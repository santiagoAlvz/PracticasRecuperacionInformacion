39498,175,7,93000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh my goodness. Kids! Homer! We're late for church! I'm glad I dressed last night.
39499,175,8,99000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'd love to go with you, honey, but I've got a lot of work to do around the bed."
39500,175,9,103000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, the Lord only asks for an hour a week."
39501,175,10,107000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"In that case, he should've made the week an hour longer. Lousy God."
39504,175,13,111000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"...and the very same goes for Ezekiel, which brings us back to our starting point, the nine tenets of constancy."
39505,175,14,124000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,DAMMIT!!
39506,175,15,127000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"I seem to have lost my place, so I'll start over."
39507,175,16,131000,Moe Szyslak,First Church of Springfield,"Aw, for the luvva crumbcake!"
39508,175,17,133000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Our sermon today is on constancy, inasmuch as the..."
39510,175,19,138000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Moreover, by dint of the appreciation of these principles we can learn...the importance of constancy, sweet constancy."
39513,175,22,158000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thank you, Lord, for delivering us from Reverend Lovejoy!"
39514,175,23,161000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"/ Yahoo! / Oh, man, am I glad to get outta there! / etc."
39515,175,24,165000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, calm down. You're wrinkling your church clothes!"
39516,175,25,169000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who cares? This is the best part of the week!
39517,175,26,171000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's the longest possible time before more church.
39518,175,27,174000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Church shouldn't be a chore. It should help you in your daily life.
39520,175,28,177000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It should, but it doesn't. Now who's going with Daddy to the dump?"
39521,175,29,180000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Me! Me!
39522,175,30,181000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The dump?
39523,175,31,183000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah. We're gonna get rid of the Christmas tree. It's starting to turn brown.
39524,175,32,186000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wanna come with?
39525,175,33,187000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no, I don't feel like going to a trash pile today."
39526,175,34,191000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's your life.
39527,175,35,192000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,We'll bring you back something nice.
39529,175,37,200000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Can you believe it? They give you five Q's and only two U's. What a world.
39530,175,38,205000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,It's crazy!
39531,175,39,207000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"So what's on your mind, Marge?"
39532,175,40,209000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"...sermons about ""constancy"" and ""prudissitude"" are all very well and good, but the church could be doing so much more to reach out to people."
39533,175,41,218000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, I don't see you volunteering to make things better."
39534,175,42,221000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Well... okay. I will volunteer!
39535,175,43,225000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,I wasn't prepared for that.
39537,175,45,234000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,"C'mon, Christmas tree."
39539,175,47,243000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,Okay. Who's up for some scrounging?
39540,175,48,249000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,"Hey, here's a perfectly good basketball half!"
39541,175,49,252000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,I found a Malibu Stacy with no head!
39544,175,52,260000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,"Oh my God! Help me, Lisa!"
39545,175,53,262000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,Lisa! Dad! C'mere quick! There is something that you won't believe!
39546,175,54,269000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,What the heck is that?
39547,175,55,271000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,Maybe it's a box from the future!
39548,175,56,273000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,It looks Japanese.
39549,175,57,274000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,Wh... what's going on? Wh... wha... why am I on a Japanese box?
39550,175,58,283000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,"Oh, my God, what is that?..."
39554,175,60,286000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"All done! I swept the aisles and put all the collection plates in the dishwasher. Oh, and you wouldn't believe how many dead pigeons there were in the organ."
39555,175,61,295000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Marge, you are a real time-saver. Do you know, thanks to you, I've rediscovered a form of shame that's gone unused for 700 years."
39556,175,62,302000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Wow.
39557,175,63,305000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Lovejoy here.
39558,175,64,306000,Seymour Skinner,First Church of Springfield,"Reverend, this is Principal Skinner. I'm facing a crisis and I didn't know to whom to turn."
39559,175,65,312000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,All right.
39560,175,66,313000,Seymour Skinner,First Church of Springfield,"Mother's gone too far. She's put cardboard over her half of the television. We rented ""Man Without a Face"" -- I didn't even know he had a problem. What should I do?"
39561,175,67,322000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Well, maybe you should read your Bible."
39562,175,68,325000,Seymour Skinner,First Church of Springfield,"Um, any particular passage?"
39563,175,69,327000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, it's all good."
39564,175,70,330000,Seymour Skinner,First Church of Springfield,All right. Thanks anyway.
39565,175,71,332000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Reverend, I hate to say this, but it sounded like that poor man was reaching out to you. I'm not sure your advice was all that helpful."
39566,175,72,340000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, Marge, I was once idealistic like you. It was the mid-seventies, and I was fresh out of seminary. The Sixties were long over and people were once again ready to feel bad about themselves..."
39568,175,74,359000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,I came to Springfield ready to roll up my sleeves and help my fellow man.
39570,175,76,368000,Young Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Reverend, I'm a... I'm afraid something terrible has happened."
39571,175,77,371000,Young Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Well, sit down and rap with me, brother. That's what I'm here for."
39572,175,78,375000,Young Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Well, I was talked into doing a dance called ""the bump"", but my hip slipped and my buttocks came into contact with the buttocks of another young man!"
39573,175,79,386000,Young Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,I... see.
39574,175,80,389000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Then the calls began.
39576,175,82,391000,Ned Flanders,LOVEJOY'S KITCHEN,"...Well, I... I think I may be coveting my own wife..."
39552,175,84,395000,Ned Flanders,LOVEJOY'S BASEMENT,I'm meek... but I could probably stand to be meeker.
39578,175,86,399000,Ned Flanders,Eiffel Tower,I think I swallowed a toothpick.
39579,175,87,402000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Eiffel Tower,"Finally, I just stopped caring. Luckily by then, it was the 80s and no one noticed."
39580,175,88,409000,Marge Simpson,Eiffel Tower,But you can't let a few bad experiences sour you on helping people!
39581,175,89,413000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Eiffel Tower,"Oh, sure I can."
39582,175,90,415000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Eiffel Tower,You handle it.
39583,175,91,417000,Marge Simpson,Eiffel Tower,Me?
39584,175,92,417000,Marge Simpson,Eiffel Tower,"No, I... I... Wait, I can't... I-- Hello...?"
39585,175,93,422000,Moe Szyslak,Eiffel Tower,"Uh, yeah, hi, I'm callin' for Reverend Lovejoy. Who is this?"
39586,175,94,426000,Marge Simpson,Eiffel Tower,"Oh, well, this is... um... the, uh... the Listen Lady!"
39587,175,95,430000,Moe Szyslak,Eiffel Tower,"Yeah, well listen, lady. I've got so many problems, I.... I don't even know where to begin here."
39588,175,96,435000,Marge Simpson,Eiffel Tower,"Okay, uh, why don't you start from the top?"
39589,175,97,439000,Moe Szyslak,Eiffel Tower,"All rightee... Uh, number one: I've lost the will to live."
39590,175,98,444000,Marge Simpson,Eiffel Tower,"Oh, that's ridiculous, Moe. You've got lots to live for."
39591,175,99,448000,Moe Szyslak,Eiffel Tower,"Really? That's not what Reverend Lovejoy's been tellin' me. Wow, you're good. Thanks!"
39592,175,100,456000,Moe Szyslak,Eiffel Tower,"Hi, it's me again. I got another problem. Uh, this one's about my cat."
39594,175,102,463000,Moe Szyslak,Eiffel Tower,"Yeah, shut up. I'm asking her."
39596,175,104,468000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why would you volunteer at the church?
39597,175,105,470000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know... guilt?
39598,175,106,472000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Volunteering is for suckers! Do you know that so-called ""volunteers"" don't even get paid?"
39599,175,107,477000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I think volunteering is great. Deep down it makes you feel --"
39600,175,108,481000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer! Will you get that crazy box off the dinner table? It came from the dump.
39601,175,109,485000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But Marge, I'm obsessed with it! Where did it come from? What is it a box of? How'd my face get on it?!"
39602,175,110,492000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, if they got a picture of you, that means they can see you. They're probably watching us right now."
39603,175,111,497000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's ridiculous. Nobody is watching us right now.
39605,175,113,507000,Akira,The Happy Sumo,Hai! Hai! Hai! Bye.
39606,175,114,511000,Akira,The Happy Sumo,Hai!
39607,175,115,512000,Homer Simpson,The Happy Sumo,"Akira, can you read this for me?"
39609,175,116,514000,Akira,The Happy Sumo,"Ah yes, this is a product called ""Mr. Sparkle."" Very popular dish detergent. Hey, he looks like you!"
39610,175,117,523000,Lisa Simpson,The Happy Sumo,What's he saying?
39611,175,118,525000,Akira,The Happy Sumo,He identifies himself as a magnet for foodstuffs... He boasts that he will banish dirt to the land of wind and ghosts.
39612,175,119,525000,Lisa Simpson,The Happy Sumo,Wow.
39613,175,120,533000,Akira,The Happy Sumo,"Yes. You have very lucky dishes, Mr. Simpson. This soap is from the sacred forest of Hokkaido. Renowned for its countless soap factories."
39614,175,121,541000,Homer Simpson,The Happy Sumo,"Hokkaido, eh?"
39616,175,123,545000,Lenny Leonard,First Church of Springfield,"See, all along, I been telling Carl I'm married to a beauty queen. Now he's comin' over for dinner."
39617,175,124,551000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, Lenny, I'm sure he'll like your wife no matter what she looks like."
39618,175,125,554000,Lenny Leonard,First Church of Springfield,"No, no, no, no, no, no, it's worse than that. I don't even have a wife. I just said I did to, you know, be a big-shot."
39619,175,126,561000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Oh. Well, it's time to start telling the truth. Now, when I have to tell my husband the truth, I cook him a big delicious dinner. By the time he's done eating, he's too full and tired to care what I have to say."
39620,175,127,574000,Lenny Leonard,First Church of Springfield,"Wow, that's great! When Carl comes over, I'll stuff him 'til he don't know what's what."
39621,175,128,581000,Agnes Skinner,First Church of Springfield,"Seymour, I'm getting tired. Tell them we're going next."
39622,175,129,585000,Seymour Skinner,First Church of Springfield,"Well, I'm not principal of the line, mother."
39623,175,130,587000,Agnes Skinner,First Church of Springfield,And you never will be.
39625,175,132,593000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Library,"I'd like the phone book for Hokkaido, Japan, please."
39626,175,133,596000,Librarian,Springfield Library,"Okay. Here you go. The phone book for Hokkaido, Japan."
39627,175,134,600000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Library,Thank you. May I please use your phone?
39628,175,135,603000,Librarian,Springfield Library,Is it a local call?
39629,175,136,604000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Library,Y-y-y-yes.
39632,175,139,649000,Japanese Worker #1,Mr. Sparkle Detergent Factory,Moshi-moshi?
39633,175,140,650000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Sparkle Detergent Factory,Yes. This is Homer Simpson from America. Who may I say is speaking to me?
39634,175,141,658000,Japanese Worker #1,Mr. Sparkle Detergent Factory,Hanashima su eigo-fu.
39635,175,142,658000,Japanese Worker #2,Mr. Sparkle Detergent Factory,Hello Chief. Let's talk why not?
39636,175,143,660000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Sparkle Detergent Factory,"Uh, hello? Why am I Mr. Sparkle?"
39637,175,144,663000,Japanese Worker #2,Mr. Sparkle Detergent Factory,"Oh, you like Mr. Sparkle?"
39638,175,145,665000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Sparkle Detergent Factory,"Well, I am Mr. Sparkle!"
39639,175,146,667000,Japanese Worker #2,Mr. Sparkle Detergent Factory,"You have many question Mr. Sparkle. I send you premium, answer question hundred percent."
39642,175,149,673000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,The Lord will hear your lamentations and give solace to your spirit.
39643,175,150,677000,Moe Szyslak,First Church of Springfield,The Lord... or Marge Simpson!
39644,175,151,679000,Lenny Leonard,First Church of Springfield,Amen to that!
39646,175,153,682000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Umm, could we please not yell out things in the church?"
39648,175,155,688000,Congregation,First Church of Springfield,"Marge, I need some advice -- / Listen, I've got some trouble with-- / etc."
39649,175,156,694000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Please, one at a time, one at a time! Now, who has the most urgent problem?"
39650,175,157,700000,Sideshow Mel,First Church of Springfield,I have a recurring dream in which I'm falling.
39652,175,159,704000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Come right this way, Mel. I... Tim, hold my calls."
39653,175,160,714000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,I'm a shepherd without a flock. What have I done to lose them?
39654,175,161,722000,St. Eleutherius,First Church of Springfield,"The real question is, what have you done to keep them?"
39655,175,162,722000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Ah, St. Eleutherius of Nicomedia."
39656,175,163,728000,St. Eleutherius,First Church of Springfield,That's my name -- don't wear it out.
39657,175,164,730000,St. Bartholomew,First Church of Springfield,"To inspire men, you must be brave. I introduced Christianity to Mongolia. It didn't take, but it was worth a try."
39658,175,165,737000,St. Lucian,First Church of Springfield,"Tell us, good Reverend, what great deeds have you done to inspire the hearts of men?"
39659,175,166,742000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Well, I had the vestibule recarpeted."
39660,175,167,747000,St. Donickus,First Church of Springfield,"I've appeared in over 8,000 visions, and that's the lamest reply I've ever heard."
39661,175,168,752000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh now, please, I... I thought saints were supposed to be friendly."
39662,175,169,756000,St. Eleutherius,First Church of Springfield,You -- you're just lucky God isn't here.
39663,175,170,765000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Hello, Listen Lady."
39666,175,171,767000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Marge, people say you've got a real knack for solving problems. Well, this is a little awkward, but, um, Tim came home from church so despondent today. He's just been playing with his trains all afternoon."
39667,175,172,780000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"We all need a little time to ourselves, Helen. Just give him a day or two and I'm sure he'll be back to his old dynamic self."
39668,175,173,787000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Okay.
39669,175,174,790000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Attention, H-O scale passengers: the dining car is closed. Root beer is still available but the cost is now $6.50. If the passengers will look to the right, you will see a sad man. That is all."
39671,175,176,808000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, we got a package from the Mr. Sparkle Company in Japan!"
39672,175,177,813000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow!

39674,175,179,820000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Put it in! Put it in!
39675,175,180,828000,Japanese Businessman,Simpson Home,"Ahhhh. Oh! Hello, American investor. I see you are interested in distributing Mr. Sparkaru in your home prefecture. You have chosen wisely. But please, don't believe me. Observe this commercial."
39676,175,181,849000,Mr. Sparkle,Simpson Home,Aka ni taishte burei da! Yogore o yaburu! Honki da yo.

39684,175,189,910000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That didn't explain anything. All I know is they stole my face and used it for their stupid ""logo"". There's no other explanation."
39685,175,190,918000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait, look."
39686,175,191,920000,Japanese Announcer,Simpson Home,Mr. Sparkle: a joint venture of Matsumura Fishworks...and Tamaribuchi Heavy Manufacturing Concern.
39687,175,192,933000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, it was all a coincidence!"
39688,175,193,935000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yep. There's your answer, Fish Bulb."

39690,175,195,943000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,We are home.
39691,175,196,944000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That was fast.
39692,175,198,946000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,You've just got to accept it. Your GameBoy is gone. It's at the bottom of the ocean.
39693,175,199,952000,Captain Horatio McCallister,First Church of Springfield,Aye. Aye. Aye.
39694,175,200,960000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Hello. Listen Lady.

39696,175,202,970000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Well, Ned, you don't have to stand for that. You just march right up to those youngsters and tell them to vamoose."
