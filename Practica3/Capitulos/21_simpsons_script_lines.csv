154881,21,114,581000,MURDOCK,STADIUM,"I almost forgot. To add a real element of danger, one drop of human blood."

154876,21,145,735000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,EMERGENCY WAITING AREA,Hmmm. I think I know something that might discourage him from this sort of behavior.
154912,21,147,740000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,HOSPITAL CORRIDOR,"Bart, in this ward are the children who have been hurt by imitating stunts they saw on television, movies and the legitimate stage."
154914,21,149,749000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,HOSPITAL WARD,This little boy broke his leg trying to fly like Superman.
154915,21,150,755000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,HOSPITAL WARD,"This boy's brother hit him in the head with a wrench, mimicking a recent TV wrestling match."
154916,21,151,761000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,HOSPITAL WARD,I won't even subject you to the horrors of our Three Stooges ward.
154917,21,152,765000,Marge Simpson,HOSPITAL WARD,"Gee, I never realized TV was such a dangerous influence."
154918,21,153,768000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,HOSPITAL WARD,"Well, as tragic as all this is, it's a small price to pay for countless hours of top-notch entertainment."
154919,21,154,774000,Homer Simpson,HOSPITAL WARD,"Amen! Well, Bart, has Dr. Hibbert made his point?"
154920,21,155,778000,Bart Simpson,HOSPITAL WARD,"He certainly has, Dad. I learned a real lesson here today. Thank you. Dr. Hibbert."
154921,21,156,792000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,HOSPITAL WARD,Hmmm.

154933,21,168,822000,Bart Simpson,Bus,"I'm runnin' on empty, Milhouse. You kids get a kick out of my jumps, and I love you for it, but it's all too easy."
154934,21,169,829000,Bart Simpson,Bus,There's got to be a challenge out there worthy of me.
154936,21,171,833000,SMYTHE,Springfield Gorge,"Hello, children, and welcome to Springfield Gorge."
154937,21,172,837000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Gorge,Wow!!
154938,21,173,838000,Otto Mann,Springfield Gorge,"Man, this thing's pretty gnarly. I bet you could throw a dead body in there, and no one'd ever find it."
154939,21,174,844000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Gorge,"Otto, I'm gonna leap over Springfield Gorge on my skateboard."
154940,21,175,849000,Otto Mann,Springfield Gorge,"You know, Bart, as the only adult here, I feel I should say something."
154941,21,176,853000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Gorge,What?
154942,21,177,854000,Otto Mann,Springfield Gorge,Cool!
154911,21,179,867000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Hey, Otto! Can I use that microphone?"
154878,21,180,872000,Otto Mann,School Bus,"Sorry, Bart-dude. It's for emergencies only."
154945,21,181,877000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,But I want to tell them about my jump.
154946,21,182,878000,Otto Mann,School Bus,"Oh, okay."
154947,21,183,880000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"May I have you attention, please. This Saturday I will be jumping over Springfield Gorge on my skateboard. There is a good possibility I will plunge to my bloody death. Hope to see you there, thank you."
154948,21,184,892000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,"Springfield Gorge? Bart, you'll be killed!"
154949,21,185,895000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Lisa, I don't know how to explain this, but I get the same thrill out of jumping over stuff that you do from... reading."
154950,21,186,903000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,"Please, before you do anything, there's someone I'd like you to talk to."
154952,21,188,907000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"Thank you for arranging this, Dr. Hibbert."
154953,21,189,910000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"Oh anything I can do to stem the tide of entertainment-related injury. Now, children you're about to meet the world's greatest daredevil, Lance Murdock."
154954,21,190,919000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"Lance, this is Lisa and Bart Simpson. Bart is one of your biggest fans."
154955,21,191,924000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"It's an honor, Lance. How you feeling?"
154956,21,192,926000,MURDOCK,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"Ow! Doc, I heard a snap."
154957,21,193,931000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"Hmm. I'm afraid the bone's broken. Well, that's all of them."
154958,21,194,935000,MURDOCK,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"Don't worry, partner. I've broken that thumb dozens of times. Hey, I bet you'd like an autograph. Nurse."
154959,21,195,941000,MURDOCK,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,Who should I make this out to?
154960,21,196,943000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"Just Bart will be fine, sir."
154961,21,197,945000,MURDOCK,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"To Bart: Thanks for visiting me at Springfield General Hospital. Your visit was a ray of sunshine on an otherwise cloudy day. Your pal, Captain Lance Murdock."
154962,21,198,963000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"Wow, man! Thanks, Lance."
154963,21,199,969000,MURDOCK,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,You're welcome. Take this thing out of my mouth now.
154964,21,200,973000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"Mr. Murdock, my brother is thinking about jumping Springfield Gorge on a skateboard."
154965,21,201,978000,MURDOCK,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"Could you leave me with the young'uns, please?"
154970,21,202,982000,MURDOCK,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"Now let me start by saying... good for you, son. It's always good to see young people taking an interest in danger. Now, a lot of people are gonna be telling you you're crazy, and maybe they're right. But the fact of the matter is: bones heal, chicks dig scars, and the United States of America has the best doctor to daredevil ratio in the world."
154971,21,203,1001000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,But Captain Murdock!
154972,21,204,1002000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"Thanks, Lance."
154973,21,205,1003000,MURDOCK,SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY,"You're welcome, little pardner. On your way out, tell the nurse I'm ready for my sponge bath. Another fringe benefit. Nurse."
154975,21,207,1010000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Springfield Gorge? I thought we settled this daredevil junk.
154976,21,208,1014000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Squealer.
154977,21,209,1015000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"I'm sorry, Bart. But if you got hurt or died, despite the extra attention I'd receive, I'd miss you."
154978,21,210,1021000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Bart, I forbid you to jump over that gorge."
154979,21,211,1024000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,You can't.
154980,21,212,1025000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"I can and do. Go to your room, Bart! There, I've done it. I'm glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all."
154981,21,213,1033000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Hey, man, you can tell me not to do it, but there's no way you can watch me twenty-four hours a day. And the minute your back is turned, I'm grabbing my skateboard and headin' for that gorge."
154982,21,214,1043000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"He's got us, Marge. There's nothing we can do. He's as good as dead."
154983,21,215,1046000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Homer, you're his father. You've got to try and reason with him."
154984,21,216,1052000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh, that never works. He's a goner."
154985,21,217,1055000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh, come on, Homer. A heart to heart talk with your son, you've got to try."
154986,21,218,1061000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Okay, okay. I'll try."
154988,21,220,1065000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart? Bart?
154989,21,221,1066000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! What are you doing?
154990,21,222,1067000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, nothing."
154991,21,223,1069000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you?"
154992,21,224,1071000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe.
154993,21,225,1072000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, I know I can't stop you. The only thing I can do is ask you to promise me you won't jump the gorge."
154994,21,226,1080000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, I promise."
154966,21,228,1081000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What's the matter?
154967,21,229,1082000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You didn't mean that. Bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises I don't expect you to keep. If you make this promise, you have to keep it."
154968,21,230,1091000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why?
154996,21,231,1092000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"'Cause if you don't, I'll never believe anything you say, ever again."
154997,21,232,1096000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, come on."
154998,21,233,1098000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I mean it, boy."
154999,21,234,1099000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, okay, Dad. I promise. I will not jump Springfield Gorge."
155000,21,235,1104000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's my boy.
155001,21,236,1106000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"How'd it go, Homer?"
155002,21,237,1108000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, Marge, we got a pretty good kid there."
155003,21,238,1111000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, he's got a pretty good father."
155006,21,241,1119000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Gorge,Where is he? I thought he said noon.
155007,21,242,1122000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Gorge,"Aw, he's just doing this to build the suspense."
155008,21,243,1125000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Gorge,"Whoa, what a showman."
155009,21,244,1126000,JANEY,Springfield Gorge,"Look, there he is!"
155011,21,246,1136000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, boy. Wanna toss the old --"
155012,21,247,1140000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why that little liar! I should... and I was gonna play pickle with him.
155014,21,249,1168000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,BART!
155015,21,250,1177000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Gorge,"Hey, what gives?"
155016,21,251,1179000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,"Boy, I've tried ordering you, I've tried punishing you, and God help me, I even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself."
155017,21,252,1188000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Gorge,What? Why?
155018,21,253,1190000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,Because that way you'll see what it's like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.
155019,21,254,1197000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Gorge,"But, Dad, you'll never make it."
155020,21,255,1199000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,Don't you think I know that?
155021,21,256,1203000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,"Goodbye, son."
155022,21,257,1205000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Gorge,"Wait, dad. Don't do it. I won't jump anymore, I promise."

155025,21,260,1214000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,"I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --"
155026,21,261,1229000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I--
155029,21,263,1277000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"You think you've got guts, try raising my kids."
