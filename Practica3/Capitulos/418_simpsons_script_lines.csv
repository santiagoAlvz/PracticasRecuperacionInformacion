108516,418,2,34000,Bart Simpson,Car,Why do we have to get here so early? The football game doesn't start for hours.
108517,418,3,39000,Homer Simpson,Car,We're not here for the game. The game is nothing. The game is crap. The game makes me sick!
108518,418,4,46000,Homer Simpson,Car,"The real reason we Americans put up with sports, is for this..."
108520,418,6,46000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,"Behold, the tailgate party -- the pinnacle of human achievement!"
108521,418,7,53000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,"Since the dawn of parking lots, man has sought to stuff his guts with food and alcohol in anticipation of watching others exercise. What childbirth is to women, eating trunk meats is to the be-wanged."
108522,418,8,70000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,What could be greater than eating and drinking for hours in a drizzly parking lot?
108523,418,9,75000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,Anything?
108524,418,10,76000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,"No, everything is better."
108525,418,11,78000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,Anything! / Everything! / Anything! / Everything!
108526,418,12,84000,Ralph Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,"Daddy, I made a Ralphwich!"
108527,418,13,87000,Ralph Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,It tastes hurty!
108528,418,14,90000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,"That's 'cause it's not food, Ralphie!"
108529,418,15,93000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,"No, no, no, I'm sorry. It's food, it's food. Everything's what you say it is."
108531,418,17,99000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"All right, time to dig in. I brought everything we need."
108532,418,18,104000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,It's just forks and plates. Didn't we bring any food?
108533,418,19,107000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,The food is all around us.
108534,418,20,109000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,You brought us here to beg?
108535,418,21,111000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Up-bup-bup-bup-bup... when you know the people you're begging from, it's mooching."
108536,418,22,116000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Moleman! Come here, ya big bag-a skin! How the hell are ya, huh?!"
108538,418,24,126000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Yeah? No kidding? Well, that sounds like you're gonna have fun."
108540,418,26,133000,Carl Carlson,Parking Lot,Springfield U sucks!
108541,418,27,135000,Sideshow Mel,Parking Lot,A and M cheerleaders are clumsy!
108543,418,28,138000,Carl Carlson,Parking Lot,Your superstar professors treat undergrads like an afterthought!
108544,418,29,142000,Sideshow Mel,Parking Lot,Your tenure track is heavily politicized!
108545,418,30,145000,Carl Carlson,Parking Lot,"Oh, that's it!"
108547,418,32,149000,Marge Simpson,Near Simpson Car,"Lisa, honey, just because you're a girl doesn't mean you can't join in the fun. Maggie and I are washing the soiled foam fingers."
108548,418,33,159000,Lisa Simpson,Near Simpson Car,"Well, I guess I could cut loose and do a little homework."
108549,418,34,162000,Lisa Simpson,Near Simpson Car,I can start working on my school video project. The assignment is to film the beauty of the everyday. So let's see...
108551,418,36,193000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,There's drama and inspiration everywhere I look.
108552,418,37,200000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,I am a born filmmaker!
108554,418,39,209000,Mr. Kinkaid,Springfield Elementary School,Really interesting stuff. Three points out of a possible five.
108555,418,40,214000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, that's a funny joke, Mr. Kinkaid. Is this an art class or a comedy class? Seriously, why is it three?"
108556,418,41,220000,Mr. Kinkaid,Springfield Elementary School,I can make it a two.
108557,418,42,222000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Three it is! You're the teacher, and I accept your decision."
108559,418,44,226000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,The man is an idiot!
108560,418,45,228000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Agreed. The film has everything -- emotion, conflict, Milhouse! Lisa, you're a gifted filmmaker. It's as if Ingmar Bergman and Penny Marshall had a baby."
108561,418,46,236000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Principal Skinner, I didn't know you knew so much about film."
108562,418,47,241000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Cinema is my secret passion. I've even written a screenplay or two ""on speculation."""
108563,418,48,247000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"""When Edna Met Seymour""... ""Ghost Willie""... ""Killing Seymour's Mother""... ""The Principal Who Sold A Screenplay""..."
108564,418,49,253000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,They sound great... I'd love to read them sometime.
108565,418,50,256000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Unfortunately, the studios have made it clear they're not interested in my work. In fact, I'm... I'm no longer welcome on the Universal Studios tour."
108566,418,51,263000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,Orlando or Hollywood?
108567,418,52,265000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,There's one in Hollywood?!
108568,418,53,267000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,Yeah. Getting back to my grade...
108570,418,54,268000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Forget grades! With the right subject, you could be a great filmmaker. What comes to mind when you think of drama?"
108571,418,55,275000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Well, according to Aristotle, drama contains six elements: plot, theme, character--"
108572,418,56,280000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Not the smarty-pants answer. Where's the drama in your life?
108573,418,57,284000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Okay, but can I just finish the smarty-pants answer?"
108574,418,58,286000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,No! In your life!
108575,418,59,287000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"My family. ...Language, rhythm and spectacle."
108576,418,60,290000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Family, eh? That's right, your brother is Bart Simpson, one of Mrs. Krabappel's fourth graders. And your father is a local character of note."
108577,418,61,301000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Lisa, if you make a documentary about your family, I can help you."
108578,418,62,305000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,I'm giving you... the key to the A.V. cage.
108579,418,63,313000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,This is so generous. How can I ever repay you?
108580,418,64,317000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"All I ask is, if you ever win an Oscar... give it to me."
108581,418,65,321000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Um, okay."
108582,418,66,325000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Those cabinet makers laughed at me, but they'll see."
108584,418,68,332000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, what are you doing?"
108585,418,69,333000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm making a documentary about a very special family.
108586,418,70,337000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Smithers and Burns?
108587,418,71,338000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, us!"
108588,418,72,339000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Can I be Smithers?
108589,418,73,339000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No Dad, I want you to play Homer Simpson."
108590,418,74,342000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why, 'cause I'm fat?"
108591,418,75,345000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I love documentaries! Especially the one that came with our lawnmower.
108592,418,76,350000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Although it was suspiciously pro-lawnmower.
108593,418,77,353000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay everyone -- just be yourself. Don't look in the camera, pretend I'm not here, and... no toupees..."
108594,418,78,360000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What, I'm going for a Shia LaBeouf thing. Not quite a nerd, not quite a hunk... Shia LaBeouf!"
108595,418,79,367000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,And... let's roll.
108596,418,80,369000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh. There's already an on-set romance.
108597,418,81,375000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, she's not making a snuggle film."
108598,418,82,378000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ew, Lisa, make them stop!"
108542,418,83,382000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, but as a filmmaker I have to face the truth."
108601,418,85,426000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Skin-ner!
108602,418,86,428000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, Superintendent Chalmers?"
108603,418,87,430000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,I hear you've been encouraging a student's creativity!
108604,418,88,433000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Please sir, I can explain..."
108605,418,89,434000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm thrilled! Or would have been, if not for your knee-jerk assumption that I'm angry at you -- which I am now! Anyway, we have got to support Lisa Simpson's film. This is our chance to finally show up that fancy Springfield Creative Arts Academy."
108606,418,90,452000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"The whole school is made up of modeling clay -- every afternoon they reshape it, just to get my goat."
108607,418,91,461000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, with some school band music and added effects, we could show Lisa's film at the public library."
108608,418,92,467000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Think bigger, Seymour. Think film festivals."
108609,418,93,471000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,You mean... Banff?
108610,418,94,473000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Banff, shmanff! I'm talking about Sundance!"
108611,418,95,476000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Sundance, the preeminent independent film festival held each January in Park City Utah?"
108612,418,96,483000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh yes, the very same, yes. If Lisa's movie gets in, we won't just be the school with the highest hamster mortality rate."
108613,418,97,491000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, so young. We'll also have a kid who did a thing!"
108614,418,98,497000,Dewey Largo,Springfield Elementary School,"I call this cue ""Homer's Lament."""
108616,418,100,497000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What are you boys doing on the Foley stage?
108617,418,101,510000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,Awesome-ing up your sound effects.
108618,418,102,513000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, one more take."
108619,418,103,515000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,Can we please go to the next scene?
108620,418,104,520000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,Oh dear.
108623,418,107,522000,Head Board Member,Sundance Institute,We're getting too many mainstream movies. When are we gonna see a submission with the Sundance independent film spirit?
108624,418,108,529000,Head Board Member,Sundance Institute,"Uh, ""Paul Giamatti..."""

108635,418,118,541000,Head Board Member,Sundance Institute,...intellectual misfit...
108637,418,120,555000,Head Board Member,Sundance Institute,"People, you know you have to limit your gasps at this altitude! Ooo, and she's eight years old!"
108640,418,123,575000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Stupid charities, they think I'm gonna give them money? Save the Children? Save your breath. Take a hike, Sierra Club! Doctors Without Borders? Doctors without money! Hey, Greenpeace, you're not getting' a piece of my green! Robert Redford? Guess what -- a scissor runs through it."
108641,418,124,593000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, no!"
108642,418,125,598000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,My movie got in! I'm going to the Sundance Film Festival!
108643,418,126,603000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Film Festival,"" eh?"

108647,418,130,620000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Where'd everybody go?
108651,418,134,633000,Lisa Simpson,PARK CITY,I can't believe I'm a director with a movie at Sundance.
108652,418,135,637000,Homer Simpson,PARK CITY,"Maybe I can finally meet Jim Jarmusch and ask him who he is. Hey, that's him!"
108653,418,136,643000,Homer Simpson,PARK CITY,Who are you?
108654,418,137,644000,Jim Jarmusch,PARK CITY,I try to answer that question in my films.
108655,418,138,647000,Homer Simpson,PARK CITY,What else?

108661,418,144,661000,Jim Jarmusch,PARK CITY,This is the last time we'll ever be together.
108663,418,146,665000,Lisa Simpson,PARK CITY,These badges will get us into any of the independent movies playing at Sundance.
108664,418,147,670000,Marge Simpson,PARK CITY,"Ooo, ""Regularsville."" Sounds like my kind of place!"

108666,418,149,691000,Marge Simpson,PARK CITY,"I get it -- every title means the opposite of what it means! Then I bet I'll love ""Chernobyl Graveyard!"""
108667,418,150,703000,Marge Simpson,PARK CITY,I didn't.
108669,418,152,706000,Lisa Simpson,Theater,This is it! My premiere!

108679,418,162,738000,Bride,Theater,It isn't. You crashed and now you're lying unconscious in a snow bank.

108698,418,181,810000,Lisa Simpson,Theater,I didn't mean it like that! A lot of things got changed in the editing room.
108699,418,182,815000,Lisa Simpson,Theater,Proudly edited by Lisa Simpson!
108700,418,186,824000,Bart Simpson,Theater,"Lisa, your movie exposed our crappy side to the world. I knew you were lame, but I never imagined you were bogus."
108701,418,187,832000,Marge Simpson,Theater,"Sweetie, I'm usually your number one fan. But, call me old-fashioned, I usually don't like movies that humiliate my family in front of the world."

108730,418,217,959000,Homer Simpson,PARK CITY,I never wanted to be famous for being mean. I wanted to be famous for catching Santa Claus.
108731,418,218,968000,Bart Simpson,PARK CITY,Let's just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it's nice for the next people.
108732,418,219,974000,Lisa Simpson,PARK CITY,I can't believe what I've done -- maybe deep down I always knew how much this film would hurt them. Maybe I'm the monster this movie exposed.
108733,418,220,982000,Voice,PARK CITY,Now what kind of talk is that?
108734,418,221,985000,Lisa Simpson,PARK CITY,"Oh... hi, Mr. Jarmusch."
108735,418,222,987000,Jim Jarmusch,PARK CITY,"Lisa, I've been following your family's turmoil closely, and I can relate. My movies like ""Stranger Than Paradise"" and ""Down By Law"" are also about social misfits experiencing the dark side of the American dream. I'm doing it again in my next film, ""Cheaper By The Dozen 3."""
108736,418,223,1002000,Lisa Simpson,PARK CITY,That doesn't sound like your kind of movie.
108737,418,224,1005000,Jim Jarmusch,PARK CITY,It will be. Check out the poster.
108738,418,225,1007000,Lisa Simpson,PARK CITY,"Ew... so, do you think my family will ever forgive me for making them a laughing stock?"
108739,418,226,1015000,Jim Jarmusch,PARK CITY,The answer to that is where it always is -- in a movie. Let's take a look.
108741,418,228,1026000,Lisa Simpson,Theater,Nelson? He couldn't have made a movie by himself. Who helped him?
108742,418,229,1030000,Announcer,Theater,Chalmskinn...
108743,418,230,1032000,Seymour Skinner,Theater,"Seymour Skinner never puts all his eggs in one basket. That's why they call me ""Two Basket"" Skinner. What? They do."
108744,418,231,1040000,Nelson Muntz,Theater,I'm Nelson. This is my house.
108745,418,232,1043000,Nelson Muntz,Theater,This is the impound lot that my house gets towed to every night.
108746,418,233,1046000,Mrs. Muntz,Theater,"Let's get goin' -- we got to swing by the Laundromat, steal me a new bra."
108747,418,234,1050000,Nelson Muntz,Theater,You're gonna be the classiest girl at Classy Girls!
108748,418,235,1060000,Jim Jarmusch,Theater,"No, no, no, don't go in there! Oh no, he did! Oh man, that is messed up! Whoa, what the hell is that?"
108749,418,236,1068000,Lisa Simpson,Theater,It's just a cat.
108750,418,237,1070000,Jim Jarmusch,Theater,"What? Oh yeah, oh yeah, now I see it."
108265,418,238,1073000,Audience,Theater,Shhh!
108751,418,239,1074000,Nelson Muntz,Theater,"Mom, there's this school play tonight. It's called ""Kids Are People Too,"" and I play a grownup who doesn't think kids are people too. So, if you wanna come..."
108752,418,240,1086000,Mrs. Muntz,Theater,"Can't -- I'm organizing my Laramie Bucks. If I want that golf umbrella, I got to get to smokin'."
108753,418,241,1096000,Nelson Muntz,Theater,"Sometimes I take the long way home, past the happy people's houses. I like to look inside and pretend I have a family like theirs."
108756,418,244,1131000,Nelson Muntz,Beach,"I like to cry at the ocean, because only there do my tears seem small."
108757,418,245,1152000,Lisa Simpson,Beach,"Thank you, Mr. Jarmusch -- you've taught me a valuable lesson that other people have bigger family problems than I do."
108758,418,246,1159000,Jim Jarmusch,Beach,"True, but I was also teaching you that festival buzz is, like my movie ""Coffee and Cigarettes"", a funny thing. Did you see it?"
108759,418,247,1167000,Lisa Simpson,Beach,"Well, I uh..."
108760,418,248,1169000,Jim Jarmusch,Beach,"That's okay, I know you did."
108761,418,249,1170000,Male Filmgoer,Beach,I like this movie way better than the one by that little girl -- 'cause I saw this one today!
108762,418,250,1176000,Lisa Simpson,Beach,"Wow, I guess Nelson's the hot thing now. My movie will probably never be seen."
108763,418,251,1181000,Jim Jarmusch,Beach,"Oh, it will -- on select flights by Alaska Airlines and its regional partners. Okay, only its regional partners. The point is, you made a great movie and you ought to be proud."
108764,418,252,1192000,Jim Jarmusch,Beach,"And now, like the best independent films, I must fade out with a cool dissolve."
108765,418,253,1199000,Jim Jarmusch,Beach,Owwwwwwwwww! That hurt!
108767,418,255,1206000,Man On Street,Theater,"Hey Nelson, say something poor!"
108769,418,257,1212000,Marge Simpson,Theater,Thank God they're not jeering at us anymore.
108770,418,258,1215000,Homer Simpson,Theater,I know! Kinda miss it.
108771,418,259,1217000,Bart Simpson,Theater,I know! We'll be in another movie -- and this time we'll act really bad!
108772,418,260,1222000,Marge Simpson,Theater,No more Simpsons movies! One was plenty!
108773,418,261,1225000,Lisa Simpson,Theater,Are you guys still mad at me?
108774,418,262,1227000,Marge Simpson,Theater,"We know you love us, honey -- even though sometimes you show it in a ""quirky"" way."
108775,418,263,1238000,John C. Reilly,Theater,I'm not gonna lie to you guys -- John C. Reilly would love to be in the ChalmSkinn business.
108776,418,264,1242000,Seymour Skinner,Theater,"Well, did you read my script?"
108777,418,265,1244000,John C. Reilly,Theater,Read it? I lived it! I am Ghost Willie. Check this out --
108778,418,266,1251000,Gary Chalmers,Theater,Fantastic! Bravo! You nailed it!
108779,418,267,1257000,Gary Chalmers,Theater,I don't know -- he seems a little needy.
108780,418,268,1260000,Seymour Skinner,Theater,Pass.
108781,418,269,1261000,Seymour Skinner,Theater,We'll see you on the set.
108782,418,270,1263000,John C. Reilly,Theater,Yes!
108783,418,271,1271000,Announcer,Theater,Chalmskinn...
108784,418,272,1274000,Seymour Skinner,Theater,Another hit!
108785,418,273,1275000,Gary Chalmers,Theater,Skin-ner! Why can't you be a gentle clinker?
