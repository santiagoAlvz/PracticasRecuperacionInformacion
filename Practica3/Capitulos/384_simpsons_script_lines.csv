99745,384,144,743000,Tom Wolfe,Main Building,"Ah, magnificent Moe. He stands, stoop-shouldered, blinking in the light, hollow-chested like a dough-faced fall guy who's made a career of taking dives but has decided to get his manhood out of hock and take a shot at the title -- or at least go for the jaw and -- thwack!!! -- hyperextend the champ's pterygoideus before kissing the mat goodnight."

99754,384,153,799000,Gore Vidal,Cocktail Party,"Well, so have I, Gore Vidal. ""1876"" was the price I paid for gas once. I thought of ""Burr"" when I saw it written on an Eskimo Pie package."
99755,384,154,809000,Woman At Festival,Cocktail Party,I can't believe it!

99774,384,172,894000,Michael Chabon,WORDLOAF,"I'd have to say my good friend Jonathan Franzen. I thought his novel ""The Corrections"" needed none."
99775,384,173,901000,Stoner In Audience,WORDLOAF,Cha-bonnnnne!
99776,384,174,903000,Jonathan Franzen,WORDLOAF,"Well, in turn, I'd have to say my biggest influence is..."

99781,384,179,917000,Tom Wolfe,WORDLOAF,"Moe, who inspired you to become a writer... Jack Kerouac? Charles Bukowski? Me? Tom Wolfe?"
99782,384,180,923000,Moe Szyslak,WORDLOAF,"I dunno... the only book I ever read was ""Super Hounds: The Ultimate Greyhound Betting System"". So uh... any of you wetnaps write that?"
99784,384,182,934000,Lisa Simpson,WORDLOAF,"Mr. Szyslak -- there must be some person, possibly in this very room, who believed in you when no one else did."
99785,384,183,941000,Moe Szyslak,WORDLOAF,"Oh, uh yeah I-I get what you're gettin' at. Um... nope."
99786,384,184,946000,Lisa Simpson,WORDLOAF,But how can you--
99787,384,185,947000,Tom Wolfe,WORDLOAF,"Now now, he's answered your question. I declare this panel dismissed!"
99788,384,186,952000,Lisa Simpson,WORDLOAF,But... I deserve... acknowledgement...

99807,384,205,1016000,Moe Szyslak,POND,"I need a brilliant new poem for the farewell dinner. So if you could turn these into one of those and then don't say nothin' while I take all the credit, I'd really appreciate it, though I'd never admit that. And look, I got you started. Eh? Eh?"
99808,384,206,1029000,Lisa Simpson,POND,"Moe, you're a heartless jerk!"
99809,384,207,1033000,Moe Szyslak,POND,"Huh? Whoa, where'd that come from? Oh, right, right, my actions."
99810,384,208,1037000,Moe Szyslak,POND,"Well, let's see if I can put this poem together."
99811,384,209,1040000,Moe Szyslak,POND,"Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Stupid geese! You're eatin' my brilliance!"
99813,384,211,1052000,Moe Szyslak,POND,"Look at me. It's supposed to be my big triumph and I'm standing in mud, fightin' with geese. Well, if I'm gonna fight, I might as well win."
99814,384,212,1064000,Moe Szyslak,POND,"Yeah, go on, you cowards! Fly off in a ""V""!"
99816,384,214,1066000,Bart Simpson,WORDLOAF,"Hey Lis, we learned so much scootin' around Vermont. Did you know that candles are made by losers?"
99818,384,215,1076000,Homer Simpson,WORDLOAF,"And we went to the ""Vermont Teddy Bear"" factory. Look what we got! Hm? Hm?"
99820,384,217,1086000,Homer Simpson,WORDLOAF,"Oh honey, don't cry. They're not made from real bears -- just their fur and noses!"

99825,384,222,1110000,Moe Szyslak,WORDLOAF,"Look at me, sittin' here depressed when I'm surrounded by the happiest people in the world: writers."
99826,384,223,1117000,Tom Wolfe,WORDLOAF,"Before Moe reads his keynote poem, I would like to stake my claim to any unfinished garlic mashed potatoes. So please, if you would pass them clockwise up to table one, I'll collect them later."
99827,384,224,1129000,Tom Wolfe,WORDLOAF,"Now, I give you... Moe Szyslak."
99828,384,225,1135000,Moe Szyslak,WORDLOAF,"Uh, this here poem is called ""Elevator Capacity."" ""Elevator capacity twenty-four hundred pounds. Inspection Certificate available in hotel manager's office..."""
