47598,204,2,36000,Homer Simpson,Try-N-Save,Can't you just write on your arm like I do?
47599,204,3,44000,Marge Simpson,Try-N-Save,All you're getting is rubber bands and paper clips? Don't you need a notebook or something?
47600,204,4,48000,Bart Simpson,Try-N-Save,Nah. These days everything's done on computers.
47601,204,5,54000,Bart Simpson,Try-N-Save,And staplers. Computers and staplers.
47603,204,7,59000,Lisa Simpson,Try-N-Save,Krusty's Speak and Say?
47605,204,8,61000,Krusty the Clown,Try-N-Save,"""S"" is for ""shiksa"". S... H... I... I think there's a ""T"" in there somewhere. Ah, look it up."

47607,204,10,84000,Milhouse Van Houten,Try-N-Save,"Oh, hi, Lisa. Did you have a nice summer? Don't you hate that we have to go back to stupid school tomorrow?"

47609,204,12,93000,Milhouse Van Houten,Try-N-Save,"Me, too. We have so much in common."
47610,204,13,96000,Lisa Simpson,Try-N-Save,You have a pen glued to your cowlick.
47611,204,14,99000,Milhouse Van Houten,Try-N-Save,"If you don't like it, it's gone."
47613,204,16,103000,Milhouse Van Houten,Try-N-Save,"Uh, you want this?"
47614,204,17,105000,Lisa Simpson,Try-N-Save,No!
47616,204,19,109000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Yo, Apu, gimme the usual."
47617,204,20,111000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Yes, sir! One Kwik-E-Dog, one bubble gum cigar, and the latest issue of ""Success"" magazine."
47618,204,21,117000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey, this hot dog tastes different."
47619,204,22,121000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Yes, I just cleaned out the machine, sir, so the snack you are enjoying has not been soaking in putrid grease."
47620,204,23,127000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Uh, yeah, but without the grease all you can taste is the hog anus."
47621,204,24,132000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"I'm so sorry, but I sold it all to the rendering plant."
47622,204,25,135000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,People buy grease?
47623,204,26,137000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh yes. They use it to make products such as soap, cosmetics, baby food..."
47624,204,27,141000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Used grease is worth money? Then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold. I'm rich, Apu! Rich, I--!"
47625,204,28,152000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Money in the bank.
47627,204,30,156000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, this bacon's done."
47628,204,31,163000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And now for the profit taking.
47629,204,32,167000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, Dad, I don't think the dog can handle any more bacon."
47630,204,33,170000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Looks like he's about ready for another squeezin'.
47631,204,34,174000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, that side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight."
47632,204,35,178000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, if you don't mind, I'm a little busy right now achieving financial independence."
47633,204,36,182000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,With cans of grease?
47634,204,37,184000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, through savings and wise investments. Of course with grease!"
47635,204,38,189000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Bart. The bus is here."
47636,204,39,191000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Where do you think you're goin'?
47637,204,40,194000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's the first day of school.
47638,204,41,195000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Not for you it isn't. You're in the grease business now.
47640,204,43,200000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,...Then the doctor told me that both my eyes were lazy. And that's why it was the best summer ever.
47641,204,44,206000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Thank you, Ralph. Now take your seat."
47642,204,45,210000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey blindie, have a nice trip."
47644,204,47,214000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw haw.
47645,204,48,216000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Attention, please. I need a volunteer for a thankless chore."
47646,204,49,221000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Shall I assume the only hand in the air is Lisa Simpson's? Thank you, Lisa."
47648,204,51,226000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"We have a new student, Lisa. And I want you to show her the works. The lunchroom, the tree..."
47649,204,52,232000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"But when you get to the trophy case, give her some cock 'n bull story. They're out for cleaning, or whatever."
47650,204,53,238000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Don't worry, I'll help her out. I remember how hard it was to be an outsider. Always trying to fit in... never quite feeling like..."
47651,204,54,245000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Lisa, I'd like you to meet Alex Whitney."
47652,204,55,248000,Alex,Skinner's Office,"Your name's Lisa? Shut up, I love that name!"
47653,204,56,251000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,Did she just tell me to shut up?
47654,204,57,253000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Take it outside.
47656,204,59,257000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You'll want a locker in this hallway -- it's library-adjacent.
47657,204,60,261000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Is that perfume?
47658,204,61,262000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't be such a Phoebe. It's ""Pretension"" by Calvin Klein. Wanna try some?"
47659,204,62,269000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, so what's the haps in Springfield? What do you guys like do for fun?"
47660,204,63,273000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, you'll definitely want to get yourself a good doll. The new Malibu Stacy has an achievable chest."
47661,204,64,280000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,"Dolls, really? Okay, what else ya got?"
47662,204,65,282000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, jacks. Jacks are big. They went out for a while, but then they came roaring back."
47663,204,66,288000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,You mean that game with the little rubber ball?
47664,204,67,291000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, don't worry, you'll pick it up fast. Once you get to foursies, you're in the zone."
47665,204,68,296000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,Uh-huh...
47666,204,69,298000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,Isn't a trophy case supposed to have... trophies?
47667,204,70,300000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, they were... all wiped out in the big trophy fire."
47668,204,71,304000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, I see the trophies are still out for cleaning. Eh, Lisa?"
47671,204,74,314000,Homer Simpson,Rendering Plant,"Okay, boy, this is where all the hard work, sacrifice, and painful scaldings pay off."
47672,204,75,321000,Clerk,Rendering Plant,Four pounds of grease... that comes tooo... sixty-three cents.
47673,204,76,328000,Homer Simpson,Rendering Plant,Woo hoo!
47674,204,77,329000,Bart Simpson,Rendering Plant,"Dad, all that bacon cost twenty-seven dollars."
47675,204,78,332000,Homer Simpson,Rendering Plant,"Yeah, but your Mom paid for that."
47676,204,79,335000,Bart Simpson,Rendering Plant,But doesn't she get her money from you?
47677,204,80,337000,Homer Simpson,Rendering Plant,And I get my money from grease. What's the problem?
47678,204,81,342000,Homer Simpson,Rendering Plant,"Wow, look at that load of grease. Boy, if we're ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation."
47679,204,82,350000,Bart Simpson,Rendering Plant,"Um, I don't know how much more school I can miss."
47680,204,83,353000,Homer Simpson,Rendering Plant,"Oh, you'll miss plenty. I have a feeling this business is going to consume our whole lives."
47682,204,85,363000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Alex! Over here! Okay if the new girl sits with us?
47683,204,86,366000,Girls,Springfield Elementary School,"/ I guess. / Yeah, I guess."
47684,204,87,367000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"She's a little weird, but let's give her a chance."
47685,204,88,370000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Guys, this is Alex."
47686,204,89,372000,Girls,Springfield Elementary School,"Hi, there. / Hi. / Hello."
47687,204,90,373000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,"Ooo, twins! Which one is the evil one?"
47688,204,91,381000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, I'll go get our lunches."
47689,204,92,383000,Allison,Springfield Elementary School,"So, Alex, uh...?"
47690,204,93,383000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,Just a sec.
47691,204,94,387000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,"Hello? Oh yeah, like I'd be seen with a Discover card."
47692,204,95,393000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,You have a cell phone?
47693,204,96,394000,Terri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,And a purse?
47694,204,97,398000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"That's it, don't be shy..."
47695,204,98,400000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Now maybe a little joke, to break the ice."
47696,204,99,404000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Or a big joke.
47697,204,100,407000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Careful, now. Nobody likes a showoff."
47698,204,101,411000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Where are they going?
47699,204,102,413000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, wait up!"
47700,204,103,416000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,They left without me.
47701,204,104,418000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, Lisa..."
47702,204,105,420000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"I've got an extra seat, and you've got an extra lunch... Catch my drift?"
47703,204,106,428000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Milhouse, lower those eyebrows! And the other one."
47705,204,108,442000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, there I am being nice to Alex, and she takes all of my friends and ditches me."
47706,204,109,446000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sure they didn't ""ditch"" you, honey. Maybe they went off to plan a surprise party for you."
47707,204,110,453000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, yeah. Good one, Mom."
47708,204,111,457000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"They only like her 'cause she acts so grown up, with her perfume and her cell phone and... Oh, and get this, Mom, she drinks iced tea."
47709,204,112,467000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Li-sa, I can't imagine anyone being more likable than you. But apparently this new girl is. So my advice would be to start copying her in every way."
47710,204,113,477000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"But, Dad..."
47711,204,114,478000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh-uh, think. Is that what Alex would say?"
47713,204,116,486000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,"Ooo, there you are! Listen, I'm sorry I ran out on you yesterday, but the girls couldn't wait to show me that tree."
47714,204,117,491000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hm, don't give it a second thought. I didn't."
47715,204,118,494000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,"Anyway, I got you a little present."
47716,204,119,496000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, earrings! Wow, thank you so much, Alex. But these are for pierced ears."
47717,204,120,504000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,Yeah. Aren't they great?
47718,204,121,506000,Terri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,Alex did ours.
47719,204,122,508000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, all you need is a thumb tack and a whole lot of paper towels."
47720,204,123,511000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,But I don't think I'm ready for pierced ears.
47721,204,124,514000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, maybe you can put them on your doll."
47723,204,125,520000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,"Just kidding, Lis. I'm sure you'll be ready someday."
47724,204,126,523000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, Lisa, I was hoping I could count on you again to spearhead our annual school-wide apple-pick."
47725,204,127,529000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Absolutely.
47726,204,128,530000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,Apple-pick?
47727,204,129,531000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, it's great. We have pony rides, sing-alongs, apple-bobbing, apple-picking, apple everything."
47728,204,130,537000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, you forgot apple-bobbing."
47729,204,131,538000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No, I didn't."
47730,204,132,540000,Allison,Springfield Elementary School,Didn't your old school have apple-picks?
47731,204,133,542000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,"No, we weren't big on fruit. We were more into like, dances. You know, things that are fun."
47732,204,134,548000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,"A dance? Great idea, Alex!"
47733,204,135,550000,Terri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah! Principal Skinner, can we have a dance instead?"
47735,204,137,555000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, uh, we've never had a dance before. Lisa, you'd be doing all the work. What do you think?"
47736,204,138,563000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Um, I don't know. The ponies might be startled by the loud music."
47737,204,139,567000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, there wouldn't be ponies."
47738,204,140,568000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, then, at the risk of being unpopular, I think I'm gonna have to say..."
47739,204,141,578000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,School dance?! I didn't approve any school dance!
47740,204,142,581000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, you did! Yesterday. Right by my locker."
47741,204,143,584000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, yes, yes. Uh, carry on."
47743,204,145,599000,Bart Simpson,Krusty Burger,"When you want grease, go to the source: good old Krusty Burger."
47744,204,146,602000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,Oh I'll say. Look at that redheaded kid. There must be twenty dollars' worth of grease on his forehead alone.
47745,204,147,608000,Bart Simpson,Krusty Burger,I was thinking more of the deep fryer.
47746,204,148,610000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,All right. We'll try it your way.
47747,204,149,614000,SQUEAKY-VOICED TEENAGER,Krusty Burger,"Can I help you, sir?"
47748,204,150,616000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,"My God, you're greasy."
47749,204,151,619000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Krusty Burger,Mr. Maruca ? Help!
47750,204,152,624000,Bart Simpson,Krusty Burger,Mom's gonna kill you.
47751,204,153,626000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,"If she didn't want her car ruined, she should've done a better job hiding her keys."
47752,204,154,632000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,"Hey, what the...?"
47753,204,155,635000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,"Hey, hey, you're taking our grease!"
47754,204,156,639000,Thug #1,Krusty Burger,It's our grease now.
47756,204,158,642000,Thug #2,Krusty Burger,We run the grease racket in this town.
47757,204,159,645000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,"Hey, that's my shovel."
47758,204,160,647000,Thug #1,Krusty Burger,We also run the shovel racket.
47760,204,162,658000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Okay, girls, we're gonna need balloons, crepe paper, party hats..."
47761,204,163,662000,Alex,Springfield Mall,"Whoaaa, you've got a ""Dingo Junction"" here?"
47763,204,165,677000,Lisa Simpson,Dingo Junction,I am not wearing this.
47764,204,166,678000,Alex,Dingo Junction,"Oh, come on, Lisa. It's totally you. Just, you know, add some accessories, lip gloss, and maybe drop five pounds..."
47765,204,167,684000,Lisa Simpson,Dingo Junction,"Aren't we a little young for makeup and... What do you mean, five pounds?"
47766,204,168,688000,JANEY,Dingo Junction,"Well, you wanna look nice for your date."
47767,204,169,690000,Lisa Simpson,Dingo Junction,Date?
47768,204,170,691000,Alex,Dingo Junction,Hel-lo? For the dance.
47769,204,171,694000,Lisa Simpson,Dingo Junction,You guys have dates?
47770,204,172,695000,Terri Mackleberry,Dingo Junction,Hel-lo?
47771,204,173,696000,Lisa Simpson,Dingo Junction,Stop saying hello!
47772,204,174,698000,Alex,Dingo Junction,"Okay, calm down, Lisa. D.M.Y."
47773,204,175,701000,Lisa Simpson,Dingo Junction,"What's ""D.M.Y.""?"
47774,204,176,702000,Alex,Dingo Junction,Don't Mess Yourself.
47775,204,177,703000,Lisa Simpson,Dingo Junction,Eww!
47776,204,178,704000,Alex,Dingo Junction,"Yeah, that's why we changed it to D.M.Y."
47777,204,179,706000,Allison,Dingo Junction,"Don't worry, Lisa. There's still plenty of time. You'll get a date."
47778,204,180,710000,Lisa Simpson,Dingo Junction,"I don't want a date! And I don't want to wear perfume and cocktail dresses! Am I the only one who just wants to play hopscotch, and bake cookies, and watch ""The McLaughlin Group?"""
47779,204,181,721000,Lisa Simpson,Dingo Junction,Hel-lo?
47780,204,182,723000,Lisa Simpson,Dingo Junction,Hello?
47782,204,184,726000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business. I've been muscled out of everything I've ever done, including my muscle-for-hire business."
47783,204,185,736000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My poor Homie. Couldn't you try some other far-out money-making scheme?
47784,204,186,742000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, what's the point?"
47785,204,187,744000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You could raise some emus...
47787,204,188,747000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Emus? Really? Oh, that's pretty crazy... Nah... I'd only fail just like I fail at everything."
47788,204,189,755000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Dad, I've been thinking. What if instead of giving up on grease, we go for one last big score?"
47789,204,190,761000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait a minute. The boy's right! I can't quit now. Aww, you always know just what to say to cheer me up. Emu farm... You're priceless, Marge."
47792,204,193,777000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"The thing about huckleberries is, once you've had fresh, you'll never go back to canned."
47793,204,194,784000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, uh, so anyway, I kicked the guy's ass."
47794,204,195,790000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, if the berries are too tart, I just dust them with confectioner's sugar."
47795,204,196,795000,Boys,Springfield Elementary School,Oh. / Good secret. / Yeah.
47796,204,197,797000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, guys."

47798,204,199,807000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Are you all right?
47799,204,200,809000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,No doubt! Can't a girl fabulize herself before the big dance?
47800,204,201,813000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Your earlobe's bleeding.
47801,204,202,816000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh. So, I guess major muffins like yourselves all have dates, huh?"
47802,204,203,821000,Wendell Borton,Springfield Elementary School,You'd better believe it.
47803,204,204,822000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Really? All of you?
47804,204,205,824000,Database,Springfield Elementary School,"Ahh, we all have dates, Lisa."

47813,204,214,840000,Milhouse Van Houten,Nurse's Office,"Oh, hurry."
47814,204,215,842000,Lisa Simpson,Nurse's Office,"Milhouse! I've been lookin' all over for you! Listen, you've always had a crush on me, right? Well, this is your lucky day, 'cause you're gonna take me to the dance. Pretty great, huh? See ya."
47815,204,216,853000,Milhouse Van Houten,Nurse's Office,But I can't. I already asked somebody.
47816,204,217,856000,Lisa Simpson,Nurse's Office,So un-ask her.
47817,204,218,858000,Milhouse Van Houten,Nurse's Office,But that wouldn't be...
47786,204,219,859000,Lisa Simpson,Nurse's Office,You're taking me! You got that?! And it's gonna be a magical evening!
47818,204,220,866000,Lisa Simpson,Nurse's Office,"Ah. What am I doing? This isn't me. I'm sorry, Milhouse."
47819,204,221,871000,Milhouse Van Houten,Nurse's Office,I'm free next weekend! There's plenty of Milhouse to go around.
47821,204,223,889000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, son, we're about to embark on our most difficult mission. Let's bow our heads in prayer."
47822,204,224,894000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dear Lord, I know you're busy, seeing as how you can watch women changing clothes and all that. But if you help us steal this grease tonight, I promise we'll donate half the profits to charity."
47823,204,225,906000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, he's not stupid."
47824,204,226,908000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, screw it. Let's roll."
47825,204,227,912000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Mmm... I knew I should have attached those somehow.
47826,204,228,916000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Lucky parameciums.
47827,204,229,919000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't have to worry about finding dates or dancing.
47829,204,231,925000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa...
47830,204,232,925000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I made you some homemade Pepsi for the dance. It's a little thick, but the price is right."
47831,204,233,932000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, Mom. But I told you, I'm not going."
47832,204,234,934000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ohh, so you don't have a date. You can still go and have a wonderful time."
47833,204,235,940000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't understand. I don't belong there. The other girls are already into fashion and make-up and dating. They make me feel like a little baby.
47834,204,236,949000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, honey. A baby couldn't have organized a big school dance. Unless it was especially skilled. Or one of those super-babies from Brazil."
47835,204,237,959000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Forget it, Mom. I'm not going."
47836,204,238,961000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"But they're counting on you to take tickets. And if you sit there with a brave little smile and a festive bow, why, you could be the belle of the ball."
47837,204,239,971000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, you can't possibly believe that."
47838,204,240,973000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I have to, honey. Or... you can stay here and we'll have our own dance. ""Every Simpson dance now! Bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp!"""
47839,204,241,985000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll go.
47841,204,243,987000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,"This better work, boy. I don't wanna wind up workin' on your mother's emu farm."
47842,204,244,991000,Bart Simpson,Parking Lot,Don't worry. This is the score we've been dreamin' about. The grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied.
47843,204,245,1003000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,"Okay, turn on the suction."
47844,204,246,1008000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,It's not working.
47847,204,249,1016000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,What is it?
47848,204,250,1017000,Bart Simpson,Parking Lot,"Uh, nothing."
47850,204,252,1021000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Enjoy the dance.
47851,204,253,1026000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Wow, Lisa. I really admire your guts. You came here all by yourself, at the risk of being labeled a dateless wonder."
47852,204,254,1036000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Ow!
47853,204,255,1037000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,It slipped.
47854,204,256,1041000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, it's gonna be a long night."
47855,204,257,1048000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Where's the hose?
47856,204,258,1049000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Bringin' up the rear.
47857,204,259,1052000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Are you as excited as I am?
47858,204,260,1054000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, yeah."
47859,204,261,1056000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, here goes..."
47860,204,262,1062000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,And now we wait. So... is this your school?
47861,204,263,1068000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, it used to be."
47862,204,264,1080000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Eek! -- I mean, ach! -- I mean, what are you doing here?"
47863,204,265,1084000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Uhhhh... we're, uh, new foreign exchange students from, uh... um... Scotland."
47864,204,266,1092000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Saints be praised! I'm from Scotland! Where do ye hail from?
47865,204,267,1096000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Uhh... North... Kilt... town?
47866,204,268,1100000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,No foolin'?! I'm from North Kilt-town! Do you know Angus MacCloud?
47867,204,269,1106000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Wait a minute, there's no Angus MacCloud in North Kilt-town. Why you're not from Scotland at all!"
47868,204,270,1114000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, don't be daft. I was born and rai-- Hey, what the--?"
47869,204,271,1119000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,My retirement grease! Noooo!
47870,204,272,1123000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Ya thievin' grease bandits! I'll kill ya! Wait up!
47872,204,274,1134000,Groundskeeper Willie,Vent,"Not so fast, boy-o. Well, if it was up to me, I'd let ya go. But the lads have a temper... and they've been drinkin' all day."
47873,204,275,1147000,Homer Simpson,Vent,Ow! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful!
47874,204,276,1152000,Groundskeeper Willie,Vent,"All right, fine, I'll strangle ya for a while."
47875,204,279,1161000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, I have to run home. I need you to keep an eye on the dance."
47876,204,280,1165000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, I don't want to go in there with all the happy dancing couples."
47877,204,281,1169000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Normally I wouldn't ask, but it's an emergency. Mother has a Junebug cornered in the basement and she needs me to finish it off. C'mon, chop chop."
47878,204,282,1177000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"All right, all right. D.M.Y."
47879,204,283,1179000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I know what that means, young lady."
47880,204,284,1187000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Huh?
47882,204,286,1196000,Alex,Gym,"Oh, Lisa, it's terrible! Okay, this dance has gone Titanic!"
47883,204,287,1200000,Lisa Simpson,Gym,What happened?
47884,204,288,1201000,Alex,Gym,"Well, the boys and girls are like, afraid of each other. They're acting like a bunch of..."
47885,204,289,1205000,Lisa Simpson,Gym,Kids?
47886,204,290,1206000,Alex,Gym,I know. What is up with that?
47887,204,291,1208000,Lisa Simpson,Gym,"It's because they are kids. And so are we. C'mon, Alex, we've only got nine, maybe ten years tops where we can giggle in church, and chew with our mouths open, and go days without bathing. We'll never have that freedom again."
47888,204,292,1223000,Alex,Gym,"Listen, you can giggle and stink all you want, but I have a credit card. So on you!"
47890,204,294,1233000,Bart Simpson,VENTILATION DUCT,Uh... guys? Guys? The hose.
47891,204,295,1236000,Homer Simpson,VENTILATION DUCT,"Bart, please. The groundskeeper and I are trying to settle this like adults."
47894,204,298,1251000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"Look, it's snowing!"
47895,204,299,1257000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Wow, the snowflake tastes like fish sticks."
47896,204,300,1272000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,It's like a hamburger milkshake!
47898,204,302,1277000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Here comes a grease ball!
47899,204,303,1279000,Luigi,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, Luigi bringa you kids free pizza. Why you have to maka da fun, huh?"
47900,204,304,1290000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That's my grease! It's mine! Give it here!
47901,204,305,1294000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,They're playing in grease? Yarrgh!
47902,204,306,1297000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, act your age."
47905,204,309,1303000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,You are so dead.
47906,204,310,1311000,Alex,Springfield Elementary School,"Ow, there was bacon in that!"
