92957,359,3,43000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Maggie!
92958,359,4,43000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,That's not what you do with a hymnal. Homer!
92959,359,5,48000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I forgot to floss this morning!
92960,359,6,52000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Something's wrong with Maggie. We should get her to Dr. Hibbert. But I don't see him anywhere.
92961,359,7,57000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"The Hibberts now attend a more ""boisterous"" house of worship."
92963,359,9,73000,Bart Simpson,First A. M. E. Church of Springfield,This is awesome! Black God rules!
92964,359,10,77000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,First A. M. E. Church of Springfield,SHINE ON / OH LET IT SHINE ON
92965,359,11,83000,Marge Simpson,First A. M. E. Church of Springfield,Dr. Hibbert?

92967,359,13,85000,Marge Simpson,First A. M. E. Church of Springfield,"I hate to interrupt while you're rejoicing, but Maggie is terribly itchy."
92968,359,14,90000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,First A. M. E. Church of Springfield,Mm-hmm!
92969,359,15,91000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,First A. M. E. Church of Springfield,Oh. This looks to be the initial stages of chicken pox. Say amen!
92970,359,16,95000,Marge Simpson,First A. M. E. Church of Springfield,Amen!
92971,359,17,96000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,First A. M. E. Church of Springfield,Coat Maggie with this Calamine lotion and the scabbing will heal. The scabbing will heal!
92972,359,18,102000,Congregation,First A. M. E. Church of Springfield,The scabbing will heal!
92973,359,19,104000,Emotional Woman,First A. M. E. Church of Springfield,"Heal my scabs, Lord!"
92974,359,20,106000,Homer Simpson,First A. M. E. Church of Springfield,"Praise the Lord, I can walk again! What, my foot fell asleep."
92977,359,22,112000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetie, I know it itches, but you've gotta stop scratching!"
92978,359,23,118000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
92979,359,24,119000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No!!! Here, here play with your teddy bear."
92980,359,25,127000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, sugar-booger!"
92981,359,26,129000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, poor Maggie."
92982,359,27,131000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, don't touch her! You've never had chicken pox."
92983,359,28,134000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know, and you did, and you're great."
92984,359,29,137000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm just saying it's very dangerous if you get it as an adult! It could leave you sterile down there."
92985,359,30,144000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh. You always gotta work blue, don't ya Marge?"
92986,359,31,148000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're better than that.
92987,359,32,151000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Can't even go in my own kitchen... Bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters.
92988,359,33,157000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mmm. Don't worry, Dad. I'm saving one for you."
92989,359,34,160000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll just leave it here in the dog's mouth.
92990,359,35,162000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Noooo! Bart, that's a really bad storage area!"
92991,359,36,167000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Hey Homer, why the sour puss? Didja chugalug a skunky Snapple?"
92992,359,37,170000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I dunno, maybe. Plus my wife won't let me inside because the baby's got chicken pox."
92993,359,38,175000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Really? Do you mind if I bring my boys over so she can infect Rod and Todd? Then there'll be a pox on both our houses!
92994,359,39,181000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why would you do that? Are you a bad parent?
92995,359,40,184000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Au contraire, man with no hair! You see, Rod and Todd can only get the chicken pox once, and childhood's the safest time!"
92996,359,41,190000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,So you want Maggie to infect your kids?
92997,359,42,192000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"You betcha! In fact, some parents have been known to hold ""pox parties,"" so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please."
92998,359,43,199000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And would they pay handsomely for the privilege?
92999,359,44,202000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, they might. But you'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors..."
93000,359,45,206000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,...Fifteen dollars to infect your kids!
93001,359,46,209000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now featuring the Pox Box! Pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. Like any disease box, results may vary. Pox box!"
93003,359,47,215000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Welcome to our pox party. Save room for punch -- Maggie's bathing in the bowl!
93004,359,48,225000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Uh, hi. Luann'll pick Milhouse up when the party's over. I'll just read in the car till then."
93005,359,49,233000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Kirk, come join the parents in the kitchen. We're having alcohol drinks, and dishing on the parents who aren't here."
93006,359,50,240000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"...normally I'm not one to laugh at a man's urinary blockage, but, you shoulda seen it... oh, there he is."
93007,359,51,248000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ladies and gentlemen, presenting... the sister with the blisters... the tot with all the spots... Maggie!"
93008,359,52,263000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,I feel like a chicken already. I just made an egg in my pants!
93009,359,53,271000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Hey Marge. Hit me with a little more of that silly slush.
93010,359,54,275000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Chief, don't you think you've had enough?"
93011,359,55,277000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"I'm fine. Watch, I can even touch my gun to my nose."
93012,359,56,281000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Oh don't worry, I'm the Pief of Cholice. I mean I'm uh, beef with no cheese. Why doesn't Lou like me? Why?"
93013,359,57,289000,Luann Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Knock, knock!"
93014,359,58,291000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Luann, what are you doing here?"
93015,359,59,293000,Luann Van Houten,Simpson Home,I thought you were just dropping Milhouse off. I could get some coffee and come back...
93016,359,60,297000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"No, no, no, you stay. I'll just drive home. Uh, who's gonna let me siphon?"
93017,359,61,301000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, why don't you both stay and have one of my Marge-aritas?"
93018,359,62,305000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,All right!
93019,359,63,307000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,I never drank one of these without a cigarette in it!
93020,359,64,309000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome Mr. Krusty the Clown!"
93021,359,65,317000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Hey, hey, kids! This putz only paid for twenty seconds, so listen fast. Moishe caught the chicken pox, he scratched all night and day / He asked the rabbi what to do, and he said Time! I'm outta here!"
93022,359,66,336000,Luann Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Kirk, you look good. Have you been working out?"
93023,359,67,339000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Well, dogs have been chasing me..."
93024,359,68,341000,Luann Van Houten,Simpson Home,No one's been chasing me lately.
93027,359,69,342000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"What happened to your last boyfriend? The one who'd always go to the gym after visiting you, then have lunch at that place downtown? You know his taillight's broken."
93028,359,70,351000,Luann Van Houten,Simpson Home,I'm not seeing him anymore.
93029,359,71,352000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Well, does that mean there might be a chance for me?"
93030,359,72,356000,Luann Van Houten,Simpson Home,Almost anyone's got a chance now.
93031,359,73,361000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Goodbye, thanks for coming. If my party made you sick, tell your friends!"
93033,359,75,370000,Milhouse Van Houten,Hallway,Sweet Lizzie McGuire!
93034,359,76,372000,Bart Simpson,Hallway,You think that's traumatic.
93036,359,78,375000,Homer Simpson,Bathroom,"Mr. Stomach, are you hungry? I'm always hungry. Now make with the pizza, Fatso. You're the stomach!"
93037,359,79,388000,Homer Simpson,Bathroom,I have to do this for work.
93039,359,81,395000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So Milhouse walks into the bedroom, and there's his Mom and Dad going..."
93040,359,82,401000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Mr. Van Houten, I love when you kiss me! Yeah, yeah, kissing ladies is the best. Oh baby, kiss my mouth. Kiss me like we're in a fancy hotel."
93041,359,83,412000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, we get it!"
93042,359,84,414000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, what's happening to me?"
93043,359,85,417000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Homie, you got chicken pox. But how?"
93044,359,86,421000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know. I kept away from Maggie all day.
93045,359,87,426000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm so itchy!
93047,359,89,434000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah.
93049,359,91,436000,Kirk Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Son, we want to talk about what you saw in the Simpsons' house."
93050,359,92,439000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Well, I didn't see anything to get my hopes up, if that's what you mean."
93051,359,93,442000,Kirk Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Well, maybe you should get your hopes up a little."
93052,359,94,445000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,They're already up! They're sky-high!
93053,359,95,448000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Your father and I are going through what's called a ""trial un-separation."""
93054,359,96,448000,Kirk Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"And son, I wanna make one thing clear. Unlike the breakup, this is not your fault."
93055,359,97,457000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,I can't believe it! Our family might get back together again!
93025,359,98,496000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,I haven't daydreamed in color in so long.
93026,359,99,501000,Kirk Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Oh, thank God. We were afraid we lost you, son."
93057,359,101,506000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You sit in this oatmeal awhile, and it'll send your itchies packing! Homer!"
93058,359,102,511000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Mmm... Homer-oats.
93059,359,103,514000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Stop eating the oatmeal! That's the third tub you've eaten!
93060,359,104,520000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Y'ello? No, I'm not coming into work. I have chicken pox. I know I said that last month, but I was lying."
93061,359,105,529000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Right... right... right... right... okay... right. I love you, bye!"
93062,359,106,535000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I just got fired. Better check the ""Want Ads."""
93063,359,107,536000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh! ""Truck drivers needed in Iraq."""
93064,359,108,542000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Trucks are like big cars.
93066,359,110,545000,Kirk Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Okay, Luann. For honesty's sake, we should probably talk about everyone we dated while we were separated."
93067,359,111,552000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Well, the Sea Captain and I..."
93068,359,112,554000,Kirk Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Yeah, okay, I don't wanna know! I don't wanna know! I don't wanna know!"
93069,359,113,556000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,So what are we going to do as a family today? Mini-golf? Pedal boats? Indoor rock wall?
93070,359,114,561000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Um, Milly..."
93071,359,115,562000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Botanical garden? Build-A-Bear Workshop? Arena Football with the Springfield Stun?
93072,359,116,566000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Not today, big guy. Your Dad and I need more time to get... reacquainted."
93073,359,117,572000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Why are you laughing? Tell me! Private jokes are rude.
93074,359,118,576000,Kirk Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Uh son, here's ten bucks. Why don't you go to the bowling alley and throw some solo balls?"
93075,359,119,580000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,But it's league night!
93077,359,121,584000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"This trial un-separation stinks. My parents used to compete for my love, and I cashed in every time."
93078,359,122,592000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"And I always got the spillover. Drive-in movies, two Christmases, soda with dinner -- we lived like kings!"
93079,359,123,600000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,Remember when you told my Dad to go to bed and he did?
93080,359,124,604000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,That was some New Years. Now listen. I think we should consider breaking your parents up again.
93081,359,125,609000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"I don't know, Bart. I've wanted them back together for so long."
93082,359,126,613000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Look, you know they're gonna separate again. So why don't we just speed up the process?"
93083,359,127,617000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"You know, Bart, my imaginary friend never made me do things I thought were wrong."
93084,359,128,621000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,That's why he had to go away forever.
93085,359,129,624000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,I thought you were gonna let him come back!
93086,359,130,627000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I'm afraid he has to spend another year searching for his brain.
93089,359,133,634000,Kirk Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Luann, I'm moving my stuff back in!"
93090,359,134,638000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Uh, Dad... Mom says you're stinky and gross."
93091,359,135,642000,Kirk Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Your mother said that?
93092,359,136,646000,Kirk Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"This is so great! I mean, she used to keep her criticisms all bottled up... until they destroyed our marriage. And I guess I am a little funky. Well, this is what cologne samples are for!"
93094,359,138,664000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Mom, I don't wanna get Dad in trouble... but he just let me drink a beer."
93095,359,139,669000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Hm. Looks like we have a problem here.
93096,359,140,673000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,The problem being that you are addicted to fibbing.
93097,359,141,676000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,I am drunk -- I'll prove it! Watch me... kiss this picture of Nana.
93098,359,142,684000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,I can't do it. She's so mean to me. She wouldn't let me eat Fruit Loops!
93100,359,144,692000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Maybe my Mom and Dad are meant to be together, Bart."
93101,359,145,695000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You'd better hope not, 'cause you know what comes next? Your worst nightmare: a baby sister."
93102,359,146,701000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hi, Bart. I baked you some cookies."
93103,359,147,703000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Skanks for nothing, Lamerella."
93104,359,148,707000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you two don't mind, I'd like to watch that cool Fox show about teenagers in Orange County."
93105,359,149,713000,Amer-asian Girl,Simpson Home,"Austin, I was looking for my belly ring in your recording studio and I found this!"
93106,359,150,719000,Amer-asian Girl,Simpson Home,"Does this, or does this not, belong to Feather?"
93107,359,151,722000,Bratty Teenage Boy,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Jade. That's how we light it up in the O.C."
93108,359,152,724000,Amer-asian Girl,Simpson Home,You cheated on me! Our mixed-race fling is so over!
93109,359,153,727000,Bratty Teenage Boy,Simpson Home,Whatever. Let's score some jam at Knott's Berry Farm.
93111,359,154,731000,Bratty Teenage Boy #2,Simpson Home,"For sure, dog. We'll be kickin' it old-school at Bigfoot Rapids."
93112,359,155,735000,Bratty Teenage Boy #3,Simpson Home,Gonna get my flume on... log style!
93113,359,156,773000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I bet that bra was planted by Sterling, to break them up."
93114,359,157,773000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That's a brilliant idea. Those TV writers are geniuses!
93115,359,158,781000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Whatever they're paid, it's not enough."
93117,359,160,783000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,This bra is really gonna lift and separate: lift your mother's suspicions and separate your parents!
93118,359,161,789000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Milhouse! I need slender fingers to get me a pickle!
93119,359,162,797000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,This isn't mine.
93120,359,163,805000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,I have a message for your wife: stop sleeping with my husband!
93121,359,164,809000,Homer Simpson,Van Houten Home,Okey-doke. And you are...
93122,359,165,813000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,The wife of your wife's lover!
93123,359,166,816000,Homer Simpson,Van Houten Home,Will she know what this is regarding?
93124,359,167,817000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,You moron! Marge is having an affair with Kirk!
93125,359,168,821000,Homer Simpson,Van Houten Home,"That's ridiculous! No woman would want to have sex with that loser! And, uh, congratulations on snagging him back. Good stuff."
93126,359,169,830000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Never mind about those two. Just answer me one question. How did your wife's bra end up in my husband's bed?
93127,359,170,838000,Homer Simpson,Van Houten Home,This-this is Marge's bra. I bought it for her boobs!
93129,359,172,844000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of all the people for Marge to cheat on, why did it have to be me?"
93130,359,173,848000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh boy, am I beat! If you wanna return a melon to the grocery store, clear your day!"
93131,359,174,856000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that answers the mystery of the missing melon, but I have one more question: did you sleep with Kirk Van Houten?"
93132,359,175,862000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How could you ask me that?
93133,359,176,864000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I repeat: did you sleep with Kirk?
93134,359,177,867000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you're crazy!"
93135,359,178,868000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're not saying no.
93136,359,179,868000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine... No!
93137,359,180,871000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm still not hearing no.
93138,359,181,871000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no, no!"
93139,359,182,874000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, methinks the lady doth protest too much!"
93140,359,183,877000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't trust me? After I salved every chicken pock on your ungrateful body! How dare you!
93141,359,184,883000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Get out of this house!
93142,359,185,887000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Gladly.
93143,359,186,904000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,We tried to break up your parents and we broke up mine!
93144,359,187,907000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Wanna call my therapist and tell her how you feel?
93145,359,188,910000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Hello, Dr. Wexler?"
93146,359,189,913000,Therapist,Simpson Home,"Stop calling me! I'm on my honeymoon! Yeah, it's that weird kid again."
93147,359,190,926000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I thought Mom kicked you out of the house."
93148,359,191,929000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I came to get my mail.
93149,359,192,931000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Resident... occupant... I can't open these. Ooh, a traffic ticket!"
93150,359,193,941000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'd do anything to get your mother and that donut back.
93151,359,194,945000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay look, you and Mom can fix this. What exactly happened between the two of you?"
93152,359,195,949000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, we don't need to know how. It's just a natural thing that happens, like a hurricane or going to war."
93153,359,196,955000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'd better go."
93154,359,197,957000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Where are you staying?
93155,359,198,958000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know the Four Seasons? Well, I'm experiencing them first hand, because I'm living in the park."
93156,359,199,964000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, I think you're behind this whole thing."
93157,359,200,967000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I can see how you'd think that. But on the other hand..."
93158,359,201,969000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I can read you like a book.
93159,359,202,974000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ha, ha, you read books."
93160,359,203,975000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you don't tell Mom what you did, I will."
93161,359,204,979000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh come on, wouldn't it be easier if our parents divorced and you compensated by marrying much older men? Meanwhile, I'll be one of those weird guys who's thirty-five and shows up at high school basketball games."
93162,359,205,996000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why did I marry that selfish jerk? I've asked him to flip the mattress a thousand times, and he never does!"
93163,359,206,1008000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, Mom?"
93164,359,207,1009000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hi, sweetie."
93165,359,208,1010000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... you know that bra that broke up our family?
93166,359,209,1013000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-hmm.
93167,359,210,1014000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I looked into it, and it turns out I was responsible."
93168,359,211,1019000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Really? Well, just for that I'm gonna erase all the saved games on your PlayStation."
93169,359,212,1024000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What?! How do you know about things like that?
93170,359,213,1027000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I learned about it in here.
93171,359,214,1031000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"But now Dad can come home, right?"
93172,359,215,1032000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
93173,359,216,1032000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But he's innocent.
93174,359,217,1034000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Innocent?! After all I do for your father, he still doesn't trust me. I'm finished with him."
93175,359,218,1039000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Does this mean you and Dad might get a D-A-V-U-R-S?
93176,359,219,1043000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Young man, you go work on your spelling... or I'll delete all the custom ring tones from your cell phone!"
93177,359,220,1049000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Nooo!!!!!
93179,359,222,1052000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Milhouse, our reverse parent trap just made everything worse."
93180,359,223,1055000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"Maybe we should use a different movie as our guide. Like ""Oklahoma."""
93181,359,224,1060000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"OH THE FARMER AND THE COWMAN SHOULD BE FRIENDS / OH, THE FARMER AND THE COWMAN SHOULD BE FRIENDS"
93182,359,225,1068000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,ONE MAN LIKES TO PUSH A PLOUGH
93183,359,226,1070000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,THE OTHER LIKES TO CHASE A COW
93184,359,227,1072000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,BUT THAT'S NO REASON WHY THEY CAIN'T BE FRIENDS.
93185,359,228,1080000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"What do you think, Bart? A hoedown could solve all our problems. I just need your chap size. It's two more than your pant size."
93186,359,229,1087000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,How many times do I have to tell you: no Rodgers and Hammerstein!
93187,359,230,1091000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,Rodgers and Hart?
93188,359,231,1092000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,No!
93189,359,232,1093000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"Well, what will trick your parents into getting back together?"
93190,359,233,1096000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Enough with the tricks!
93191,359,234,1098000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Stupid movie schemes do not work in real life. Mom and Dad have a marriage on the rocks and they need to work through it in therapy to make sure it doesn't shatter.
93192,359,235,1107000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Rocks... shatter... jagged cliff... Lis, you've just given me an idea for the most insane, hair-brained, fool-proof scheme ever!"
93196,359,238,1117000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Okay. When Mom and Dad see this dummy fall in the river, they'll think it's me, and they'll realize what really matters: each other."
93197,359,239,1123000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield,"Do you like the dummy, Bart? I even made it smell like you."
93198,359,240,1128000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Now, to make sure Homer and Marge are in proper viewing position..."
93200,359,242,1133000,Marge Simpson,Park,"So, I got your note saying you wanted to meet here to apologize."
93201,359,243,1137000,Homer Simpson,Park,"Well, I got your note saying you were gonna bring me a bucket of potato salad."
93202,359,244,1141000,Marge Simpson,Park,Where's my apology?
93203,359,245,1142000,Homer Simpson,Park,Where's my bucket?
93205,359,247,1144000,Bart Simpson,Cliff,"Now, I'll get my Mom and Dad's attention, and you shove the dummy in the water. Any questions?"
93206,359,248,1147000,Milhouse Van Houten,Cliff,Yeah. What are you going as for Halloween?
93207,359,249,1150000,Bart Simpson,Cliff,Pile of dog doo. Let's roll.
93208,359,250,1152000,Bart Simpson,Cliff,"Mom, Dad! I'm playing on a dangerous cliff -- because you're too busy arguing to pay attention to me!"
93210,359,252,1160000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,"Bart! We're all disappointed there's no potato salad! But for God's sake, don't jump!"
93211,359,253,1165000,Bart Simpson,Cliff,Now!
93212,359,254,1165000,Milhouse Van Houten,Cliff,I can't tell which is which. Oh no! I'm already running!
93213,359,255,1177000,Milhouse Van Houten,Cliff,"I did it, Bart! Bart?"
93215,359,257,1192000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,"I'm a-comin', boy!"
93217,359,259,1209000,Bart Simpson,Cliff,This is all my fault! I planted Mom's bra in Milhouse's parents' bed!
93218,359,260,1213000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,Why you little...
93219,359,261,1217000,Marge Simpson,Cliff,Homer! I can save you both! Just let go of the rock!
93220,359,262,1221000,Marge Simpson,Cliff,Just do it! Trust me!
93221,359,263,1223000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,Okay.
93222,359,264,1237000,Bart Simpson,Cliff,Mom... Dad. I'd give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together.
93223,359,265,1241000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,Make it two kajillion.
93224,359,266,1242000,Marge Simpson,Cliff,Homer!
93225,359,267,1243000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,We'll lose the first kajillion to taxes.
93226,359,268,1245000,Marge Simpson,Cliff,"Well, I guess you showed you do trust me after all."
93227,359,269,1249000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,Of course I do. The only thing I can't believe is that a woman as great as you would be married to me.
93228,359,270,1255000,Marge Simpson,Cliff,"Oh, Homie..."
93195,359,271,1259000,Milhouse Van Houten,Cliff,I don't want to live in a world without Bart!
92508,359,272,1265000,Marge Simpson,Cliff,Can he swim?
93002,359,273,1267000,Bart Simpson,Cliff,What do you think?
