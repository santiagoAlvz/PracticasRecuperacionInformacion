125694,485,2,58000,Homer Simpson,Bakery,"I love your low prices, but why did these weddings get cancelled?"
125695,485,3,63000,Salesman,Bakery,Returned because of a fight over the pre-nup.
125696,485,4,65000,Homer Simpson,Bakery,Awww...
125697,485,5,67000,Salesman,Bakery,That one there? Bride's dad made a racist toast.
125700,485,7,71000,Salesman,Bakery,"She wanted a cake with blue rosettes, he slept with her sister."
125701,485,8,75000,Homer Simpson,Bakery,"Cake, will you do me the honor of making my stomach the happiest bag of acid in the world? You will?!"
125704,485,11,86000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Time for a shortcut.
125705,485,12,90000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Woo hoo!
125707,485,14,96000,Bart Simpson,Car,"Dad, the cake!"
125708,485,15,104000,Lisa Simpson,Car,"Dad, our lives!"
125709,485,16,105000,Homer Simpson,Car,Fine.
125711,485,18,119000,Homer Simpson,NARROW MOUNTAIN ROAD,"Uh-oh, they've got the right-of-way."
125712,485,19,125000,Homer Simpson,NARROW MOUNTAIN ROAD,Morning.
125713,485,20,125000,Cyclist,NARROW MOUNTAIN ROAD,Guten tag.
125716,485,23,137000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who's alone in the vehicle?
125717,485,24,142000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Maggie's locked in!
125718,485,25,143000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,With the keys!
125720,485,27,145000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's wrong?
125721,485,28,147000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, first the good news... two of your kids are not locked in the car."
125722,485,29,151000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maggie!
125725,485,32,158000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We've gotta get her out of there! Babies aren't supposed to sleep on their stomach on a cake!
125726,485,33,163000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay. Okay, the spare key is somewhere in here."
125727,485,34,169000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What's this key with the plastic skull for?
125728,485,35,172000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That's the key to my box with the real skull.
125729,485,36,177000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Maggie!
125731,485,38,186000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,So how come we have all these other keys?
125732,485,39,188000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if you live long enough you start to accumulate things. This is from a gas station men's room. They put the block of wood on it so you don't walk away with it. These are from a key party we went to before we realized what a key party was--"
125733,485,40,202000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We got out of it just in time.
125734,485,41,208000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"Aw, come on! You'll miss all the sex!"
125735,485,42,211000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Uh, this key opens your parrot cage."
125736,485,43,213000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,Rules are rules.
125699,485,44,216000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And these keys are from all my jobs.
125737,485,45,219000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,At some point we should try to return these keys to their rightful owners.
125738,485,46,223000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you nuts?! Let's have some fun!
125739,485,47,226000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, stop him!"
125740,485,48,227000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Stop who, Marge? Be specific."
125742,485,50,230000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Time to get my mischief on!
125743,485,51,233000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Let's start with a little federal crime.
125744,485,52,238000,Man,Springfield Street,"Oh, thank God! I can get back the angry letter I wrote to my boss!"
125745,485,53,242000,Woman,Springfield Street,"I really didn't want that subscription to ""The Atlantic"""
125746,485,54,247000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Street,"Yes, and this patent application for a robot dog could use a bit more tinkering."
125747,485,55,252000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Street,With the biting and the chewing on my tuchus--
125748,485,56,255000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Street,"Oh, the laser eyes! Why did I give it to him?!"
125749,485,57,258000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,What the? I tried to do bad and I did good!
125750,485,58,261000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Street,Haw-haw.
125751,485,59,262000,Barney Gumble,Springfield Street,Keys to the Duff Brewery?! Where'd you get those?!
125752,485,60,266000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Well, it might have been the time when..."
125753,485,61,274000,Duffman,Springfield Street,"Duffman doesn't need Duff to have fun! Seriously, you got any beer?"
125754,485,62,278000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,No.
125755,485,63,280000,Duffman,Springfield Street,I heard drowning makes you feel like you're drunk.
125757,485,65,287000,Homer Simpson,Sidewalk,Or maybe I just found them on the ground.
125759,485,67,295000,Barney Gumble,Duff Brewery Grounds,Wow! The guys at the AA meeting will never believe this!
125761,485,69,299000,Homer Simpson,Duff Brewery,Oh my God... there's the fire brewer... the beechwood ager... the rat filter...
125762,485,70,313000,Homer Simpson,Duff Brewery,"The Duff blimp! Oh, how I'd love to drive that thing."
125763,485,71,321000,Homer Simpson,Duff Brewery,"Really, Duff blimp? You really want me to?"
125764,485,72,327000,Homer Simpson,Duff Brewery,"Oh, what the hell? Life is made to be lived. I've been buttoned down too long!"
125765,485,73,333000,Barney Gumble,Duff Brewery,"Hey Homer, I really had you going there, huh? Homer?"
125766,485,74,338000,Homer Simpson,Duff Brewery,When we see each other again you'll be an old man and I'll be a baby!
125769,485,76,343000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,...And these are from sardine cans your father opened. He saved them out of sentimental value.
125770,485,77,351000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll return this to the school.
125771,485,78,353000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Maggie, one key left for us!"
125772,485,79,356000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This looks like it's from a wind-up toy.
125773,485,80,364000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I hope we haven't stumbled onto my anniversary present.
125774,485,81,381000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer? Could you please turn down those blimp engines and tell me where you are?
125775,485,82,390000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll call you back! Come back, Pooter Toot! People might be offended by your mild tastelessness!"
125776,485,83,398000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oh, isn't that a cute little choo-choo..."
125778,485,85,402000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,"Daddy, did you make that devil's music?"
125779,485,86,405000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"It wasn't me, boys! It was the train!"
125780,485,87,407000,Todd Flanders,Simpson Home,"What train, Daddy?"
125781,485,88,409000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,It was right there... with the ... and the...
125782,485,89,413000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,Jesus cries blood every time you lie.
125785,485,92,420000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, Lisa. Whatcha doin'?"
125786,485,93,422000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Returning this lost key to Principal Skinner.
125787,485,94,425000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,But that key could open any door in the school. Aren't you curious?
125788,485,95,428000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, maybe a little. But I'd never break the rules."
125789,485,96,431000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Little Miss Play-It-Safe. Have a nice day... just like yesterday... and the day before that... and the day before that...
125790,485,97,434000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,And the day before that... and the day before that... and the day before that...and the day before that... and the day before that...
125791,485,98,450000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Nelson, either tell them what they're having for lunch, or get off the P.A."
125792,485,99,453000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Sloppy Joes... and the day before that... tater tots... and the day before that...
125794,485,101,460000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Basement,Banned books?!
125795,485,102,464000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Basement,Band books?!
125797,485,104,467000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Basement,Could this key open...
125798,485,105,470000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Basement,Get thee behind me Namuche! That's the Buddhist Satan. Let's give it a shot.
125799,485,106,482000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Basement,"No problem, just some cobwebs."
125802,485,109,496000,Lisa Simpson,CLASSROOM,"I've discovered a mystery, wrapped in a riddle in the basement of a lousy school!"
125804,485,111,503000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"It's like five classrooms in one! A science room... student lounge... mathnasium... An experimental theater! All set for a production of Samuel Beckett's ""Endgame""!"
125805,485,112,515000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Ooh, a pull-down map of..."
125806,485,113,518000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Nothing? And this ruler is unmarked and... the tabs on this pop-up book have no effect...and this tooth has no dentin! Everything is fake! What is going on?!
125808,485,115,533000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Mother, it is my birthday, not our anniversary!"
125809,485,116,536000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Principal Skinner, do you know anything about a bizarre hidden classroom underneath the school?"
125810,485,117,542000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Mother, I have work to do. Well, it's work if they pay you! They say they're going to!"
125811,485,118,549000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Lisa, I know every moldy inch of this unaccredited school. But I have never seen such a thing as you describe."
125812,485,119,555000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,It's real. I can show you!
125813,485,120,558000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Well, I have a very busy schedule, but..."
125814,485,121,561000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Myra, cancel all my appointments!"
125815,485,122,562000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,You're just pressing a Mento.
125816,485,123,565000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Very true.
125817,485,124,567000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Okay, let's go."
125819,485,126,573000,Homer Simpson,SKY OVER SPRINGFIELD,Hm. Is it drinking and driving if you're flying a blimp? Maybe I can find the answer by texting.
125820,485,127,579000,Homer Simpson,SKY OVER SPRINGFIELD,"Yo, Lenny... ...do you know anything about... flying the blimp while drinking..."
125821,485,128,597000,Homer Simpson,SKY OVER SPRINGFIELD,What was that?
125823,485,130,602000,Marge Simpson,Street,Uh-oh.
125825,485,132,606000,Female Ibs Sufferer,Conference Room,This train is mocking our intestinal distress!
125826,485,133,610000,Male Ibs Sufferer,Conference Room,I don't think I've ever felt this irritable.
125768,485,134,612000,Marge Simpson,Conference Room,"Excuse me, has anyone seen my toy?"
125827,485,135,614000,Female Ibs Sufferer,Conference Room,You mean your wind-up hate crime?
125830,485,138,619000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"And now without further ado, I give you... this!!!"
125832,485,140,629000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,One Thousand and One Vulgar Marching Band Formations.
125833,485,141,629000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Truly these band books deserve to be banned.
125834,485,142,638000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I swear there was a room here!
125835,485,143,640000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, Lisa... go home, relax, try to do some kid things. You know, with a ball or something... or decorate your sneakers with a ""Magic""-brand marker."
125838,485,146,657000,Bart Simpson,Streets Of Springfield,"Maybe this key will be the key to putting the ""key"" in anarchy."
125839,485,147,664000,Bart Simpson,Streets Of Springfield,The last place anybody would expect to see a moon: the sky!
125840,485,148,673000,Matrons,Streets Of Springfield,"Why, we never!"
125841,485,149,677000,Gil Gunderson,Streets Of Springfield,"Goodbye, cruel world!"
125842,485,150,680000,Gil Gunderson,Streets Of Springfield,I'm alive! And you're my naked fairy-god-boy.
125843,485,151,684000,Bart Simpson,Streets Of Springfield,"Aw jeez, I hope no one heard you say that."
125845,485,153,686000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"And so, to this naked fairy-god-boy, I present the key to the city. Now do us a favor and lower your pants for the picture."
125848,485,156,697000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Lisa Simpson may be onto us.
125849,485,157,698000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"I oversee fourteen schools, Seymour, and for some reason, I always find myself talking to you about one of the Simpson kids!"
125850,485,158,704000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh my God, there she is. Act natural. Act natural."
125851,485,159,708000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, oh, hello, student. Um, we were just standing here discussing how we have no, uh, secrets."
125852,485,160,715000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,And nothing to hide. I'll just take that key back now.
125854,485,162,724000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Backing away from something, Lisa?"
125858,485,165,733000,Lisa Simpson,Streets Of Springfield,"I've got to get back in that room, but Skinner took away the only key! What would Nancy Drew do?"
125859,485,166,740000,Elderly Nancy Drew,Streets Of Springfield,"Oh, don't you worry, I'll get my friends The Hardy Boys to help."
125861,485,168,745000,Ralph Wiggum,Streets Of Springfield,Extra! Read all about it! Lisa's a liar! Pants on fire!
125862,485,169,756000,Chief Wiggum,Streets Of Springfield,Pull over!
125863,485,170,756000,Chief Wiggum,Streets Of Springfield,Before somebody gets hurt!
125864,485,171,762000,Homer Simpson,Streets Of Springfield,"So long, suckers!"
125865,485,172,765000,Chief Wiggum,Streets Of Springfield,Oh!
125866,485,173,765000,Chief Wiggum,Streets Of Springfield,"Oh, the Zoomanity!"
125869,485,176,774000,Lisa Simpson,Key Store,"Hi, my name is Lisa Simpson."
125870,485,177,777000,Key Man,Key Store,"Ah yes, the Simpsons: a notch and a bump, two notches and a bump."
125871,485,178,780000,Lisa Simpson,Key Store,That's us. Do you think you could reproduce the key in this photo?
125872,485,179,785000,Key Man,Key Store,"Yeah, but it's gonna cost ya."
125873,485,180,787000,Lisa Simpson,Key Store,How much?
125874,485,181,788000,Key Man,Key Store,"Dollar eighty-five. And if you want that little plastic ring around it, now that's gonna cost you another seven cents."
125875,485,182,794000,Lisa Simpson,Key Store,Keep the change.
125876,485,183,796000,Key Man,Key Store,Yes ma'am!
125878,485,185,808000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,How did this bookshelf get here so fast? I bet it's shoddy.
125879,485,186,815000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"What do you think of that, Nancy Drew?"
125880,485,187,819000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Jeez, they're dropping like flies."
125881,485,188,828000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,The children are on Bus 23.
125883,485,190,828000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'm so sick of keys. They've brought nothing but good luck since I got them.
125884,485,191,845000,Cletus Spuckler,Springfield Elementary School,"Brandine, I think we finally gots us something to cut off that umbrilical cord."
125885,485,192,851000,Brandine Del Roy,Springfield Elementary School,Well then you got one more mouth to feed.
125886,485,193,854000,Brandine Del Roy,Springfield Elementary School,Y'all want some chocolate milk?
125887,485,194,856000,Child,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, mama."
125888,485,195,857000,Brandine Del Roy,Springfield Elementary School,"You got it, Embry-Joe."
125891,485,198,866000,Marge Simpson,Road,That wisenheimer windup toy could be anywhere.
125892,485,199,873000,Marge Simpson,Road,Chief Wiggum! Stop that train!
125857,485,200,879000,Chief Wiggum,Road,Things on the ground are out of my jurisdiction.
125893,485,201,883000,Chief Wiggum,Road,"Aw, not through my legs. Oh, that's really rubbin' it in."
125895,485,203,888000,Chief Wiggum,Road,Maybe if I use a pen...
125896,485,204,893000,Chief Wiggum,Road,"Aw jeez, here comes that girl I always liked in high school."
125897,485,205,897000,Attractive Woman,Road,"Clancy, is that you?"
125898,485,206,898000,Chief Wiggum,Road,"Oh ah hey, Maryann. Uh, how are you at getting pants off the ground?"
125900,485,208,904000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Skinner's involved in this. Deep.
125901,485,209,907000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Crazy classroom, bus full of missing kids... I know who'd have some answers. Someone who's been here a long, long time."
125903,485,211,918000,Nelson Muntz,WOODSHOP,"Yeah, I've been held back more times than I can count... which I guess is why I keep getting held back."
125904,485,212,924000,Lisa Simpson,WOODSHOP,You know anything about... Bus Twenty-three?
125905,485,213,927000,Nelson Muntz,WOODSHOP,"Whoa, Goldilocks, you best be leaving those bowls of porridge alone."
125906,485,214,932000,Lisa Simpson,WOODSHOP,"There's only one bed that's just right for me, the bed with the truth in it. Which is probably the third one."
125907,485,215,938000,Nelson Muntz,WOODSHOP,"All right, I'll tell you. I'll tell you about Bus Twenty-three."
125909,485,217,946000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,It was a cold winter -- two-vest cold.
125910,485,218,950000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"A bus was loaded with kids for a field trip. I was gonna shake 'em down for field trip money, but what I heard shook me worse than my Dad when I was a baby."
125911,485,219,959000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Sir, this bus is too heavy to cross the ice bridge. They'll have to take a more circuitous route."
125912,485,220,964000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,There's no time to be safe! Now bang the side of that bus! Bang it twice!
125913,485,221,971000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,That bus never came back.
125914,485,222,974000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,So the answer to our mystery lies on the other side of that ice bridge.
125915,485,223,978000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,But it's summertime -- the ice bridge will be a water nothing.
125916,485,224,981000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, kids!"
125917,485,225,981000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,If I tossed you guys a bucket full of something could you pour it out and toss the bucket back up? Don't drink it!
125921,485,228,991000,Lisa Simpson,Blimp,That's where the ice bridge would be! Go down!
125923,485,230,997000,Lisa Simpson,Skies,"Dad, stop!"
125924,485,231,999000,Homer Simpson,Skies,But there's so many buttons!
125931,485,238,1024000,Homer Simpson,Blimp,"Bart, take the controls!"
125932,485,239,1025000,Bart Simpson,Blimp,What videogame is this like?
125933,485,240,1027000,Homer Simpson,Blimp,Blimp Assassin Three.
125934,485,241,1028000,Bart Simpson,Blimp,For Wii or Xbox?
125935,485,242,1028000,Homer Simpson,Blimp,Xbox.
125936,485,243,1030000,Bart Simpson,Blimp,Original or Three-Sixty?
125937,485,244,1032000,Homer Simpson,Blimp,"Fly the blimp, you spoiled kid!"
125940,485,247,1037000,Homer Simpson,Blimp,"I'll save you, honey!"
125941,485,248,1039000,Homer Simpson,Blimp,Boy! Stomp on my head!
125942,485,249,1041000,Bart Simpson,Blimp,Yes! And I've got gum on my shoe!
125943,485,250,1047000,Homer Simpson,Blimp,You're a real jerrrk!
125944,485,251,1059000,Homer Simpson,Blimp,Why you undead little...!
125945,485,252,1062000,Lisa Simpson,Blimp,That's not a real arm -- it's plastic!
125946,485,253,1065000,Homer Simpson,Blimp,"That doesn't mean you're any better than him, young lady. He could be a war hero."
125947,485,254,1068000,Lisa Simpson,Blimp,"No, I mean they're mannequins!"
125950,485,257,1078000,Bart Simpson,River,"There's nothing I can do to save my sister, the blimp or this airship."
125953,485,260,1110000,Homer Simpson,Riverbank,All pooted out.
125954,485,261,1113000,Marge Simpson,Riverbank,"Oh, I'm sorry, Homie."
125955,485,262,1115000,Homer Simpson,Riverbank,It's worse than you think. I have to buy you a new anniversary present.
125956,485,263,1122000,Lisa Simpson,Riverbank,Skinner and Chalmers loaded that bus with those kids... but why?
125957,485,264,1127000,Otto Mann,Riverbank,I can tell you why.
125958,485,265,1129000,Lisa Simpson,Riverbank,Otto? Are you the one who left the message on the blackboard?
125959,485,266,1133000,Otto Mann,Riverbank,"Yeah, it was me. I was the bus driver when those sweet young angels were swallowed up by the river. Now I'm gonna join them."
125960,485,267,1143000,Lisa Simpson,Riverbank,"Otto, they're just mannequins!"
125962,485,268,1145000,Otto Mann,Riverbank,Then... I'm not responsible for a horrible tragedy! And I didn't do anything wrong by fleeing the scene and not reporting it and killing that hobo with the big mouth. I might have imagined that last part.
125963,485,269,1157000,Gary Chalmers,Riverbank,Skin-ner!
125965,485,271,1157000,Gary Chalmers,Car,"When I say ""drive us to Bolivia,"" that is your cue to start the damn car!"
125966,485,272,1163000,Seymour Skinner,Car,I can't find the key!
125967,485,273,1166000,Bart Simpson,Car,Looking for something?
125968,485,274,1167000,Seymour Skinner,Car,Yes. My car key.
125969,485,275,1169000,Bart Simpson,Car,Does it look like... this?
125970,485,276,1170000,Seymour Skinner,Car,Yes. Quite a bit.
125971,485,277,1172000,Gary Chalmers,Car,"He's got your key, Seymour."
125973,485,279,1175000,Seymour Skinner,Mysterious Basement Classroom,I suppose you want to know why this all happened. Picture what I'm describing in your minds.
125975,485,281,1180000,Seymour Skinner,NEW SCHOOL,"Years ago we received a government grant to improve the school. Unfortunately, I cashed it...and the money was in my pants when mother did the laundry."
125976,485,282,1192000,Seymour Skinner,NEW SCHOOL,But these pants were good for another day.
125977,485,283,1194000,Agnes Skinner,NEW SCHOOL,That's not your decision.
125978,485,284,1196000,Seymour Skinner,NEW SCHOOL,I'm the boss of my own laundry!
125979,485,285,1198000,Agnes Skinner,NEW SCHOOL,"Well, you don't have to sleep next to you!"
125981,485,287,1201000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"To keep the feds from coming after us, we built the phony schoolrooms that you saw."
125983,485,289,1207000,Gary Chalmers,Circular Classroom,So all you had to do was fill the class with mannequins and take a few pictures.
125984,485,290,1211000,Gary Chalmers,Circular Classroom,"Yes, except for one small glitch. We could only afford to rent the mannequins."
125987,485,293,1217000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"If we didn't get them back by five, we'd be charged for the extra day."
125988,485,294,1221000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,And they didn't pro-rate.
125990,485,296,1225000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Otto, maybe it was wrong of us to let you think you killed twenty-four children -- who could say?"
125993,485,297,1232000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, there's one thing you didn't count on: my Dad getting a giant wedding cake and my sister locking herself in the car."
125994,485,298,1238000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"We planned for the wedding cake, we just didn't see the baby thing coming."
125995,485,299,1241000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, you should've."
125996,485,300,1242000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,How could I? She wasn't even born yet.
125997,485,301,1244000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,People have babies!
125999,485,303,1253000,Otto Mann,Springfield,Not to worry. They're just mannequins.
126000,485,304,1256000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield,No we're not!
126001,485,305,1258000,Otto Mann,Springfield,"Maybe we'll fall real slow like ""Inception."""
126002,485,306,1262000,Otto Mann,Springfield,Oops. Guess not.
