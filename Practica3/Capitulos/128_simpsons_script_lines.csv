27045,128,1,35000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, is there nothing so intoxicating as the school hallway at early morn?"
27046,128,2,43000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Hmm. School normally doesn't smell so... rank.
27047,128,3,47000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Ahh. Washbasin fresh. That funk must be coming from one of the classrooms.
27049,128,5,55000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Poor fellow. Crushed by his own water bottle...
27050,128,6,63000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Willie, sometime over the holiday weekend, the beloved Grade Four gerbil, er, Superdude, lost his life. I need you to air out the classroom and give Superdude a proper burial."
27052,128,8,76000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Yer lucky yer getting a decent burial! Me own father got thrown in the bog!
27053,128,9,85000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,What in the name of St. Ephesiocritus?!
27055,128,11,95000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Yuck. What reeks?
27056,128,12,98000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Smells like one of Van Houten's!
27057,128,13,100000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,It does not!
27058,128,14,105000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Miss Hoover? The floor is shaking.
27059,128,15,109000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,Ralph. Remember the time you thought the --
27060,128,16,109000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Mommmmy!!!
27062,128,18,115000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Now, before we adjourn, gentlemen, I have one last matter of utmost importance. I need to send this parcel with the profit projections to Pete Porter in Pasadena - And it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight!"
27063,128,19,129000,Executive #1,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Pete Porter. Pass it on.
27064,128,20,130000,Executive #2,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Pasadena. Promptly.
27003,128,21,131000,Executive #3,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Package for parcel processing. Pronto.
27038,128,22,133000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Perk up, Prendergast. Profoundly pressing package of power plant profit projections for Pete Porter in Pasadena."
27065,128,23,137000,Prendergast,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Priority?
27066,128,24,138000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Precisely.
27067,128,25,146000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Here's your package, Mr. Burns!"
27068,128,26,154000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"My name is the return address, you senseless dunderpate! Smithers, who is this nincompoop?"
148565,128,27,159000,Homer's Brain,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I've worked here for ten years, and my boss doesn't even know my name? Well, that's gonna change right now. My name is Homer J. Simp--"
27069,128,28,168000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,--son!
27070,128,29,169000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Sounded large when I ordered it. I can't make hide nor hair of these metric booby-traps.
27072,128,31,176000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Roof,My Lord. Such destruction.
27073,128,32,179000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Roof,Superintendent Chalmers! How are you going?
27074,128,33,183000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Roof,"Why is it when I heard the word ""school"" and the word ""exploded,"" I immediately thought of the word ""Skinner""?"
27075,128,34,189000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Roof,I-I-I-I-I...
27076,128,35,189000,Engineer,Springfield Elementary School Roof,"Congratulations, gentlemen. Your custodian struck oil. You're standing on top of the richest elementary school in the state."
27077,128,36,197000,Engineer,Springfield Elementary School Roof,We also found this.
27078,128,37,199000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Roof,"Thank you, Superdude."
27080,128,39,209000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Bah! A non-profit organization with oil? I won't allow it! An oil well doesn't belong in the hands of Betsy Bleedingheart and Maynard G. Muskie-vote!
27081,128,40,218000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, have you had enough exercise for this morning?"
27082,128,41,223000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No. Let's do another twenty miles.
27083,128,42,227000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Ugh!
27084,128,43,236000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hello, Lenny, Carl, Guillermo..."
27085,128,44,239000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hello... Eh... do..er... uh... Oooh...umm...
27086,128,45,243000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Don't take it so hard, Homer. He's always screwin' up people's names."
27087,128,46,248000,Guillermo,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah. At the picnic, he thought my son Reynaldo was my son Rolando. Can you believe that?"
27089,128,48,254000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Superintendent, we made the front page today!"
27090,128,49,259000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, what's that say under your hand there?"
27091,128,50,262000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Hm, it's an unrelated article."
27092,128,51,264000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,It's an unrelated article. Within the banner headline?
27093,128,52,268000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes. Now, to re-direct our conversation slightly, I had a few ideas on how to spend this oil money."
27094,128,53,272000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, we could give each student a full college scholarship."
27096,128,55,284000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh mercy. Seriously though, before we draw up the budget, I believe the students and faculty have a few suggestions..."
27097,128,56,290000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"I want a crystal bucket for my slop-water. Oh, and a brand new filthy blanket."
27098,128,57,297000,Lunchlady Doris,Springfield Elementary School,The cafeteria staff is complaining about the mice in the kitchen. I want to hire a new staff.
27099,128,58,305000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'd like to start a jazz program for the music department. We've got a really great instructor lined up...
27100,128,59,312000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Tito Puente!
27101,128,60,315000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,He's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo circuit and settle into a nice teaching job.
27102,128,61,321000,Tito Puente,Springfield Elementary School,"Man, it will be my pleasure. Lisa has told me all your students are as bright and dedicated to jazz as she is."
27103,128,62,329000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Let's go now, Mr. Puente."
27104,128,63,332000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Chocolate microscopes...?
27105,128,64,334000,Otto Mann,Springfield Elementary School,You know those guitars that are like double guitars... you know?
27106,128,65,337000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,More rubber stamps.
27107,128,66,340000,Voice,Springfield Elementary School,"Principal Skinner, this is your secretary. There is one last student here to see you."
27108,128,67,344000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"That's odd. I don't have a secretary, or an intercom. But send him in."
27109,128,68,348000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,"Ahoy there, Dean! I understand you're taking suggestions from students, eh? Well, me and my Fourth Form chums think it would be quite ""corking"" if you'd sign over your oil well to the local energy concern!"
27110,128,69,362000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Mr. Burns...
27111,128,70,364000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,Bheh!
27112,128,71,364000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,It was naive of you to think I would mistake this town's most prominent 104 year-old man for one of my elementary school students.
27114,128,72,371000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,"I want that oil well! I've got a monopoly to maintain! I own the Electric Company and the Waterworks, plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue."
27115,128,73,378000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"That hotel's a dump, and your monopoly is pathetic. The school's oil well is not for sale. Particularly to a black-hearted scoundrel like yourself!"
27116,128,74,385000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,I see. Then I'll just have to... AT-TTACK YOU!
27117,128,75,389000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,"I must have that oil! Oogh! Smithers! Smithers, help me subdue this beast!"
27118,128,76,398000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Elementary School,"Sorry, sir, this is all I could find! Take that! And that!"
27119,128,77,403000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Please don't waste those.
27121,128,79,410000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm happy for the school. It sounds like this money is gonna provide a lot of new opportunities.
27122,128,80,414000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Big deal. They didn't approve my idea. They said it was ""unfeasible."""
27123,128,81,418000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"It is unfeasible to resurrect the dead, Bart. And even if the Three Stooges were alive, I doubt they'd want to hang around with you."
27124,128,82,424000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, um, yeah. I guess they'd probably want to be with their families or something, huh?"
27125,128,83,427000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I hate my job. I mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?"
27126,128,84,432000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I have an idea.
27127,128,85,434000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What? What's your idea?
27128,128,86,435000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"When my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent her a box of candy with his photo in it. After that, she never forgot him."
27129,128,87,442000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's all well and good, but it's not really your idea, is it now Marge?"
27131,128,89,446000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That's it. Frimble about with your widgets and doobobs. It'll all be a monument to futility when my plan comes to fruition.
27132,128,90,454000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir... uh, What I'm about to say violates every sycophantic urge in my body, but: I wish you would reconsider. This isn't a rival company you're battling with. It's a school. People won't stand for it."
27133,128,91,465000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Pish-posh. It will be like taking candy from a baby.
27134,128,92,469000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Say, that sounds like a larf. Let's try it right now."
27136,128,93,474000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ah, ub, there's some candy right here, Sir. Why don't we eat this instead of stealing?"
27137,128,94,479000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, very well."
27139,128,96,485000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, look, there's a photo in here."
27140,128,97,487000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hmm, yes. I believe that's little Maggie Simpson -- the baby who found my precious teddy-bear Bobo. Oh and there's that, ah Simpson mutt, my former guard dog."
27141,128,98,497000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ooh uh, uh, that's B-Bart Simpson. He was my heir for a brief period, you know."
27142,128,99,503000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes, Sir, I remember."
27143,128,100,506000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Anything left?
27144,128,101,509000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Only the sour quince log, Sir."
27145,128,102,513000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Dispose of it. And uh, send a thank-you note to Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie Simpson."
27147,128,104,526000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Today, Springfield Elementary embarks on a new era: an era of unbridled spending where petro-dollars will fuel our wildest educational fantasies. These young minds will enjoy every academic advantage... ...until they enter Springfield High School, which has no oil well."
27148,128,105,542000,High School Student,Springfield Elementary School,We got an air hockey table!
27149,128,106,543000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Fine. Now, to switch on our oil pump for the very first time, here's our top student, Lisa Simpson."
27150,128,107,550000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Nerd!
27151,128,108,559000,Engineer,Springfield Elementary School,There's no pressure! Someone else has tapped this well!
27152,128,109,563000,Tito Puente,Springfield Elementary School,Ay carumba!
27153,128,110,574000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah. Soon that mighty apparatus will burst forth with its precious fluid. Almost sexual, isn't it, Smithers?"
27154,128,111,581000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Elementary School,Eh.
27155,128,112,583000,Roughneck,Springfield Elementary School,Oil ho!!
27156,128,113,592000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,Huzzah!
27158,128,115,594000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Huh? Wahw!
27165,128,122,614000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Holy Christmas.
27167,128,124,620000,Veterinarian,Animal Hospital,"Your dog's condition has been upgraded from ""stable"" to ""frisky,"" and he's free to go. His legs should be good as new in a few months. But in the meantime, he'll have to use the Wheelabout."
27169,128,126,630000,Bart Simpson,Animal Hospital,"I'll get even with whoever did this to you, boy. I swear it."
27170,128,127,634000,Veterinarian,Animal Hospital,"Oops, almost forgot. Wouldn't want you gnawing on those casts, eh boy?"
27171,128,128,639000,Nelson Muntz,Animal Hospital,Haw haw!
27172,128,129,641000,Nelson's Parrot,Animal Hospital,Haw haw!
27174,128,131,642000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I'm afraid we've got no legal recourse against Mr. Burns and his slant- drilling operation. The oil belongs to whoever pumped it first.
27175,128,132,648000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,What about all the expensive stuff we wanted? Can we still have it?
27176,128,133,651000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,No.
27178,128,135,655000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"In fact, to pay for the construction, and operation, and demolition of our new derrick, the school will have to eliminate all non-essential programs: music..."
27179,128,136,662000,Tito Puente,Springfield Elementary School,What?! / Que?!
27180,128,137,663000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,And maintenance.
27181,128,138,665000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,I'll kill that Mr. Burns!! And wound that Mr. Smithers. Outta my way!
27183,128,140,673000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, no. that's awful, Mr. Puente. What? Oh. He owns the nuclear power plant. Yeah, I'd like to settle his hash, too."
27184,128,141,682000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, how can you work for a man like Mr. Burns?"
27185,128,142,685000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, he's not all bad. He did send me this nice thank-you card."
27186,128,143,689000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie."" Dad, this doesn't have your name on it."
27187,128,144,697000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, would you step outside for a second?"
27188,128,145,702000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,F-F-F-F-F-F-
27190,128,147,706000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,Dear Lord. That's the loudest profanity I've ever heard.
27192,128,149,713000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"These fumes aren't as fun as beer. Sure, I'm all dizzy and nauseous, but where's the inflated sense of self-esteem?"
27113,128,151,723000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey! If you guys are getting loaded off them fumes, I'm gonna have to charge ya."
27194,128,152,728000,Male Inspector,Moe's Tavern,Man alive! There are men alive in here!
27195,128,153,731000,Female Inspector,Moe's Tavern,I'm detecting over twenty different toxins in the air.
27197,128,155,736000,Male Inspector,Moe's Tavern,"All right, everybody out! As long as Burns is pumping oil, this bar is closed."
27198,128,156,740000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Damn Burns... Lemme just get one thing.
27199,128,157,745000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Me too.
27200,128,158,747000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Ahhhh, now there's the inflated sense of self-esteem."
27203,128,161,762000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Earthquake!
27204,128,162,768000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Nurse!
27205,128,163,769000,Other Old People,Springfield Retirement Castle,Nurse! Nurse! Nurse!
27207,128,165,778000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, Sir, you've certainly vanquished all your enemies: the elementary school, the local tavern, the old age home. You must be very proud."
27208,128,166,787000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, not while my greatest nemesis still provides our customers with free light, heat, and energy. I call this enemy... the sun!"
27209,128,167,805000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Since the beginning of time man has yearned to destroy the sun. I will do the next best thing -- block it out.
27210,128,168,818000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Good God!
27211,128,169,820000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Imagine it, Smithers. Electrical lights and heaters running all day long."
27212,128,170,824000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"But Sir, every plant and tree will die; uh, owls will deafen us with incessant hooting... the town sundial will be useless."
27213,128,171,831000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,-II don't want any part of this project. It's unconscionably... fiendish.
27214,128,172,835000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I will not suffer your insubordination! There has been a shocking decline in the quality and quantity of your toadying, Waylon, and you will fall into line. Now."
27215,128,173,846000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No... No, Monty, I won't. Not until you step back from the brink of insanity."
27216,128,174,851000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'll do no such thing! You're fired!
27217,128,175,861000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Take that, bowl-a-rama! Take that, convenience mart! Take that, nuclear power pla-- Oh, fiddlesticks."
27219,128,177,872000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I must say Mr. Burns is being awfully inconsiderate. Selfish, even."
27221,128,178,879000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Burns needs some serious boosta-fazoo. Right, Dad? Dad? Homer?"
27223,128,180,886000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Grampa. It's just that, for a second, it looked like Dad had melted."
27224,128,181,890000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, get used to it, cause I'm livin' here now. I ain't goin' back to the retirement home until they fish my bed outta that sinkhole."
27225,128,182,897000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Strained carrots for Maggie... Strained carrots for Grampa.
27226,128,183,901000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I want a bib, too."
27228,128,185,902000,Imaginary Burns #1,Simpson Car,"Smithers, who is that ignoramus?"
27229,128,186,905000,Imaginary Burns #2,Simpson Car,"Smithers, who is that lollygagger?"
27230,128,187,907000,Imaginary Burns #3,Simpson Car,Who is that blubberpot?
27231,128,188,909000,Ten Imaginary Burnses,Simpson Car,Who is that bafflewit? / ...lummox? / Puddinghead? / Mooncalf? / Limpnoodle? / Goldbricker? Drizzlepuss? / Cueball? / Fumblefist? / Galoot?

27233,128,190,915000,Ten Imaginary Burnses,Simpson Car,Look out!
27234,128,191,916000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,What?
27235,128,192,920000,Elderly Guard,Simpson Car,Just a minute.
27239,128,196,934000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Who the devil are you?!
27240,128,197,938000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Shut up! Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson!
27241,128,198,939000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"What? What are you talking about? Clearly make sense, man. I can't understand a word you're saying. You're just babbling incoherently like some sort of..."
27242,128,199,948000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, you're a dead man! Oh, you're dead! You're dead Burns!"
27244,128,201,951000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, the lamps runnin' away."
27245,128,202,954000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's my dog, man."
27246,128,203,955000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So long, lamp. Now stop loafing, and help your Grampa unpack."
27247,128,204,962000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Wow!
