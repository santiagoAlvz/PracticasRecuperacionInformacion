7943,59,3,99000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Nah.
8001,59,6,100000,Doctor,Testing Area,This can't be right. This man has 104% body fat!
8002,59,7,104000,Doctor,Testing Area,"Hey, no eating in the tank!"

8005,59,10,107000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"How was your day at work, dear?"
8006,59,11,109000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, the usual. Stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough..."
8008,59,13,117000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, I'm afraid Homer Simpson is sterile."
8009,59,14,120000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Who?
8010,59,15,121000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,One of your cabbage heads from Sector 7-G. Take a look at this sperm sample from his recent physical.
8011,59,16,129000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Ewww.
8012,59,17,130000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Now, compare this with a normal sperm sample."
8013,59,18,135000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hm. Oh yes.
8014,59,19,137000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'm afraid radiation from the plant is the reason he's shooting blanks. He could sue us for millions.
8015,59,20,142000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Mother of pearl. Call my lawyers!
8018,59,23,144000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Before you begin, let me make one thing clear to you. I want your legal advice. I even pay for it. But to me you're all vipers. You live on personal injury. You live on divorces. You live on pain and misery...... but I'm rambling. Anybody want any coffee?"
8019,59,24,160000,Lawyer,Burns's Office,I'll have some coffee.
8020,59,25,161000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Want it black, don't you? Black like your heart! It's so hard for me to listen to you, I hate you all so much... I'm sorry. It's my problem. I'll deal with it. Please continue."
8021,59,26,173000,Lawyer,Burns's Office,"If you offer Mr. Simpson a token sum -- say, a couple thou -- he'll be so dazzled, he'll sign anything you shove under his nose."
8022,59,27,180000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Oh, brilliant. A cash settlement. I could have figured that out, you button-down maggot."
8023,59,28,185000,Lawyer,Burns's Office,Do you have any cream?
8024,59,29,186000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Oh yes, of course. Where are my manners?"
8026,59,31,190000,Bum,HOBO JUNGLE,"Yeah... I used to be rich. I owned ""Mickey Mouse Massage Parlors"". Then those Disney sleezeballs shut me down. I said, ""Look, I'll change the logo, put Mickey's pants back on"". Some guys you just can't reason with."
8027,59,32,205000,HERB,HOBO JUNGLE,"Well, I used to own a successful car company. My strategy was givin' them Japanese names. You guys ever drive a Tempura Hatchback?"
8028,59,33,216000,HERB,HOBO JUNGLE,"Yeah, life was sweet. Then I found out I had a long lost half- brother."
8030,59,35,224000,HERB,HERB'S ESTATE,Homer!

8036,59,41,241000,HERB,Powell Motors Showroom,"Forbes Magazine called it the ""Blunder of the Century."" A little overblown, don't you think? What about new Coke?"
8037,59,42,247000,WILLIAM POWEL LOOKALIKE,Powell Motors Showroom,"Hey, I invented that."
8038,59,43,249000,HERB,Powell Motors Showroom,"Yeah, but all that's in the past. Because this is America and in America you're never finished as long as you've got a brain in your head. Because all a man really needs is an idea."
8039,59,44,262000,Bum,Powell Motors Showroom,"Well, I'm lit."
8040,59,45,262000,Bum #2,Powell Motors Showroom,Me too.
8042,59,47,264000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"And now, the next event...in our Living Room Olympics... the always controversial, couch vault. I do this for Stain Master Carpets. Proud sponsor of the Living Room Olympics."

8044,59,49,282000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat... the dream is over. All right, who did this?"
8045,59,50,289000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"We were just sitting on the couch, quietly chatting, when we heard a creaking noise."
8046,59,51,292000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We leapt off just in time to see it collapse.
8047,59,52,296000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"There, there. You're safe now, little sister."
8048,59,53,299000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!?"
8049,59,54,305000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, goodbye, old girl. We've had a lot of great memories."

8061,59,66,359000,Mother,Park,What do you want? I just changed your diaper. Are you hungry? Are you cold? Do you want to go home?
8062,59,67,366000,HERB,Park,"Lady, you just gave me the idea of a lifetime. How do I thank you?"
8063,59,68,371000,Mother,Park,Please don't hurt me.
8064,59,69,373000,HERB,Park,Consider it done.

8073,59,78,397000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Is this the one with the lazy sperm?
8074,59,79,400000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,Hmmm hmmm.
8075,59,80,401000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Ah, Simpson, you big virile son-of-a- gun. How would you like a check for two-thousand dollars?"
8076,59,81,407000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,Would I!
8077,59,82,408000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,All you have to do is sign this form.
8078,59,83,411000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Wait a minute. I'm not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it."
8079,59,84,416000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"All right, well, it just explains that you've won -- yes, that's it -- won the first annual... uh... Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for... a-a-a Outstanding Achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, Excellence!"

8085,59,92,467000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Civic Center,This Award is the biggest farce I ever saw.
8086,59,93,470000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Civic Center,What about the Emmys?
8087,59,94,471000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Civic Center,I stand corrected.
8088,59,95,472000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Civic Center,"And now to present the award, here's former heavyweight champion, Smokin' Joe Frazier."

8098,59,105,523000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,You cleaned me out Smokin' Joe. What's the matter Homer? Cummerbund too tight?
8099,59,106,527000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I miss my couch.
8100,59,107,528000,Smokin' Joe Frazier,Moe's Tavern,I know how you feel. You lost a couch. I lost a heavyweight championship.
8101,59,108,534000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There's like three of those. That couch was one of a kind.
8102,59,109,538000,Smokin' Joe Frazier,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, I know things are tough now. But one day you'll be walking along and you'll see a piece of furniture that you can love just as much."
8103,59,110,546000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, Frazier, shut up!"
8104,59,111,548000,Smokin' Joe Frazier,Moe's Tavern,"Barney, you've been riding my back all night."
8105,59,112,550000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Oh yeah? Care to step outside?
8106,59,113,553000,Smokin' Joe Frazier,Moe's Tavern,Let's do it.
8107,59,114,559000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I think I'm gonna take a walk.
8109,59,116,562000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,All right! A peanut!
8111,59,118,566000,HERB,TRAIN YARD,"I'm telling you, all a man needs is an idea. And I've got an idea."
8112,59,119,571000,Bum #2,TRAIN YARD,Then how come you're still a bum?
8113,59,120,573000,HERB,TRAIN YARD,"All right. A man needs two things, an idea and money to get it off the ground. Hello, what's this?"
8114,59,121,586000,HERB,TRAIN YARD,"""Local man, Homer Simpson, receives award and $2,000 check."" Hmmm... Any of you guys know which freight goes to Springfield?"
8115,59,122,594000,HERB,TRAIN YARD,Uh-uh. Nope. Nope. That's the one.
8118,59,125,604000,Homer Simpson,Street,"I feel so empty. So alone, so... couchless."
8119,59,126,610000,Homer Simpson,Street,Wow. The Spine Melter 2000.
8121,59,128,617000,Homer Simpson,Furniture Store,Give me full power.
8122,59,129,618000,Salesman,Furniture Store,But sir...
8123,59,130,618000,Homer Simpson,Furniture Store,"Dammit, I said full power!"
8124,59,131,644000,Lisa Simpson,Furniture Store,Dad? Dad?
8125,59,132,648000,Homer Simpson,Furniture Store,I'll take it.
8126,59,133,650000,Marge Simpson,Furniture Store,"This chair is $2,000. We could buy a whole living room set for that."
8127,59,134,656000,Homer Simpson,Furniture Store,"Marge, there's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer."
8128,59,135,666000,Marge Simpson,Furniture Store,This money was a blessing. We can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
8129,59,136,670000,Homer Simpson,Furniture Store,"All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky."
8131,59,138,689000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Yes?
8132,59,139,690000,HERB,Flanders Home,"Oh... uh... sorry, I must have the wrong house."
8133,59,140,693000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Ho, ho, that's where you're wrong, friend."
8134,59,141,695000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Aren't we in luck? Today's our tithe day and we've got ourselves a transient. Come in my friend. Let us feed and bathe you.
8135,59,142,702000,HERB,Flanders Home,Hey wait a minute...
8136,59,143,702000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,"Dad, can I anoint the sores on his feet?"
8137,59,144,705000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"I think it's Mom's turn, son."
8138,59,145,707000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,"Ah, no fair."
8140,59,147,709000,HERB,Flanders Home,Thanks for the suit.
8141,59,148,710000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Well, if you ever want to spend the night, Maude and I can sleep on card tables."
8142,59,149,715000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS...
8143,59,150,718000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,"""MARCHING AS TO WAR, ETC..."""
8145,59,152,721000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,They're singing again. Lousy neighbors. Wish I was deaf.
8146,59,153,728000,HERB,Simpson Home,"What am I gonna say? This is the guy who ruined me. But on the other hand, he's family. So many conflicting emotions. How to express them..."
8083,59,154,739000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Herb!
8147,59,155,744000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Unky Herb!
8148,59,156,746000,HERB,Simpson Home,Bart... Lisa. I'm so glad to see you.
8149,59,157,749000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You weren't so glad to see me.
8150,59,158,751000,HERB,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, Homer. But I'm still mad at you. Every word you say just makes me want to punch you in the face."
8151,59,159,757000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?"
8152,59,160,760000,HERB,Simpson Home,"I'll try, but I'm not making any promises."
8153,59,161,763000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Herb! How have you been?
8154,59,162,765000,HERB,Simpson Home,"I've been living in a cardboard box, sleeping on grates, eatin' out of dumpsters. You?"
8155,59,163,770000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Can't complain.
8156,59,164,772000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode."
8157,59,165,779000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,On... off... on... off.
8158,59,166,781000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, he knows how to work a light switch."
8159,59,167,783000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know what this switch does."
8162,59,170,789000,HERB,Simpson Home,"This is really great, Marge."
8163,59,171,790000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Counsel.
8164,59,172,794000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,They do good work.
8165,59,173,795000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Unky Herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself?"
8166,59,174,801000,HERB,Simpson Home,Discarded pizza boxes are an inexpensive source of cheese.
8167,59,175,805000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Lisa, aren't you happy to see me?"
8168,59,176,808000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why didn't you write, Unky Herb?"
8169,59,177,810000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Hey if I wrote to you what was I supposed to say? ""Dear Lisa, last night I used a rat for a pillow thanks to your pop."
8170,59,178,815000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I see your point.
8171,59,179,817000,HERB,Simpson Home,WHETHER YOU'RE DRIVING NEAR OR FAR / POWELL MAKES A POW-POW-POWERFUL CAR!
8172,59,180,824000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Maggie, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. You're gonna make me rich again. Yes-oo are! Yes-oo are!"
8173,59,181,835000,HERB,Simpson Home,"One, two, three... Ventnor Avenue."
8174,59,182,838000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"And while on Ventnor Avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous Hotel Lisa. A valet will be around shortly to park your thimble. Of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the bill."
8175,59,183,849000,HERB,Simpson Home,Get to the point.
8176,59,184,850000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Eleven hundred and fifty bones.
8177,59,185,853000,HERB,Simpson Home,That's all I got.
8178,59,186,855000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. I guess you're just not much of a businessman."
8180,59,188,862000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe we should play another game.
8181,59,189,864000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why are we playin' games when we got two grand in the bank!? Remember when Dad won the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence?
8182,59,190,872000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I think we should invest in a set of the great books of Western Civilization. Look at this ad from ""New Republic for Kids."" Each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: ""Paradise Regained,"" ""Martin Chuzzlewit,"" or Herman Melville's twin classics ""Omoo"" and ""Typee""."
8183,59,191,878000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait, Marge. Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?"
8184,59,192,890000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That was your idea.
8185,59,193,892000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I think we should get a machine gun. We could use it to hunt game, spell out things, or ring in the new year!"
8186,59,194,897000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I really think we need to replace the washer and dryer."
8187,59,195,904000,HERB,Simpson Home,How would you like to spend two thousand dollars to give a broken man a second chance?
8188,59,196,909000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Nah.
8189,59,197,910000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, wait. Herb, what're you talking about?"
8190,59,198,912000,HERB,Simpson Home,Up-up-up-up. Not here. Come into the dining room. I want to give you a twenty-minute presentation that will change the world.
8191,59,199,919000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Twenty minutes?!
8192,59,200,922000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Okay. Now, before I tell you about my idea, I'd like to show you this."
8193,59,201,931000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's drinking the water!
8194,59,202,934000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Take it easy, Homer. Now this is an example of how one little idea -- carefully marketed..."
8195,59,203,940000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!
8196,59,204,945000,HERB,Simpson Home,"No, Homer. That invention is out already. I'm just using it as an example."
8197,59,205,950000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's going back for more!
8199,59,207,955000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Homer, this is my invention."
8200,59,208,957000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Now, of course, with these blueprints you'll have to use your imagination."
8202,59,209,971000,HERB,Simpson Home,"It's a baby translator. It measures the pitch, the frequency, and the urgency of a baby's cries. Then it tells whoever's around -- in plain English -- exactly what the baby is trying to say. Everything from ""Change me"" to ""turn off that damn Raffi record."""
8203,59,210,982000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's a very clever idea!
8204,59,211,989000,HERB,Simpson Home,All I need is a couple thousand dollars to build a prototype. You'll have your money back in thirty days. I swear.
8205,59,212,996000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I think we owe a debt to Unky Herb. He took us into his home and Dad destroyed him.
8206,59,213,1001000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you know some shyster's gonna bilk you out of your money. It may as well be your brother."
8207,59,214,1005000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother."
8208,59,215,1011000,HERB,Simpson Home,Nope.
8209,59,216,1011000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, then just give me the drinking bird."
8210,59,217,1020000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Now, let's see... What could you be trying to say? Nothing downstairs... You just took a nap..."
8211,59,218,1027000,HERB,Simpson Home,I want to suck your nose.
8212,59,219,1027000,HERB,Simpson Home,Ooga booga! Ooga booga!
8213,59,220,1033000,HERB,Simpson Home,I'm scared.
8214,59,221,1033000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Hmm... the amplitude of the sine wave is insufficient for ""Burp Me"", and this saw-tooth formation is something I've never..."
8215,59,222,1043000,HERB,Simpson Home,Eureka.
8216,59,223,1045000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Now, I bet you're all wondering what lies under this sheet."
8217,59,224,1049000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Not really. We peeked inside while you were in the john.
8218,59,225,1051000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Oh. Well, here it is again. My ""Baby Translator!"""
8219,59,226,1057000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoooa!!
8220,59,227,1061000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Marge, you don't have to humor me."
8221,59,228,1062000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it's pretty ingrained."
8222,59,229,1063000,HERB,Simpson Home,"What do you think, Homer?"
8223,59,230,1065000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks."
8224,59,231,1074000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Homer, could you stop thinking about your ass!"
8225,59,232,1076000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I try, but I can't."
8226,59,233,1080000,Herb Powell,Simpson Home,Lavish attention on me and entertain me.
8227,59,234,1082000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maggie, you talked!"
8228,59,235,1084000,HERB,Simpson Home,You see! It tells you exactly what's on the baby's mind.
8201,59,236,1088000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Maggie! Maggie!
8230,59,237,1092000,Herb Powell,Simpson Home,Where did you go?
8231,59,238,1093000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Peek-a-boo!
8232,59,239,1095000,Herb Powell,Simpson Home,"Oh, there you are. Very amusing."
8233,59,240,1097000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Well, Homer, now what do you think?"
8234,59,241,1099000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something."
8235,59,242,1106000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, every mother in the country is going to want one of these."
8236,59,243,1111000,Herb Powell,Simpson Home,I have soiled myself. How embarrassing.
8237,59,244,1116000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear.
8238,59,245,1122000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. He is your brother."
8239,59,246,1126000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, when is he gonna act like it?"
8242,59,249,1139000,Professor Jonathan Frink,BABY EXPO,"This radio controlled plane gives your baby the chance to fly, just like my son here. He can execute the barrel roll... loop-de-loop... then bring it in for the perfect landing."
8243,59,250,1153000,Professor Jonathan Frink,BABY EXPO,"Whoop, oh dear. My wife is going to kill me."
8245,59,252,1160000,Herb Powell,Kremlin,I only want to eat candy!
8246,59,253,1162000,Mom,Kremlin,Then that's all you'll get.
8247,59,254,1166000,Herb Powell,Kremlin,This leash demeans us both.
8248,59,255,1168000,Woman,Kremlin,I'll take two.
8249,59,256,1168000,Man,Kremlin,I'll take a dozen!
8250,59,257,1169000,Man #2,Kremlin,"I represent the ""Precious Baby Discount Stores"". I'll take 50,000."
8251,59,258,1173000,HERB,Kremlin,I'm rich again! USA! USA! USA!
8253,59,260,1179000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Homer, here's a check for two-thousand dollars. But I also wanted to give you each a little something for believing in me. Lisa, this is the first volume of The Great Books of Western Civilization. You'll receive a new one every month. From ""Beowulf"" to ""Less Than Zero."""
8254,59,261,1195000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Finally, a copy of ""Ethan Frome"" to call my own."
8255,59,262,1198000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Now Bart, I know you're too young for the machine gun you wanted. But I'm gonna give you something that'll make sure when you're old enough you can still buy one. A membership in the National Rifle Association."
8256,59,263,1210000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow! The NRA. Can I be get armor piercing cyanide-tipped bullets, too?"
8257,59,264,1214000,HERB,Simpson Home,"It's in the Constitution, son."
8258,59,265,1216000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Maggie, who brought me my fortune I'll give you anything you want in this world."
8259,59,266,1224000,Herb Powell,Simpson Home,I want what the dog's eating.
8261,59,268,1226000,HERB,Simpson Home,I'll get you somethin' nice. Now Marge...
8262,59,269,1228000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Herb, I appreciate your generosity, but I don't need any gift from you."
8263,59,270,1232000,HERB,Simpson Home,"You're too late, Marge. I got you a new washer and dryer. And I sold the old ones for fifty bucks."
8265,59,272,1240000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Come on washer!
8266,59,273,1243000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, you stupid dryer!"
8268,59,275,1246000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Herb, I don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me."
8269,59,276,1251000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Homer, walk me to my car."
8270,59,277,1254000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What do I get? What do I get? It's not another punch in the face is it? Because if it is, I don't want it."
8271,59,278,1259000,HERB,Simpson Home,"This is what you get, Homer. I forgive you. You can call me brother and I can do the same."
8272,59,279,1265000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it?
8273,59,280,1266000,HERB,Simpson Home,That's it.
8274,59,281,1267000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I see your point, brother."
8275,59,282,1270000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Gimme a hug, brother."
8276,59,283,1272000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right... but I never really hugged a man before.
8277,59,284,1281000,HERB,Simpson Home,"Homer, I bought you the damn chair."
8278,59,285,1286000,HERB,Simpson Home,That's enough already. Get outta here!
