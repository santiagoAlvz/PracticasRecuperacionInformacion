60569,246,2,84000,Announcer,Simpson Living Room,"""The Cyborganizer."" A high-tech robocop created for one purpose only... to help the NYPD tackle its tedious paperwork."
60570,246,3,92000,Police Captain,Simpson Living Room,"Good work, Cyborganizer."
60571,246,4,94000,Cyborganizer,Simpson Living Room,"I can streamline any procedure, except this thing you call ""love."""
60572,246,5,94000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Poor Cyborganizer
60573,246,6,101000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Homer, sitting that close to the TV can't be good for you."
60574,246,7,104000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Talking while the TV's on can't be good for you.
60575,246,8,107000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,You should get your eyes checked. I'm taking Bart to the mall to buy camping supplies -- why don't you come along?
60576,246,9,113000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Nah. I want to enjoy this show before the network retools it.
60577,246,10,117000,Cyborganizer,Simpson Living Room,How can I organize this modeling agency and still be a good single father?
60578,246,11,123000,Robobaby,Simpson Living Room,"I love you, Daddy."
60579,246,12,124000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Too late.
60582,246,15,129000,Marge Simpson,Eye Caramba,We need something quick. My husband's eyes are really shot.
60583,246,16,133000,Homer Simpson,Eye Caramba,"Whee! Touch the sky, Maggie! Whee! Touch the sky!"
60584,246,17,137000,Lisa Simpson,Eye Caramba,"Dad, I've got Maggie."
60585,246,18,138000,Homer Simpson,Eye Caramba,Who said that?
60586,246,19,141000,Marge Simpson,Eye Caramba,"Come on, Bart. While your dad gets his glasses, we'll go shop for your trip."
60587,246,20,145000,Bart Simpson,Eye Caramba,"I hate shopping. Just get me a deck of cards, and I'll win whatever I need from the other kids."
60588,246,21,151000,Marge Simpson,Eye Caramba,"But you need to try things on! Every brand has a different idea of ""Husky."""
60589,246,22,154000,Bart Simpson,Eye Caramba,"I'm in tantrum position. T-minus five... four... three... remembering dead cat for real tears, and..."
60590,246,23,162000,Marge Simpson,Eye Caramba,"Fine, you win. I'll do your shopping for you."
60591,246,24,166000,Bart Simpson,Eye Caramba,Tantrum averted. But now I can't forget the cat.
60593,246,26,170000,Optometrist,"""eye Caramba"" Examination Room","Okay, let's get started."
60594,246,27,174000,Optometrist,"""eye Caramba"" Examination Room","Hey, wake up."

60606,246,39,193000,Bart Simpson,"""eye Caramba"" Examination Room",Dad!
60608,246,41,195000,Optometrist,Eyewear Store,That pair is popular with celebrities like Val Kilmer...
60609,246,42,198000,Homer Simpson,Eyewear Store,"Oo, my favorite Door."
60610,246,43,199000,Optometrist,Eyewear Store,And Yoko Ono...
60611,246,44,201000,Homer Simpson,Eyewear Store,Ew. She ruined the Plastic Ono Band.
60612,246,45,204000,Optometrist,Eyewear Store,Maybe you're a candidate for laser eye surgery.
60613,246,46,206000,Homer Simpson,Eyewear Store,Would it get me out of having to choose glasses?
60614,246,47,208000,Optometrist,Eyewear Store,"Well yes, but I must warn you, it's an experimental procedure and we still don't know the long-term effects..."
60615,246,48,213000,Homer Simpson,Eyewear Store,"Less yappin', more zappin'."
60617,246,50,214000,Marge Simpson,"""tommy Hillclimber"" Camping Store","Well, looks like we got everything for Bart's camping trip: Blair Witch Repellent, antler saw and Deep Woods Scrabble."
60618,246,51,221000,Marge Simpson,"""tommy Hillclimber"" Camping Store","Ooh, ""Tango de la Muerte."" I've been dying to see that movie!"
60619,246,52,227000,Lisa Simpson,"""tommy Hillclimber"" Camping Store",It got rave reviews from both the Entertainment Radio Network and the Radio Entertainment Network. Let's go!
60622,246,54,236000,Optometrist,Eyewear Store,Wait! You've gotta use these drops. They prevent your eyes from crusting over.
60623,246,55,240000,Homer Simpson,Eyewear Store,"Oh, here we go with the add ons. No thanks."
60626,246,58,249000,Eduardo,Ballroom,"Now that my severed foot has been reattached, I must win back the coveted dance title: Loco Legs!"
60627,246,59,254000,Dance Coach,Ballroom,"As your wise but alcoholic dance coach, I know that somewhere, your father is looking down on you and smiling. Oh, there he is."
60628,246,60,264000,Eduardo,Ballroom,"And now, I must choose a beautiful partner for the big dance contest."
60629,246,61,274000,Eduardo,Ballroom,No.
60630,246,62,278000,Lisa Simpson,Ballroom,"Oh, he'll never dance with her. She'll have to settle for some Mexican Milhouse."
60631,246,63,282000,Eduardo,Ballroom,I demand to know your name.
60632,246,64,283000,PLAIN JANE,Ballroom,My name is... Lisabella.
60633,246,65,285000,Lisa Simpson,Ballroom,"That's my name with bella on the end of it. Ask her, oh God, please ask her to dance."
60634,246,66,290000,Eduardo,Ballroom,I shall dance with her.
60635,246,67,294000,Latin Milhouse,Ballroom,"Que malo! Once again, I must sugar my own churro."
60636,246,68,299000,LISABELLA,Ballroom,But I am just a simple librarian. I have only read about dancing in books.
60637,246,69,305000,Eduardo,Ballroom,I will show you something that is in no book.
60638,246,70,316000,Lisa Simpson,Ballroom,"She's not plain, she's beautiful!"
60639,246,71,328000,Eduardo,Ballroom,There is just one dance that will beat them: the Tango de la Muerte.
60640,246,72,333000,LISABELLA,Ballroom,"Only one man was crazy enough to dance that dance, and he is dead!"
60641,246,73,336000,Eduardo,Ballroom,"My twin brother, Freduardo. But where he died, I shall live. In his apartment."
60642,246,74,365000,Eduardo,Ballroom,You are now carrying my child.
60643,246,75,367000,LISABELLA,Ballroom,But how?
60644,246,76,368000,Eduardo,Ballroom,It is the mystery of the dance.
60646,246,78,375000,Lisa Simpson,Movie Theater,"Oh, Mom. I want to be a dancer!"
60647,246,79,377000,Marge Simpson,Movie Theater,"That's wonderful, honey. We should ask your father, though. Where is he, anyway?"
60649,246,81,383000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Homer's Car,"Now Homie, when we get to the liquor store, buy me some Jack Daniels and a carton of smokes."
60650,246,82,389000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Yes, dear."
60653,246,84,399000,Marge Simpson,Dance Studio,I remember Little Vicki Valentine! Her perky smile and dancing brought America right out of the depression.
60654,246,85,407000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,"Well, I think World War II helped a little, Mom."
60655,246,86,409000,Marge Simpson,Dance Studio,"Don't smart mouth, Lisa."
60656,246,87,411000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,A great big sunshine hello to you!
60657,246,88,414000,Marge Simpson,Dance Studio,"Hi, Little Vicki."
60658,246,89,416000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Oh, that was such a long time ago. I'm just plain Vicki now."
60659,246,90,419000,Marge Simpson,Dance Studio,"All right. I'd like to sign my daughter up for lessons, Vicki."
60660,246,91,423000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,Little Vicki.
60661,246,92,423000,Marge Simpson,Dance Studio,But you just said that...
60662,246,93,425000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"So, what dance style were you interested in? We have ever so many. There's ballroom..."
60663,246,94,431000,Agnes Skinner,Dance Studio,Ow! You stepped on my toes again!
60664,246,95,434000,Seymour Skinner,Dance Studio,If you would just let me lead...
60665,246,96,436000,Agnes Skinner,Dance Studio,"You're not a leader, Seymour. Never have been. Never will be."
60666,246,97,441000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,There's square dancing...
60667,246,98,442000,Texan Man,Dance Studio,"Put the birdie in the cage, odd lady in the center / Now the birdie is purdy / and the crows hop in / Pluck the feather all together / Hell bent for leather / Put your honey in the saddle...!"
60668,246,99,449000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Or, there's the dance that made me famous: tap."
60669,246,100,455000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,"But I want to learn a dance I can use in real life, like the Tango de la Muerte."
60670,246,101,459000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Aw, bless your heart. Let's get you some tap shoes."
60671,246,102,462000,Marge Simpson,Dance Studio,"Ah, Little Vicki, I really think she had her heart set on..."
60672,246,103,465000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,Little advice: don't live through your child.
60673,246,104,467000,Marge Simpson,Dance Studio,Okay.
60676,246,107,473000,Milhouse Van Houten,School Bus,"Camp is gonna be great! Seven days without parents, homework or ear medicine."
60677,246,108,478000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Yes sir, this is gonna be the best week of our young lives."
60678,246,109,482000,Nelson Muntz,School Bus,I'm gonna pound you two all week.
60679,246,110,484000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,What'd we do?
60680,246,111,486000,Nelson Muntz,School Bus,Nothin'. But I gotta pound somebody.
60682,246,113,492000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw haw.
60683,246,114,492000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Now where do we go?
60684,246,115,493000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"I don't wanna go home. My grandma's sleeping in my bed, and she has skin like a basketball."
60685,246,116,499000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Wait a minute. Everybody thinks we're at camp this week. We can stay wherever we want.
60686,246,117,504000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, like the Four Seasons. Each room has its own safe!"
60687,246,118,509000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I've got a better place.
60688,246,119,511000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,The mall?
60689,246,120,513000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Yeah. It's just like my dad always says...
60690,246,121,514000,Thought Bubble Homer,Springfield Elementary School,"For an evening or a week, there's no place like the mall. Food, fun and fashion -- the mall has it all!"
60691,246,122,522000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,What? What did he say?
60693,246,124,529000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Now, the key to great dancing is one word: Tap-a-tap-a-tap-a."
60694,246,125,533000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,Tap-a-tap-a-tap-a...
60695,246,126,537000,Ralph Wiggum,Dance Studio,"Teacher, my shoes are making noise."
60696,246,127,539000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,You must be Ralph.
60697,246,128,541000,Ralph Wiggum,Dance Studio,My daddy shoots people!
60699,246,130,548000,Little Vicki,Dance Class,"Good... Good... Wait a minute, somebody's off the beat."
60700,246,131,553000,Little Vicki,Dance Class,Let me hear you two.
60701,246,132,556000,Little Vicki,Dance Class,Okay. Now you.
60702,246,133,561000,Little Vicki,Dance Class,"Children, stop it! For all you know, she has a medical condition."
60703,246,134,565000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Class,Nope.
60704,246,135,566000,Little Vicki,Dance Class,I see.
60706,246,137,571000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"This is way better than camp. No mosquitoes, no stupid camp songs..."
60707,246,138,575000,Voice,Springfield Mall,"IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT, SHOP AT STAN'S."
60708,246,139,578000,ORGAN SALESMAN,Springfield Mall,GIANT DISCOUNTS ON YOUR FAVORITE MAJOR BRANDS...
60709,246,140,581000,Mall Announcer,Springfield Mall,"Attention shoppers, the mall is now closed."
60710,246,141,587000,Security Guard,Springfield Mall,"Okay, folks. You heard the recording. Clear out."
60711,246,142,592000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Quick. Up here.
60712,246,143,596000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Mall,Where are we going?
60713,246,144,597000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Quiet. Just keep scurrying.
60714,246,145,599000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Mall,Worms!
60715,246,146,603000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Gold! Wait, this is just chocolate. Chocolate!"
60716,246,147,608000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Mall,And these are Gummy Worms! Gummy!
60652,246,148,611000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,War Heads? Jelly Bellies? We're like two kids in a candy store!
60717,246,149,615000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Mall,Yes!
60556,246,150,620000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Flavor's gone.
60718,246,151,623000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Flavor's gone.
60719,246,152,624000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Mall,Shoe fight!
60720,246,153,628000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Ow! No golf shoes!
60721,246,154,629000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Ready, Milhouse?"
60722,246,155,631000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Mall,Gimme a sec...
60723,246,156,648000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Mall,Whoa!
60724,246,157,649000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,We're lumberjacks!
60725,246,158,651000,Mall Manager,Springfield Mall,"Oh, my God!"
60726,246,159,653000,Mall Manager,Springfield Mall,Look at this place. How could this happen?
60727,246,160,655000,Mall Manager,Springfield Mall,"Candy chewed, wigs pulled from stands, cheese packages poked and repoked..."
60728,246,161,665000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,Every sign points to one obvious culprit... A giant rat.
60729,246,162,668000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,You'll have to shut down the mall.
60730,246,163,669000,Mall Manager,Springfield Mall,On Presidents' Day weekend? Are you crazy?
60731,246,164,672000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,"Crazy with concern for the public, yes. Now shut this place down before the old folks come in for their morning walk."
60732,246,165,681000,Old Folks,Springfield Mall,Open!
60734,246,167,683000,Little Vicki,Dance Class,Tap-a-tap-a-tap-a. Tap-a-tap-a-tap-a...
60735,246,168,686000,Ralph Wiggum,Dance Class,Ow!
60736,246,169,688000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Class,Sorry. The floor's kind of at an angle here. I'm gonna move over there.
60737,246,170,693000,Little Vicki,Dance Class,"Okay, from tap-a-tap-a-tap-a."
60739,246,172,700000,Ralph Wiggum,Dance Class,Lisa's bad dancing makes my feet sad.
60740,246,173,702000,Little Vicki,Dance Class,Let's take five.
60741,246,174,705000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Class,"What am I doing wrong, Little Vicki?"
60742,246,175,706000,Little Vicki,Dance Class,"Well, you're falling a lot... Maybe you should work on that."
60743,246,176,710000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Class,"Yeah, well, no offense, but maybe I need a little more instruction than just tap-a-tap-a-tap-a."
60744,246,177,714000,Little Vicki,Dance Class,"Why, back when I was your age, I had 43 movies under my belt and I had to do it without tap-a-tap-a-tap-a. I would have killed for tap-a-tap-a-tap-a."
60745,246,178,723000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Class,Sorry. I'm just frustrated.
60746,246,179,725000,Little Vicki,Dance Class,"Well, you'll never save grandpa's farm with that attitude. You've just got to turn that frown upside down."
60747,246,180,731000,Little Vicki,Dance Class,"That's a smile, not an upside-down-frown! Work on that, too."
60752,246,183,736000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, we got a postcard from Bart. ""Dear Mom and Homer. I'm having fun."" Aw, sounds like he's having fun."
60753,246,184,743000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why does it have a picture of Vitamin Barn?
60754,246,185,746000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Didn't you ever go to camp? The ol' Vitamin Barn...
60755,246,186,750000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,There's our Broadway Baby!
60756,246,187,754000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, dig that crazy rhythm."
60757,246,188,756000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm just walking. Listen, I know I said I wanted to be a dancer, but..."
60758,246,189,761000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And you will be a dancer.
60759,246,190,763000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look at you, all sugar and spice instead of equations and test tubes."
60760,246,191,767000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're Daddy's precious dancing queen!
60761,246,192,771000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And you look adorable.
60762,246,193,774000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now honey, what were you trying to say before we kept interrupting you with our loving proudness?"
60763,246,194,778000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, our tiny tapper. What was it you were going to say after ""I wanted to be a dancer, but..."""
60764,246,195,783000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But I just... need more practice. See ya!
60765,246,196,792000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh! What's that awful sound?
60766,246,197,794000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The furnace?
60767,246,198,795000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's me!
60768,246,199,796000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Awww...
60769,246,200,802000,Bojangles,Simpson Home,"Why is you so down, Little Miss Vicki?"
60770,246,201,804000,Little Vicki,Simpson Home,My kitty cat's sick and I'd be ever so sad if she should die.
60772,246,203,810000,Bojangles,Simpson Home,"Ooh, well, I'm no animal doctah or nothin', but whenever I'm feelin' poorly, you know what fixes me up? Dancin'!"
60773,246,204,817000,Little Vicki,Simpson Home,Dancin'?
60774,246,205,818000,Bojangles,Simpson Home,Dancin'!
60775,246,206,822000,Little Vicki,Simpson Home,But I don't know how to dance.
60776,246,207,824000,Bojangles,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'll show ya how."
60777,246,208,837000,Bojangles,Simpson Home,There. Now you're gettin' it!
60778,246,209,839000,Little Vicki,Simpson Home,"Look at me, Powder Puff. I'm dancin'!"
60779,246,210,851000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The cat dances better than I do.
60781,246,212,853000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,We'll catch that mall rat.
60782,246,213,856000,Lou,Springfield Mall,Sure hope this ACME kit works.
60783,246,214,858000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,"Gosh, that cheese looks good. Think I could grab it before that anvil hits?"
60784,246,215,862000,Lou,Springfield Mall,"Uh, I dunno, Chief. It's a million to one."
60750,246,216,863000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,I like those odds.
60786,246,217,870000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,My mistake was grabbing the cheese.
60789,246,220,878000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Professor Frink, will that spaceship be ready for the recital?"
60790,246,221,882000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Dance Studio,"I have visited the future, and yes it will."
60791,246,222,885000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Okay, kids, tonight's the big night. Now remember, the important thing is to just dance flawlessly."
60792,246,223,892000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,Excuse me...
60793,246,224,893000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,Why isn't my name in the program?
60794,246,225,895000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"It is, silly. You've got the most important part of all."
60795,246,226,898000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,Curtain puller?!
60796,246,227,899000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,No one can see the show if the curtain isn't open!
60797,246,228,902000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,But my parents are counting on seeing me dance! And I've worked ever so hard.
60798,246,229,907000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"I'm sorry, Lisa. But giving everyone an equal part when they're clearly not equal, is called what again, class?"
60799,246,230,913000,Children,Dance Studio,Communism.
60800,246,231,914000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,That's right. And I didn't tap all those Morse code messages to the allies 'til my shoes filled with blood just to roll out the welcome mat for the Reds.
60801,246,232,921000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,"All right, I'll be the stupid curtain puller."
60802,246,233,928000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,Smoothly. Pull-a-pull-a-pull-a...
60803,246,234,932000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,I get your pull-a-pull-a-pull-a...
60804,246,235,932000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Dance Studio,"Excuse me, Lisa, but I couldn't help but overhear your nerdly predicament. Maybe I can be of assistance with the dancing and the twisting and the kung fu fiiigh-ting."
60806,246,237,947000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,I first observed this technology at the airport gift shop.
60807,246,238,951000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"As you see, it responds to any percussive sound with an exuberant shaking of its groove thing. Yeah, yeah."
60808,246,239,957000,Lisa Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Most entertaining, but how does that help me?"
60809,246,240,959000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Observe.
60810,246,241,967000,Lisa Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Ohhhhhh. That's brilliant, Professor! What will you think of next?"
60811,246,242,973000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Well, I also found this at the gift shop."
60812,246,243,975000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Isn't it cute?
60814,246,244,976000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,I'm hoping to turn it into a weapon. Kill ya.
60815,246,245,982000,Lisa Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,I've gotta go now.
60817,246,247,985000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,"Okay, Mister Rat... We've got a little playmate for you."
60818,246,248,992000,Lou,Springfield Mall,"Should I get the backup lion, Chief?"
60819,246,249,992000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,Would you?
60820,246,250,999000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Can you see the lion anywhere?
60822,246,252,1003000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Well, do you see him or not?"
60823,246,253,1009000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Are you saying he's right on the other side of that plant?
60825,246,255,1013000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Okay. Run!!!
60828,246,258,1019000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,This way!
60832,246,262,1037000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Mall,"Bart, you're a genius!"
60834,246,264,1042000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"You okay, Milhouse?"
60835,246,265,1044000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Mall,Nothing that a handful of gummy bears can't fix.
60836,246,266,1050000,Lou,Springfield Mall,"Well, well, looks like the cat got the rat."
60837,246,267,1054000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,"And that's the end of that ""tail."""
60838,246,268,1057000,Eddie,Springfield Mall,"Uh, Chief? Should we try and get the mountain lion back in its crate?"
60839,246,269,1060000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,I repeat...
60841,246,271,1064000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Okay, everyone. We need big smiles out there, so line up for dimpling."
60842,246,272,1068000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Now this may hurt a lot. What am I saying, ""may""?"
60843,246,273,1072000,Sherri Mackleberry,Dance Studio,Ow!
60844,246,274,1073000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Now, that's a happy face."
60845,246,275,1076000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,"Little Vicki, I figured out how to dance. I can be in the show now!"
60846,246,276,1079000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"I'm sorry, Lisa. People go to a children's dance recital expecting a certain level of professionalism."
60847,246,277,1085000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,"But, but you don't understand..."
60849,246,279,1089000,Ralph Wiggum,Dance Studio,I ate too much plastic candy.
60851,246,280,1091000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Heavens to Betsy, the star of the show is sick! Whatever will we do? There's only one person who can get us out of this pickle. Lisa?"
60852,246,281,1099000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,Yes?!
60853,246,282,1100000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,Help me into Ralph's costume.
60855,246,284,1103000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Showtime, children! Let's go."
60856,246,285,1106000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Okay, curtain puller, this is your moment to shine. Oh, it's too important. I'll do it for you."
60857,246,286,1116000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Lean, muscular children of Mars, we bring you candy."
60859,246,288,1123000,JANEY,Dance Studio,Let's walk over to them.
60860,246,289,1125000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,"Why walk, when you can dance?"
60861,246,290,1134000,Marge Simpson,Dance Studio,Where's Lisa?
60862,246,291,1135000,Homer Simpson,Dance Studio,Shh! This plot is hard enough to follow as it is.
60863,246,292,1139000,Kids,Dance Studio,ON THE SPACESHIP LOLLIPOP / GINGERBREAD MEN LIKE TO DO HIP HOP.
60864,246,293,1145000,Kids,Dance Studio,AND CHOCOLATE CHIPS / MAKE A ROCKIN' FUEL FOR ROCKET SHIPS / WE JUST LOVE TO DANCE ON MARS / WHERE EVERYTHING'S MADE FROM CANDY BARS.
60865,246,294,1156000,Marge Simpson,Dance Studio,"There she is! Hi, honey! Wow, look at her go."
60866,246,295,1160000,Homer Simpson,Dance Studio,"Yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off!"
60868,246,297,1171000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,What are you doing?
60869,246,298,1172000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,I can't help it! It's the shoes!
60870,246,299,1174000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,Nobody upstages Little Vicki!
60871,246,300,1184000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,"Oh, please stop!"
60872,246,301,1186000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,I'm just getting started!
60875,246,304,1197000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,Stop clapping!
60876,246,305,1203000,Homer Simpson,Dance Studio,"Go, Lisa! C'mon, everybody, give it up for my little girl!"
60877,246,306,1212000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Dance Studio,Stop with the clapping! You'll kill us all!
60878,246,307,1220000,Marge Simpson,Dance Studio,"Lisa's gone berserk! Do something, Homer! Do something!"
60879,246,308,1227000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,"Oh, thanks, Dad."
60880,246,309,1228000,Homer Simpson,Dance Studio,"I didn't think, I just acted."
60881,246,310,1232000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,Self-tapping shoes?! I'm ever so pissed!
60882,246,311,1234000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,"I'm sorry, Vicki. I just wanted to be a dancer so badly."
60883,246,312,1239000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,I understand. We all do crazy things when we're desperate. I once destroyed Buddy Ebsen's credit rating.
60785,246,313,1245000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,Why?
60813,246,314,1246000,Little Vicki,Dance Studio,He knows why.
60850,246,315,1248000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Dance Studio,"Jesus, Mary and glayvin! These shoes are in the ""Off"" position."
60884,246,316,1251000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,You mean I danced all by myself?
60885,246,317,1253000,Marge Simpson,Dance Studio,"See, honey? All you needed was to believe in..."
60886,246,318,1256000,Homer Simpson,Dance Studio,"What are you talking about, Professor Frink? They're clearly in the ""On"" position. See? ""On."""
60887,246,319,1258000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Dance Studio,"I was merely trying to spare the girl's feelings, you insensitive clod."
60888,246,320,1265000,Homer Simpson,Dance Studio,"Oh. Ohhhhh. Well, now that I look even closer..."
60889,246,321,1269000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,"Forget it, Dad. I guess I'm never gonna be your Broadway Baby."
60890,246,322,1274000,Homer Simpson,Dance Studio,"That's not true, honey. You can always write a depressing Broadway play of some kind."
60891,246,323,1278000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,You think so?
60892,246,324,1279000,Marge Simpson,Dance Studio,Sure. It could be a story about people coming to terms with things.
60893,246,325,1283000,Homer Simpson,Dance Studio,"Hey, yeah. You could load it up with lots of swears. That's what David Mamet does."
60894,246,326,1288000,Lisa Simpson,Dance Studio,"Oh, I love you guys."
60895,246,327,1290000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Dance Studio,Uh-oh. It's out of its matrix. Nobody move.
60896,246,328,1293000,Homer Simpson,Dance Studio,"Why? It's just a cute little weasel. Hello there, Mister weasel."
60897,246,329,1301000,Homer Simpson,Dance Studio,I'm down.
