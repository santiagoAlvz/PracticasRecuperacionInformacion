102837,396,104,535000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Bart, come with me. I'll take you to someone who will make you feel better."
102838,396,105,539000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Is it my rabbit Cottontail? The one who went to live upstate?
102839,396,106,543000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"He died, Bart. Dad buried him in the back yard. But not in that order."
102843,396,110,556000,Lisa Simpson,Hotel Ballroom,"Bart, meet Joe LaBoot."
102844,396,111,558000,Bart Simpson,Hotel Ballroom,"LaBoot, LaBoot. Sounds familiar."
102845,396,112,562000,Joe Laboot,Hotel Ballroom,"Well, you probably remember me from the nineteen forty-three World Series. With the score tied in game seven, Tommy Heinrich of the Yankees hit a ball in my direction."
102846,396,113,572000,Joe Laboot,Hotel Ballroom,"Jugglin' Joe LaBoot they called me. When I finally picked up the ball, I threw it into the stands...hitting Eleanor Roosevelt, who up till then had been a great beauty."
102847,396,114,581000,Joe Laboot,Hotel Ballroom,We lost the game and the series. But I bounced back -- got my own car dealership. I have seventeen grandchildren and a big home in Idaho. It's a great life!

102849,396,116,594000,Joe Laboot,Hotel Ballroom,"And at these card shows, the fans let me know that I've put my gaffe behind me."
102850,396,117,598000,Grampa Simpson,Hotel Ballroom,"You stink, LaBoot!"
102851,396,118,600000,Joe Laboot,Hotel Ballroom,"No I don't! Google my stats! Take it from me, kid -- you'll be just fine!"

102854,396,121,610000,Joe Laboot,Hotel Ballroom,The kid who dropped that easy fly ball?! You stink like a Dutchman's throw-up. Talking to you was the biggest error of my life!
102855,396,122,620000,Joe Laboot,Hotel Ballroom,"Boo. Boo, indeed."
102857,396,124,629000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The Lovejoys?! If this is about me drinking that holy water, let me tell you I had had like a million Doritos -- you know, the ones with the flame on the bag? Oh-ho, that bag ain't lyin'!"
102858,396,125,639000,Helen Lovejoy,Simpson Home,We're here about the mattress.
102859,396,126,641000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What's wrong with it?
102860,396,127,643000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,We tried raising Cain but we weren't able.
102861,396,128,646000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I think I know what you're doing wrong. Have you tried..."
102862,396,129,653000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"I know the mechanics of lovemaking, Homer! You owe us a refund!"
102863,396,130,657000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll write you a check.
102865,396,132,660000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Pay to the order of... Stupid Reverend... memo: bite my ass ... Wha?!
102866,396,133,673000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Homer, I'm not a man who believes in miracles, but this bed of yours could resurrect our sex life!"
102867,396,134,679000,Helen Lovejoy,Simpson Master Bedroom,"If you let us have your mattress, we'll give you ours."
102868,396,135,682000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,On one condition: you do the shlepping.
102869,396,136,685000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Well, I'll have to check with my wife."
102871,396,138,704000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Move over just a...
102872,396,139,705000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, maybe if you go..."
102873,396,140,707000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wrong, wrong, wrong!"
102875,396,142,709000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"I'm sorry, Homie -- I want to snuggle, but I'm just not feeling it."
102876,396,143,714000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Yeah... something has changed, but I can't figure out what. Our mattress! I traded it to the Lovejoys!"
102877,396,144,723000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,You traded our mattress? I had my secret cash in it!
102733,396,145,726000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Oh, that's long gone, baby. Long gone."
102878,396,146,731000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"It was made for Elvis, but he found it tacky."
102879,396,147,734000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,I can't believe a mattress could make that much difference...
102881,396,149,739000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"THIS LITTLE LIGHT OF MINE, I'M GONNA LET IT SHINE"
102882,396,150,741000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"OH GLORY / THIS LITTLE LIGHT OF MINE, I'M GONNA LET IT SHINE."

102884,396,152,756000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Lousy Reverend. He's having my sex! While I'm at home with Marge not doing anything sexual or erotic.
102890,396,158,785000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"A damp sponge will take care of this weak, water-based... it's oil-based! Oil-based!"
102891,396,159,791000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,Daddy?
102892,396,160,793000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Fetch Daddy's thinner, boy."
102893,396,161,795000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,"But it's in the ""stay away"" closet!"
102894,396,162,796000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,You just fetch it!
102897,396,165,808000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Who would do this to Bart?
102898,396,166,811000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The person who hates Bart more than anyone else. Look!
102899,396,167,817000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, yeah, that's really something."
102900,396,168,819000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, put your glasses on."
102901,396,169,821000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But they make me look dowdy...
102902,396,170,826000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My baby!
102903,396,171,833000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,See? I hate me too! Now we can be friends again!
102904,396,172,838000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, stop! No one's mad at you anymore! Right?"
102906,396,174,843000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Jump! Who said that?
102907,396,175,846000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I hate Bart Simpson!
102908,396,176,849000,Joe Laboot,Simpson Home,I got him! I got him!
102909,396,177,851000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,You stink LaBoot!
102910,396,178,853000,Joe Laboot,Simpson Home,Dammit!
102912,396,180,859000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,He'll be all right. Right now he just needs peace and quiet.
102913,396,181,863000,Crowd,Hospital Room,Bart sucks! Bart sucks! Bart sucks! Bart sucks!
102914,396,184,868000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,You should all be ashamed! Passing judgment on a child for a sports boo-boo! What have you people ever done?
102915,396,185,876000,Lenny Leonard,Hospital,"Well, I wrote a best-selling series of mystery novels."
102916,396,186,880000,Lenny Leonard,Hospital,"Stephen King called it ""scary good fun."""
102917,396,187,880000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,Besides that!
102918,396,188,884000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,"Now, thanks to you, my special little guy will be haunted by this for the rest of his life."
102919,396,189,891000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,I always thought that was just a slogan to attract small businesses. But now I know it's the truth.
102921,396,191,901000,Moe Szyslak,Hospital,"Okay, Midge. You made us feel bad about what we done to your boy. But what can we do about it now? It's not like we can play the game over again."
102922,396,192,909000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,Can't we?
102923,396,193,911000,Moe Szyslak,Hospital,"Like I just said, we can't."
102924,396,194,912000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,Are you sure?
102925,396,195,914000,Moe Szyslak,Hospital,Open your freakin' ears -- no!
102926,396,196,915000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,I think maybe we cou-ould.
102927,396,197,918000,Moe Szyslak,Hospital,And I say I have difficulty envi-sioning it.
102929,396,199,921000,Shelbyville Manager,Baseball Field,"Let me get this straight -- you want our boys to play a fake rematch against Springfield, so your son can make the catch he missed, and feel better about himself."
102930,396,200,931000,Marge Simpson,Baseball Field,Exactly.
102931,396,201,932000,Shelbyville Manager,Baseball Field,"I guess I could, if you pretend to be my fiancé when my mother comes to visit."
102932,396,202,937000,Marge Simpson,Baseball Field,Okay. If you pretend to be our chauffeur at my high school reunion.
102933,396,203,940000,Shelbyville Manager,Baseball Field,"Fine, fine -- if you pretend to be a ghost at an old amusement park I'm trying to buy."
102934,396,204,944000,Marge Simpson,Baseball Field,We should stop now.
102935,396,205,944000,Shelbyville Manager,Baseball Field,Yeah.
102937,396,207,946000,Baseball Announcer,Announcer's Booth,"You want me to re-announce a game I've already called? Oh, sister, I've got too much integrity. The same integrity Farmer Dan puts into every link sausage."
102938,396,208,956000,Lisa Simpson,Announcer's Booth,Then I guess you wouldn't mind eating one.
102939,396,209,960000,Baseball Announcer,Announcer's Booth,Of course I wouldn't. It's not like they're made of skunk tails and horse nipples...
102940,396,210,966000,Baseball Announcer,Announcer's Booth,I'll do whatever you say! Get that death wiener away from me!
