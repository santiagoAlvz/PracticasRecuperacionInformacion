69241,274,1,84000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Putting away groceries -- it's like unwrapping presents from yourself. Fruit roll-ups for Bart... beer roll-ups for Homer...
69242,274,2,91000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Burly?! I bought the wrong brand, Maggie!"
69243,274,3,97000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll just take them right back to the store and-- Whoa.
69244,274,4,102000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Look at those massive plaid shoulders.
69245,274,5,108000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Look at that absorbativity! I've gotta tell someone...
69246,274,6,114000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I came home as quick as I could. What's going on?
69247,274,7,117000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Watch what happens when I spill this blue liquid.
69248,274,8,124000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You pulled me out of school for this?!
69249,274,9,126000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Absolutely. You're about to get a lesson... in value!
69250,274,10,132000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And Burly's still got soaking power. Spill something else.
69251,274,11,136000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I believe you."
69252,274,12,137000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Spill it...
69253,274,13,143000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, Burly, you're insatiable."
69254,274,14,149000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Burly. You're so rugged and manly...
69255,274,15,154000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, a bee almost stung me today. I felt the wind go right by my ear."
69256,274,16,160000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, it's okay, Homie. The bee's all gone."
69257,274,17,165000,Burly,Simpson Home,"Fantasize, Marge. Fantasize about Burly."
69258,274,18,173000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, that's quite a hug, honey..."
69259,274,19,173000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, you're looking at that spokes-jack! Well I can fantasize too."
69260,274,20,180000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, Mama Celeste."
69261,274,21,183000,Mama Celeste,Simpson Home,You touch-a me and I cut you.
69262,274,22,188000,Paul Newman,Simpson Home,"Homer, I'll tell you what I told Redford -- it ain't gonna happen."
69264,274,24,191000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Dear Burly, comma, I've never written to a registered trademark before. Are you a real person, or just a composite, question mark? In either case, I would love a signed photo. Sincerely, Marge Simpson."""
69204,274,25,212000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmm...
69265,274,26,216000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Love""? ""Signed photo""?! Marge hasn't asked me for a signed photo in months! Well I'll show her!"

69270,274,31,235000,Homer Simpson,FLANDERS' LIVING ROOM,"Hello. This is Chad Sexington, the model for Burly Paper Towels."
69271,274,32,240000,Marge Simpson,FLANDERS' LIVING ROOM,How did you get my number?
69272,274,33,242000,Homer Simpson,FLANDERS' LIVING ROOM,I don't know. But I was quite moved by your letter. I'd love to meet you and your family. Shall we say dinner?
69273,274,34,250000,Marge Simpson,FLANDERS' LIVING ROOM,"Oh, my goodness..."
69274,274,35,252000,Homer Simpson,FLANDERS' LIVING ROOM,Perfect. I'll be there at seven.
69275,274,36,255000,Marge Simpson,FLANDERS' LIVING ROOM,Oh my God! Dinner with Burly!
69277,274,38,264000,Ned Flanders,FLANDERS'S LIVING ROOM,"Playing a prankeroo, eh?"
69278,274,39,265000,Homer Simpson,FLANDERS'S LIVING ROOM,"I was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of Chad Sexington. Do you mind?"
69280,274,41,279000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, how was your day? Did anything unbelievable happen? Phone calls, things of that nature?"
69281,274,42,284000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're not going to believe it. That paper towel lumberjack is coming here! For dinner! Tonight!
69282,274,43,290000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tonight? Well, you better get your hopes up."

69289,274,50,319000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Barney? W-w-where's Chad--
69291,274,52,326000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Congratulations, I feel ridiculous."
69292,274,53,333000,Barney Gumble,Simpson Home,"You mean, I was just a prop in some cruel joke?"
69293,274,54,339000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Now you've done it. You really humiliated Mom.
69294,274,55,342000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It was hard on me, too. I had to wear a suit. Oh, you're right. I've gotta make it up to her."
69295,274,56,350000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I suggest dinner and a show.
69296,274,57,352000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"How about Benihana, where dinner is the show?"
69297,274,58,357000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, huh?"
69298,274,60,363000,Marge Simpson,The Pimento Grove,I guess it was a pretty funny prank. I like the ones where nothing catches on fire.
69299,274,61,368000,Homer Simpson,The Pimento Grove,"Yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings."
69300,274,62,379000,M.C.,The Pimento Grove,"Okay, you've seen our next performer on Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin, and Art Linkletter's ""House Party"". Please welcome Mesmerino, The Hip Hypnotist!"

69302,274,64,396000,Mesmerino,The Pimento Grove,"Let's see, who do we have here?"
69303,274,65,398000,Mesmerino,The Pimento Grove,"Well, what's the matter with you, champ? You couldn't find a date?"
69304,274,66,401000,Professor Jonathan Frink,The Pimento Grove,I didn't come here to be heckled and spoofed and whatnot.
69305,274,67,404000,Mesmerino,The Pimento Grove,"Well, why did you come here, seriously though? When I snap my fingers, my friend, you will be a make-out artist..."
69306,274,68,413000,Professor Jonathan Frink,The Pimento Grove,Glayvin! That's a powerful... Hold it 'cause it's different. I--
69307,274,69,422000,Buddy Love,The Pimento Grove,"Hey, cupcake, listen good. I want you to swallow that gum and meet me in the coatroom in five, four, three, two, now."
69308,274,70,431000,Waitress,The Pimento Grove,"Whatever you say, Professor."
69309,274,71,433000,Mesmerino,The Pimento Grove,"Annnd, back you go."
69310,274,72,435000,Buddy Love,The Pimento Grove,"Ooh! The-- Hey! No, no. Don't make me... I don't wanna go back to the nothin'. I don't... Oh dear, I've re-dork-ulated!"
69311,274,73,447000,Mesmerino,The Pimento Grove,"Hey, smart move, four-eyes. Sittin' next to Skeletor here makes you look like Hercules."
69312,274,74,457000,Homer Simpson,The Pimento Grove,Zing! What's a Skeletor?
69313,274,75,459000,Mesmerino,The Pimento Grove,"No, no, I kid. But seriously, it's very nice to see a young man take his father out for a night of hypnotism... before he dies."
69314,274,76,468000,Waylon Smithers,The Pimento Grove,"Actually, my father died a long time ago."
69315,274,77,472000,Mesmerino,The Pimento Grove,O-kay.
69316,274,78,473000,Mesmerino,The Pimento Grove,Is anyone here not a downer? Anyone?
69317,274,79,477000,Homer Simpson,The Pimento Grove,Do me! Do me!
69318,274,80,481000,Homer Simpson,The Pimento Grove,I am in your power. Boss me around.
69319,274,81,484000,Mesmerino,The Pimento Grove,"When I snap my fingers, you will transform into... a... famous historian."
69320,274,82,492000,Homer Simpson,The Pimento Grove,"Look at me, I'm a famous historian! Out of my way!"
69321,274,83,497000,Mesmerino,The Pimento Grove,Thank you. Now you are... Emily Dickinson.
69322,274,84,501000,Homer Simpson,The Pimento Grove,"Look at me, I'm Angie Dickinson! Out of my way!"
69323,274,85,507000,Mesmerino,The Pimento Grove,"Now, you are a young boy... ah, yourself, at twelve years old..."
69324,274,86,514000,Homer Simpson,The Pimento Grove,I'm twelve years old... I'm with my friends. It's a beautiful summer day at the old swimming hole... Oh my God!
69325,274,87,526000,Marge Simpson,The Pimento Grove,"Do something, Mesmerino!"
69326,274,88,529000,Mesmerino,The Pimento Grove,"Ah, yes, yes. Um..."
69327,274,89,531000,Homer Simpson,The Pimento Grove,"Oh, that's better..."
69328,274,90,540000,Lisa Simpson,The Pimento Grove,"Dad, what's wrong?"
69329,274,91,542000,Marge Simpson,The Pimento Grove,We'd better get him home.
69331,274,93,547000,Homer Simpson,The Pimento Grove,Here you go.
69335,274,97,559000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmmm. And, Bart is set for the week."
69336,274,98,578000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, no..."
69338,274,100,580000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Mrs. S. He was kinda disruptin' things at work."
69339,274,101,584000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"Yeah, he ruined naptime and quiet time."
69340,274,102,587000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homey, you poor thing."
69341,274,103,593000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, cool, he's still mental!"
69342,274,104,595000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, my hunch is he's struggling with some sort of repressed memory."
69343,274,105,599000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How do we un-repress it?
69344,274,106,601000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, the Yaqui Indians brew a special tea that unlocks memories."
69345,274,107,605000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It would be a good excuse to use my Yaqui tea set...
69347,274,109,611000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Well, is anything coming back to you?"
69348,274,110,614000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,Huh?... There have been so many classic Simpson moments. I remember that time I tried to jump over Springfield gorge...
69349,274,111,625000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"No Dad, everyone's sick of that memory!"
69350,274,112,628000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,Try to remember back when you were twelve. Something frightening must have happened.
69351,274,113,632000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Hm, twelve... Well, I remember I used to go hiking a lot with these two guys. With these two guys."
69353,274,115,640000,Homer Simpson,Railroad Tracks,"It was one of those lazy summer days you thought would last forever. And to kill the boredom, we sang."
69356,274,117,654000,Young Lenny,Woods,BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM...

69360,274,123,662000,Lenny Leonard,Woods,GIVE HIM THE LONELY HEART LIKE...
69361,274,124,665000,Young Louie,Woods,"Check it out, Fat Tony. Those jokers think they're the Cowsills."
69362,274,125,670000,Lenny Leonard,Woods,...AND LOTS OF WAVY HAIR LIKE LIBERACE.
69363,274,126,676000,Young Fat Tony,Woods,You guys have blundered into our secret tobacky patch.
69364,274,127,680000,Young Lenny,Woods,Wow. Is that wacky tobacky?
69365,274,128,682000,Young Fat Tony,Woods,The wackiest.
69366,274,129,684000,Young Louie,Woods,Let's punch and kick them!
69367,274,130,688000,Young Moe,Woods,Not so fast.
69368,274,131,692000,Young Legs,Woods,"Uh-oh, he's got a daisy!"
69369,274,132,693000,Young Fat Tony,Woods,"We better scram. Eighteen more pumps, that could break the skin."
148081,274,133,698000,Young Homer,Woods,"Hey thanks, Moe."
69370,274,134,699000,Moe Szyslak,Woods,And that's how a troubled young Moe saved the day.
69372,274,136,702000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"Moe, what are you doin' here?"
69373,274,137,704000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"What am I-- My bar is empty, is what. Why ain't you guys there?"
69374,274,138,707000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We're trying to uncover a hidden trauma in my Dad's childhood.
69375,274,139,711000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"What? You mean that time he wigged out? Well, uh, gimme some of that Indian memory tea, there and I'll tell you all about it."
69376,274,140,719000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Mmm, that's good Yaqui... Okay, that night we camped out under the stars..."
69378,274,142,728000,Young Moe,Field,"Ah, look at all them stars. Buncha lazy lights. Don't do nothin' for nobody."
69379,274,143,734000,Young Carl,Field,Hey you know what I'm lookin' forward to? The future. Have you heard about this internet thing?
69380,274,144,739000,Young Lenny,Field,Internet.
69381,274,145,741000,Young Carl,Field,"Yes, the inner netting they invented to line swim trunks. It provides a comforting snugness."
69382,274,146,748000,Young Moe,Field,"Hey, what was that?"
69383,274,147,750000,Young Lenny,Field,That's that nuclear plant they just opened.
69384,274,148,753000,Young Carl,Field,"Yeah that's your future -- bustin' atoms. Can you imagine us workin' there, the whole Carl Crew?"
69355,274,149,759000,Young Lenny,Field,"Hey, I thought we were called ""Lenny and the Jets""!"
69385,274,150,759000,Young Moe,Field,"Ah, you're both wrong. We're the Moe Syszlak experience, featuring Homer."
69386,274,151,766000,Young Carl,Field,"Ah, I like the sound of that."
148082,274,152,768000,Young Homer,Field,Friends forever?
69387,274,153,768000,Moe Szyslak,Field,Friends forever.
69388,274,154,771000,Moe Szyslak,Field,"Ow! / Ow, that hurts! / Man we're stupid. / I hate you guys."
69390,274,156,774000,Moe Szyslak,ROCK QUARRY,"The next morning, we went out to the old quarry to have a swim..."
69391,274,157,779000,Young Moe,ROCK QUARRY,You guys really gonna dive offa here?
69392,274,158,781000,Young Lenny,ROCK QUARRY,Not me. I'm shakin' like a French soldier.
69393,274,159,784000,Young Carl,ROCK QUARRY,Yeah. I think I just logged onto my internet.
69394,274,160,786000,Young Lenny,ROCK QUARRY,Only a moron would jump into that--
148083,274,161,789000,Young Homer,ROCK QUARRY,Geronimooo -- oh my God!
69396,274,164,799000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"And there's your whatchamacall repressed trauma. I mean, who likes getting muddy? It's terrible. Okay, let's go to Moe's now."
69397,274,165,806000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait a minute. I remember falling in the mud, but I don't think that's why I've been screaming..."
69398,274,166,812000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Fine. Crap all over my theory.
69399,274,167,814000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Something else happened in that quarry... something... else...
148085,274,169,820000,Young Homer,ROCK QUARRY,"Hey, what happened to all the water?"
148051,274,170,825000,Young Homer,ROCK QUARRY,"Hmmm... hey, something's blocking it."
69401,274,171,829000,Homer Simpson,ROCK QUARRY,Hey come on...
69403,274,173,831000,Young Moe,TOP OF QUARRY,"Come on Homer, we're going to Sears to feel the bras."
148086,274,175,835000,Young Homer,BOTTOM OF QUARRY,What the heck is that thing?
69406,274,178,861000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You found a corpse when you were twelve? No wonder you've been so traumatized.
69407,274,179,868000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's responsible for everything wrong in my life -- my occasional overeating, my fear of corpses..."
69408,274,180,881000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"What I wanna know is, what the heck was that body doin' there?"
69409,274,181,884000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe there's murder afoot!
69410,274,182,886000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Murder most foul?
69411,274,183,888000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe.
69412,274,184,889000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, if Dad never told anyone, that body must still be out there."
69413,274,185,894000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,This sounds like a case that only the Simpson family can solve.
69414,274,186,898000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Oh. Okay. Well, we'll just be going, then."
69415,274,187,903000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, hey, you guys can come with us."
69416,274,188,906000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"No, no, no. He said Simpson family. I mean, you know, it sounded exciting, but, uh... you know, we, we don't wanna intrude..."
69417,274,189,912000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Thanks for understanding.
69418,274,190,913000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Oh... Oh, okay. Well, uh, I'll see ya."
69419,274,191,929000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bye, Moe."
69422,274,194,935000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Yep, the old quarry is just a stone's throw away."
69423,274,195,939000,Lisa Simpson,Car,"Stop saying that, Dad."
69424,274,196,941000,Homer Simpson,Car,Never!
69425,274,197,943000,Lisa Simpson,Car,"Hey, there's Mesmerino."
69426,274,198,948000,Mesmerino,Car,Seventeen seventy-six. How much is left in my checking account?
69428,274,200,953000,Homer Simpson,Woods,This is it. This is the old quarry.
69430,274,202,964000,Marge Simpson,QUARRY,Maybe we should come back in the daytime.
69431,274,203,966000,Homer Simpson,QUARRY,Someone's yellow belly is showing.
69432,274,204,969000,Bart Simpson,QUARRY,"Oh, sorry."
69433,274,205,972000,Chief Wiggum,QUARRY,"Aw, geez. Right in the eyes."
69434,274,206,974000,Marge Simpson,QUARRY,Chief Wiggum!
69435,274,207,976000,Chief Wiggum,QUARRY,Who's there? How do you... How do you know my name?!
69436,274,208,978000,Bart Simpson,QUARRY,"It's us, the Simpsons."
69437,274,209,979000,Chief Wiggum,QUARRY,"Oh. I saw your car by the gate and I, well I thought you might be lost hikers. 'Cause then I could rescue you, and-and be a hero, and-and maybe the city would give me a coupon for free guitar lessons ha."
69438,274,210,994000,Chief Wiggum,QUARRY,So what are you doin' here?
69439,274,211,995000,Lisa Simpson,QUARRY,We're investigating a possible murder case.
69440,274,212,998000,Chief Wiggum,QUARRY,"Oh, you mind if I tag along? I'm kind of a crime buff."
69442,274,214,1003000,Chief Wiggum,EDGE OF QUARRY,"If there's a body in here, we'll drag it up."
69443,274,215,1011000,Chief Wiggum,EDGE OF QUARRY,"Ah heck, it's just an old shopping cart."
69444,274,216,1013000,Homer Simpson,EDGE OF QUARRY,And it's empty. Put it back! I don't wanna see it this way.
69446,274,217,1018000,Lisa Simpson,EDGE OF QUARRY,We'll never find the body under all this water.
69447,274,218,1022000,Marge Simpson,EDGE OF QUARRY,"Water, eh?"
69449,274,220,1024000,Marge Simpson,QUARRY,Burly to the rescue!
69450,274,221,1030000,Chief Wiggum,QUARRY,"Oh, that is so cool."
69451,274,222,1036000,Lisa Simpson,QUARRY,"Hey, what's that over there?"
69452,274,223,1041000,Chief Wiggum,QUARRY,"Aw, don't get excited. It's just a skull-shaped rock and a buncha white sticks."
69453,274,224,1046000,Bart Simpson,QUARRY,It's the body!
69454,274,225,1047000,Homer Simpson,QUARRY,And someone has eaten the flesh.
69455,274,226,1051000,Marge Simpson,QUARRY,But whose body is it?
69456,274,227,1053000,Lisa Simpson,QUARRY,And who sent it down that pipe?
69458,274,229,1060000,Homer Simpson,DRAINAGE PIPE,"Now do you believe dead rats float, Lisa?"
69459,274,230,1063000,Lisa Simpson,DRAINAGE PIPE,Yes.
69461,274,232,1067000,Chief Wiggum,DRAINPIPE,"Well, looks like the end of the line."
69462,274,233,1070000,Chief Wiggum,DRAINPIPE,That means our murderer could be on the other side of this hatch.
69464,274,235,1093000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,What are you doing in my corpse-hatch?
69465,274,236,1095000,Chief Wiggum,Burns's Office,"Montgomery Burns, you're under arrest for murder."
69466,274,237,1098000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Did I say corpse-hatch? I meant innocence tube.
69467,274,238,1100000,Bart Simpson,Burns's Office,Then how do you explain this?
69468,274,239,1106000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"I've been expecting this day for thirty years. In a way, it's a relief. But in another way, it's most unwelcome."
69469,274,240,1114000,Chief Wiggum,Burns's Office,"All right, quit stallin', Burns. Who'd you ice?"
69470,274,241,1116000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"I'm afraid that skull belongs to my dear friend... Waylon Smithers, Sr."
69471,274,242,1122000,Lisa Simpson,Burns's Office,Mr. Smithers' father!
69472,274,243,1125000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,But I did not murder him.
69473,274,244,1129000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,And I can prove it...
69474,274,245,1132000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,With this film.
69475,274,246,1134000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Ooh, a movie! I call the couch!"
69477,274,248,1138000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"If you see only one film this year that proves my innocence, make it this one."
69479,274,250,1146000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Why are these numbers so high? Why is that red light flashing?
69481,274,251,1149000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"And what's that alarming sound? Smithers, get in here! Smithers!"
69482,274,252,1154000,"Waylon Smithers, Sr.",Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sorry, Monty. I was feeding Waylon Jr."
69483,274,253,1157000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Will you put that baby down? There's something wrong with the reactor core.
69484,274,254,1165000,"Waylon Smithers, Sr.",Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I better go in and have a look.
69485,274,255,1167000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, Waylon Senior! It could be filled with atoms and steam and other nuclear bric-a-brac."
69486,274,256,1173000,"Waylon Smithers, Sr.",Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"If this reactor blows, the whole town is doomed, including my son."
69487,274,257,1182000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,So... you're a baby huh? How's that working out for you?
69488,274,258,1186000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,He did it!
69489,274,259,1188000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Look at your heroic daddy in there.
69490,274,260,1190000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Making funny faces. Falling to the floor. Shedding his hair. Lying perfectly still...
69491,274,261,1198000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh dear.
69492,274,262,1198000,WAYLON JR.,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Sir...
69493,274,263,1205000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Smithers Sr. gave his life to save the plant. And, since cover-ups were all the rage back then, I shoved his heroic corpse down the sewer pipe. I never told Smithers the truth about his father."
69494,274,264,1217000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Until tonight, sir."
69495,274,265,1220000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Smithers Jr.!
69496,274,266,1222000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ha, busted!"
69497,274,267,1224000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Now the movie's turned into a play! Still good, though."
69498,274,268,1227000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I'm sorry I lied to you, Waylon, but I wanted to spare you the details of your father's gruesome death."
69499,274,269,1232000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, I'm glad to know he died a hero, instead of that other way."
69500,274,270,1236000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I told him his father was killed in the Amazon by a tribe of savage women.
69501,274,271,1241000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I hope it didn't affect you in any way.
69502,274,272,1243000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"We'll never know, sir."
69504,274,274,1248000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well Marge, we solved the case of the haunted quarry."
69505,274,275,1253000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, shouldn't we give that skull to Mr. Smithers?"
69506,274,276,1256000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why? He'd just bury it.
69508,274,277,1257000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Hey, hey, I found a clue that's gonna bust your mystery wide open!"
69509,274,278,1262000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, we already solved it."
69510,274,279,1264000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Oh. Well, you wanna take a look at it anyways, uh just for ha-has?"
69511,274,280,1270000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Seems kinda pointless now.
69512,274,281,1271000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Yeah I guess you're right. It's just that I, you know, went to a lot of trouble, you know makin' the envelope and everything..."
69513,274,282,1277000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Let's see what you have, Moe."
69514,274,283,1280000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Okay, now this first thing is just gonna look like a used Band Aid. And it is. But the rest of this stuff won't make no sense without it. So uh, bear with me."
69515,274,284,1289000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow Moe, you've been doing a lot of sleuthing."
69516,274,285,1293000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Oh yeah, oh yeah, I sleuthed my ass off on this one."
69517,274,286,1296000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Okay, this is a number six from somebody's address. Or is it a nine? You don't know. Uh, this is gravel. Okay? Gravel. This is uh, that's more gravel. Okay, oh. This is a shell, that to me -- this is just me talkin', it looks like a helmet for a mouse... Now, that sounds crazy, right. But if you ask a mice about it, they don't say nothin'. I mean they run the other way. At first I was just fishin' with the helmet thing. But then from the mouse's reaction I got, I got a little more concerned."
69518,274,287,1337000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Did you really make that envelope? 'Cause it says Hammermill over here.
69519,274,288,1343000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Ummm, no."
