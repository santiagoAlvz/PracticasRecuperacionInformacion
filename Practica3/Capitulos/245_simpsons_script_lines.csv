60268,245,1,84000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here's the mail, Dad. That'll be three dollars for on-couch delivery."
60269,245,2,89000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,...And three makes three.
60270,245,3,90000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,This isn't real money. It's printed by the Montana Militia.

60272,245,5,96000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, my first issue of ""Self-Test Monthly."" Finally I get to find out what makes me tick."
60273,245,6,102000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm betting it's hunger and rage.
60274,245,7,104000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but in what ratio?"

60277,245,10,113000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, those are just the names of the quizzes. You're supposed to open the magazine."
60278,245,11,117000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,My way is easier.
60279,245,12,118000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you be the quizmaster and ask other people the questions?
60280,245,13,122000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Quizmaster, yes... That would entertain me briefly."
60282,245,15,125000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Okay, Flanders, your love quiz score is 61. That makes you a ""Frigid Frieda."" I took off thirty points for all that crying you did."

60284,245,17,141000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,No way. When?
60285,245,18,143000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Six months ago. You were at the funeral. You fell into the grave.
60286,245,19,147000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Oh, yeah. I saw a gopher. What a day!"

60301,245,34,216000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've only got three more years to live!
60302,245,35,220000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, maybe you added it wrong. Let me add it..."
60303,245,36,225000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"See?! And these quizzes are never wrong, Marge. They're put together by the finest scientists in the magazine business."
60304,245,37,233000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, honey, don't panic. If you just made a few lifestyle changes..."
60305,245,38,237000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No!

60307,245,40,248000,Charlie Rose,Simpson Home,"We're back with legendary producer Robert Evans. Now before you did ""The Godfather,"" there was ""Love Story."" Tell us about that."
60308,245,41,254000,Robert Evans,Simpson Home,"Ah, Love Story. The little picture that could. Was Paramount chomping at the bit to make it? You'd better believe they weren't. But once that tear-jerker hit John Q. Popcorn, it was boffo boo-hoo box office all the way."
60309,245,42,268000,Charlie Rose,Simpson Home,And the critics loved it too. I remember Vincent Canby said...
60310,245,43,271000,Charlie Rose,Simpson Home,"I'm going to kill you, Homer. You are so dead."
60312,245,45,276000,Charlie Rose,Simpson Home,"Now ""Chinatown"" was a classic. But you had problems with the sequel, ""The Two Jakes""..."
60313,245,46,280000,Robert Evans,Simpson Home,"Oh, boy. Disappointed? I had the blues like Chasen's had chili. I said to myself, ""Evans, you forgot Hollywood rule number one: Kill Homer Simpson."""
60314,245,47,289000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, what's all the screaming?"
60315,245,48,293000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Some of us have grammar school in the morning, you know."
60316,245,49,296000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe you should see a doctor, Homie. A head doctor."
60317,245,50,299000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm not crazy. It's the TV that's crazy. Aren't you, TV?"
60318,245,51,304000,Robert Evans,Simpson Home,"The crisis? Charlie Bluhdorn's birthday. The solution? A snappy banner. Out comes the phone, in flies Bobby Towne. And six drafts later, I had myself a party."
60319,245,52,313000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You see? Gibberish. All gibberish.
60322,245,54,318000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"So, tell me, are all you government inspectors so handsome and strapping?"
60323,245,55,322000,Inspector,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, we've got a Soloflex down at H.Q. Anyway, everything looks great, Mr. Burns. I can't find a single violation or employee acting strangely."
60324,245,56,333000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You gotta hide me. Death is after me! And I don't entirely trust these cowboys.
60325,245,57,338000,Inspector,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Is this man an employee?
60326,245,58,340000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Of course not. He's just a harmless maniac, here to remind us of the precious gift of sanity. B... Oh, God! What's he doing?"
60327,245,59,353000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,A mother can't die. And I'm a mother. See?
60328,245,60,361000,Psychiatrist,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You hate your father, don't you?"
60329,245,61,363000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Sometimes. But the guy I really hate is your father.
60330,245,62,366000,Psychiatrist,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I shouldn't have brought that up. I was just venting. Anyhoo, I think your fear of death is causing your insomnia, which is provoking your erratic behavior."
60331,245,63,375000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Why isn't my baby gaining weight?
60332,245,64,377000,Psychiatrist,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Because it's made of plastic.
60333,245,65,379000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I see...
60334,245,66,380000,Psychiatrist,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"What you need is a good, long rest. I suggest Florida."
60335,245,67,384000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Florida? But that's America's wang.
60336,245,68,386000,Psychiatrist,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"They prefer ""The Sunshine State."""

60383,245,115,574000,Tour Guide,SWAMP,"'Fraid not. Now years ago, Captain Jack helped build Palm Corners, by draggin' sticks and stones from the swamps. Legend has it he designed the town flag."

60431,245,167,796000,Sheriff,SWAMP,"No, ma'am. I did not."
60432,245,168,797000,Marge Simpson,SWAMP,"You seemed so understanding before. What happened to ""boys will be boys""?"
60433,245,169,802000,Sheriff,SWAMP,"You see, during Spring Break the beer companies pay me to look the other way. The rest of the year, I'm a real hardass. Okay, sweet pea, you're next."
60434,245,170,814000,Sheriff,SWAMP,"Whoa, looks like we got a teeny Houdini here."
60435,245,171,818000,Sheriff,SWAMP,"Well don't you worry, darlin'. I got some baby-cuffs in the station."

60443,245,179,839000,Sheriff,Springfield Police Station,"Aw, dang it."
60444,245,180,842000,Sheriff,Springfield Police Station,"Now, why does that only happen when nobody's lookin'?"
60446,245,182,851000,Sheriff,Country Road,Pull over!
60447,245,183,852000,Homer Simpson,Country Road,There's no good place!

60460,245,196,916000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Rise and shine, everybody."
60461,245,197,919000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,You went to the snack car?
60462,245,198,920000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Yeah, but first I talked to the engineer. He said there's a procedure for dealing with events of this nature."
60464,245,200,934000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Okay, now am I the only one on fire? Good."
60465,245,201,943000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"This family has hit a new low. We're on the run from the law, totally lost, no car, no money, no clean clothes... And it's all your fault."

60471,245,207,972000,Diner Owner,Diner,You took the signs out of the window? That's pretty presumptuous. How do you know I'm going to hire you?
60472,245,208,976000,Bart Simpson,Diner,Sorry. I just want to be a broom boy so bad.
60473,245,209,979000,Diner Owner,Diner,"I like your attitude. You're hired. How 'bout you, missy? You wanna be a mop girl?"
60474,245,210,984000,Lisa Simpson,Diner,"Not really, no."
60475,245,211,985000,Diner Owner,Diner,I like your honesty. You're hired. And you two haven't said a word. I like that. You're hired.

60477,245,213,991000,Diner Owner,Diner,"Hey, keep it down."
60478,245,214,992000,Diner Owner,Diner,"Y'all can stay in this trailer. Now, it ain't Buckingham Palace..."
60480,245,216,999000,Diner Owner,Diner,"...but I raised eight young'uns, three chilluns and a baby here."
