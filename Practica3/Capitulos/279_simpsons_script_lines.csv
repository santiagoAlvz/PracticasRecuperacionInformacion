70772,279,122,562000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If we had Artie's money, I could get that snoring surgery. Plus at least two of those other surgeries I desperately need."
70773,279,123,569000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No way, no how! I'll get used to the snoring, just like I got used to saying ""Courtney Cox-Arquette""."

70783,279,133,624000,Marge Simpson,Master Bedroom,You need that surgery. We'll have to call Artie.
70785,279,135,630000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Okay Ziff, you get her for the weekend, but no funny stuff."
70786,279,136,630000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"And by funny stuff I mean handholding, goo goo eyes, misdirected woo -- which is pretty much any John Woo film--"
70787,279,137,643000,ARTIE,Simpson Backyard,Your wife's virtue shall remain as untouched as Bill Gates' weight room.
70788,279,138,649000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Remember, Homie. I'm doing this for us. See you on Monday."

70793,279,143,677000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I didn't sell her. I just rented her to an old boyfriend.
70794,279,144,682000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Gee, a million bucks, that's gonna buy him a lot of, uh... Swings in the old battin' cage."
70795,279,145,689000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Looks like everyone's a winner. Marge gets a great new life...
70796,279,146,693000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,And you get more sprawl space on the bed.
70797,279,147,696000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Wait, you really think Marge is gonna fall for this guy? Even after I bought her that hockey-fight tape?"
70798,279,148,702000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,I'd dump your ass.
70799,279,149,703000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Me too.
70800,279,150,704000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, I can't get Artie out of my head. He's like a spy in the house of Moe."
70801,279,151,708000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh God, you're right. I've gotta get her back before it's too late."
70802,279,152,721000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,That's enough running.
70804,279,154,721000,Marge Simpson,ARTIE ZIFF'S ESTATE,"Hello, Artie."

70810,279,160,734000,ARTIE,ARTIE ZIFF'S ESTATE,"Oh my God! Artie, it's our senior prom!"
70811,279,161,746000,Chief Wiggum,ARTIE ZIFF'S ESTATE,I can't believe he's paying us a thousand bucks to pretend it's the seventies.

70815,279,165,768000,ARTIE,ARTIE ZIFF'S ESTATE,"Come, dear. We can dance all night. The band hasn't worked since the wrap party for ""James at 16"". Some say they're cursed!"
70817,279,167,787000,Homer Simpson,ZIFF ESTATE,"Oh my God, it's our high school prom! And once again I have no date!"

70819,279,170,795000,Principal Dondelinger,ZIFF ESTATE,"You're not on the guest list, Simpson. Orders of Prom King Ziff. And have you been drinking?"
70820,279,171,801000,Homer Simpson,ZIFF ESTATE,Just for twenty-five years.
70821,279,172,803000,Principal Dondelinger,ZIFF ESTATE,"Let's go, mister."
70823,279,174,808000,Principal Dondelinger,Ballroom,You're very sweet... but no fake prom could make me forget my husband. Sorry.
70824,279,175,816000,Principal Dondelinger,Ballroom,"Very well, Marge. I see you'll never feel about moi the way I feel about toi. But, before the evening ends, may I request an innocent peck on the cheek?"
70825,279,176,827000,Principal Dondelinger,Ballroom,Okay.
70826,279,177,837000,Homer Simpson,Ballroom,"Oh no. If Marge marries Artie, I'll never be born!"
70828,279,179,852000,Marge Simpson,ARTIE'S HOUSE,"Get off me, you little... nerd!"
70830,279,181,858000,Marge Simpson,ARTIE'S HOUSE,I knew this weekend was just an excuse to get in my mouth. Keep your money. I'm going home.

70832,279,183,888000,Chief Wiggum,ARTIE'S HOUSE,"Ah, he's gonna sleep tonight."
70834,279,185,892000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh guys, it was horrible. I saw Marge kissing a far superior man."
70835,279,186,898000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, well if it makes you feel any better, he's probably doin' her right now."
70836,279,187,904000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh yeah, make me the bad guy."
70837,279,188,905000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"My life here is over. Lenny, how'd you like to leave town with me, and never come back?"
70838,279,189,913000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Sounds like a plan.
70839,279,190,914000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Then it's settled. We leave Springfield forever.
70840,279,191,920000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,What'd I miss? Anything good?

70852,279,202,952000,Marge Simpson,Bedroom,"Marge, if you're watching this, then it means I've figured out how to work the camera. Last night I crashed a certain fake prom. That's right, Artie Ziff's fake prom."
70853,279,203,965000,Marge Simpson,Bedroom,Homer was there?
70854,279,204,966000,Homer Simpson,Bedroom,"I saw something terrible, and I can't even say it so I'll have these two dolls do it for me."

70858,279,208,984000,Homer Simpson,Bedroom,"I'm leaving you, Marge. The next time you see my name will be in the hobo obituaries. Don't worry about the kids -- I'll drop 'em off with Patty and Selma."

70867,279,217,1038000,Homer Simpson,Bus,What did Carl think?
70868,279,218,1040000,Lenny Leonard,Bus,"You know, we've never discussed it."
70870,279,220,1059000,Homer Simpson,Highway,Do you have any jobs for a man who wants to die? Something indoorsy.
70871,279,221,1063000,Lenny Leonard,Highway,Close to a bathroom.
70872,279,222,1064000,One-armed Man,Highway,"I'll put you on rig thirteen, as soon as they burn off the corpses."
70873,279,223,1069000,Homer Simpson,Highway,"This job'll be perfect. I'm gonna leave this world the way I entered it -- dirty, screaming and torn away from the woman I love."

70878,279,228,1090000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,He must have taken a job in the West Springfield oil patch. That's practically a death sentence!

70886,279,235,1115000,Marge Simpson,Helicopter,I really appreciate you helping me find Homer.

70904,279,253,1197000,Marge Simpson,BOTTOM OF OIL DERRICK,"But, Homer..."
70905,279,254,1198000,Homer Simpson,BOTTOM OF OIL DERRICK,"We said ""Good day""!"
70906,279,255,1207000,ARTIE,BOTTOM OF OIL DERRICK,"Listen to me, Homer. You've won. You own Marge's heart. And that's something I could never buy."
