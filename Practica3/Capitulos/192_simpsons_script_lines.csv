44099,192,35,183000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, uh-hum. Let's see. Ah. The exports of Libya are numerous in amount. One thing they export is corn..."
44100,192,36,191000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Or as the Indians call it, maize. Another famous Indian was Crazy Horse. In conclusion, Libya is a land of contrasts. Thank you."

44187,192,122,566000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, this industry moves so fast, it's really hard to tell. That's why I need a name that's cutting edge, like Cutco... or Edgecom... Interslice... Come on, Marge -- you're good at these. Help me out."
44188,192,123,578000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How about CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet?
44189,192,124,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fine. It's not important. What really matters is my title. I think I'll make myself Vice President. No, wait... Junior Vice President."
44190,192,125,595000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet. Junior Vice President Homer Simpson speaking. How may I direct your call?

44202,192,137,652000,Bart Simpson,Island,"Oh. No food, no shelter, no monkey butlers... This island is a death-hole. We should've just swum for it like Otto."
44204,192,139,664000,Otto Mann,Ocean,"Well, I'm done for. At least I'll leave a beautiful corpse."
44205,192,140,672000,Otto Mann,Ocean,Whoa!

44240,192,181,818000,Lisa Simpson,Island,"No one, but if we're gonna survive, we need rules and order. Let's not forget what we learned in the U.N. Club."
44242,192,183,825000,Lisa Simpson,Island,"Not now, Martin."

44285,192,225,985000,Nelson Muntz,Island,"Monster? Oh, please."
44286,192,226,988000,Bart Simpson,Island,"I remind you, we are not here to debate the existence of monsters."
44287,192,227,992000,Kids,Island,Aww. / Too bad. / I wanted to.
44288,192,228,993000,Lisa Simpson,Island,The defense has just one more question.
44289,192,229,996000,Lisa Simpson,Island,Did any one of you actually see Milhouse eat the food?
44290,192,230,1004000,Lisa Simpson,Island,I rest my case.
44291,192,231,1005000,Bart Simpson,Island,"Prosecutor, your witness."
44292,192,232,1018000,Nelson Muntz,Island,"You liar! You did it, ya lyin' jerk! Take that! You did it! You did it! Ma--"
44293,192,233,1022000,Lisa Simpson,Island,Object-Objection! He's not asking any questions!
44294,192,234,1025000,Bart Simpson,Island,Hmm. I'm gonna allow this.
44295,192,235,1030000,Nelson Muntz,Island,Prosecution rests.
44296,192,236,1035000,Bart Simpson,Island,"After careful deliberation, it's my opinion that Milhouse probably did eat the food. But since there's no proof, I must find him not guilty."
44297,192,237,1047000,Milhouse Van Houten,Island,All right!
44298,192,238,1048000,Kids,Island,"Ohhh... / Aw, man."
44299,192,239,1050000,Martin Prince,Island,But he ate our food!
44300,192,240,1052000,Lisa Simpson,Island,The law has spoken.
44301,192,241,1054000,Nelson Muntz,Island,"Ah, sucks to the law!"
44302,192,242,1059000,Lisa Simpson,Island,"Stop! Leave Milhouse alone! Help me out here, Bart."
44303,192,243,1062000,Bart Simpson,Island,"I don't know, Lis... to be honest, that verdict made me pretty angry."
44304,192,244,1066000,Nelson Muntz,Island,"Bart's with us, law girl! Step aside!"
44305,192,245,1069000,Bart Simpson,Island,"Hey, man! Leave my sister alone!"
44306,192,246,1071000,Nelson Muntz,Island,"Oh, so you're one of them. So be it. KILL-THE-DORKS!"

44311,192,251,1093000,Nelson Muntz,Island,The hunt is on...
44313,192,253,1097000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, they have the Internet on computers now..."
44314,192,254,1099000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, Bill Gates is here."
44315,192,255,1101000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bill Gates? Billionaire computer nerd Bill Gates? Oh my God, oh my God! Get out of sight, Marge! I don't want this to look like a two-bit operation!"
44317,192,257,1111000,Bill Gates,Simpson Home,Mr. Simpson?
44318,192,258,1112000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't look so rich.
44319,192,259,1114000,Bill Gates,Simpson Home,Don't let the haircut fool you. I'm exceedingly wealthy.
44320,192,260,1117000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Get a load of the bowl job, Marge."
44321,192,261,1119000,Bill Gates,Simpson Home,"Your Internet ad was brought to my attention. But I can't figure out what, if anything, CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet does. So rather than risk competing with you, I've decided simply to buy you out."
44322,192,262,1130000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is it, Marge. I poured my heart and soul into this business, and now it's finally paying off! We're rich! Richer than astronauts!"
44323,192,263,1138000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, quiet. You'll queer the deal."
44324,192,264,1141000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, right. I reluctantly accept your proposal."
44325,192,265,1145000,Bill Gates,Simpson Home,"Well, everyone always does. ""Buy him out,"" boys!"
44326,192,266,1155000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, what the hell's going on?!"
44327,192,267,1157000,Bill Gates,Simpson Home,"Oh, I didn't get rich by writin' a lot of checks."
44331,192,271,1180000,Milhouse Van Houten,Island,I can't go on. You two go ahead. And carry me with you.
44332,192,272,1186000,Lisa Simpson,Island,"Aw, crud. / Aw, come on, man."
44333,192,273,1187000,Milhouse Van Houten,Island,Hurry! They're catching up!
44334,192,274,1193000,Bart Simpson,Island,"Here, Milhouse, you go first."
44336,192,275,1197000,Bart Simpson,Island,"Okay, now throw the vine back!"
44337,192,276,1199000,Milhouse Van Houten,Island,There's no time!
44338,192,277,1213000,Lisa Simpson,Island,Look! We can hide in that cave!
44340,192,279,1220000,Lisa Simpson,Cave,We should be safe in here.
44341,192,280,1221000,Nelson Muntz,Cave,They're trapped in the cave! Move in for the kill!
44342,192,281,1224000,Lisa Simpson,Cave,"Oh, figs."
44343,192,282,1229000,Lisa Simpson,Cave,Stop! You are in violation of the Model U.N. Charter!
44344,192,283,1234000,Lisa Simpson,Cave,"Uh, that's right. The U.N. doesn't look too kindly on..."
44345,192,284,1238000,Nelson Muntz,Cave,The monster!
44346,192,285,1249000,Martin Prince,Cave,"Your ""monster"" appears to be nothing but a run-of-the-mill wild boar."
44347,192,286,1253000,Bart Simpson,Cave,"Hey, look at his tusk!"
44348,192,287,1255000,Nelson Muntz,Cave,"So the boar ate our food! Oh, sorry about that whole tryin' to kill ya thing."
44349,192,288,1261000,Milhouse Van Houten,Cave,"Yeah, well, you should be. I only stole two sandwiches and a bag of Doritos."
44350,192,289,1267000,Lisa Simpson,Cave,"Hey... If a boar can survive here, there must be a source of food."
44351,192,290,1272000,Lisa Simpson,Cave,"Look, he's licking the slime off that rock! That's what he's been eating -- slime! And there's enough slime for all of us! We're saved!"
44353,192,292,1290000,Nelson Muntz,Island,All that slime made this boar extra tender.
44354,192,293,1295000,Martin Prince,Island,"More snout, anyone?"
44355,192,294,1297000,Bart Simpson,Island,"Mmm. Mm. How's your dinner, Lis?"
44356,192,295,1300000,Lisa Simpson,Island,"Ah, shut up. Savages."
44357,192,296,1305000,James Earl Jones,Island,"So, the children learned to function as a society. And eventually, they were rescued by, oh, let's say, Moe."
