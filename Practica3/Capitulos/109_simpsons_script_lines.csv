22021,109,25,238000,C. Montgomery Burns,RETREAT,"Yes, by cutting off cable TV and the beer supply, I can ensure an honest winter's work out of those low-lifes."
22022,109,26,247000,Waylon Smithers,RETREAT,"Sir, did you ever stop to think that maybe it was doing this that caused the previous caretakers to go insane and murder their families?"
22023,109,27,253000,C. Montgomery Burns,RETREAT,"Hmm, perhaps. Tell you what. We come back and everyone's slaughtered, I owe you a coke."

22043,109,47,323000,Marge Simpson,FIRST FLOOR,"Feelin' fine, well, that's a relief."
22044,109,48,338000,Marge Simpson,FIRST FLOOR,This is less encouraging.
22045,109,49,344000,Homer Simpson,FIRST FLOOR,"So, what do you think, Marge? All I need is a title. I was thinking along the lines of ""No TV and No Beer Make Homer..."" something something."
22046,109,50,349000,Marge Simpson,FIRST FLOOR,Go crazy?
21566,109,51,358000,Homer Simpson,FIRST FLOOR,Don't mind if I do.

22119,109,124,657000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD JUNGLE,"But that was just one little insignificant mosquito. That can't change the future, right? Right?"

22165,109,171,873000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,Hmph. It's raining again.
22167,109,173,877000,Groundskeeper Willie,BASEMENT,"You're still not in your own world, Homer. I can get you home, but you have to do exactly as I tell..."

22192,109,198,994000,Seymour Skinner,Hallway,"Yes, you should have thought of that before you made that paper airplane."
22194,109,200,999000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,This overcrowding in detention is becoming critical. It's a powder keg waiting to go off in an explosion of unacceptable behavior.
22195,109,201,1005000,Lunchlady Doris,CAFETERIA,"Don't bitch to me, boss man. Thanks to the latest budget cuts, I'm down to using grade F meat."
22197,109,203,1011000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA STOREROOM,Wouldn't it be wonderful if there were some sort of common solution to both our problems?
22198,109,204,1015000,Lunchlady Doris,CAFETERIA STOREROOM,That would be great!

22206,109,212,1035000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA STOREROOM,Well might we.
22208,109,214,1037000,Jimbo Jones,KITCHEN DOOR,It's hard for me to clean this giant pot when you keep spilling meat tenderizer all over me.
22209,109,215,1042000,Jimbo Jones,KITCHEN DOOR,"Oh great, now I gotta work in the dark."
22211,109,217,1050000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CAFETERIA,"Mmmm. Mm-mmm. This sandwich tastes so young and impudent. Seymour, what's with the good grub?"
22212,109,218,1058000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,"Hmmm. Well, perhaps I ought to let you folks in on a secret. Do you remember me telling Jimbo Jones that I'd make something of him one day?"
22213,109,219,1065000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CAFETERIA,"Are you saying you killed Jimbo, processed his carcass, and served him for lunch?"
21964,109,220,1071000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CAFETERIA,Ha!
22214,109,221,1076000,Bart Simpson,CAFETERIA,"Hmm, I wonder where Jimbo is today. He should've beaten us up for our lunch money an hour ago."
22215,109,222,1082000,Üter,CAFETERIA,"Frau Lunchlady, please to have another Sloppy Jimbo. Das is good, nein?"
22216,109,223,1087000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,"Now, that's your third helping, young man. It's making you fat and soft... and tender. Hmmm... Uh, you just cut in line, didn't you? Report to detention, Uter."
22217,109,224,1099000,Üter,CAFETERIA,For how long?
22218,109,225,1100000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,Oh about seven minutes a pound should do it.
22219,109,226,1106000,Lunchlady Doris,CAFETERIA,"Okay, I got your German grub right here."
22220,109,227,1110000,Lisa Simpson,CAFETERIA,"Bart, does it strike you as odd that Uter disappeared and suddenly they're serving us this mysterious food called Uterbräten?"
22221,109,228,1118000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,"Oh relax, kids. I've got a gut feeling Uter's around here somewhere. After all, isn't there a little Uter in all of us? In fact, you might even say we just ate Uter and he's in our stomachs right now. Wait. Scratch that."
22223,109,230,1142000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom! Mom! You've gotta help! They're cooking kids in the school cafeteria!
22224,109,231,1146000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen, kids. You're eight and ten years old now. I can't be fighting all your battles for you."
