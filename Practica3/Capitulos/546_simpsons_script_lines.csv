142031,546,27,146000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"A contest? But, sir, we don't have any money to pay for prizes. We had to rent out our multi-purpose room to a Japanese-American social club."
142033,546,29,154000,Elderly Japanese Man,MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM,TANPATSU!!!
142034,546,30,155000,Gary Chalmers,MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM,"The answer is simple, Seymour. Get a corporate sponsor. But don't worry, you won't have to compromise yourself."

142043,546,39,192000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,So the chained-up dude cuts off his own foot to save his family from Jigsaw! My hero is my Mom's boyfriend who took me to that movie when I was three.
142044,546,40,202000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I call him Uncle Rob -- because he robbed us.
142045,546,41,209000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Madame Curie, we just might have this one in the bag."

142056,546,52,261000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Oh, just make a speech about Dad."
142057,546,53,263000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,Everyone does that.
142058,546,54,264000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Everyone does that with good dads. But with our Dad, it's like climbing Mount Everest. You either plant your flag at the top of the world or get frozen in agony forever. Either way, Hell of a show."
142059,546,55,279000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"People, please! Martin has left the building. He had an orthodontist appointment."

142075,546,71,327000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,He's my Dad.
142077,546,73,330000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,He worked two jobs to get me a pony... he started me playing the saxophone you all love...
142079,546,75,337000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"...and anyone can put a band aid on, but my Dad knows how to take it off so it doesn't hurt."
142081,546,77,345000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"The trick is, wait several weeks."
142082,546,78,348000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"...And when my Dad was a soccer referee, he had the guts to red card me, his only talking daughter, because he knew I was diving."
142083,546,79,356000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"In the history of soccer, he's the only parent to ever take sides against his own kid, and he was right. He made me a better person, because that's what heroes do."
142084,546,80,366000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That's what heroes do.
142085,546,81,372000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'm so glad I was forced to come.
142086,546,82,375000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"People, people... we have a tie!"
142088,546,84,380000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, which means that nobody wins. The money goes back in the school general fund. But we will put both speeches online, behind a pay wall. Now, please fold up your chairs and stack them."

142096,546,92,423000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,When did you come up with the idea? You must've worked on it for days.
142097,546,93,428000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Oh, dad, you don't want details. No one wants to see the sausage being made."
142098,546,94,432000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,There's sausage being made? Where?
142099,546,95,434000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Homie, there's someone here to see you."

142141,546,136,581000,Pilot,Airliner Cabin,Will you please turn that off? It's annoying the hell out of the flight crew.
142142,546,137,585000,Marge Simpson,Airliner Cabin,I was just trying to learn the--
142143,546,138,587000,Pilot,Airliner Cabin,Everyone thinks they can learn our language on the plane. Do you know how disrespectful that is?

142155,546,152,645000,Announcer #2,Announcer's Booth,"And with Brazil maintaining an insurmountable one goal lead, let's take a look at the refs."
142156,546,153,652000,Announcer #1,Announcer's Booth,It says here Homer Simpson was recruited for his honesty and utter disinterest.
142157,546,154,652000,Announcer #2,Announcer's Booth,How did he get those shorts on over that arse?
142158,546,155,659000,Announcer #1,Announcer's Booth,Rumor has it they employed a team of pullers.
142159,546,156,663000,Announcer #2,Announcer's Booth,Brazil wins it! And a fairly-called match it was.
142161,546,158,667000,ANDRES CANTOR,Another Broadcasting Booth,"In choosing Homer Simpson, the World Cup has met its goooooooooooooooaaaaal!"
142162,546,159,676000,Spanish Announcer,Another Broadcasting Booth,"Andres Cantor, you know that is incorrect usage!"

142168,546,165,707000,Lisa Simpson,RESTAURANTE FIGUEIRA RUBAIYAT,How'd you eat the meat without the vegetables?
142169,546,166,710000,Homer Simpson,RESTAURANTE FIGUEIRA RUBAIYAT,The stomach wants what it wants. I need some air.
142171,546,168,715000,Homer Simpson,Restaurant,"Ah, Brazil. I couldn't stay afraid of you forever. The only thing that keeps me from living here is that fish that swims up your pee stream. That is a deal breaker."
142172,546,169,726000,Antonio,Restaurant,Homer Simpson! I would like to congratulate you on your fine officiating today.
142173,546,170,731000,Homer Simpson,Restaurant,Thanks. I still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.
142174,546,171,736000,Antonio,Restaurant,"Your disbelief will fade with time. But now, I would like to know if you are as ""incorruptível"" as they say."

142177,546,174,751000,Homer Simpson,Restaurant,You don't know the new me of the last few days at all!
142178,546,175,757000,Antonio,Restaurant,We will get to him. We have our ways.
142179,546,176,760000,2nd Gambler,Restaurant,What other ways besides guns and money?
142180,546,177,763000,Antonio,Restaurant,We have two ways. Two very good ways.
142181,546,178,769000,Homer Simpson,Restaurant,Red card!

142183,546,180,780000,Homer Simpson,Restaurant,Get outta here!
142185,546,181,805000,Announcer #1,Restaurant,"And as Homer officiates, looks like we've got a little action on the bribe cam."
142187,546,183,832000,Bart Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,"Man, Krusty should get some of these letters."
142188,546,184,837000,Bart Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,"While you were out, the gamblers sent up gold-frosted donuts, a chocolate bowling ball, and a fresh pork sandwich."
142189,546,185,844000,Homer Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,How fresh?
142191,546,187,847000,Homer Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,Where's your mother?
142192,546,188,848000,Bart Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,Went to practice her Portuguese.
142194,546,190,851000,Marge Simpson,Hotel,"""Selecionar conta..."" ooh, ""select account""!"
142195,546,191,851000,Samba Instructor,Hotel,"Uh, perhaps you could select the ""English"" option!"
142196,546,192,858000,Marge Simpson,Hotel,I did not pay seven ninety-nine for an app so I could use the English option.
142197,546,193,863000,Samba Instructor,Hotel,"You Americans, you really throw your seven ninety-nines around."
142198,546,194,866000,Marge Simpson,Hotel,"You know, you're pretty rude."
142199,546,195,868000,Samba Instructor,Hotel,Stupid lady.
142201,546,197,870000,Homer Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,"Give the donuts to the hotel staff. Release the pig, and the bowling ball, into the wild."
142202,546,198,876000,Bart Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,"Dad, is it hard for you to turn these bribes down?"
142203,546,199,878000,Homer Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,Yes. But knowing that Lisa chose me as her hero... without ever considering any other hero... keeps me strong.
142204,546,200,886000,Homer Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,Why so quiet?
142205,546,201,888000,Bart Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,"I'm just examining what kind of person I am and whether I should destroy your happiness forever. Eh, why not?"
142206,546,202,893000,Homer Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,I'm listening. And it better be devastating.
142207,546,203,896000,Bart Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,You weren't Lisa's hero. She just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero.
142208,546,204,902000,Homer Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,"Oh my God. That's, that's shattering. And now, I'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since San Francisco turned all nerdy."
142209,546,205,913000,Bart Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,Where are you going?
142210,546,206,914000,Homer Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,To drink until there's no pain left in my soul. But first I'm gonna eat off someone else's room service tray that was left in the hall!
142211,546,207,926000,Bart Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,Now that's a broken man.
142213,546,209,932000,Man In Robe,Hotel,What the Hell are you doing?
142122,546,210,934000,Homer Simpson,Hotel,It's okay. I'm an American!
142214,546,211,935000,Man In Robe,Hotel,"Oh, oh. Okay."
142217,546,214,944000,Antonio,SEEDY BAR,So the rumors are true. We knew you'd find out your daughter's original speech topic was Marie Curie. And now we need you to fix the greatest game of all: the World Cup Final.
142218,546,215,958000,Homer Simpson,SEEDY BAR,Fine. Marge is always complaining I never fix things. Give me another.
142219,546,216,962000,Bartender,SEEDY BAR,All right. But we've run out of sugarcane.
142220,546,217,965000,Homer Simpson,SEEDY BAR,I carry my own.
142221,546,218,971000,Antonio,SEEDY BAR,"All right, Homer. To begin your descent into Hell, let us enjoy this pirated copy of ""Man of Steel."" But beware: Superman was never less fun."
142223,546,220,984000,Announcer #2,RIO,"Here it is, the World Cup Final."

142227,546,224,987000,Announcer #2,RIO,Will it be a German Blitzkrieg or a Brazilian waxing?

142233,546,230,1006000,Homer Simpson,REFEREE'S TUNNEL,"If I bet it, I could double it. But on who?"

142238,546,235,1021000,Lisa Simpson,REFEREE'S TUNNEL,"Don't do it, Dad. Don't cheat."
142239,546,236,1024000,Homer Simpson,REFEREE'S TUNNEL,You're a funny one to tell me about deception.
142240,546,237,1026000,Lisa Simpson,REFEREE'S TUNNEL,I'm sorry you weren't my first choice. In fact... I had my doubts about using you at all.
142241,546,238,1034000,Homer Simpson,REFEREE'S TUNNEL,"Well, if we're going to be brutally honest, that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness."
142242,546,239,1040000,Lisa Simpson,REFEREE'S TUNNEL,You put it on the fridge!
142243,546,240,1042000,Homer Simpson,REFEREE'S TUNNEL,It was pity-fridged!
142244,546,241,1044000,Lisa Simpson,REFEREE'S TUNNEL,"All right, you're hurt. I understand. But when I made you my hero, you lived up to it and more. You became the hero I thought you could be, Dad."
142245,546,242,1054000,Homer Simpson,REFEREE'S TUNNEL,"Oh, come here."
142246,546,243,1058000,Homer Simpson,REFEREE'S TUNNEL,Everything's right with the world.
148648,546,244,1060000,Homer's Thoughts,REFEREE'S TUNNEL,Except that you're about to double-cross some gangsters.
142247,546,245,1063000,Homer Simpson,REFEREE'S TUNNEL,"That's all right, brain. If I die, I'll be doing the thing I love the most: trying not to get killed."
142249,546,247,1071000,Announcer #2,STADIUM,This match is tighter than two dogs on a summer morn.
142250,546,248,1074000,Announcer #2,STADIUM,There's no score at all. Even the slightest pebble could start a landslide.
142251,546,249,1079000,Announcer #1,STADIUM,And El Divo goes down! In the box! will Homer award a penalty kick to Brazil?
142252,546,250,1089000,Antonio,STADIUM,Do it! Do it! Call the penalty!

142259,546,257,1119000,Announcer #1,STADIUM,I've never seen the Brazilians so depressed.
142260,546,258,1122000,Brazilians,STADIUM,"OLÉ / OLÉ, OLÉ, OLÉ."
142261,546,259,1128000,Antonio,STADIUM,You broke a deal with us. And we have lost a fortune.
142262,546,260,1134000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Well, at least I'll die the American way. In a foreign country wearing short pants."
142263,546,261,1139000,Marge Simpson,STADIUM,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! I wanna say something!"
142264,546,262,1142000,Antonio,STADIUM,You have one minute. Wait. Let it get to the twelve. Nnnow!
142265,546,263,1147000,Marge Simpson,STADIUM,Um... Deixar meu marido sozinho!

142267,546,265,1159000,Lisa Simpson,STADIUM,"I don't know, but she's my new hero."
142268,546,266,1162000,Marge Simpson,STADIUM,"Yeah, I was a little surprised I wasn't considered before. Todo o meu marido se preocupa é ser um herói para sua filha. Por favor, perdoa-lhe."
142269,546,267,1172000,Antonio,STADIUM,Your fluency is impressive. You can help my son learn Hebrew for his bar mitzvah. But I am still killing your husband.
142270,546,268,1180000,Marge Simpson,STADIUM,"First, mazel tov! Second, don't! Please, please, I'm a mother. Surely you have a mother too."
142271,546,269,1188000,Antonio,STADIUM,"I do have a mother. Oh, she's right there."
142272,546,270,1191000,Brazilian Lady,STADIUM,"I'm sorry, my son. We owe a debt to the Simpsons that can never be repaid."
142274,546,271,1197000,Antonio,STADIUM,All that she did was switch seats on a plane!
142275,546,272,1199000,Brazilian Lady,STADIUM,On a fifteen hour flight!
142276,546,273,1202000,Antonio,STADIUM,You are free to go.
