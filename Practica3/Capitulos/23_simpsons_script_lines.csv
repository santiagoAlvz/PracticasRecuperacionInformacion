155320,23,16,171000,Devil,SAME SCENE,"Ah, please allow me to introduce myself. I'm the DEVIL! And you've earned eternal damnation for your lifetime of evil deeds, Bart. Spitting off the escalator just clinched it."

155322,23,18,186000,Devil,SAME SCENE,"Innocent. Everybody's innocent. Okay, let's just pull up your file here."

155325,23,21,206000,Bart Simpson,SAME SCENE,Um... say... is there anything I can do to avoid coming back here?

155336,23,32,258000,Homer Simpson,SAME SCENE,"Ooo, classy."
155337,23,33,259000,Lionel Hutz,SAME SCENE,I'd like to talk to you about bringing legal action against the fiend who did this to your boy.
155339,23,34,264000,Homer Simpson,SAME SCENE,"Well, the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. And besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. Nothing serious."
155340,23,35,273000,Lionel Hutz,SAME SCENE,Doctors! Doctors are idiots! There's no telling what kind of permanent injuries he might have. You might have to wait on him hand and foot for the rest of his natural life!
155341,23,36,283000,Lionel Hutz,SAME SCENE,That's the downside. Now here's the good part. You can ching-ching-ching cash in on this tragedy.

155343,23,38,290000,Lisa Simpson,SAME SCENE,"Excuse me, Mr. Hutz. Are you a shyster?"
155344,23,39,293000,Lionel Hutz,SAME SCENE,How does a nice little girl like you know a big word like that?
155345,23,40,295000,Marge Simpson,SAME SCENE,"Mr. Hutz, this is hardly the time or place to discuss this."
155346,23,41,299000,Lionel Hutz,SAME SCENE,"You're right, you're right. When you feel up to it, come over to my office and we'll talk about it."
155347,23,42,304000,Lionel Hutz,SAME SCENE,"Lionel Hutz, Attorney-At-Law. What's that, a broken neck? Great!"

155352,23,47,316000,Bart Simpson,SAME SCENE,Ow! Quit it!
155353,23,48,318000,Marge Simpson,SAME SCENE,"Is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably, doctor?"
155354,23,49,321000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,SAME SCENE,Hmm. Better let him rest up awhile first.
155355,23,50,324000,Marge Simpson,SAME SCENE,Hmmm.
155357,23,52,324000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, Simpson, I heard Mr. Burns crushed your boy."
155358,23,53,327000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah. If I wasn't so spineless, I'd march into Mr. Burns' office right now and..."

155366,23,61,347000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yes. My attorneys have advised me to pay you for running over your child. So I'm cutting you a check.

155368,23,63,361000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"... One... Hundred... Dollars! Of course you'll have to sign a waiver, relinquishing your right to sue and so forth... merely a formality..."
155369,23,64,367000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,A hundred bucks?
155370,23,65,369000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"W-well... It's a v-very generous offer, sir. But... his medical bills alone..."
155371,23,66,373000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, so extortion is the name of your little game, is it Simpson? Very well. Then you get nothing. I have the finest lawyers in Springfield, Simpson. Tangle with me and I'll crush you like a paper cup."
155372,23,67,390000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Throw him out, Smithers."
155373,23,68,392000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You don't have to do that, Mr. Burns. I can throw myself out."

155387,23,82,458000,Homer Simpson,The Law Office of Lionel Hutz,Well... I dunno... You and I might have different ideas about just how big a big cash settlement is.
155388,23,83,466000,Lionel Hutz,The Law Office of Lionel Hutz,A million dollars.
155389,23,84,467000,Homer Simpson,The Law Office of Lionel Hutz,Whoo ooo! I stand corrected. A million bucks is A-okay!

155398,23,92,500000,Homer Simpson,Waiting Room Of Dr. Nick Riviera's Office,Whiplash! Oh no!
155399,23,93,501000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Waiting Room Of Dr. Nick Riviera's Office,And this smudge here that looks like my fingerprint? No. That's trauma.
155401,23,95,509000,Bart Simpson,Waiting Room Of Dr. Nick Riviera's Office,Am I gonna die?
155402,23,96,510000,Homer Simpson,Waiting Room Of Dr. Nick Riviera's Office,"Yes, son."

155407,23,101,523000,Bart Simpson,Waiting Room Of Dr. Nick Riviera's Office,But I played baseball this morning!
155408,23,102,525000,Marge Simpson,Waiting Room Of Dr. Nick Riviera's Office,"That's right, he did. Excuse me, but Dr. Hibbert has been our family physician for years, and he thought Bart was fine."
155409,23,103,533000,Homer Simpson,Waiting Room Of Dr. Nick Riviera's Office,"Oh, Dr. Hibbert from Johns Hopkins Medical School?"
155410,23,104,537000,Lionel Hutz,Waiting Room Of Dr. Nick Riviera's Office,"With all due respect, Mrs. Simpson, you are not a doctor, the boy's not a doctor, I'm not a doctor. The only person in this room who even comes close is this man."

155415,23,109,558000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,A million dollars! Smithers! I want this Homer J. Simpson fired!
155416,23,110,563000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Uh, do you think that's wise, Mr. Burns? I mean... think of the headlines."
155417,23,111,576000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,What about the headlines?
155418,23,112,578000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,The press might be critical of you for firing the crippled boy's father so soon after the accident.
155421,23,113,583000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Well... all right, then. I don't want to seem like an ogre. I'll bide my time. Let him twist in the wind... slowly... slowly. And then... when the papers have found their new ""flavor of the month"", he'll find out this cat has claws!"
155422,23,114,601000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Good thinking, sir."
155424,23,116,603000,Lionel Hutz,Simpson Home,"Now, let's pretend you're on the witness stand... ...How are you, Bart?"
155425,23,117,606000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine.
155426,23,118,609000,Lionel Hutz,Simpson Home,"Oh, fine. Isn't that nice? Bart says he's fine. Wrong!!! You are not fine! You are in constant pain!"
155427,23,119,615000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I am in constant pain.
155428,23,120,617000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, may I please make an observation?"
155429,23,121,619000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, what? What is it?"
155430,23,122,620000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I think this is all a charade to make Bart look more injured than he really is.
155431,23,123,624000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, maybe Lisa does have a point. I don't mind you boys doing this in the living room, but in court doesn't Bart have to tell the truth?"
155432,23,124,632000,Lionel Hutz,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but what is truth -- if you follow me. Now, Bart, can you roll your eyes back in your head like this?"
155433,23,125,639000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, you mean like I'm dead? Yeah, sure."
155434,23,126,642000,Lionel Hutz,Simpson Home,The kids a pro.

155438,23,130,656000,C. Montgomery Burns,Courtroom,I should be able to run over as many kids as I want!
155439,23,131,662000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Mr. Burns, I must warn you that if you continue to disrupt the court in this way, I will have to cite you for contempt."
155440,23,132,670000,C. Montgomery Burns,Courtroom,You wouldn't dare.
155441,23,133,672000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Well, no, I-I guess I wouldn't."
155442,23,134,674000,Bailiff,Courtroom,Calling Bartholomew J. Simpson to the stand!
155443,23,135,680000,C. Montgomery Burns,Courtroom,"Oh, please."
155444,23,136,682000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Hello, Bart. Now, you know the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie, don't you, son?"
155445,23,137,690000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,Maybe.
155446,23,138,692000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Uh-huh. Well, you wouldn't lie to the United States, would you, Bart?"
155447,23,139,697000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,No.
155392,23,140,699000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Good. Proceed, Mr. Hutz."
155419,23,141,701000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,"Thank you, your honor. Now, Bart, I want you to tell the jury, in your own words, exactly what happened on the day of the accident."
155448,23,142,709000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,"Yes, sir. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon. I was playing in my wholesome childlike way, little realizing that I was about to be struck down by the Luxury Car of Death."
155451,23,145,725000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Car,Defenseless child at three o'clock!
155455,23,149,734000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,"Luckily, I was not killed that day. Although sometimes I wish I had been."
155456,23,150,743000,C. Montgomery Burns,Courtroom,He's lying!
155457,23,151,746000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,Now that's believable testimony.
155459,23,153,749000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"Now, Mr. Burns, would you please relate in your own words exactly what really happened on the day of the accident."
155460,23,154,759000,C. Montgomery Burns,Courtroom,"Certainly. Oh, it was a beautiful day. The sun was shining. I was driving to the orphanage to pass out toys."
155462,23,156,766000,C. Montgomery Burns,DREAMLIKE SUBURBAN SPRINGFIELD STREET,"Suddenly, that incorrigible Simpson boy, darted in front of me..."
155464,23,158,777000,C. Montgomery Burns,DREAMLIKE SUBURBAN SPRINGFIELD STREET,"Oh, my goodness! Look what's happened!"
155465,23,159,780000,Waylon Smithers,DREAMLIKE SUBURBAN SPRINGFIELD STREET,"Oh, it's not important, sir. Let's drive on."
155466,23,160,782000,C. Montgomery Burns,DREAMLIKE SUBURBAN SPRINGFIELD STREET,"Why you despicable, cold-blooded monster. Regardless of what you think, we must summon help, and comfort the dear boy until an ambulance arrives."
155467,23,161,793000,C. Montgomery Burns,DREAMLIKE SUBURBAN SPRINGFIELD STREET,"Noooo! Take me, I'm old!"
155469,23,163,799000,C. Montgomery Burns,Courtroom,And that's what happened.
155470,23,164,804000,C. Montgomery Burns,Courtroom,What are you looking at me like that for? You believed his cock and bull story.
155471,23,165,809000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,"It's looking good, Mr. Simpson. It's looking very, very good."
155473,23,167,813000,C. Montgomery Burns,"GLASS-ENCLOSED CONSULTATION ROOM (LIKE IN ""L.A. LAW"")",They hate me? Well what trial were you watching?
155475,23,169,819000,C. Montgomery Burns,GLASS BOOTH,"Oh yeah, settlement? Fine! Hang your heads in shame, you over-priced, under-brained, glorified notary publics! Just get that big ape to my house tonight and we'll buy him off with a banana or two."
155476,23,172,831000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,...and that ugly customer was the last Indonesian Rhino on earth.
155477,23,173,837000,Marge Simpson,Burns's Living Room,I didn't know you liked animals.
155478,23,174,840000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,"Oh, I don't like everything about them, just their heads. Well, would you care for some wine, old buddy?"
155479,23,175,847000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Living Room,Don't mind if I do.
155480,23,176,851000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,"Bottoms up Simpson, there's plenty more where that came from."
155481,23,177,856000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Living Room,"Mr. Burns, are you trying to get me drunk?"
155482,23,178,856000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,"Yes. Now then, Homer, old chum, I'm sure you'll agree with me that this trial is an affront to our collective dignity. What do you say, we settle this man to man?"
155483,23,179,870000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Living Room,You mean duke it out?
155484,23,180,871000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,"Oh, no, I mean I'm prepared to offer you a most generous cash settlement."
155485,23,181,878000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,A princely sum...
155486,23,182,880000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,"Well, a handsome sum that can end this little embrolio once and for all."
155487,23,183,888000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Living Room,Five hundred thousand dollars!
155488,23,184,893000,Marge Simpson,Burns's Living Room,Goodness!
155489,23,185,893000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,"Up-up-up-up. Don't answer me now. Relax, talk it over with the missus, soak in the opulence of your surroundings and dream of what might be. Smithers, let's go powder my nose."
155490,23,186,906000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Living Room,"Well, Marge, what do you think?"
155491,23,187,908000,Marge Simpson,Burns's Living Room,I don't know. Maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us.
155492,23,188,913000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,The fish is in the pan.
155493,23,189,917000,Marge Simpson,Burns's Living Room,"What do you think, Homer?"
155494,23,190,918000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Living Room,I'll tell you what I think. I think he thinks I'm an idiot. The only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.
155495,23,191,929000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,"Oh, I feel faint.."
155496,23,192,931000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Living Room,"""Five hundred thousand dollars."" I spit on his five hundred thousand dollars."
155497,23,193,939000,Marge Simpson,Burns's Living Room,"Homer, what's happened to you? All this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors --"
155498,23,194,946000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,Phony doctors? Hel-lo.
155499,23,195,948000,Marge Simpson,Burns's Living Room,Do you know what I'd settle for if it was up to me? Bart's medical bills and an apology!
155501,23,196,953000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,And you won't even get that.
155502,23,197,954000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Living Room,"Sorry, offer's expired. I guess we'll just have to let the jury decide, twelve good men and true. Good day. Smithers, release the hounds."
155504,23,199,965000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"Your honor, I would like to call to the stand Mrs. Homer J. Simpson."
155506,23,201,980000,Bailiff,Courtroom,"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?"
155507,23,202,985000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"Yes, I do."
155508,23,203,986000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,She sounded like she was taking that awful seriously.
155509,23,204,989000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Oh, the truth!"
155510,23,205,992000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"Mrs. Simpson, does the name Julius Hibbert mean anything to you?"
155511,23,206,996000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"Yes, he's been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day I became a mother. He's seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care."
155512,23,207,1008000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"But, wait a minute! I'm confused! This court heard ""expert"" testimony from one Dr. Nick Riviera. What is your opinion of him?"
155514,23,209,1019000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,Mrs. Simpson...
155515,23,210,1021000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"I'm sorry, but my mother always said, ""If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."""
155516,23,211,1026000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Will that hold up in court?
155517,23,212,1027000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,"No, I've tried it before."
155518,23,213,1029000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"Mrs. Simpson, what is your opinion of Dr. Riviera? And let me remind you that you're under oath."
155519,23,214,1036000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"Well, to be honest, he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping Bart in bandages than in making him feel better. And he mispronounced words that even I know, like abdomen. And his office was dirty. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure he's even a doctor."
155521,23,216,1054000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"And Mrs. Simpson, could you describe for us in your own words Bart's ""intense mental anguish and suffering""?"
155522,23,217,1062000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"Well, I don't know how intense it was..."
155523,23,218,1065000,BURNS LAWYER,Courtroom,Huh uh.
155524,23,219,1066000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"...but, well, I guess he did miss three days of school --"
155525,23,220,1066000,BURNS LAWYER,Courtroom,"Oh, three days."
155526,23,221,1066000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"...although he doesn't really like school all that much,"
154143,23,222,1066000,BURNS LAWYER,Courtroom,No.
155527,23,223,1066000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,...so I guess that may not count as anguish.
155528,23,224,1076000,BURNS LAWYER,Courtroom,"No, it doesn't."
155529,23,225,1077000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,It was a little hard on me having him around the house
155530,23,226,1077000,BURNS LAWYER,Courtroom,Yes...
155531,23,227,1077000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,...all that time.
155532,23,228,1082000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,Could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships?
155533,23,229,1085000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"Well, we pay Bart five dollars a week to take out the trash..."
155534,23,230,1085000,BURNS LAWYER,Courtroom,Huh uh.
155535,23,231,1089000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"I suppose if he'd been able to do it that week, we might have given him the five dollars."
155536,23,232,1094000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,Five dollars?
155537,23,233,1094000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,Um-hmm.
155538,23,234,1096000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"But your lawyer -- assuming he is a lawyer -- is asking for a million? Well, we can't blame them for trying can we. Thank you very much, Mrs. Simpson."
155539,23,235,1106000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Oh, Marge."
155541,23,237,1111000,C. Montgomery Burns,GLASS BOOTH,"I'm going to write a figure on this piece of paper. It's not quite as large as the last one, but I think you'll find it fair."
155542,23,238,1121000,Lionel Hutz,GLASS BOOTH,I think we should take it.
155545,23,241,1122000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A million dollars. My wife cost me a million dollars.
155546,23,242,1127000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, would you like some more macaroni and cheese?"
155547,23,243,1130000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman. No, thank you."
155548,23,244,1134000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Some string beans?
155549,23,245,1136000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No I don't want any string beans either you two-timing, back-stabbing. Uh oh I better answer. No, thank you."
155550,23,246,1141000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Some celery with cream cheese on it?
155551,23,247,1145000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, thank you."
155552,23,248,1146000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You know what would've really been cool? If we got that million bucks.
155553,23,249,1149000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, please."
155554,23,250,1150000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"What? We could have bought tons of great stuff, Mom... maids, a pool, fancy sweaters... stop me if I'm wrong."
155555,23,251,1157000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, dear. Would it be all right if I went over to Moe's for a drink?"
155556,23,252,1160000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Sure.
155557,23,253,1161000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know if I'll ever come back here. Goodnight.
155559,23,254,1166000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My woman's intuition is telling me something... I wonder what... Oh my god.
155561,23,256,1174000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, that's it. I guess this is the class I'm gonna die in."
155562,23,257,1178000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Eh, you're better off. Rich people aren't happy. From the day they're born, to the day they die, they think they're happy but, trust me... they ain't."
155563,23,258,1187000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, I wish he'd shut up."
155564,23,259,1192000,Larry,Moe's Tavern,"Look, a chick!"
155565,23,260,1194000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,And it's not even Ladies Night.
155566,23,261,1196000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, hey, guys. Knock it off. It's just my wife."
155567,23,262,1202000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,My name is Marge.
155568,23,263,1204000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing."
155569,23,264,1210000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, Marge..."
155570,23,265,1211000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"We've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- I mean, I know this is different than that time I washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but I--"
155571,23,266,1219000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"No, no, no. You think this is about money? Well, it's not. It's worse, Marge. I'm afraid that from now on when I look at you, I'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance."
155572,23,267,1238000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"What are you saying, Homer?"
155573,23,268,1238000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I'm saying... She's been your wife for ten years, you've had three children together, it's time to be honest with her. I'm not sure I love you anymore."
155575,23,270,1250000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,But don't worry. I'll never let on. I'll still do all the bed stuff. Maybe it won't be so bad.
155576,23,271,1256000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh my Lord. Well, I don't want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore. I think that you should look me in the eyes and find out."
155578,23,273,1268000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, look at me."
155579,23,274,1271000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Alright, alright, look at her if it'll make her shut up. Start with the feet, still angry? Good, good Homer, good. This is tough, need refreshment. Ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. Alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her."
155580,23,275,1294000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, who am I kidding? I love you more than ever."
155581,23,276,1298000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I love you too!
155583,23,277,1299000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Sorry to scare you like that, babe."
155584,23,278,1303000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, everybody! For the next fifteen minutes, one third off on every pitcher... one per customer... domestic beer only... hey, no sharing!"
