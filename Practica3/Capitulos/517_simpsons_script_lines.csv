134412,517,148,625000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?"
134413,517,149,630000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Guys who call themselves ""preacher"" or ""deacon"" are very bad. Water is money unless gasoline is money. And even though lots of things are razor-sharp, no one ever shaves."

134433,517,169,723000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What move? We haven't moved! What's going on?!
134434,517,170,727000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I want to tell you but I promised to keep it a secret.
134435,517,171,730000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You can't have secrets from your wife!
134436,517,172,733000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's very late in the marriage to tell me that.

134442,517,178,751000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's reassuring to see you're aware of the future. But this is all a little... creepy.
134443,517,179,757000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Creepy? Marge, the apocalypse is coming. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe never, but it's coming... and soon."
134444,517,180,765000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm going to bed.
134445,517,181,769000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,There's no handle on this side!
134446,517,182,774000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The one thing I couldn't prepare for.

134487,517,223,939000,Homer Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,"Well, just because I imagined it doesn't make it any less true. And now all those people are on their own."
134488,517,224,945000,Marge Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,How can you call yourself a Christian?
134489,517,225,947000,Homer Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,If Jesus had a gun he'd be alive today.
134490,517,226,951000,Marge Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,"Homer Simpson! When I fell in love with you, it was because of your big heart and your good looks. But some day those good looks are gonna fade."
134492,517,228,964000,Lloyd,BUG-OUT LOCATION,"Soon we'll be approached by people who haven't prepared. Now, do not look at their faces. That can trigger ""feelings"" and ""emotions,"" which have no place in Civilization 2.0: Rise of the Weirdos."
134494,517,229,979000,Gary Chalmers,BUG-OUT LOCATION,I may have solved that problem. This rifle scope I modified makes any human face look dangerous and threatening.
134495,517,230,990000,Gary Chalmers,BUG-OUT LOCATION,Boom.
134496,517,231,991000,Homer Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,Why do we have to shoot them at all?
134497,517,232,993000,Lloyd,BUG-OUT LOCATION,Are you that good with a knife?
134498,517,233,995000,Homer Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,No! I want to help the people who didn't prepare!
134499,517,234,999000,Gary Chalmers,BUG-OUT LOCATION,Boom. Boom.
134500,517,235,1001000,Gary Chalmers,BUG-OUT LOCATION,Boom.
134501,517,236,1001000,Lindsay Naegle,BUG-OUT LOCATION,What'd you shoot me for?
134502,517,237,1003000,Gary Chalmers,BUG-OUT LOCATION,"You were thinking I'd gone mad with power, weren't you?"
134503,517,238,1006000,Lindsay Naegle,BUG-OUT LOCATION,"I wasn't, but I am now!"
134504,517,239,1007000,Gary Chalmers,BUG-OUT LOCATION,Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom...
134505,517,240,1018000,Bart Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,"Oh God, now what?"
134506,517,241,1019000,Lisa Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,"Every time you wake us up early in the morning, it's either church or we have to change our identities."
134507,517,242,1025000,Homer Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,"Don't be silly, ""Mary Ellen."""
134508,517,243,1028000,Homer Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,"Now we're going to leave this place. I'm sorry, Bart -- I know you've made a bug-out camp girlfriend..."
134509,517,244,1033000,Bart Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,I've got to be honest with you. It was just a bag of rice I drew a face on.
134510,517,245,1036000,Homer Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,White rice or brown?
134511,517,246,1037000,Bart Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,I never noticed.
134512,517,247,1038000,Marge Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,Good boy.
134513,517,248,1039000,Homer Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,So we'll take these supplies back to Springfield where they're needed most.
134514,517,249,1044000,Marge Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,"You're a good man, Homer Simpson."
134515,517,250,1051000,Lisa Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,You said you cut the wires to the alarm!
134516,517,251,1053000,Homer Simpson,BUG-OUT LOCATION,Hm. I cut the wires to something.
134518,517,253,1066000,Homer Simpson,Various Country Roads,"Okay, everybody, keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked twenty-three of thirty-six or something. If we miss it, we're dead."
134519,517,254,1073000,Lisa Simpson,Various Country Roads,"Dad, there are lights following us!"
134520,517,255,1075000,Homer Simpson,Various Country Roads,How can that be? I took every last can of gas!
134522,517,257,1086000,Homer Simpson,Road,"Now, everyone relax and pretend we're about to be hit by a soft brick wall."
134523,517,258,1091000,Homer Simpson,Road,"Out of our way, corn! The starving people of Springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn, corn flakes, and flash frozen corn nibblets."
134493,517,261,1110000,Marge Simpson,Car,"I'm proud of you. Society may have crumbled, but our decency hasn't."
134524,517,262,1115000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Now to save these sorry souls from a life of anarchy, starvation, and having sex for procreation."
134527,517,265,1129000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Everything's normal. The world didn't end.
134528,517,266,1134000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Dad, you said people would be drinking each other's blood."
134529,517,267,1137000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"You got to watch a VHS copy of ""Red Dawn"" thirteen times. Stop complaining."
134530,517,268,1143000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Square,What happened with the E.M.P.?
134531,517,269,1145000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Town Square,"Only Springfield lost power, you see, and after a few days, it came back. Maybe a little bit brighter."
134532,517,270,1150000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Town Square,And the spirit of neighborly cooperation broke out as if all the weird angry people had left.
134533,517,271,1157000,Lloyd,Springfield Town Square,Then society didn't crumble? The zoo animals weren't eaten?
134534,517,272,1161000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Square,"No, well, a couple."
134535,517,273,1163000,Lloyd,Springfield Town Square,This non-disaster is a catastrophe!
134536,517,274,1167000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Are you really so disappointed the world didn't end, just so you could be proven right?"
134537,517,275,1173000,Lloyd,Springfield Town Square,"No, no. It's just that in the new world I would have been... a big shot."
134538,517,276,1178000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Town Square,"Well, not for long. Me and the others were planning to overthrow you and seal you in a cave."
134539,517,277,1184000,Lloyd,Springfield Town Square,"Yeah, but what you didn't know was I was gonna poison all your drinking water."
134540,517,278,1189000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Town Square,Which is why I'm only drinking my own urine.
134542,517,280,1194000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Guys, can't you see that even an imperfect society is better than the savagery of creating a new one? I for one am glad we're stuck with civilization and I think we will be for a long, long time."
134543,517,281,1215000,Zombie Kid,Springfield Town Square,I'm hungry.
134544,517,282,1217000,Zombie Dad,Springfield Town Square,"Look, you can have potato chips now, or if you wait ten minutes you can have all the brains you can eat."
134545,517,283,1223000,Zombie Kid,Springfield Town Square,I want both.
