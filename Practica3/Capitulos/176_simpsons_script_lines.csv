39793,176,9,105000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Smithers, I've just seen the most heroic dog on television. He pulled a toddler from the path of a speeding car, then pushed a criminal in front of it. Find this dog. I want to make him my executive vice president."

39808,176,24,171000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Wow. You've got pencils with your name on 'em. Just like a pencil company executive. I'd give anything for one of these.
39784,176,25,178000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Any office supply company can have them made up for you.
39785,176,26,181000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Can I have this one?

39809,176,30,185000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, that's my degree in nuclear physics. I'm sure you all have one."
39810,176,31,189000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, yeah. Carl and I each have a masters. 'Course old Homer, he didn't need a degree. He just showed up the day they opened the plant."
39811,176,32,197000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.
39812,176,33,199000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Um... Yeah... Well, listen, I'm... sure we all have a lot of work to do."
39813,176,34,210000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip. If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know."

39823,176,44,235000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,I'm outta here.
39824,176,45,245000,Auctioneer,Springfield Town Hall,Ladies and gentlemen our next lot is number Seven Fifty-One. How much am I bid for Item Seven Fifty-One -- Seven Five One? Nothing? No bids for Item Seven Fifty-One?

39833,176,54,287000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"My name is Grimes, uh, Simpson. Frank Grimes. I took the trouble to learn your name. The least you can do is learn mine."
39834,176,55,293000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Okay, Grimy!"
39835,176,56,296000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You're eating my special dietetic lunch.

39837,176,58,301000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh. Oh, I'm sorry."
39838,176,59,304000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,The bag was clearly marked. Please be more careful in the future.
39839,176,60,307000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Check.
39840,176,61,324000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Simpson, do you know who chewed my..."
39842,176,63,334000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Factory,Wow! It's filthy... and it's mine.
39846,176,67,358000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"So how's it going, Grimy?"
39847,176,68,361000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my office, Simpson."
39848,176,69,365000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I wish I had a nickel for every time I've heard that. TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME / TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL! So what's new, Grimy?"
39849,176,70,384000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Simpson! You've got a 513!
39850,176,71,386000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No! A 513! In your procedures manual! A 513?!
39851,176,72,393000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Look at your control panel!
39852,176,73,396000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh. A five THIRTEEN. I'll handle it.
39853,176,74,406000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That got it.
39855,176,76,419000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Factory,"Hey, Milhouse! You want a job in my factory?"
39856,176,77,422000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Factory,You don't have a factory.
39857,176,78,424000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Factory,"Hey, I'm a busy man. You want a job or not?"
39858,176,79,427000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Factory,Okay!
39860,176,81,434000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"God, he eats like a pig!"
39861,176,82,436000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I dunno. Pigs tend to chew. I'd say he eats more like a duck.
39862,176,83,443000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, some kind of farm animal, anyway. And earlier today, I saw him asleep inside a radiation suit! Can you imagine that? He was hanging from a coat hook!"
39863,176,84,453000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,He had three beers at lunch. That would make anybody sleepy.
39864,176,85,455000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I've never seen him do any work around here. Wh... what is his job?
39865,176,86,458000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Safety inspector.
39866,176,87,459000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"That irresponsible oaf? A man who, by all rights, should have been killed dozens of times by now?"
39867,176,88,465000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Eh, three hundred sixteen times, by my count."
39868,176,89,467000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That's the man who's in charge of our safety? It boggles the mind.
39869,176,90,471000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It's best not to think about it.
39870,176,91,483000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You idiot! You nearly drank a beaker full of sulfuric acid!
39871,176,92,487000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Acid, eh? Gee, that would have been stupid. Boy would my face have been red!"
39872,176,93,497000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Stop laughing, you imbecile! Don't you realize how close you just came to killing yourself?"
39873,176,94,507000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Who did this to my wall?
39874,176,95,509000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,He did.
39875,176,96,510000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Is this true?
39876,176,97,511000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I-- well-- uh, technically it is true, Sir, but..."
39877,176,98,515000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Come with me.
39878,176,99,518000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,He likes you.
39879,176,100,523000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,How dare you destroy my valuable wall and spill my priceless acid?! Did you really think you were going to get away with it?
39880,176,101,528000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I wasn't...
39881,176,102,529000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Silence! I'm going to give you one more chance -- at a reduced salary. So straighten up and fly right!
39882,176,103,535000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"But, Sir, if I could..."
39883,176,104,543000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hi, Grimy, old buddy."
39884,176,105,545000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I'm not your buddy, Simpson. I don't like you. In fact, I hate you. Stay the hell away from me! Because from now on... we're enemies!"
39885,176,106,554000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Okay. Do I have to do anything?
39889,176,110,565000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, I can't believe it. I've got an enemy. Me! The most beloved man in Springfield."
39890,176,111,571000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, it's a weird world, Homer. As hard as it is to believe, some people don't care for me, neither."
39891,176,112,576000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"No, I won't accept that."
39892,176,113,577000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"No, it's true. I've got their names written down right here, in what I call my, uh, ""enemies list""."
39893,176,114,583000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Jane Fonda, Daniel Schorr, Jack Anderson... Hey, this is Richard Nixon's enemies list! You just crossed out his name and put yours."
39894,176,115,593000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, gimme that. Gimme it back!"
39519,176,116,596000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"""Barney Gumbel""."
39895,176,118,599000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, what'll I do, Moe?"
39896,176,119,601000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, why don't you invite him over to dinner. Turn him from an enemy into a friend. Then when he's not expecting it, bam! The old fork in the eye."
39897,176,120,609000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?
39898,176,121,613000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,There's always a first time.
39900,176,123,619000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This dinner has to go absolutely perfect if Grimy and me are going to be friends. Lisa -- be perfect.
39901,176,124,625000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay.
39902,176,125,625000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge -- perfect. Bart -- perfect. Other kid -- perfect.
39903,176,126,629000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I only have five lobsters. Are you sure he's not bringing anyone with him?
39904,176,127,633000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no. He doesn't know he's coming to dinner. I didn't think he'd come, so I called and said I had something really important to tell him and that I could only tell him about it here."
39905,176,128,642000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's him! It's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him!...
39906,176,129,645000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Calm down, Homer. Calm down. Answer the door."
39907,176,130,653000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Welcome-to-the-Simpson-residence-or-Casa-De-Simpson-as-I-call-it-heh-heh-heh-heh.
39908,176,131,657000,Frank Grimes,Simpson Home,"Yeah. What did you want to see me about, Simpson? This better be important."
39909,176,132,660000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It is. It is. But first let me introduce you to my family. My perfect family.
39910,176,133,667000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is my wife, Marge..."
39911,176,134,669000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hello.
39912,176,135,670000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"... and our beautiful baby. My daughter, Lisa -- I.Q. 156."
39913,176,136,675000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hi.
39914,176,137,676000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"See. And my son, Bart -- he owns a factory downtown."
39915,176,138,680000,Frank Grimes,Simpson Home,"How do you do. Look, Homer, I'm I'm late for my night job at the foundry, so if you don't mind telling m... Good heavens! Th-this is a palace. How can... how in the world can you afford to live in a house like this, Simpson?"
39916,176,139,694000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I 'unno. Don't ask me how the economy works.
39917,176,140,696000,Frank Grimes,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but look at the size of this place. I-I-I live in a single room, above a bowling alley and below another bowling alley."
39918,176,141,703000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wow.
39919,176,142,704000,Frank Grimes,Simpson Home,"I... I'm sorry, isn't that...?"
39920,176,143,705000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, that's me all right. And the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford. And this is when I was on tour with The Smashing Pumpkins. Oh, and here's a picture of me in outer space."
39921,176,144,716000,Frank Grimes,Simpson Home,You. Went into outer space. You.
39922,176,145,719000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sure. You've never been?
39923,176,146,722000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Would you like to see my Grammy Award?
39924,176,147,724000,Frank Grimes,Simpson Home,"No! I wouldn't Gaw, I've had to work hard every day of my life. And what do I have to show for it? This briefcase, and this haircut. And what do you have to show for your lifetime of sloth and ignorance?"
39925,176,148,738000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What?
39926,176,149,739000,Frank Grimes,Simpson Home,"Everything! -- A dream house, two cars, a beautiful wife, a son who owns a factory, fancy clothes, and lobsters for dinner. And do you deserve any of it? No!"
39927,176,150,753000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you saying?
39928,176,151,756000,Frank Grimes,Simpson Home,"I'm saying you're what's wrong with America, Simpson. You coast through life, you do as little as possible and you leech off decent, hard-working people like me. Ha. If you lived in any other country in the world you'd have starved to death long ago."
39929,176,152,771000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"He's got you there, Dad."
39930,176,153,772000,Frank Grimes,Simpson Home,You're a fraud. A... a total fraud.
39931,176,154,776000,Frank Grimes,Simpson Home,It was nice meeting you.
39933,176,156,786000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Factory,"Wow! Adding machines! Industrial waste! What should we do with all this stuff, Bart?"
39934,176,157,794000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Factory,I think we both know the answer to that..
39935,176,158,808000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Factory,Get to work.
39936,176,159,812000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Factory,Wacky shack!
39937,176,160,814000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Factory,"Better be careful, Bart. Look at those warning signs."
39938,176,161,821000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Factory,"Solve your problem, Milhouse?"
39939,176,162,823000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Factory,Yep.
39941,176,164,836000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer...
39942,176,165,837000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, why aren't you at work?"
39943,176,166,838000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The car won't start. And I don't feel very good today. I am at work.
39944,176,167,843000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're afraid to go to work because Frank Grimes will be there, aren't you?"
39945,176,168,847000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wh-- th-- that's crazy talk. You're crazy, Marge. Get off the road."
39948,176,170,854000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"You'll have to face him sometime. And when you do, I'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are."
39949,176,171,860000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,No he won't. He hates me.
39950,176,172,861000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,He doesn't hate you. He just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily and it's been so difficult for him.
39951,176,173,869000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Yeah, yeah, that's his problem. He's a nut. It's not about me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut!"
39952,176,174,878000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Well, maybe... but I'll bet he would be less crazy if you were just a little more... professional in your work."
39954,176,176,887000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Just a little more... Then he won't have any reason to resent you.
39955,176,177,892000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,I'll do it. To professionalism!
39957,176,179,905000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Good morning, fellow employee. You'll notice that I am now a model worker. We should continue this conversation later during the designated break period. Sincerely, Homer Simpson."
39958,176,180,921000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Can you believe that guy? He's in his office making a pathetic attempt to look professional.
39959,176,181,926000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, whaddya got against Homer, anyway?"
39960,176,182,928000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Are you kidding? Does this whole plant have some disease where it can't see that he's an idiot? Look here:
39961,176,183,934000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Accidents have doubled every year since he became safety inspector. And meltdowns have tripled. Has he been fired? No. Has he been disciplined? No, no."
39962,176,184,942000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Aw, everybody makes mistakes. That's why they put erasers on pencils."
39963,176,185,946000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yeah. Homer's okay. Give him a break.
39964,176,186,948000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No! Homer is not ""okay"". And I want everyone in this plant to realize it. I would die a happy man if I could prove to you that Homer Simpson has the intelligence of a six-year-old."
39965,176,187,959000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"So, how you doin'?"
39966,176,188,968000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, here we go."
39967,176,189,985000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh. Design your own power plant, eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am."
39968,176,190,992000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Lenny, tell Mr. Burns I've gone home to work on the contest."
39969,176,191,1005000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh God!
39970,176,193,1016000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Can I go downstairs and see what Dad's doing?
39971,176,194,1023000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I wouldn't bother him, honey. He's making some kind of model for a contest. He says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand."
39972,176,195,1031000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?"
39974,176,197,1043000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Factory,"Oh, boy! Quittin' time!"
39975,176,198,1049000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Factory,"Just a minute, Van Houten. Somebody needs to guard this place tonight so it doesn't get trashed. How'd you like to be night watchman?"
39976,176,199,1056000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Factory,"But, I'm sleepy."
39977,176,200,1057000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Factory,"Ah, no problemo. Here's a nickel for the coffee machine."
39978,176,201,1074000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Factory,So this is my life... At least I've done better than Dad.
39979,176,202,1082000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Factory,"Aw, geez!"
39980,176,203,1085000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Factory,"Milhouse, how could you let this happen? You were supposed to be the night watchman."
39981,176,204,1089000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Factory,I was watching. I saw the whole thing. First it started falling over. Then it fell over.
39982,176,205,1095000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Factory,Wow. I wonder where all the rats are gonna go.
39983,176,206,1105000,Moe Szyslak,Bart's Factory,"Okay, everybody tuck your pants into your socks."
39985,176,208,1111000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"...and the bold, new ideas these tiny tykes unveil for us today could make thousands of jobs like yours obsolete!"
39986,176,209,1122000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Our first little genius is Ralph Wiggum.
39987,176,210,1128000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"It's pretty good, sir."
39988,176,211,1131000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hot tub? Media room? It's supposed to be a power plant, not Aunt Beulah's Bordello. Thank you. Get out. Next."
39989,176,212,1141000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, Ralphy, get off the stage! Sweetheart!"
39990,176,213,1149000,Martin Prince,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Behold! The power plant of the future, today!"
39991,176,214,1156000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Too cold and sterile. Where's the heart?
39992,176,215,1160000,Martin Prince,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,But it really generates power. It's lighting this room right now.
39993,176,216,1167000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You lose! Get off my property!
39994,176,217,1169000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Let's have the next child.
39995,176,218,1173000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Look, everybody! Simpson's in a contest with children!"

39998,176,221,1180000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Could you explain your model, young man?"
39999,176,222,1183000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What's to explain?! He's an idiot!
40000,176,223,1185000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Pipe down!
40001,176,224,1187000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, basically I just copied the plant we have now..."
40003,176,226,1192000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Then I added some fins to lower wind resistance. And this racing stripe here I feel is pretty sharp.
40004,176,227,1198000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Agreed. First prize.
40005,176,228,1200000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What?!

40008,176,231,1204000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,But it-- this was a contest for children!
40009,176,232,1207000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, and Homer beat their brains out!"
40010,176,233,1210000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, I can't stand it any longer! This whole plant is insane! Insane, I tell you!"
40011,176,234,1222000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I can be lazy, too! Look at me!"
40012,176,235,1225000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hi! I'm a worthless employee just like Homer Simpson! Give me a promotion!
40013,176,236,1233000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oooh, I eat like a slob but nobody minds!"
40014,176,237,1240000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'm peeing on the seat. Give me a raise?!
40015,176,238,1244000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Now I'm returning to work without washing my hands. But it doesn't matter, because I'm Homer Simpson!"
40016,176,239,1250000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I don't need to do my work, 'cause someone else will do it for me. D'oh d'oh d'oh!"
40017,176,240,1256000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, you okay, Grimy?"
40018,176,241,1257000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'm better than okay. I'm Homer Simpson.
40019,176,242,1260000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You wish.
40020,176,243,1262000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, hi, Mr. Burns, I'm the worst worker in the world! Time to go home to my mansion and eat my lobster!"
40021,176,244,1271000,Frank Grimes,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"What's this? ""Extremely high voltage""? Well, I don't need safety gloves because I'm Homer Simp..."
40023,176,246,1282000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Cemetery,"Frank Grimes, or ""Grimy"" as he liked to be called, taught us that a man can triumph over adversity. And even though Frank's agonizing struggle through life was tragically cut short, I'm sure he's looking down..."
40024,176,247,1303000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,"Change the channel, Marge."
40026,176,249,1307000,Lenny Leonard,Cemetery,That's our Homer!
