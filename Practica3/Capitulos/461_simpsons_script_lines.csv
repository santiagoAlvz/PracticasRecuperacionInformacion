119318,461,1,3000,Duffman,Moe's Tavern,Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Duffman is here to refill your beers!
119319,461,2,91000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Okay.
119320,461,3,91000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Thank you!
119321,461,4,92000,Duffman,Moe's Tavern,"Now, for the only thing better than Duff..."
119322,461,5,95000,Barflies,Moe's Tavern,Better than Duff? What's he talking about?
119323,461,6,97000,Duffman,Moe's Tavern,...Free Duff stuff!
119324,461,7,98000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, yeah."
119325,461,8,99000,Duffman,Moe's Tavern,"Now, who wants...beer cozies! A shirt that says ""Yo!"" Sassy seat cushions! And Flash drives for your P.C. so you can take your data and back it up!!!"
119326,461,9,113000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I want some of that!
119327,461,10,115000,Duffman,Moe's Tavern,"And now, Duffman has a dinner date with his estranged daughter! Must not bring up why she dropped out of college! It's too sad!"
119329,461,12,126000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Guess what company had a giveaway at Moe's last night?
119330,461,13,131000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No. I won't.
119331,461,14,132000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Keep guessing...
119332,461,15,135000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What's it say, boy?"
119333,461,16,137000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Responsibly.
119336,461,19,141000,Lunchlady Dora,Springfield Elementary School,"Kid, you've been staring at these gelatin desserts for fifteen minutes. Pick one!"
119337,461,20,146000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,It's so hard to decide. Is the yellow one lemon or pineapple?
119338,461,21,151000,Lunchlady Dora,Springfield Elementary School,It's your pet canary! Now scram!
119339,461,22,156000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Hey!
119340,461,23,156000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw haw! You're a spaz!
119341,461,24,159000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"That's not true! First of all, Milhouse fell because you tripped him. Secondly, ""spaz"" is short for ""spastic diplegic,"" someone who suffers from a serious medical condition. Thirdly, your ""haw haw,"" through overuse, has lost its power."
119342,461,25,174000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Wow. I bow before your logic.
119343,461,26,182000,Ms. Dubinsky,Springfield Elementary School,Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice how logically you argue.
119344,461,27,188000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I am one: flattered and two: intrigued. Lisa Simpson."
119345,461,28,192000,Ms. Dubinsky,Springfield Elementary School,Ms. Dubinsky. I'd like to invite you to join our debate team.
119346,461,29,196000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I didn't know we had a debate team.
119347,461,30,198000,Ms. Dubinsky,Springfield Elementary School,"Well it's the one extra-curricular activity that can't be cut, because it requires no equipment."
119348,461,31,203000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"We're low on funding, so Ralph Wiggum will be standing in as your lectern."
119349,461,32,208000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,I'm a furniture!
119350,461,33,213000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,...and that is why hybrid car buyers should be given rebates paid for by taxes on hamburgers.
119351,461,34,221000,Judge Snyder,Springfield Elementary School,"Thank you, Lisa."
119352,461,35,221000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Excuse me. The podiums are needed in the art room as easels.
119353,461,36,225000,Wendell Borton,Springfield Elementary School,Yay!
119354,461,37,228000,Judge Snyder,Springfield Elementary School,"Megan, cross-examination."
119355,461,38,230000,Megan,Springfield Elementary School,"What if someone's driving an old, but functioning, car? Wouldn't the carbon required to create a new hybrid exceed the savings in gas?"
119356,461,39,237000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Initially yes, but--"
119357,461,40,238000,Megan,Springfield Elementary School,And isn't most electricity in the United States ultimately derived from the burning of coal?
119358,461,41,243000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Currently. However, solar and wind are..."
119359,461,42,245000,Megan,Springfield Elementary School,"The sun and the breeze: the two things you know a lot about. Right, Blondie?"
119360,461,43,249000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Blondie?
119361,461,44,250000,Megan,Springfield Elementary School,"Like, totally."
119362,461,45,252000,Megan,Springfield Elementary School,Why don't we get a bitchin' new perm with daddy's credit card?
119364,461,47,256000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"First of all, my father no longer has any functioning credit cards. Secondly, how dare you refer--"
119365,461,48,260000,Megan,Springfield Elementary School,"Ooo, you can count to two. Do you need some ice on your head?"
119367,461,50,268000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I... I...
119368,461,51,271000,Judge Snyder,Springfield Elementary School,The winner by a hair... a brown hair... Megan!
119371,461,54,276000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Sir?
119372,461,55,276000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That hollow mountain in Nevada that was supposed to hold a million years of nuclear waste is full.
119373,461,56,282000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Did they jump on the pile to smoosh it down?
119374,461,57,285000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It went down in one place and up in another. We need somewhere else to dispose of this plutonium.
119375,461,58,289000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Eh, just find the biggest idiot on our payroll and slip it in his bag."
119376,461,59,297000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Ooh. That's a Bingo.
119377,461,60,301000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Mmmm. Good mac and cheese.
119378,461,61,304000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I've had better. Down at the train station.
119379,461,62,308000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'll have to check it out sometime.
119381,461,64,310000,Homer Simpson,Train Station,Mmm.
119382,461,65,312000,Man At Counter,Train Station,Now the best mac and cheese I've ever had is at a bowling alley in Ogdenville.
119383,461,66,316000,Homer Simpson,Train Station,I am pretty full.
119384,461,67,318000,Man At Counter,Train Station,Breadcrumbs on the top.
119385,461,68,319000,Homer Simpson,Train Station,I'm on my way!
119386,461,69,324000,Woman,Train Station,That bag...
119387,461,70,324000,Woman,Train Station,...surely it's attended.
119388,461,71,328000,Woman,Train Station,Unattended bag!
119389,461,72,332000,Train Conductor,Train Station,Allll... panic!
119390,461,73,341000,Chief Wiggum,Train Station,"So, what do you think?"
119391,461,74,343000,Bomb Squad Guy,Train Station,I think we're gonna blow it up and let the bleeding heart liberals ask questions later.
119392,461,75,347000,Liberal Man,Train Station,"Well now, why can't it be blown up by a woman of color?"
119393,461,76,351000,Bomb Squad Guy,Train Station,"Five, four, no time for a full countdown."
119208,461,79,358000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, it's dinner time!"
119395,461,80,367000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"This just in: the suspicious bag detonated at Springfield Union Station today contained deadly plutonium, which can only mean one thing -- a terrorist plot. Enough radioactivity was released to create seventeen Hulks and a Spider-man. Here's an artist's conception:"
119396,461,81,381000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,Quite disturbing.
119398,461,83,385000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"I admit it. Everything I've said about terrorism till now was fear-mongering. But today I monger the truth. To protect our city from all future bombings, dirty, clean, dive or carpet, we have hired an outside consultant from London, England."
119399,461,84,401000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Does he have a cute accent?
119400,461,85,403000,CONSULTANT,Springfield Town Hall,"Why don't you be the judge, young lady?"
119401,461,86,405000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Oooh, he sounds just like Paddington Bear!"
119402,461,87,408000,CONSULTANT,Springfield Town Hall,My name is Nigel Bakerbutcher.
119403,461,88,411000,Nigel Bakerbutcher,Springfield Town Hall,"Sleepy London town. Once upon a time, the only problem we had here was from over-zealous cockney flower sellers."
119404,461,89,418000,Cockney Flower Girls,Springfield Town Hall,"Flowers, guvnor? / A pretty for your button hole? / Hello, hello, hello."
119406,461,91,423000,Nigel Bakerbutcher,Springfield Town Hall,"But in London of the twenty-first century, the watchword is ""vigilance"". London is now ringed by the most comprehensive array of surveillance cameras mankind has ever seen."
119407,461,92,449000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Excuse me! Is this what the framers of the constitution would want?
119408,461,93,453000,Man,Springfield Town Hall,"Well, I'm Wally of Wally's Framers, and this is exactly what I want."
119409,461,94,458000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,How many personal freedoms are we willing to give up in the name of security?
119410,461,95,464000,Cletus Spuckler,Springfield Town Hall,That blonde girl thinks she's smart like us dark hairs.
119411,461,96,467000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Again with the blonde! Why in the world would the color of the hair on someone's head have anything to do with the intelligence within?
119412,461,97,476000,Miss Springfield,Springfield Town Hall,"Yeah, you're so right. I'm smart too. I got Joe to promise to leave his wife when I turn fifty."
119413,461,98,484000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Er, uh, yes. Now, all in favor of these cameras say ""cheese."""
119414,461,99,490000,Audience,Springfield Town Hall,Cheese!
119415,461,100,491000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Those opposed say ""I hate America""."
119416,461,101,491000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,I ha--
119418,461,102,498000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Motion carries. Next up: motion to limit terms of city officials. All in favor say ""I have sex with animals."""
119419,461,103,504000,Cletus Spuckler,Springfield Town Hall,"I do have sex with animals, but I am not in favor of term limits."
119421,461,105,515000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, I know kids have been making fun of your blonde hair, so I got you this book from the ""being different"" section of the bookstore."
119422,461,106,525000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Sally Circle was eating donuts and Ovaltine when her father came in with terrible news.
119423,461,107,525000,Sally's Father,Simpson Home,We're moving to Rectangu-Land! Round up the family and let's roll!
119424,461,108,535000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Everyone was mean to Sally. She was too well-rounded. She felt cornered. They wouldn't let her play four-square or invite her to the box social.
119425,461,109,545000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The end.
119426,461,110,545000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's a rather unambitious book.
119428,461,112,549000,Nigel Bakerbutcher,Springfield,"I want a camera on every light pole, I want two hidden cameras there, open camera there, hidden, hidden...hidden...hidden...cluster! Right there! Yes!"
119429,461,113,561000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield,Um. You ain't gonna like what you see.
119431,461,115,564000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Did you hear about the blonde who couldn't make ice? She lost the recipe!
119433,461,117,566000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,You know why it takes longer to build a blonde snowman? You have to hollow out the head!
119435,461,119,579000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"He sure nailed you, Lis."
119436,461,120,581000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You're blond too.
119437,461,121,582000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Blonde guys aren't dumb. They're evil. Like in ""The Karate Kid"" and World War Two."
119440,461,124,590000,Chief Wiggum,MONITOR ROOM,"All right, boys. Let's see the dark underbelly of our fair burg."
119441,461,125,600000,Chief Wiggum,MONITOR ROOM,"Okay, we got a litterbug on F-6... double homicide in progress on Q-22-- a woman sunbathing topless on R-15!"
119442,461,126,608000,Lou,MONITOR ROOM,"Uh Chief, I think we've got a misuse of police equipment on ZZ-99."
119443,461,127,612000,Chief Wiggum,MONITOR ROOM,Killjoy.
119444,461,128,616000,Chief Wiggum,MONITOR ROOM,"Gas station customer washing windshield without buying gas... girl using White-Out as nail polish... Oh man, this is hard."
119445,461,129,625000,Chief Wiggum,MONITOR ROOM,"Hey, did you get that guy who was parading around naked?"
119446,461,130,628000,Lou,MONITOR ROOM,"He was just jogging in a tan sweat suit, Chief."
119447,461,131,630000,Chief Wiggum,MONITOR ROOM,Are you sure? I thought I saw his...
119448,461,132,632000,Lou,MONITOR ROOM,"That was a fanny pack, worn on the front."
119449,461,133,635000,Chief Wiggum,MONITOR ROOM,But there was a...
119450,461,134,635000,Lou,MONITOR ROOM,Water bottle...
119451,461,135,636000,Chief Wiggum,MONITOR ROOM,But it was...
119452,461,136,636000,Lou,MONITOR ROOM,Leaking.
119453,461,137,637000,Chief Wiggum,MONITOR ROOM,That's it! That's it! I can't take another minute of these stupid screens! Go-- go find some concerned citizens to pick up the slack.
119454,461,138,645000,Lou,MONITOR ROOM,"Well, how many should I get?"
119455,461,139,646000,Chief Wiggum,MONITOR ROOM,"Well, we've got eight chairs, so... No, no, wait. Put one chair in my office facing my desk, so I'll seem like a meetings guy. Have a seat... I'll be with you in one minute... Yeah..."
119456,461,140,659000,Lou,MONITOR ROOM,That's a new low.
119458,461,142,661000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"We have chosen you to help out because you are all that rare combination: prying, but not pervy."
119460,461,144,669000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Now just follow a little formula called P.B. & J.: Peer at the monitor, Be judgmental, and Jot it down. One way to remember that is A.B.C.: Always Be Considering P.B. & J. But the single most important rule is the four A's: Always Act According to A.B.C."
119461,461,145,691000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Police Station,Uh-oh.
119462,461,146,692000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"What is it, Ned?"
119463,461,147,693000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Police Station,I've got two teens in a public park goin' at it like a couple of gibbons in the back seat of Noah's Ark!
119464,461,148,697000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Should we inform the Chief?
119465,461,149,699000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Police Station,Maybe. But I feel a little like I'm the Tom Voyeur to these Huckleberry Sinners.
119466,461,150,704000,Nigel Bakerbutcher,Springfield Police Station,Or you could correct the behavior yourself with our Nag-a-sonic speakers.
119467,461,151,709000,Nigel Bakerbutcher,Springfield Police Station,Oi! Snogging people!
119469,461,153,712000,Shauna Chalmers,Park,What the hell was that?!
119470,461,154,713000,Nigel Bakerbutcher,Park,"Tongues where I can see them, please."
119471,461,155,715000,Shauna Chalmers,Park,I ain't lettin' you touch me with somebody watchin'.
119472,461,156,717000,Jimbo Jones,Park,"C'mon, baby, it's just a voice."
119473,461,157,720000,Shauna Chalmers,Park,"Don't push it, Kearney."
119417,461,158,722000,Jimbo Jones,Park,I'm Jimbo!
119474,461,159,722000,Shauna Chalmers,Park,Great. Make me look easy in front of the voice.
119475,461,160,726000,Jimbo Jones,Park,But you are easy -- don't be ashamed of what you are! Shauna!
119477,461,162,732000,Ned Flanders,SURVEILLANCE CENTER,I've gone from lookie-loo to talkie-too.
119478,461,163,735000,Ned Flanders,SURVEILLANCE CENTER,"Excuse me, that's your salad fork!... That Wi-Fi's for hotel guests only!... What's the matter, sir, too cool to sing ""Happy Birthday?"""
119479,461,164,740000,Ned Flanders,SURVEILLANCE CENTER,"Isn't this great, Marge? We're like Jiminy Cricket for the whole ding-dang town. A half-man, half-bug that knows what's best for everybody. Um-hm."
119480,461,165,753000,Marge Simpson,SURVEILLANCE CENTER,"I don't know... I'm starting to think we're prying too much into people's lives, and this room isn't really the best place for Maggie to hang out."
119481,461,166,761000,Marge Simpson,SURVEILLANCE CENTER,"That's not Sesame Street, that's a gay bar."
119482,461,167,770000,Marge Simpson,SURVEILLANCE CENTER,"Although I guess this would teach her sharing and caring, but... we're going home."
119484,461,169,791000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dye! Dye! DYE!
119486,461,171,797000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,Tomorrow's forecast is:
119487,461,172,799000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, place your bets."
119488,461,173,801000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Partly cloudy!
119489,461,174,801000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Partly sunny!
119490,461,175,803000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Golf ball-sized hail!
119491,461,176,805000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,A chance of severe thunder storms with golf ball-sized hail!
119492,461,177,809000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Woo-hoo!
119493,461,178,809000,Ned Flanders,Moe's Tavern,Ahem!
119494,461,179,811000,Ned Flanders,Moe's Tavern,"I spy, with my electronic eye, illegal wagering!"
119495,461,180,815000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, weren't these cameras installed to keep America's enemies from blowin' up our homeland?"
119496,461,181,820000,Ned Flanders,Moe's Tavern,"Well, sir, how many times have you been blown up since the cameras went in?"
119497,461,182,823000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Zero times.
119498,461,183,825000,Ned Flanders,Moe's Tavern,"Mm-hmm! Now I'm gonna go tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk till you give the money back. Tsk, tsk, tsk."
119500,461,185,842000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,All right! All right!
119501,461,186,844000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I'm goin' home. It's not safe in here.
119504,461,189,853000,Ned Flanders,Springfield,Don't use that dog as a ramp...
119506,461,191,854000,Ned Flanders,MONITOR ROOM,Less radical... less radical!
119508,461,193,859000,Ned Flanders,Springfield,Stop gleaming that cube!
119510,461,195,865000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So you like to watch, huh?! Well, take a look at this!"
119513,461,198,873000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Buttocks!
119514,461,199,875000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Tushie!
119516,461,201,879000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, a blind spot!"
119518,461,203,886000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Backyard,Boy cheeks!... Fanny!... Derriere!... Hiney!... Backside!... ...Cover up that coin slot!
119519,461,204,899000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Hey boy, whatcha doing?"
119520,461,205,901000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Experimenting with my butt.
119521,461,206,902000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,My little Einstein.
119523,461,208,915000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Welcome to Chaos Corners, the Pleasure Patch, Satan's Triangle...the one place in town no cameras can see you and no laws can touch you!"
119524,461,209,928000,Brandine Del Roy,Evergreen Terrace,Oh yeah. That stopped the kicking.
119526,461,211,934000,Ned Flanders,SURVEILLANCE CENTER,"Inspiration Point looks pretty uninspired... All's quiet in Murder Town... Yep, Springfield is cleaner than the Lord's hand towels."
