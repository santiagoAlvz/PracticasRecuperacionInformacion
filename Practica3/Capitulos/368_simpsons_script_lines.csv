95425,368,16,109000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But it's the teacher who's bullying me.
95426,368,17,111000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, tell your regular bully. He won't like it one bit."
95427,368,18,114000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I ripped my pants! The only pants that understand my complex hiney."
95428,368,19,120000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That was your last pair! How did it happen?

95444,368,37,215000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why'd I put this in here?

95459,368,52,254000,Coach Krupt,Springfield Elementary School,"What is your major malfunction, Simpson?! You will defrost, drain, and surrender that ball. And then I will use it to bombard you! Bombardment!"

95463,368,56,276000,Groundskeeper Willie,Shack,Me shack! It's ruin't!
95464,368,57,278000,Groundskeeper Willie,Shack,"Ya red, rubber home-wrecker!"
95467,368,60,287000,Bart Simpson,BEHIND THE SCHOOL,"Listen, I'm real sorry I busted your shack. Let me make it up to you. I know a ravine where there's a rusted-out car."
95468,368,61,294000,Groundskeeper Willie,BEHIND THE SCHOOL,Don't be tantalizin' me with tales of ravines and rusted-out cars. I'll only be gettin' me heart broke.
95469,368,62,303000,Bart Simpson,BEHIND THE SCHOOL,"That's my mom, I gotta go. I finished nailing this board."
95470,368,63,306000,Bart Simpson,BEHIND THE SCHOOL,"Oh yeah, you're out of nails."
95472,368,65,317000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,Poor Willie. Would you like to spend the night with us?
95473,368,66,321000,Groundskeeper Willie,Marge's Car,I don't need your charity! Not as long as I've got a pan over me head!
95474,368,67,326000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,"That's not a pan, it's a colander!"
95475,368,68,329000,Groundskeeper Willie,Marge's Car,"Aw, so that's where all my soup went."
95477,368,70,335000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,"Thanks for takin' me in, Misses. Please accept this in return: it's me most prized possession."
95478,368,71,342000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,It's a sculpture made of children's lost retainers.
95479,368,72,346000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh... ooh, ooh, it's lovely. I like this part in here... the way it, um, it goes."
95480,368,73,360000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Willie? I hope I'm not being too personal, but you seem resigned to a life of abject squalor."
95481,368,74,365000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,My family's used to it. Me grandfather used to get sent down into the mines to make sure it was safe for the canaries.
95482,368,75,374000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't you ever hope for anything better?
95483,368,76,376000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,Something better? For Willie?
95484,368,77,379000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,ALL I WANT IS A PLACE SOMEWHERE...

95486,368,79,388000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,That's it.
95487,368,80,389000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe you could aim a little higher.
95488,368,81,392000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,"Well, let's see... OH, TO HAVE ME SHACK REBUILT / GET MY ROTTEN TEETH ALL DRILL'T /"
95489,368,82,402000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,"SOMETHING ON UNDERNEATH ME KILT / OH, WOULDN'T IT BE ADEQUATE? /"
95490,368,83,409000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,MATCHING SHOES FOR BOTH ME FEET /
95491,368,84,413000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,DINING ON UNTAINTED MEAT / A TOILET WHAT STILL HAS ITS SEAT /
95492,368,85,421000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"OH, WOULDN'T IT BE ADEQUATE?"
95493,368,86,426000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,ADEQUATE... ADEQUATE...
95494,368,87,429000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,WOULDN'T IT BE ADEQUATE!
95495,368,88,439000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,"You're right, Lisa! I do want to better me lot. To live like a normal..."

95498,368,91,452000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I bet I could turn him into a proper gentleman! And I will do it in time for the School Science Fair!
95499,368,92,459000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're on, Lis."
95500,368,93,460000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I think you'll find that deep down, anyone can be civilized. Goodnight, Willie."

95502,368,95,479000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Willie, in the next few weeks I'll be teaching you poise, pronunciation and posture. Let's see you stand up as straight as you can."
95503,368,96,486000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,"Well, there's a first time for everything."
95504,368,97,491000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,"Ach! I'm too far off the ground! Lisa, come up here and help me down!"
95505,368,98,500000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,"So, how'm I doin'?"
95509,368,102,508000,Eli Stern VI,OWNER'S OFFICE,"Mr. Simpson, I appreciate how much you love our big blue trousers, but I'm afraid we just don't make them anymore. Sales plummeted after our disastrous Super Bowl ad."
95510,368,103,518000,Announcer,OWNER'S OFFICE,Big blue pants. When you no longer care if you're attractive to women.
95511,368,104,543000,Homer Simpson,OWNER'S OFFICE,"Mr. Stern, would you make those glorious blue pants again if I whipped up public interest for them?"
95512,368,105,549000,Eli Stern VI,OWNER'S OFFICE,"Of course, but how?"
95513,368,106,550000,Homer Simpson,OWNER'S OFFICE,"Through an advertising campaign so fresh and exciting, I haven't even thought of it yet."
95514,368,107,554000,Eli Stern VI,OWNER'S OFFICE,"Well, what have I got to lose, besides the factory that's been in my family for generations?"
95515,368,108,562000,Homer Simpson,OWNER'S OFFICE,How long is this commercial anyway?
95516,368,109,564000,Eli Stern VI,OWNER'S OFFICE,"I don't know. I've uh, never made it to the end."
95518,368,111,569000,Lisa Simpson,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,Okay. How do you address an Archbishop?
95519,368,112,574000,Groundskeeper Willie,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya for what ya done to me!
95520,368,113,580000,Groundskeeper Willie,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,"Lisa, you're a sweet lass, but it's hopeless. Like me Dad told me..."
95521,368,114,586000,Willie's Dad,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,"You'll never amount to anything! You were born trash, and you'll be lucky if you grow up to be garbage!"
95523,368,116,595000,Scottish Nurse,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,Would you like to cut the cord?
95524,368,117,596000,Willie's Dad,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,Let him cut it himself. It's time he learned life ain't one big party!
95525,368,118,601000,Groundskeeper Willie,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,That was the last time we really talked.
95527,368,120,606000,DOLPH,Simpson Home,What the hell are they doin' in there?
95528,368,121,608000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Simpson Home,Lisa bet Bart she can turn Willie into a proper gentleman.
95529,368,122,612000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,That's as unlikely as Kearney going around the world in eighty days.
95530,368,123,616000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Simpson Home,"Eighty days? Ample time to circumnavigate the globe, Booger Breath."
95531,368,124,621000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,"You, sir, have a wager!"
95532,368,125,623000,DOLPH,Simpson Home,I shall hold the money!
95533,368,126,629000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Simpson Home,To Istanbul!
95534,368,127,631000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,"Wrong way, dingus!"
95536,368,129,639000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, what's that?"
95537,368,130,641000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh?
95538,368,131,642000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,On the back of your head.
95539,368,132,644000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's called ""headvertising."" It creates brand awareness without relying on traditional media."
95540,368,133,650000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it creeps me out!"
95541,368,134,653000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, it glows in the dark."
95542,368,135,655000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not supposed to.
95543,368,136,662000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Alright, let's just try one more lesson. Repeat after me: ""What flows from the nose does not go on the clothes."""
95544,368,137,664000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,What flows from me nose... Uh... It's no use. I'm not very cultured. I don't even have a last name!
95545,368,138,681000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Care to concede that bet?
95546,368,139,683000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No! C'mon, Willie. I believe in you!"
95547,368,140,689000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,What flows from the nose does not go on my clothes.
95548,368,141,696000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Say it again!
95549,368,142,700000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,WHAT FLOWS FROM THE NOSE / DOES NOT GO ON MY CLOTHES!
95550,368,143,704000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I THINK HE'S GOT IT! OH YES HE'S GOT IT!
95551,368,144,709000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,WHAT FLOWS FROM THE NOSE
95552,368,145,711000,Groundskeeper Willie's Reflection,Simpson Home,DOES NOT GO ON MY CLOTHES!
95553,368,146,715000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,A talkin' mirror!
95554,368,147,718000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,WHERE IS THAT GHASTLY FLOW?
95555,368,148,721000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,THE NOSE! THE NOSE!
95556,368,149,724000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,AND WHERE SHOULD IT NOT GO?

95558,368,151,730000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, get your own song."

95560,368,153,733000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'M GETTING BLUE PANTS IN THE MORNING / DING DONG THE ZIPPER'S GONNA SHINE...
95562,368,155,740000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Gee, Homer, if those blue pants mean that much to you, they must be the greatest."
95563,368,156,744000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,I'm gettin' two pair today!
95564,368,157,746000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"I don't get this. This guy paints his noggin and you guys are ready to buy pants. Meanwhile, I been payin' for that billboard outside for a year now, and it's not yieldin' nothin'!"
95565,368,158,755000,Moe Recording,Moe's Tavern,You don't have to look at me. You don't have to look at me.
95566,368,159,760000,Woman,Moe's Tavern,"Well, he does have billboard money. Talking billboard money."
95568,368,161,769000,Woman,Moe's Tavern,Ew... But he might be right for my friend.

95576,368,169,808000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"And you may meet him again... as your new father! Hubba, hubba, mommy like!"
148042,368,170,817000,G. K. Willington,Springfield Elementary School,"If you ask me, the Royal Shakespeare Company's latest season was ""much ado about nothing."""
95578,368,172,824000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Ha! I get that reference. And you can get me any time you want, handsome."
148043,368,173,830000,G. K. Willington,Springfield Elementary School,I would be delighted to dine with you on the twelfth.
95579,368,174,838000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You're a smash G. K.!
148044,368,175,840000,G. K. Willington,Springfield Elementary School,It feels so sublime! I feel like I... COULD BE INDOORS ALL NIGHT / COULD USE A FORK AND KNIFE
148045,368,176,850000,G. K. Willington,Springfield Elementary School,AND NEVER SOIL MY SUIT.

95580,368,179,903000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to announce the winner of the science fair. Though I must note I'm surprised Lisa Simpson didn't enter a project this year!"
95582,368,181,912000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"That's where you're wrong, Principal Skinner. I did enter a project... and it's been in plain sight the entire evening!"
95583,368,182,922000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Mr. G. K. Willington is not who he seems. In fact, he's someone you all know quite well!"
95584,368,183,928000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Is it me?
95585,368,184,929000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I give you... Groundskeeper Willie!

148048,368,190,961000,G. K. Willington,Simpson Home,"Good morning, Lisa! What's the lesson for today? How to smoke a pipe while summoning a falcon?"
148049,368,191,968000,G. K. Willington,Simpson Home,"Put the kettle on, Featherbee. I'll be home soon."
95591,368,192,973000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Willie, there are no more lessons. You're a proper gentleman, my work is done."
148050,368,193,977000,G. K. Willington,Simpson Home,But... I don't know what to do with myself. All I've ever been is a groundskeeper.
95592,368,194,981000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And that job's taken. Skinner dumped it on the next-lowest guy on the totem pole.
95594,368,196,985000,Dewey Largo,Springfield Elementary School,Oh for goodness sakes!
95595,368,197,987000,Dewey Largo,Springfield Elementary School,How did I get up here?!
