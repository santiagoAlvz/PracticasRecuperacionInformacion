129193,498,1,48000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"...and that's why I really don't believe there's a God. Thank you, and God bless America."
129194,498,2,102000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Moe's Tavern,You were only supposed to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.
129195,498,3,105000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Well I'm pretty sure it was in there somewhere.
129196,498,4,108000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Moe's Tavern,"Now, let me conclude by thanking Moe the Bartender for hosting this meeting while City Hall is fumigated for bedbugs."
129197,498,5,115000,Ned Flanders,Moe's Tavern,Bedbugs? Just why is there a bed in City Hall?
129198,498,6,119000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Moe's Tavern,"Er, uh, meeting adjourned!"
129199,498,7,149000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,This is so convenient! I can go straight from doin' my civic duty to having a beer with my best friend Carl!
129200,498,8,154000,Duffman,Moe's Tavern,And I can toss back a Duff Sangre de los Muertos with my best friend: Mexican Duffman!
129201,498,9,159000,Mexican Duffman,Moe's Tavern,Ho-la!
129202,498,10,161000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey Moe, who's your best friend?"
129203,498,11,163000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Uh...
129204,498,12,164000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well... uh... well, I just made friends with Pepto-Bismol on Facebook and uh... um... Hey, would ya look at that? There's a spot on the bar!"
129205,498,13,174000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Come on!
129206,498,14,174000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,You know what? I think Moe's best friend is really that bar rag!
129209,498,17,182000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,That's even sadder than being friends with Milhouse!
129210,498,18,185000,Milhouse Van Houten,Moe's Tavern,"Y'know something, Bart? I'm getting tired of things like that."
129211,498,19,191000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Tired of what? I dump on you, and you take it -- that's how friendship works."
129212,498,20,195000,Milhouse Van Houten,Moe's Tavern,Not anymore. Friendship over.
129213,498,21,200000,Milhouse Van Houten,Moe's Tavern,Taxi!
129214,498,22,200000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,What gives? He's not crawlin' back.
129215,498,23,204000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Even a kid who wears a ""Finding Nemo"" back brace has some pride. You went too far this time, Bart."
129216,498,24,212000,Sadistic Barfly,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, Moe! I got a job here for your ""best friend,"" the bar rag."
129217,498,25,216000,The Rich Texan,Moe's Tavern,Me too!
129219,498,27,216000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Witty.
129220,498,28,223000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Great meeting though.
129221,498,29,227000,Bar Rag,Moe's Tavern,"Yes, that's right, everyone laugh at the rag. But I was not always this be-stainèd swatch you see before you. Oh no, gentles. We begin in early medieval France..."
129223,498,31,247000,Bar Rag,VILLAGE,...A young peasant wife struggles to feed her family...
129225,498,33,251000,Bartholomé,MEDIEVAL SHACK,"Maman, we are starving..."
129226,498,34,253000,Lise,MEDIEVAL SHACK,Listen to the grumbling of our estomacs!
129227,498,35,258000,Marguerite,MEDIEVAL SHACK,That's not your estomacs! It's some men speaking French!
129229,498,37,265000,Marguerite,MEDIEVAL SHACK,"Now, I have work to do. Complain to your papa."
129230,498,38,267000,Lise,MEDIEVAL SHACK,Papa? He is no help at all.
129231,498,39,270000,Homeur,MEDIEVAL SHACK,"Marguerite, I leave to fight in Flanders! Stupid Flanders."
129232,498,40,279000,Archbishop Smithers,MEDIEVAL SHACK,All tremble before the duc de Springfield!
129233,498,41,283000,Le Duc,MEDIEVAL SHACK,"That's enough! Madame, I would like you to weave me a tapestry with the following images:"
129234,498,42,284000,Le Duc,MEDIEVAL SHACK,Me healing the sick...
129235,498,43,290000,Le Duc,MEDIEVAL SHACK,Me killing the healthy...
129236,498,44,291000,Le Duc,MEDIEVAL SHACK,Me marrying my sister...
129237,498,45,293000,Le Duc,MEDIEVAL SHACK,A long winter where nothing happens...
129238,498,46,295000,Le Duc,MEDIEVAL SHACK,"Me relaxing with friends...You know, the standard stuff. For this, I shall pay you two copper coins. You have twenty-five years to complete it. You may have one fifteen-minute déjeuner."
129239,498,47,313000,Le Duc,MEDIEVAL SHACK,"Oh, these innocent creatures are blocking my path. I could walk six paces that way... or I could kill them all right now!"
129240,498,48,322000,Le Duc,MEDIEVAL SHACK,I am heartily sorry and confess all my sins.
129241,498,49,324000,ARCHBISHOP,MEDIEVAL SHACK,Absolved!
129242,498,50,327000,Le Duc,MEDIEVAL SHACK,Allons-y!
129243,498,51,327000,Bar Rag,MEDIEVAL SHACK,"In their dying fury, those beasts began expelling demon wool."
129244,498,52,335000,Bar Rag,MEDIEVAL SHACK,"And the restless spirits of those murdered sheep compelled Marguerite to loom ceaselessly, even as her husband went off to fight again and again and again..."
129246,498,54,362000,Bar Rag,MEDIEVAL SHACK,"As the years went by, the images she loomed were not of the Duc, but rather depictions of the adventures that cloth would experience over the centuries."
129247,498,55,375000,Bar Rag,MEDIEVAL SHACK,"Oh, and by the way..."
129249,498,57,377000,Bar Rag,Moe's Tavern,That tapestry was me.
129250,498,58,380000,Sponge,Moe's Tavern,"Right, and I was the Gutenberg Bible."
129251,498,59,383000,Bartholomé,Moe's Tavern,"Maman, we have failed to grow."
129252,498,60,385000,Lise,Moe's Tavern,We've had too little food!
129253,498,61,387000,Marguerite,Moe's Tavern,Is it too little food or too much complaining?
129254,498,62,390000,Lise,Moe's Tavern,"Maman, you are overstressed. You need a vacation. Perhaps to the South of France."
129255,498,63,395000,Marguerite,Moe's Tavern,We're in the South of France!
129257,498,65,398000,Bar Rag,French Village,"One day, as rosy-fingered Dawn wiped the morning gunk from her eyes, the Duc came to claim his infernal drapes..."
129259,498,67,408000,Homeur,MARGUERITE'S HOUSE,What an age for prosthetics we live in.
129260,498,68,414000,Le Duc,MARGUERITE'S HOUSE,Silence! I have reached my verdict. It's not what I expected...
129262,498,70,419000,Le Duc,MARGUERITE'S HOUSE,And yet... it's beautiful!
129264,498,72,423000,Le Duc,MARGUERITE'S HOUSE,But it's also not what I expected. Burn down their house!
129266,498,74,433000,Bar Rag,CLIFFSIDE ROAD,But Le Duc was about to be called home to the worst kind of hell: medieval hell.
129269,498,77,449000,French Wiggum,BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF,"Hey, let's show some French courage and beat up the corpse!"
129270,498,78,454000,French Wiggum,BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF,"C'mon, Ralphie, have a try."
129271,498,79,458000,French Wiggum,BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF,We're submitting that to France's Funniest Cave Paintings.
129272,498,80,472000,Bar Rag,BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF,"Even for a tapestry made of demon wool, this was hard to watch."
129273,498,81,477000,Bar Rag,BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF,I was moved to a magnificent cathedral...and learned that tapestries were the rock stars of the Middle Ages. I had legions of what you now call groupies.
129275,498,83,488000,Bar Rag,BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF,It felt like the good times known as the middle ages would never end. But then cruel fate knocked upon the door...
129278,498,86,500000,Viking Lenny,Cathedral,"Guys, it ain't working -- the door's too strong."
129279,498,87,508000,Viking Homer,Cathedral,Go Vikings!
129280,498,88,511000,Monk #2,Cathedral,Ow! Stop it!
129281,498,89,513000,Monk #3,Cathedral,You just broke your vow of silence.
129282,498,90,515000,Monk #2,Cathedral,It wasn't a vow. I just didn't want to talk to you.
129284,498,92,519000,Viking Homer,Cathedral,This Viking stuff is too dangerous. I'm going to become a gentleman art thief.
129285,498,93,527000,Viking Homer,Cathedral,Huh? Hm? What the--
129286,498,94,532000,Viking Homer,Cathedral,Spooky. Hm... hm...
129287,498,95,536000,Bar Rag,Cathedral,That was the first time I knew anguish and fear. Nothing will ever staunch the pain of that memory.
129289,498,97,545000,Bar Rag,Moe's Tavern,"Well, that helps."
129291,498,99,545000,Bart Simpson,Milhouse's Bedroom,Milhouse!
129292,498,100,554000,Bart Simpson,Milhouse's Bedroom,Milhouse!
129293,498,101,554000,Milhouse Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,What do you wa--
129295,498,103,564000,Milhouse Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,"What is it, Bart?"
129296,498,104,567000,Bart Simpson,Milhouse's Bedroom,"Listen, um... after our fight, I couldn't sleep."
129297,498,105,569000,Milhouse Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,"Well, I was doing fine. Warm glass of milk, some choice cuts from The Wriggles and I was out."
129298,498,106,577000,Bart Simpson,Milhouse's Bedroom,"C'mon, man. At least listen to what I have to say."
129299,498,107,580000,Milhouse Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,Okayyy...
129300,498,108,582000,Bart Simpson,Milhouse's Bedroom,Um... well... this is usually the part where you say you're sorry.
129301,498,109,588000,Milhouse Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,"Bart, I'm not your puppet."
129302,498,110,589000,Bart Simpson,Milhouse's Bedroom,"I know, I made you into a real boy last week."
129303,498,111,592000,Milhouse Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,And I'll always be grateful. But it's time you started treating me with respect.
129304,498,112,599000,Kirk Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,"They're a tough pair, huh?"
129305,498,113,604000,Luann Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,Kir--
129306,498,114,606000,Kirk Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,If you let me in I'll give you the Heimlich!
129308,498,116,610000,Bar Rag,Moe's Tavern,So to recap: I had been unjustly torn from my lofty perch.
129309,498,117,616000,Bar Rag,Moe's Tavern,I wound up as a barter in Persia...
129311,498,119,621000,Persian Trader,Persia,You have taken our gold and jewels and given us this faded cloth?!
129312,498,120,625000,Christian Homer,Persia,"That's right. And if anyone asked who swindled you, it was Christians. Remember that name: Christians."
129313,498,121,634000,Bar Rag,Persia,I found myself in the court of the young Persian King. A cruel king who demanded constant entertainment from his wives.
129314,498,122,652000,King Nelson,Persia,Eh. Throw her in the pit of boring wives!
129315,498,123,659000,Discarded Wives,Persia,We never go out anymore. / Are you even listening to me? / My sister has a much bigger pit.
129316,498,124,663000,Servant Jimbo,Persia,"Dude, you've already discarded, like, five hundred wives."
129317,498,125,667000,King Nelson,Persia,I think it's weird that you're counting. Send in the next one!
129318,498,126,675000,Scheherazade,Persia,"Good evening, your majesty. May I tell you your slippers are as curly as everyone says?"
129319,498,127,683000,King Nelson,Persia,Pit her.
129320,498,128,685000,Scheherazade,Persia,"Wait, wait, wait... I can, uh, tell you a story!"
129321,498,129,688000,King Nelson,Persia,Cease your dragging!
129322,498,130,691000,Scheherazade,Persia,Uh... there once was a boy named Ali Baba. He and his elder brother Cassim were the sons of a merchant who traded in camels and spices and--
129324,498,131,703000,King Nelson,Persia,"Okay, just a couple thoughts on your direction so far..."
129325,498,132,710000,Scheherazade,Persia,"One day, while out for a walk, Ali Baba was set upon by a thief."
129327,498,134,717000,Scheherazade,Persia,Make that two thieves!
129329,498,136,719000,Scheherazade,Persia,A million thieves!
129331,498,138,721000,Scheherazade,Persia,Forty thieves.
129334,498,141,724000,Bar Rag,Tent,"With her inventiveness and wit, the clever wife entertained her king for a thousand and one nights. And while he slept, she freed her imprisoned compatriots."
129335,498,142,744000,Shauna Chalmers,Tent,"Eh, it was cooler in the pit."
129336,498,143,753000,Scheherazade,Tent,... and that's how the camel got its hump.
129337,498,144,753000,King Nelson,Tent,Another story!
129338,498,145,759000,SCHERAZADE,Tent,"For once, couldn't you just take a few minutes to let the previous story sink in?"
129339,498,146,765000,King Nelson,Tent,You dare refuse your king? Guards!
129340,498,147,769000,King Nelson,Tent,Uh-oh.
129341,498,148,777000,Bar Rag,Tent,My downward spiral continued.
129342,498,149,792000,Spanish Man,Tent,Only cowards use blindfolds.
129343,498,150,795000,Spanish Man,Tent,I didn't know you were doing that!
129344,498,151,801000,Bar Rag,Tent,I was unfit for even the most sordid uses.
129345,498,152,804000,Executioner,Tent,"How's your neck, your Lordship? No splinters or nuffin'?"
129346,498,153,807000,Nobleman,Tent,I fear the axe less than that filthy rag.
129347,498,154,810000,Executioner,Tent,"You talk fancy now, but you'll twitch like the rest."
129348,498,155,813000,Nobleman,Tent,All too true I fear.
129349,498,156,814000,Executioner,Tent,Shut up!
129350,498,157,816000,Nobleman,Tent,Your tongue is even sharper than your--
129351,498,158,818000,Bar Rag,Tent,"But then, at my lowest ebb, a moment of hope."
129352,498,159,821000,Bar Rag,Tent,I played a pivotal role in creating one of the masterpieces of Western Art!
129354,498,161,827000,Pope Julius,Sistine Chapel,Michelangelo!
129355,498,162,829000,Pope Julius,Sistine Chapel,When will you be finished?
129356,498,163,830000,Michelangelo,Sistine Chapel,"Hey, you want a quickie? You go to Raphael, baby."
129357,498,164,833000,Bar Rag,Sistine Chapel,The artist was never satisfied...
129358,498,165,837000,Pope Julius,Sistine Chapel,How 'bout now?
129359,498,166,837000,Michelangelo,Sistine Chapel,No.
129360,498,167,843000,Pope Julius,Sistine Chapel,That's perfect!
129362,498,168,845000,Michelangelo,Sistine Chapel,Now would you like to protect your investment with a clear coat?
129363,498,169,848000,Pope Julius,Sistine Chapel,Let me discuss it with my wife.
129364,498,170,851000,Bar Rag,Sistine Chapel,The masterpiece was finished... and so was the use for me.
129365,498,171,856000,Bar Rag,Sistine Chapel,And then...
129368,498,174,862000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Y'know, Moe, it might be time to buy a new bar rag."
129369,498,175,866000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, yeah, sure thing, I'll get right on it."
129370,498,176,868000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"No way I would abandon you, Raggie."
129371,498,177,871000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,You're my best friend.
129373,498,179,887000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"So, I guess you didn't eat that ""special cheese"" that I gave you yesterday, huh?"
129376,498,182,904000,Bart Simpson,Milhouse's Bedroom,"Milhouse! What do I have to do, besides changing in any way, to get you to forgive me?"
129377,498,183,909000,Milhouse Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,"Gee, Bart. You seem, uh, how can I put it? Milhousey."
129378,498,184,914000,Bart Simpson,Milhouse's Bedroom,"Really? It's not that bad, is it?"
129379,498,185,917000,Milhouse Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,"Bart, you'll never learn."
129380,498,186,919000,Bart Simpson,Milhouse's Bedroom,"Milhouse, you're the closest thing I have to a brother. A brother with the wisdom of an older sister. And that's why we squabble, 'cause families always do. But in the end, they're still a family. What do you say... brother?"
129381,498,187,933000,Milhouse Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,Not bad. Did Lisa write that?
129382,498,188,939000,Lisa Simpson,Milhouse's Bedroom,Yes I did. Now I'm going to bed.
129383,498,189,942000,Milhouse Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,"I want something that comes from you, Bart. We're done here."
129384,498,190,946000,Bart Simpson,Milhouse's Bedroom,But-but-but...
129385,498,191,947000,Milhouse Van Houten,Milhouse's Bedroom,The glasses are off!
129387,498,193,956000,Bar Rag,Moe's Tavern,My degradation continued.
129388,498,194,959000,Bar Rag,Moe's Tavern,An enterprising seamstress turned me into the flag of a fledgling nation.
129389,498,195,964000,Bar Rag,Moe's Tavern,"Unfortunately, a nation on the wrong side of history."
129392,498,198,973000,Bar Rag,Dust Bowl,"Like everyone else, I was hit hard by the depression."
129394,498,200,977000,Bart Simpson,Shack,"What's for dinner, ma?"
129395,498,201,978000,Marge Simpson,Shack,Rag soup!
129323,498,202,985000,Homer Simpson,Shack,Needs flavor.
129396,498,203,989000,Homer Simpson,Shack,That's better.
129398,498,205,995000,Bar Rag,Mt. Everest,I was part of an expedition to the top of Mount Everest. One that had the distinction of failing un-heroically.
129399,498,206,1002000,Homer Simpson,Mt. Everest,Oxygen... I need oxygen.
129400,498,207,1007000,Bart Simpson,Mt. Everest,"C'mon, man. A few more balloons and this'll look really awesome."
129402,498,209,1011000,Comic Book Guy,Mt. Everest,Worst climbing Everest.
129403,498,210,1016000,Bar Rag,Mt. Everest,A Yeti found me and brought me home as a present to his son.
129406,498,213,1025000,Bar Rag,Moe's Tavern,"And now my thousand-year fall from grace is complete. I guess I should be happy here, with my sad, but predictable..."
129407,498,214,1034000,Bar Rag,Moe's Tavern,"Moe! Moe! Wake up! Oh no, I don't want to find out what's worse than you!"
129409,498,216,1044000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,Milhouse.
129410,498,217,1045000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,"I've been out here all night, man. Just let me know what it'll take for you to forgive me."
129411,498,218,1049000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Can I punch you?
129412,498,219,1049000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,Sure.
129413,498,220,1051000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Can I... have someone else punch you?
129414,498,221,1053000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,"Sure, what've you got? Puppy Goo-Goo comin' my way?"
