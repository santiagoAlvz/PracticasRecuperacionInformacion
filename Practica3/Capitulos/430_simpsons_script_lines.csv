111549,430,53,364000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD HIGH (1970S) - AUDITORIUM,No. Yes.
111552,430,56,368000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, Homer, you wanna try my new Vance Connor-politan? Like Vance, it is smooth, cool and oh-so-sophisticated."
111553,430,57,376000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I'll just stick with my beer.
111554,430,58,378000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, why are you so down on Vance Connor? He gave me one of his kidneys."
111555,430,59,380000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, me too."
111556,430,60,383000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Because when Vance beat me in that election, he ruined my life."
111557,430,61,388000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Why did you just exchange that look of guilt?
111559,430,62,391000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Lenny, uh, I think it's time for us to come clean."
111560,430,63,394000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,About how we give each other haircuts?
111561,430,64,396000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"No, we'll take that secret to our graves. I'm talkin' about uh , you know..."
111562,430,65,401000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, right! Listen, Homer, somethin' weird happened back in high school..."
111564,430,67,407000,Lenny Leonard,SPRINGFIELD HIGH SCHOOL (1970S),Teenage Carl and I were walking down the hallway when:
111565,430,68,409000,Principal Dondelinger,SPRINGFIELD HIGH SCHOOL (1970S),You two! I want you to take this box and bury it in the woods. The true results of this election must never be known.
111566,430,69,419000,Teenage Carl,SPRINGFIELD HIGH SCHOOL (1970S),"Tell you what -- we'll do it under one condition: our parents want us to go to college, but with a bad enough recommendation from you, we can stay here and party."
111567,430,70,427000,Principal Dondelinger,SPRINGFIELD HIGH SCHOOL (1970S),"Okay, but screw this up, and it's Carnegie-Mellon University for the both of you!"
111570,430,73,436000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,So there's a chance I actually won! I've got to dig up that ballot box!
111571,430,74,440000,Al Gore,Moe's Tavern,"Just let it go, Homer."
111572,430,75,440000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Al Gore?
111573,430,76,443000,Al Gore,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, I had a presidential election stolen from me. But I moved on, and I think you could say everything worked out all right."
111574,430,77,453000,Al Gore,Moe's Tavern,"Isn't that right, Alfred? It sure is, Albert."
111576,430,79,455000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ballots... stolen... real winner unknown... what is the truth?...
111577,430,80,466000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've gotta know.
111580,430,83,471000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's Apartment,Lenny! Wake up!
111581,430,84,471000,Lenny Leonard,Lenny's Apartment,"Finally, you returned my shovel."
111582,430,85,475000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's Apartment,That's not why I'm here. Get dressed.
111583,430,86,476000,Lenny Leonard,Lenny's Apartment,California casual or business attire?
111584,430,87,479000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's Apartment,California casual.
111586,430,89,479000,Lenny Leonard,Woods,There it is!
111587,430,90,487000,Homer Simpson,Woods,The ballot box?!
111588,430,91,487000,Lenny Leonard,Woods,"No, this is the box that tells us where the ballot box is."
111589,430,92,492000,Lenny Leonard,Woods,Right under this.
111590,430,93,492000,Homer Simpson,Woods,What will this box reveal? And what will I use this box for afterwards? Mismatched nuts and bolts? Recipes? I may never know.
111592,430,95,506000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Vance Connor...
111594,430,97,507000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer Simpson...
111595,430,98,507000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo-hoo!
111596,430,99,509000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Vance Connor...
111598,430,101,511000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer Simpson...
111599,430,102,511000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo-hoo!
111600,430,103,512000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Vance Connor...
111602,430,105,513000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer Simpson.
111603,430,106,513000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo!
111604,430,107,515000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Please stop doing that.
111605,430,108,515000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,", or woo hoo?"
111606,430,109,518000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Both. Homer Simpson... Vance Connor... Fonzie... Homer Simpson... and the winner is Homer Simpson!
111607,430,110,527000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes! I'm Senior Class President! I get a parking spot if the Assistant Principal isn't using it!
111608,430,111,533000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait a second. If I'd been Class President like I was supposed to, I'd be the one with the big mansion and the color TVs and the hot wife!"
111609,430,112,543000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey!
111610,430,113,543000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I still would be married to you, but you would just be hotter."
111612,430,115,549000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, just because you won a high school election doesn't mean your whole life would have been better."
111613,430,116,554000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's exactly what it means. And Dondelinger took that life away from me. And the taking of a life is murder. And the punishment for murder is... well, it varies from state to state and by race... but I'm gonna find Dondelinger and tell him I know what he did last summer... twenty-two years ago... in the winter!"
111616,430,119,584000,Principal Dondelinger,Golf Course,"That's the thing about you Assistant Principals. You can drive the ball, but you can't putt."
111618,430,121,587000,Administrator,Golf Course,Wait a minute! You're not in our foursome.
111619,430,122,592000,Principal Dondelinger,Golf Course,No other foursome would have me. My legs gross people out.
111620,430,123,595000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,Dondelinger!
111622,430,124,600000,Principal Dondelinger,Golf Course,Uh-oh. Looks like one of my former students on a quest for truth.
111623,430,125,606000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,"Dondelinger! I should have been Class President, but you stole the election from me."
111624,430,126,608000,Principal Dondelinger,Golf Course,I can explain. But... are you sure we should talk in front of your son?
111625,430,127,615000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,"Yes! I want him to know that if your life doesn't turn out the way you want, there's someone else to blame."
111626,430,128,619000,Bart Simpson,Golf Course,"I already knew that, Dad. I'm gonna blame you."
111627,430,129,622000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,I respect your choice. Now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a Tom Collins.
111628,430,130,626000,Bart Simpson,Golf Course,With a virgin Tom Collins for me?
111629,430,131,627000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,"Virgin? What are you, a girl?"
111630,430,132,637000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,"Now, Dondelinger, I want some answers."
111631,430,133,640000,Principal Dondelinger,Golf Course,"Very well. It's a fact I didn't like you, Simpson. Still don't."
111632,430,134,643000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,You lie. You love me!
111633,430,135,645000,Principal Dondelinger,Golf Course,"Whatever complex emotions I feel, they're not why I did what I did. There was another reason..."
111634,430,136,657000,Jock #1,Golf Course,Homer Simpson. What a loser.
111635,430,137,660000,Jock #2,Golf Course,"Hey, what if we got everyone to vote for him, as a joke, and he won?"
111636,430,138,663000,Jock #1,Golf Course,Then we could laugh at him all the way through high school and at every reunion.
111637,430,139,667000,Jock #2,Golf Course,Gooooo sports!
111638,430,140,676000,Principal Dondelinger,Golf Course,"So you see, I disposed of the ballot box to spare your feelings."
111639,430,141,680000,Principal Dondelinger,Golf Course,"Mm-hm... As Principal, I did a lot of things I'm not proud of."
111640,430,142,700000,Principal Dondelinger,Golf Course,I would steal school chalk for my home chalkboard.
111641,430,143,703000,Principal Dondelinger,Golf Course,But I'm not sorry I rigged that election. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to sit under that tree and think of all the women I could've talked to but didn't.
111642,430,144,712000,Principal Dondelinger,Golf Course,The brown-haired girl gave me a look. The redhead in the park was reading a book. The girl at the airport upgraded my car. Tonight I wonder just where you are...
111645,430,147,727000,Marge Simpson,Luigi's,"Homie, you're barely eating."
111646,430,148,729000,Bart Simpson,Luigi's,"Yeah, I can actually see your hands. They're not just a blur."
111648,430,149,732000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's,I don't feel much like eating. I'll never know what would've happened if I'd have been Class President.
111649,430,150,737000,Luigi,Luigi's,"Oh, you could know. If you dared."
111650,430,151,740000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's,Huh? Who said that?
111651,430,152,742000,Luigi,Luigi's,In the kitchen is a man from the old country who works for me. He stirs the sauce-a.
111652,430,153,745000,Luigi,Luigi's,"They say if he stirs the sauce-a just-a right, he can also see what might have-a been."
111653,430,154,756000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,"As a rational skeptic, I find that hard to believe. Also, as a vegetarian, I hope there's not meat in that sauce."
111654,430,155,762000,Luigi,Luigi's,"Any other orders, Mussolini?"
111655,430,156,762000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,"No, that's it."
111657,430,158,765000,Old Italian Man,Luigi's Back Room,Watch the sauce. You see what I see.
111658,430,159,769000,Marge Simpson,Luigi's Back Room,I see a hair.
111659,430,160,769000,Old Italian Man,Luigi's Back Room,You see too much.
111660,430,161,771000,Old Italian Man,Luigi's Back Room,"Now, watch the sauce of bubbling red and see the life you could have led."
111661,430,162,771000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's Back Room,Okay.
111662,430,163,780000,Old Italian Man,Luigi's Back Room,Yes. I like to stir.

111665,430,166,788000,Principal Dondelinger,SPRINGFIELD HIGH (1970S) - ALTERNATE REALITY,Homer Simpson.

111667,430,168,793000,Carl Carlson,SPRINGFIELD HIGH (1970S) - ALTERNATE REALITY,Yeah. A loser... like us! He proves you don't have to be popular to have everyone like you! Ho-mer! Ho-mer!

111672,430,173,808000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's,"I would've been a winner, instead of some idiot spending his Saturday night staring into a bowl of sauce. Why did fate do this to me?"
111673,430,174,820000,Old Italian Man,Luigi's,Ask-a the garlic bread.
111674,430,175,824000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's,Why? Why?
111675,430,176,826000,Old Italian Man,Luigi's,Hey everyone! The stupid fat man's talking to garlic bread!
111677,430,178,837000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's Kitchen,"Come on, stir! I must see more!"
111678,430,179,839000,Marge Simpson,Luigi's Kitchen,"Homie, please, nothing good will come of this."
111679,430,180,842000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's Kitchen,"Marge, unlike C.P.R., this is something I must know."
111647,430,181,845000,Old Italian Man,Luigi's Kitchen,Very well. Now we must once more stare madly into the sauce.
111681,430,183,858000,Student With Glasses,Springfield High School,"Mr. President, we need a class song, a class motto and a class mascot."
148292,430,184,862000,Teenage Homer,Springfield High School,"""Color My World,"" ""Disco Sucks"" and Butthead the Goat."
111682,430,185,864000,Student Reporter,Springfield High School,"Mr. President, do you approve of the bailout of the French Club?"
148293,430,186,868000,Teenage Homer,Springfield High School,They're too big to fail.
