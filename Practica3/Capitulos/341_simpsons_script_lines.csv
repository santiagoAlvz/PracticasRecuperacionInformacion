88258,341,96,1315000,Nurse,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Let me explain from behind this cage. Now, your pills have become very expensive, and no one gives a rat's ass about you. So after a lot of thought, we decided to let you go cold turkey. For those of you who survive the night, we'll be having waffles tomorrow."

88355,341,200,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Dad, you tried your best. For the first time in my life I can say, without being drunk, that I truly admire you."
88356,341,201,1315000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Retirement Castle,No drinking in public!
88357,341,202,1315000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Hey, where'd it go? Oh, well."
88359,341,204,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Oh, there's nothing like canceling an employee drug plan to make one feel so at peace with the universe."
88360,341,205,1315000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"I agree, sir."
88361,341,206,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Shut up.
88362,341,207,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"I'm so sick of you, Smithers. Your toadying, your complete agreeability, your gasping on the floor... Wha?!"
88363,341,208,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Smithers! If this is some sort of hijink, stop it immediately."
88364,341,209,1315000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"Sir, my thyroid is swelling up."
88365,341,210,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Confound it, man! I need your throat clear and ready for perjury."
88366,341,211,1315000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"When you canceled the drug plan, I couldn't afford my Thyroxin any more. But before I die, there are words I've always longed to say. Sir, I ."
88368,341,212,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Fear not, Smithers. I'll move Heaven and Earth to save you! It's still easier than teaching a new assistant my filing system."
88370,341,214,1315000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,I just wish we could make one last big score. But we could never drive past the border patrol.
88371,341,215,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,There are other ways to get into Canada...
88372,341,216,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"That's it, a plane!"
88373,341,217,1315000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Smuggle drugs in a plane? That'll never work!
88374,341,218,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Sure it will. All we need is a pilot!

88381,341,225,1315000,JOHNNY,Canadian Warehouse,"Looks like your plane's pretty full, Abe. Don't wanna overload it."
88382,341,226,1315000,Grampa Simpson,Canadian Warehouse,Typical Canadian wimpiness. That's why you have snowballs and we have the H bomb.
88383,341,227,1315000,Homer Simpson,Canadian Warehouse,"We really appreciate your help, Johnny. Is there any way we can repay ya?"
88384,341,228,1315000,JOHNNY,Canadian Warehouse,"Well, I've always wanted to see a man with the I.Q. of a child executed by the state. We don't get that up here."
88385,341,229,1315000,Homer Simpson,Canadian Warehouse,Really? In America we do it four times a week. You come on down and I'll get us front row seats.
88386,341,230,1315000,JOHNNY,Canadian Warehouse,I'd like that.
88389,341,233,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,PLYWOOD PELICAN,We're losing altitude. Time to dump all unnecessary weight.

88391,341,235,1315000,Homer Simpson,PLYWOOD PELICAN,"One... two... Eh, I'd rather die."
88392,341,236,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,PLYWOOD PELICAN,It's no use. We've got to make an emergency landing.
88393,341,237,1315000,Homer Simpson,PLYWOOD PELICAN,"Well, at least we're all in this together."
88394,341,238,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,PLYWOOD PELICAN,"Now, we have three parachutes."
88395,341,239,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,PLYWOOD PELICAN,This one's for me...

88405,341,250,1315000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Town Square,You'll have to arrest me too. Abe Simpson brought the Propecia to keep grass on Willie's field.
88406,341,251,1315000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield Town Square,He cured my lumbago. Thank you.
88407,341,252,1315000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Town Square,My diaper rash.
