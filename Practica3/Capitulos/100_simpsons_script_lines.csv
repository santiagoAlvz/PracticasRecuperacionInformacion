19656,100,2,64000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the idea of your classmates laughing at our family's private moments. How would you like it if, twenty years from now, people were laughing at things you did?"
19657,100,3,74000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not likely. C'mon, have a sense of humor about yourself!"
19658,100,4,78000,Baby Bart,Simpson Home,I'm a big boy today.
19660,100,6,81000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Argh! I gotta find something else quick!
19661,100,7,86000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you bring this potato? It's pretty big.
19662,100,8,89000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, you're always trying to give me potatoes. What is it with you?"
19663,100,9,92000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I just think they're neat.
19665,100,11,96000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,I need something for Show and Tell.
19666,100,12,97000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Just take one of my geodes. The rocks on my desk.
19667,100,13,104000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"No, that's a Trilobite... That's petrified wood... Bart, that's a bran"
19668,100,14,110000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,muffin.
19670,100,16,112000,Martin Prince,School Bus,"Greetings, fellow geodologist."
19671,100,17,122000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,I'll be right back.
19672,100,19,129000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"The ingredients were ""Fresh pureed tomatoes, water, salt, and Sodium Benzoate used to retard spoilage."" Once again, if I'm not mistaken, this can contained tomato paste."
19673,100,20,148000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Thank you, Nelson. I look forward to seeing it again next week. Bart, you're up."
19674,100,21,158000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Boys and girls, Mrs. Krabappel, I come before you today to solve a riddle that has plagued mankind for centuries -- What has four legs and ticks?"
19675,100,22,168000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,A walking clock?
19676,100,23,168000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,A walkin'-clock!
19677,100,24,171000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,I'd wager he has some variety of walking clock in that box.
19678,100,25,174000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, is it a walking clock?"
19679,100,26,176000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"What? No, it's my dog!"
19680,100,27,178000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, he is a gem! Here, boy, would you like these cookies Martin made for me?"
19681,100,28,187000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,My raisin roundies!
19682,100,29,189000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"My dog's name is Santa's Little Helper. One time he crawled under the house, and when he came out he was covered with ants. Then he ran into a church and drank all the holy water."
19683,100,30,195000,Class,Springfield Elementary School,Wow!
19684,100,31,198000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Thank you, Bart. Great job."
19685,100,32,201000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,I knew the dog before he came to class.
19686,100,33,211000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"Ka-Boom!! That, the sound of the thunderous volcanic explosion which gives birth to the magnificent geode! One of nature's most..."
19687,100,34,220000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,You're doin' it wrong. You gotta pet him hard so he can feel it.
19688,100,35,224000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,Looklooklook! The doggie sneezed!
19689,100,36,228000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Ha! It thinks it's people!
19690,100,37,228000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, poochie. Poochie-poochie, poochie."
19691,100,38,233000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,My geode must be acknowledged.
19692,100,39,239000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, brother. All right, back to Show and Tell. Bart, why don't you put the doggie away."
19694,100,41,262000,Lunchlady Doris,Springfield Elementary School,More testicles mean more iron.
19695,100,42,265000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Um, Miss Hoover? There's a dog in the vent."
19696,100,43,277000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Ralph, remember the time you said Snagglepuss was outside?"
19697,100,44,280000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,He was going to the bathroom.
19698,100,45,284000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I know Weinstein's parents were upset, Superintendent, but, but ah, I was sure it was a phony excuse. I mean, it sounds so made up: ""Yom Kip-pur?"""

19702,100,49,311000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Willie, go into the vent and get him."
19703,100,50,327000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"What?! Have ye gone waxy in yer beester?! I canna fit in the wee vent, ye croquet-playin' mint-muncher!"
19704,100,51,334000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Grease yourself up and go in, you-you... guff-speaking work-slacker."
19705,100,52,338000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Ooh. Good coomback.
19706,100,53,340000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Lunchlady Doris, have ye got any grease?"

19714,100,61,396000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Aha! There's nary an animal alive that can outrun a greased Scotsman! Now, out we go."
19715,100,62,417000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Whoogh! 'Tis more dizzying than the belfry at St. Corgegluynwaagen's!
19716,100,63,427000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"That's nice work, boys."
19717,100,64,434000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Uh-oh. Someone's getting a visit from Superintendent Chalmers.
19718,100,65,440000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I ... can't ... take ... this .
19719,100,66,440000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Skinner!
19720,100,67,440000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Superintendent Chalmers, you didn't have to come all the way down here. Everything's under control."
19721,100,68,450000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Ooh, I have had it. I have had it with this school, Skinner: the low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children..."
19722,100,69,461000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, really I hardly think the children's appearance should --"
19723,100,70,463000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Seymour, you are in very, very big troub--"
19724,100,71,466000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Huh? Why, looking into this lovable mutt's eyes just melts my heart... Seymour, all is forgiven--"
19725,100,72,475000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Aah! Make way for Willie!
19726,100,73,479000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"I said, 'Make way for Willie,' ye bloated gas-bag!"
19727,100,74,483000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Seymour?
19728,100,75,483000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Hmm?
19729,100,76,484000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,You're fired.
19731,100,78,484000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm sorry, d-did you just call me a liar?"
19732,100,79,490000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"No, I said you were fired."
19733,100,80,490000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Oh. That's much worse.
19735,100,82,494000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I thought I'd be jumping for joy the day Skinner left, but now all I have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head."
19736,100,83,513000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's guilt. You feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing a man his job.
19737,100,84,517000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I guess it is guilt."
19738,100,85,522000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. They let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?"
19739,100,86,529000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, yeah, but --"
19740,100,87,529000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm off to work."
19741,100,88,531000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The dog has had enough excitement.
19742,100,89,531000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But Marge, dogs can never have enough excitement."
19743,100,90,536000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look! Ree, ree. Ree, ree. Aye, aye. All right, all right, I won't take the dog. C'mere."
19747,100,94,549000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Boys and girls, because of Mr. Skinner's sudden departure, I've had to appoint a new principal. Leopold?"
19748,100,95,555000,Leopold,Springfield Elementary School,"All right, you little punks, prick up your freaking ears, because I'm only gonna be saying this once. From now on, things are gonna be very, very different around here..."
19750,100,97,570000,Leopold,Springfield Elementary School,"...with your new principal, Ned Flanders!"
19752,100,98,574000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, tippity-top o' the a.m. to every-good-body here! As chairman of the PTA, I Am dee-diddily-lighted to take over, and I think I can put the ""pal"" back in principal."
19753,100,99,586000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, and I'll put the ""super"" back in superintendent."
19754,100,100,593000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"That's the same exact joke. What gives, Leo?"
19755,100,101,598000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Now I know everybody's eager to get back to class --
19756,100,102,598000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Ha!
19757,100,103,602000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,But I thought it might break the ice if we had a little Q and A.
19758,100,104,602000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Elementary School,"Dude, ask a question or we'll have to go back to class."
19759,100,105,602000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,Um...
19760,100,106,614000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, you."
19761,100,107,614000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, yeah, uh, I was wonderin' d-do you, uh, er, what's your, um, policy, on... um, lunch?"
19762,100,108,624000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, let me just say I want to put the ""stew"" back in students."
19763,100,109,628000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,It's just a damn popularity contest with you kids.
19764,100,110,635000,Leopold,Springfield Elementary School,Now look what you've done you little freaks!
19766,100,112,642000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Young men! Your gargantuan cone is making a mockery of our self-serve policy!
19767,100,113,647000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,"Bart, look. It's Principal Skinner, and I think he's gone crazy. He's not wearing a suit or tie or anything!"
19768,100,114,655000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Principal Skinner... Um, I'm real sorry about my dog getting you fired, and biting you, and then getting it on with your leg."
19769,100,115,665000,Seymour Skinner,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, maybe it was for the best. Now I... I finally have time to do what I've always wanted: write the Great American Novel. Mine is about a futuristic amusement park where dinosaurs are brought to life through advanced cloning techniques!"
19770,100,116,680000,Seymour Skinner,Kwik-E-Mart,"I call it ""Billy and the Clone-o-saurus!"""
19771,100,117,683000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh you have got to be kidding, sir! First, you think of an idea that has already been done! And then, you give it a title that nobody could possibly like!! Didn't you think this thr... it was on the best-seller list for 18 months! And every magazine cover...one of the most popular movies of all time! What were you thinking?! I mean, thank you, come again."
19774,100,119,706000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, I've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been sent to my office eleven times. And now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin' in trouble every hour."
19775,100,120,715000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Mufft a been a co-in-fa-dince.
19776,100,121,717000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Anyhoo, Bart, you're gonna have to be punished. This isn't just some sort of club house."
19777,100,122,723000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, sorry, were you drinking Slice or Yoo-Hoo?"
19779,100,124,725000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT,"Well, let's see. Tide, Cheer, Bold, Biz, Fab, All, Gain, Wisk. I believe today I will try... Bold."

19781,100,126,748000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT,"Um, it's, it's a lot of fun."
19783,100,128,754000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT,"Well, it was good to see you."
19784,100,129,758000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT,"It was? Well, then we should get together again! Uh, say Saturday, at my house. Do you know where I live?"
19785,100,130,763000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT,"Uh, no."
19786,100,131,768000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT,"Hmmm, a flaming bag, eh? Well, these new Italian loafers will make short work of it."
19787,100,132,775000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT,"Uh, I'm kinda busy on Saturday."
19788,100,133,778000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT,Hey!
19789,100,134,781000,Jimbo Jones,SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT,We got Skinner's underpants!
19790,100,135,783000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT,"And there's nothing you can do about it, Mr. Ex-Principal."
19791,100,136,787000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT,"That's not true. I can buy a new pair. No, I can't. I needed those. I really did."
19793,100,138,801000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,"Oh, you must be Seymour's friend. He's up in his room. Don't touch the wallpaper."
19794,100,139,808000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,Bum-ba-bum-bum! Ba-ba-ba-bum! Now a little more allegro than last time. Bart! Welcome! Can I offer you a Diet Caffeine-Free Dr. Pepper or an individual fruit cocktail cup?
19795,100,140,824000,Bart Simpson,Skinner Home,"Uh, no I'll pass. Hey, what's this?"
19796,100,141,827000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"Oh, that's my old unit from Vietnam. I was their Sergeant, they were my loyal troops."
19797,100,142,833000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"That photo was taken shortly before I was shot in the back ... Which was very strange, because it was during a Bob Hope show. I was trying to get Joey Heatherton to put on some pants for God's sake."
19798,100,143,842000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,Seymour! Your friend Bart is here!
19440,100,144,842000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"I know, Mother."
19799,100,145,846000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,"Seymour, do you want me to tell you when it's 7:30?"
19800,100,146,846000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"No, Mother."
19801,100,147,851000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,Ned Flanders actually eliminated detention and put the whole school on the honor system?
19802,100,148,861000,Bart Simpson,Skinner Home,"Yeah, and the teachers are afraid to leave the faculty lounge."
19803,100,149,865000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"Oh, that place must be falling apart. Oh, mercy. Nobody's mentioned me, have they?"
19804,100,150,875000,Bart Simpson,Skinner Home,"Uh, I thought I heard someone say your name in the cafeteria, but they might've been saying ""skim milk."""

19806,100,152,891000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"I thought you might like this restaurant, Bart. They'll make a pizza pie with the topping of your choice."

19808,100,154,897000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"No, no, Luigi, I'd like one with two seats. I'll be dining with a friend tonight."

19815,100,161,934000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,What's the matter?
19816,100,162,937000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't you see, Milhouse? We've gone too far. We need Skinner back."

19829,100,175,1010000,Colonel,Fort Springfield,It's good to have another combat veteran around here. I myself received a number of medals for uh securing that Montgomery Ward in Kuwait City.
19830,100,176,1017000,Seymour Skinner,Fort Springfield,"Hmm. Yes, Colonel. Now, I understand it will be my duty to mold the new recruits into a well-disciplined, highly-trained infantry unit."
19831,100,177,1024000,Colonel,Fort Springfield,"Sure, I, I guess. Here they come."
19832,100,178,1024000,Hayseed #1,Fort Springfield,Hi. Where do I get my grenades at?
19833,100,179,1033000,Hayseed #2,Fort Springfield,"Hey, they don't have them group terlets here no more, do they?"
19835,100,181,1039000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Ned, Homer and I are a little concerned with the way the school's being run."
19836,100,182,1043000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, deeply concerned."
19837,100,183,1045000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I may go a little bit easy on the old hickory dickory stick, but that's, that's because my dad was so hard on me when I was a boy."

19844,100,190,1085000,Seymour Skinner,Fort Springfield,"Yes, well, there will be no smut in my company. You're in this man's army to learn!"
19845,100,191,1090000,Company,Fort Springfield,"I DON'T KNOW, BUT I BEEN TOLD! / THE PARTHENON IS MIGHTY OLD!"
19846,100,192,1095000,Seymour Skinner,Fort Springfield,Howwww old?
19847,100,193,1095000,Company,Fort Springfield,WE DON'T KNOW!
19848,100,194,1097000,Seymour Skinner,Fort Springfield,"WELL, THAT'S REAL GOOD, BUT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT."
19850,100,196,1105000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, I never thought Principal Skinner could become any more of a square, but there's the proof."
19851,100,197,1105000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's weird, Lis. I miss him as a friend, but I miss him even more as an enemy."
19852,100,198,1116000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I think you need Skinner, Bart. Everybody needs a nemesis. Sherlock Holmes had his Dr. Moriarty. Mountain Dew has its Mello-Yello. Even Maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow."
19854,100,200,1128000,Seymour Skinner,Fort Springfield,Man on the range!! Change your trajectories!!!
19856,100,202,1148000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Sixteen brand new gas pumps! At last we can compete with the Gas and Gulp!
19858,100,204,1155000,Bart Simpson,Fort Springfield,"If there was some way to get rid of Flanders, would you want to come back?"
19859,100,205,1163000,Seymour Skinner,Fort Springfield,"Uh, I must admit, I do miss the school. And uh, frankly, the Army isn't quite as I remembered it."
19860,100,206,1169000,Rowdy Soldier,Fort Springfield,"Up yours, sergeant!"
19861,100,207,1172000,Seymour Skinner,Fort Springfield,"Actually, it's exactly as I remembered it. I do want to come back, Bart, but it doesn't sound like Flanders is gonna get fired."
19862,100,208,1179000,Bart Simpson,Fort Springfield,"Oh, I think I can get him fired. I got you fired, didn't I?"
19863,100,209,1182000,Seymour Skinner,Fort Springfield,"...Yes. Now you realize, if I become Principal again, we can no longer be friends. Unless you become a good student."
19864,100,210,1194000,Bart Simpson,Fort Springfield,"Hmm, that's probably never gonna happen."
19865,100,211,1197000,Seymour Skinner,Fort Springfield,"Well, we'll always have the laun-dro-mat."
19866,100,212,1197000,Bart Simpson,Fort Springfield,Yeah.
19868,100,214,1206000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,What's he doing here?
19869,100,215,1208000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, once he found out we were going to get Ned Flanders fired, he insisted on helping."
19870,100,216,1212000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That is true.
19871,100,217,1212000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here's the plan. Once Chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten, he'll fire Ned on the spot."
19872,100,218,1221000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,"Yeah, well one question remains. How do I get out of the army?"
19873,100,219,1224000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No problem-o. Just make a pass at your commanding officer.
19874,100,220,1227000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,Done and done. And I mean done.
19875,100,221,1230000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's going on in there?
19876,100,222,1232000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,Nothing!
19878,100,224,1235000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,TO-READOR EN GARDE...
19879,100,225,1235000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"C'mon, Chalmie. You fired Skinner for less than this."
19880,100,226,1245000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, I did, but Skinner really bugged me. Besides, the way America's public schools are sliding, they'll all be this way in a few months. I say lay back and enjoy it. It's a helluva toboggan ride."
19881,100,227,1256000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, cockily-Doodily-Doo, little buddies. Let's thank the Lord for another beautiful school day."
19882,100,228,1262000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord? That sounded like a prayer! A prayer. A prayer in a public school!! God has no place within these walls, just like facts have no place within organized religion! Simpson, you get your wish. Flanders is history."
19883,100,229,1280000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I really enjoyed my time here, Superintendent. May the Lord bless and keep you."
19884,100,230,1289000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Now take it outside, God-boy."
19885,100,231,1289000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Okily-dokily.
19886,100,232,1292000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Dirksen, tuck in your shirt. Jaffee, spit out that gum."
19887,100,233,1295000,Leopold,Springfield Elementary School,You really think it's a good idea to just give that freak his job back?
19888,100,234,1299000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Eh. He seems to know the students' names.
19889,100,235,1301000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,So I guess we're enemies again.
19890,100,236,1305000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I guess. Thanks, Bart."
19891,100,237,1308000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Sure.
19892,100,238,1313000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, mercy."
