149739,4,50,211000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Oh, for the love of Peter! That's all anybody brought. Some damn fool went around telling everyone I love that slimy goop. Well, toss it in the pile over there."
149740,4,51,220000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,And make yourselves at home.

149754,4,65,264000,Marge Simpson,Burns's Back Yard,Ummm... Maybe I will take you up on that punch.
149756,4,67,269000,Marge Simpson,NURSERY,Do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised?
149757,4,68,272000,Mrs. Long,NURSERY,You're right. There.

149769,4,78,303000,Bart Simpson,Backyard,Hey!
149770,4,79,304000,Wife #1,Backyard,"I don't know who to love more. My son Joshua, who is captain of the football team, or my daughter Amber, who got the lead in the school play. Usually I use their grades as a tie-breaker, but they both got straight A's this term, so what's a mother to do?"
149771,4,80,319000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,"Uh-huh. Well, uh... I sense greatness in my family."
149772,4,81,321000,Wife #2,Backyard,Your family?
149773,4,82,322000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,"Well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there and if it's not true greatness we have, we're at least average. I don't want to alarm anyone, but I think there's a li'l al-key-hol in this punch."
149775,4,84,341000,Waylon Smithers,Backyard,"Mr. Burns, are you ready?"

149779,4,88,346000,Waylon Smithers,Backyard,"Go, Mr. Burns."
149780,4,89,356000,Bart Simpson,Backyard,"Man, this is pathetic. I'm goin' for it."
149781,4,90,360000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Bart! No! No! No, no! Oh no, Bart, No! Don't! Noooo!"

149788,4,97,389000,Other Women,Backyard,"Hey brother, pour the wine."
149789,4,98,390000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Marge, I need you."
149790,4,99,391000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,Hey Homie. Did you try the punch?
149791,4,100,394000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Snap out of it, Marge. You've got to come with me--the boss is going to make a toast!"
149792,4,101,399000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,"Well, I'm not much of a drinker..."
149793,4,102,401000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Well, you picked a perfect time to start."
149794,4,103,409000,C. Montgomery Burns,Backyard,"Musicians, cease that infernal tutlitating. ""Thank you all..."" ""...for coming."""
149764,4,104,419000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,Marge! Knock it off!
149796,4,105,421000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Sorry. Sorry."
149797,4,106,424000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,Marge!
149798,4,107,425000,C. Montgomery Burns,Backyard,But now it's time to say goodbye. Please get off my property until next year. I suggest you don't dawdle. The hounds will be released in ten minutes.
149799,4,108,439000,Nice Father,Backyard,"Did you have a good time, son?"
149800,4,109,441000,Nice Boy,Backyard,"Yeah, thanks, Pop."

149803,4,112,447000,C. Montgomery Burns,Backyard,Get that man's name. I predict big things for him down at the power plant.
149804,4,113,452000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Quick, Bart, give me a kiss."
149805,4,114,454000,Bart Simpson,Backyard,"Kiss you? But, Dad, I'm your kid!"
149806,4,115,456000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Bart, please. Five bucks for a kiss."
149807,4,116,462000,C. Montgomery Burns,Backyard,I've never seen such an obvious attempt to curry my favor.
149808,4,117,466000,Waylon Smithers,Backyard,"Fabulous observation, sir. Just fabulous."
149810,4,119,470000,Homer Simpson,DIRT ROAD,"Boy, I'm glad that's over. Now we can go home and act normal again."
149811,4,120,474000,Nice Father,DIRT ROAD,What do you mean?

149833,4,141,527000,NICE FAMILY,Road,"B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O. And Bingo was his name! Oh!"
149835,4,143,540000,Announcer,Simpson Living Room,"The father of the family has worked all day to find this food for his children. Unable to fend for themselves, the baby bald eaglets are dependant on their mother regurgitating the food, which he has found."
149836,4,144,553000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Ohh!
149837,4,145,553000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Hey!
149838,4,146,554000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Look everybody, yesterday was a real eye-opener. We've got to do better as a family. So tonight we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV. We're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family."
149840,4,148,568000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Happy, Dad?"
149841,4,149,570000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,Yes.
149842,4,150,571000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,Good. Commence shovelling.
149843,4,151,573000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,No. We're going to say grace first.
149844,4,152,577000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Okay. Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub."
149845,4,153,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"No! Ignore the boy, Lord. Now can the chatter and bow your heads. Dear Lord, thank you for this microwaved bounty, even though we don't deserve it. I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions... pardon my French... but they act like savages! Did you see them at the picnic? Oh, of course you did. You're everywhere. You're omnivorous. Oh, Lord, why did you smite me with this family?"
149846,4,154,607000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,Amen. Let's eat.
149847,4,155,610000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,No! I'm not done yet.
149848,4,156,612000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"But Homer, how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you badmouth us to the Man upstairs?"
149849,4,157,617000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think we're the worst family in town."
149850,4,158,620000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,Maybe we should move to a larger community.
149851,4,159,622000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Don't have a cow, Dad."
149852,4,160,624000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,The sad truth is all families are like us.
149853,4,161,628000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"You think so, huh? Well, there's only one way to find out. Follow me."
149855,4,163,637000,Homer Simpson,NEIGHBOR #1'S HOUSE,"Look at that, kids! No fighting, no yelling..."
149856,4,164,640000,Bart Simpson,NEIGHBOR #1'S HOUSE,No belching.

149832,4,167,644000,Bart Simpson,NEIGHBOR #1'S HOUSE,These people are obviously freaks.
149860,4,168,647000,Homer Simpson,NEIGHBOR #1'S HOUSE,"Oh, you think so? Well, let's see what's behind Door Number Two."

149864,4,172,657000,Homer Simpson,WILLIAMS' HOUSE,I wish I could hear what they're saying.
149866,4,174,658000,Williams Boy,WILLIAMS DEN,"Papa, I believe I heard some rustling in the bushes."
149867,4,175,661000,Mr. Williams,WILLIAMS DEN,I did too. Better get my gun.
149869,4,177,664000,Lisa Simpson,WILLIAMS' LAWN,Where's he going?
149870,4,178,666000,Homer Simpson,WILLIAMS' LAWN,Probably to get the old man his pipe and slippers.
149872,4,180,680000,Bart Simpson,Another House,"Whoa, look at this place. What a dump."
149873,4,181,685000,Homer Simpson,Another House,It's worse than you think. I just trampled these poor saps' flower bed.

149876,4,184,693000,Marge Simpson,Another House,"Are you coming in, Homer?"
149877,4,185,695000,Homer Simpson,Another House,"No, no. I want to be alone with my thought."

149915,4,221,818000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle. Heh-heh. They're on TV!
149917,4,223,841000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"All right, time for a family meeting!"
149919,4,225,844000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Why can't we have a meeting when you're watching TV?
149920,4,226,846000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Now, look, you know and I know this family needs help. Professional help. So I made us an appointment with Dr. Marvin Monroe."
149921,4,227,854000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,The fat guy on TV?
149892,4,228,856000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,You're sending us to a doctor who advertises on pro wrestling?
149922,4,229,859000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Boxing, Lisa, boxing. There's a world of difference."
149923,4,230,862000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Gee, Homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do?"
149924,4,231,864000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study. And of all the commercials I saw, his was the best. All it costs is two hundred and fifty dollars."
149925,4,232,873000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,But we don't have that kind of money.
149926,4,233,874000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep. Marge, go get the kids' college fund."
149927,4,234,879000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Hey!
149928,4,235,880000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, Homer."
149929,4,236,881000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, come on, Marge. Why scrimp now on the off-chance that they'll actually get in someplace?"
149930,4,237,886000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"...forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty. Eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents."
149931,4,238,892000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,That's it? That's the college fund we've been saving for all these years?
149932,4,239,896000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I guess I'd have needed a partial scholarship.
149933,4,240,898000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Well, we're not licked yet. To save this family, we're gonna have to make the supreme sacrifice."
149934,4,241,903000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"No, Dad! Please don't pawn the TV!"
149935,4,242,907000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, c'mon Dad! Anything but that!"
149936,4,243,910000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?"
149937,4,244,913000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need one hundred and fifty dollars here."
149939,4,246,917000,Pawn Broker,PAWN SHOP,"Afternoon, Simpson. So what can I do for you?"
149940,4,247,921000,Homer Simpson,PAWN SHOP,Would you pay one hundred fifty dollars for this lovely Motorola?
149941,4,248,925000,Pawn Broker,PAWN SHOP,Is it cable-ready?
149942,4,249,927000,Homer Simpson,PAWN SHOP,Ready as she'll ever be!
149943,4,250,929000,Pawn Broker,PAWN SHOP,"Mister, you got yourself a deal."
149945,4,252,936000,Marge Simpson,Family Therapy Center,"All our money, the college funds, the TV. Homer, you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you."
149946,4,253,943000,Homer Simpson,Family Therapy Center,"Hey, no pain, no gain."
149947,4,254,945000,Receptionist,Family Therapy Center,. Will you be paying by cash or check?
149948,4,255,947000,Homer Simpson,Family Therapy Center,"Cash, of course. I've got two hundred and fifty dollars right here with me. I'm holding it right now. Here it is. Look. Check it out. Two hundred and fifty big ones."
149950,4,256,959000,Bart Simpson,Family Therapy Center,"If you really want to impress her, show her the big empty space where our TV used to be."
149951,4,257,962000,Homer Simpson,Family Therapy Center,Bart!
149952,4,258,962000,Homer-ish Husband,Family Therapy Center,"Come on, family. Let's go celebrate our new found ability to express love for each other. I'm taking you out for frosty chocolate milkshakes!"
149953,4,259,974000,Lisa Simpson,Family Therapy Center,There go my young-girl dreams of Vassar.
149955,4,261,978000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Dr. Monroe's Office,"Hello, I'm Dr. Marvin Monroe. No doubt you recognize me from TV."
149956,4,262,982000,Lisa Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,We would if we had one.
149957,4,263,983000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,Lisa!
149958,4,264,984000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Dr. Monroe's Office,"No, no, Homer, don't stifle the youngster. Your family must feel free to express itself. That's what these pads and jumbo markers are for. I want you to draw for me your fears, your anxieties, the roots of your unhappiness. Now take a deep, cleansing breath...and begin."
149959,4,265,1010000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Dr. Monroe's Office,No surprises here. Homer?
149961,4,267,1016000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Dr. Monroe's Office,"Homer, what have you got for us? Homer?"
149962,4,268,1023000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,"Whoops. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention."
149963,4,269,1025000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Dr. Monroe's Office,"Well, if you had been paying attention, perhaps you would have noticed that your family sees you as a rather stern authority figure - an ogre, if you will."
149964,4,270,1034000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,"Now, Doctor, that's not true."
149965,4,271,1035000,Lisa Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,"""Ogre"" is such a strong word."
149966,4,272,1038000,Bart Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,"Right on, Doc. Another successful diagnosis."
149967,4,273,1041000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Dr. Monroe's Office,"Whoa! Okay, you want to kill each other. That's good. That's healthy. There's nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict. All I ask is that you use my patented aggression therapy mallets."
149968,4,274,1055000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,Good idea.
149969,4,275,1056000,Bart Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,All right!
149970,4,276,1057000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,I don't know...
149971,4,277,1058000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Dr. Monroe's Office,"Okay, let's take another deep, cleansing breath."
149972,4,278,1073000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,Wait a minute. These mallet things are padded with foam rubber. What's the point?
149973,4,279,1078000,Bart Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,"They'd work much better without the padding, Doc."
149974,4,280,1080000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Dr. Monroe's Office,"No, no. That's not true."
149975,4,281,1083000,Bart Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,See.
149976,4,282,1083000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Dr. Monroe's Office,Ow! Gimme that.
149978,4,283,1084000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Dr. Monroe's Office,"Yes, well, that concludes this portion of our treatment."
149979,4,284,1088000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,Are we cured yet?
149980,4,285,1089000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Dr. Monroe's Office,"Don't be ridiculous. You will be cured, but it's going to require somewhat more unorthodox methods."
149981,4,286,1096000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Monroe's Office,Unortho what?
149982,4,287,1097000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Dr. Monroe's Office,"Don't worry, I'll have plenty of time to explain while I warm up the electric generator."
149984,4,289,1104000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,"Everyone comfy? Good. Now, don't touch any of those buttons in front of you, for a very important reason, i.e. you are wired in to the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock--"
149985,4,290,1115000,Homer Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,Arrrgh!
149986,4,291,1119000,Bart Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,Just testing.
149987,4,292,1120000,Homer Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,Why you...
149988,4,293,1121000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,"No, Homer! Not yet!"
149990,4,295,1123000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,"You see, this is what is known as aversion therapy. When someone hurts you emotionally, you will hurt them physically, and gradually you will learn not to hurt each other at all. And won't that be wonderful, Homer?"
149991,4,296,1135000,Homer Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,"Oh, yes, doctor."
149992,4,297,1138000,Bart Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,Arrrgh!
149993,4,298,1139000,Lisa Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,Arrrgh!
149994,4,299,1140000,Marge Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,"Bart, how could you shock your little sister?"
149995,4,300,1142000,Bart Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,My finger slipped.
149996,4,301,1144000,Bart Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,Arrrgh!
149997,4,302,1144000,Lisa Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,So did mine.
149998,4,303,1148000,Marge Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,Bart! Lisa! Stop that.
149999,4,304,1154000,Lisa Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,Arrrgh!
150000,4,305,1154000,Homer Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,Arrrgh!
150001,4,306,1154000,Lisa Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,Arrrgh!
150002,4,307,1154000,Marge Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,Arrrgh!
150003,4,308,1154000,Bart Simpson,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,Arrrgh!
150004,4,309,1154000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY,"No, no. No! No, wait a minute! Wait! Wait! Folks! Folks, if I could... Not yet! This is not the way to get healthy!"
150009,4,314,1176000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Boy, someone's really gobbling up the juice, Sir."
150012,4,315,1179000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Excellent, excellent. Perhaps this energy conservation fad is as dead as the dodo."
150014,4,317,1191000,Homer Simpson,Laboratory,Arrrgh!
150015,4,318,1191000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Laboratory,"No, no!"
150016,4,319,1191000,Bart Simpson,Laboratory,Arrrgh!
150017,4,320,1191000,Lisa Simpson,Laboratory,Arrrgh!
150018,4,321,1191000,Marge Simpson,Laboratory,Arrrgh!
150019,4,322,1191000,Homer Simpson,Laboratory,Arrrgh!
150020,4,323,1191000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Laboratory,Stop! No!
150021,4,324,1191000,Receptionist,Laboratory,Doctor Monroe! Your other patients have fled the building!
150022,4,325,1195000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Laboratory,Stop! Stop! You're damaging the equipment.
150023,4,326,1204000,Bart Simpson,Laboratory,"Hey, nice hair, Mom."
150024,4,327,1205000,Marge Simpson,Laboratory,"Gee, I thought we were making real progress."
150025,4,328,1208000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Laboratory,"No, I'm sorry, you're not. Please, you've just got to go."
150026,4,329,1212000,Homer Simpson,Laboratory,"Wait a minute, Doc! Your TV commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!"
150027,4,330,1218000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Laboratory,Oh but that was just... All right. Get the money.
150029,4,332,1225000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Waiting Room,"five hundred. Here! Just go, and never tell anyone you were here."
150030,4,333,1235000,Homer Simpson,Waiting Room,Wow! Five hundred smackers!
150031,4,334,1237000,Marge Simpson,Waiting Room,"Homer, how wonderful. Our first pleasant surprise."
150032,4,335,1242000,Lisa Simpson,Waiting Room,It's not the money as much as the feeling that we earned it.
150033,4,336,1245000,Bart Simpson,Waiting Room,"You did it, Dad."
150034,4,337,1247000,Marge Simpson,Waiting Room,"Excuse me, dear. Shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our TV back?"
150035,4,338,1252000,Homer Simpson,Waiting Room,That piece of junk? Forget it! We're going to get a new TV! Twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!
150036,4,339,1263000,Bart Simpson,Waiting Room,Yay!
150037,4,340,1265000,Marge Simpson,Waiting Room,"Oh, Homer... we love you."
