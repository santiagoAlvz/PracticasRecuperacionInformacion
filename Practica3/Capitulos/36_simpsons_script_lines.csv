1097,36,3,68000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no. He's fine."
1098,36,4,71000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, what do you know? I'm relieved."
1099,36,5,73000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, my birthday is in two days. I'm gonna be eight years old. It's a big number -- almost double digits."
1100,36,6,79000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesn't taste as good anymore --"
1102,36,7,86000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?"
1103,36,8,88000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, this old timer does ramble on sometimes, don't he?"
1104,36,9,91000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, I do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. I've made things for you. But you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all..."
1105,36,10,98000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, it's done! I'm doing it! Birthday gift coming your way!"
1106,36,11,102000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, thank you."

1108,36,13,106000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Can do.
1109,36,14,108000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Hm... Krusty hotline.
1110,36,15,113000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Hi kids! You've reached the Krusty Hotline. If you haven't asked your parents' permission, naughty naughty! But Krusty forgives you! Two dollars for the first minute, fifty cents for each additional minute."
1111,36,16,139000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Thanks for calling kids! A new message every day.
1112,36,17,142000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maggie!
1113,36,18,143000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, I asked you to watch your sister!"
1114,36,19,146000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
1115,36,20,148000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?
1116,36,21,151000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I washed it.
1117,36,22,152000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?"
1118,36,23,154000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different."
1119,36,24,160000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now Homer, don't panic. You have plenty of white shirts."
1120,36,25,162000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!"
1121,36,26,164000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It's all over, Marge. It's all over."
1122,36,27,172000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know how this could have happened.
1123,36,28,174000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle!"
1124,36,29,177000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You! You did this to me!
1125,36,30,180000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, please. No one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work."
1127,36,32,186000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Wait a minute, go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink?"
1128,36,33,194000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, that's Homer Simpson, sir. He's one of your boobs from Sector 7-G."
1129,36,34,196000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Simpson, eh? Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he's some sort of free-thinking anarchist."
1130,36,35,202000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I'll call security, sir."
1131,36,36,203000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Excellent. These color monitors have already paid for themselves.
1133,36,38,213000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey Homer, we saved you a doughnut."
1134,36,39,216000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It has pink frosting!
1135,36,40,219000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting --"
1136,36,41,231000,Guard #1,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Drop that doughnut.
1137,36,42,232000,Guard #2,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Let's go, Pinky."
1138,36,43,234000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
1139,36,44,240000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Spare me the tired semantics of the Simpson family! Take him away!
1140,36,45,244000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You know, Mr. Burns, his body cavity search revealed nothing and we must have x-rayed him a hundred times. Maybe he's telling the truth."
1141,36,46,251000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Or perhaps you two are in cahoots. Smithers, I seem to recall you had a penchant for bell-bottom trousers back in '79."
1142,36,47,257000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, sir, that was my costume from the plant production of H.M.S. Pinafore."
1143,36,48,260000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show, as I recall. Now Doctor, what shall we do about our free wheeling fop over here?"
1144,36,49,267000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, Monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity took months. That's all changed, thanks to the ""Marvin Monroe Take Home Personality Test."" Twenty simple questions that will determine just how crazy or meshuggenah, someone is."
1145,36,50,282000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Print name?
1147,36,52,294000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form."
1148,36,53,297000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. I can't fill this out for you."
1149,36,54,302000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it."
1150,36,55,304000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me?"
1152,36,56,308000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, all right -- if you listen to the poem I just wrote."
1153,36,57,311000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,O-kay.
1154,36,58,313000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Meditations on turning eight, by Lisa Simpson. I had a cat named Snowball -- She died, she died! Mom said she was sleeping -- She lied, she lied! Why oh why is my cat dead? Couldn't that Chrysler hit me, instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy -- He died, --"
1155,36,59,329000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No deal.
1156,36,60,332000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, maybe you should do this."
1157,36,61,333000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son, it's no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot?"
1158,36,62,339000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, yeah."
1159,36,63,340000,Host,Simpson Home,"Our $50,000 Home Video Finalists are: ""Man Breaking Hip."""
1161,36,65,340000,Host,Simpson Home,"""Dog on Fire."" Ruff! Anybody order a hot dog?"
1162,36,66,354000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Look at him!
1163,36,67,355000,Host,Simpson Home,"And finally, ""Baby With A Nail Gun."""
1164,36,68,355000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Awww.
1165,36,69,360000,Host,Simpson Home,"Okay, it's time to cast your votes now."
1166,36,70,362000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire!
1167,36,71,362000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Dad. ""Do you hear voices?"""
1168,36,72,364000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, I'm hearing one right now, while I'm trying to watch TV."
1169,36,73,367000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes. ""Are you quick to anger?"""
1170,36,74,369000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! Shut up or I'll shut you up!
1171,36,75,371000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes. ""Do you wet your pants?"" Well, even the best of us has an occasional accident."
1173,36,77,379000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"So, did I pass?"
1174,36,78,381000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No.
1175,36,79,384000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Careful, men. He wets his pants."
1178,36,82,392000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,The devil with his fly open.
1179,36,83,394000,Psychiatrist,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,Right...
1180,36,84,396000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,That's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. They're gonna eat it.
1181,36,85,399000,Psychiatrist,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,Good...
1182,36,86,401000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,Arrghh!
1185,36,87,401000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,The boy! This isn't fair! How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?
1186,36,88,406000,Psychiatrist,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"Well, we have a very simple method."
1187,36,89,409000,Psychiatrist,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,Whoever has that stamp on his hand is insane.
1188,36,90,412000,Orderly,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,Put him in with the big white guy who thinks he's a little black guy.

1193,36,95,437000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"Oh, of course I've heard of you. I mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?"
1194,36,96,443000,Michael,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,Michael Jackson.
1195,36,97,444000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,Doesn't ring a bell.

1207,36,109,480000,Michael,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,You seem like a nice guy. Why'd they put you in here?
1208,36,110,483000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,Because I wore a pink shirt.
1209,36,111,485000,Michael,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,I understand. People thought I was crazy for the way I dressed.
1210,36,112,488000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,What'd you wear?

1214,36,116,514000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, in the split second before he died, I bet Scratchy appreciated his birthday present. You see how this relates to us?"
1215,36,117,521000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, you want that once a year empty gesture. You got it, sis."
1217,36,119,526000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"Hey, Michael, I don't get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me."
1218,36,120,531000,Michael,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"Homer, this is Floyd. He's an idiot savant. Give him any two numbers and he can multiply them in his head, just like that."

1229,36,131,564000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight."

1238,36,140,584000,Michael,Simpson Home,He could be. It's a big hospital.
1239,36,141,585000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, come on. If you're really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys?"
1240,36,142,592000,Michael,Simpson Home,"Brooke Shields, Diana Ross, Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles."
1241,36,143,594000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Shiver me timbers, you are Michael Jackson. Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives?"
1242,36,144,599000,Michael,Simpson Home,"I'm afraid not, Bart. Your father really needs your help. You don't want him to get a lobotomy, do you?"
1243,36,145,605000,Bart's Head,Simpson Home,"Hmmmm, lobotomy..."
1244,36,146,609000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's all right, son."

1247,36,149,629000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh my God! Mother was right.
1249,36,151,634000,Michael,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"Now Homer, don't you worry. Your family's gonna be here before you know it."
1250,36,152,638000,Wiseguy,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"Forget it, pal, there's only one way out of here and it ain't pretty."
1251,36,153,640000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,What's that?
1252,36,154,641000,Wiseguy,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,Dating a nurse.
1254,36,156,643000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house.

1264,36,166,668000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"This place is so strange. Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I'm... scared."
1265,36,167,678000,Michael,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,We all get scared once in a while. Maybe I can help you.
1266,36,168,683000,Michael,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"HOMER, THE TWO OF US NEED LOOK NO MORE / WE BOTH FOUND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR / WITH A FRIEND TO CALL MY OWN / I'LL NEVER BE ALONE / AND YOU MY FRIEND WILL SEE / YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME."

1275,36,176,743000,Doctor,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"No, Homer. Dave suffers from agoraphobia -- a fear of open areas and crowds. Please, Dave, go on."
1276,36,177,750000,Dave,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"Thank you. Anyway, that day I knew I-I just couldn't make that long drive to work."

1278,36,179,756000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,Baby.
1279,36,180,758000,Psychiatrist,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"Mrs. Simpson, I'm sorry but your husband suffers from a persecution complex, extreme paranoia, and bladder hostility."

1287,36,188,788000,Psychiatrist,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"Mr. Simpson, after talking to your wife, we believe you're no threat to yourself or others."
1288,36,189,793000,Homer Simpson,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,"That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please?"
1289,36,190,797000,Psychiatrist,New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting,Of course.

1359,36,258,1091000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Just leave me alone.
1360,36,259,1093000,Michael,Simpson Home,"Look boy, either Michael Jackson is some guy working in a recording studio in LA or he's here with you willing to work on this song. It's your choice. So long."

1367,36,266,1135000,Michael,Simpson Home,"Ah, she looks sad."
1368,36,267,1137000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That's cause she knows you're looking at her.
1369,36,268,1139000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Although I am aware you are looking at me, I would look exactly the same even if you weren't."
1370,36,269,1148000,Michael,Simpson Home,"Bart, think. What happens to you when you turn eight?"
1371,36,270,1153000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, your training wheels come off your bike."
