15710,86,55,300000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,No.
15711,86,56,308000,Lionel Hutz,Simpson Living Room,"Mr. Simpson, don't you worry. I watched Matlock in a bar last night. The sound wasn't on, but I think I got the gist of it."
15712,86,57,321000,Skeleton Judge,Simpson Living Room,"Hear ye, hear ye! The Court of Infernal Affairs is now in session."
15713,86,58,327000,Lionel Hutz,Simpson Living Room,"Very well. But first, some ground rules. Number one: We get bathroom breaks every half-hour."
15714,86,59,332000,Devil,Simpson Living Room,Agreed. Number two: The jury will be chosen by me.
15715,86,60,335000,Lionel Hutz,Simpson Living Room,"Agreed. No, wait..."
15716,86,61,337000,Devil,Simpson Living Room,Silence! I give you... the jury of the damned.
15717,86,62,341000,Devil,Simpson Living Room,Benedict Arnold. Lizzie Borden. Richard Nixon...
15718,86,63,345000,Richard Nixon,Simpson Living Room,"But I'm not dead yet. In fact, I just wrote an article for Redbook."
15719,86,64,349000,Devil,Simpson Living Room,"Hey listen, I did a favor for you."
15720,86,65,349000,Richard Nixon,Simpson Living Room,"Yes, Master."
15721,86,66,352000,Devil,Simpson Living Room,"John Wilkes Booth. Blackbeard the pirate. John Dillinger. And, the starting line of the 1976 Philadelphia Flyers."
15722,86,67,360000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"I'm sorry, Mr. Blackbeard, we're low on chairs and this is the last one."
15723,86,68,374000,Blackbeard,Simpson Living Room,"Arrr. This chair be high, says I."
15724,86,69,378000,Devil,Simpson Living Room,"Ahem! I hold here a contract between myself and one Homer Simpson, pledging me his soul for a donut. Which I delivered! And it was scrum-diddly-umptious!"
15725,86,70,391000,Devil,Simpson Living Room,I simply ask for what is mine.
15726,86,71,394000,Lionel Hutz,Simpson Living Room,"That was a right pretty speech, sir. But I ask you, what is a contract? Webster's defines it as an agreement under the law which is unbreakable. Which is unbreakable. Excuse me, I must use the restroom."
15728,86,73,414000,Marge Simpson,SIMPSON'S,Uh... Mr. Hutz?
15729,86,74,423000,Skeleton Judge,SIMPSON'S,"Homer Simpson, I have no choice but to sentence you to an eternity --"
15730,86,75,430000,Marge Simpson,SIMPSON'S,"Wait! Before you send him to hell, there's something you should see."
15731,86,76,433000,Marge Simpson,SIMPSON'S,That's a photo of Homer and me at our wedding.
15732,86,77,437000,Richard Nixon,SIMPSON'S,Wait a minute. You got married in an emergency room?
15733,86,78,440000,Marge Simpson,SIMPSON'S,Well... Homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself... before the wedding.
15734,86,79,448000,Marge Simpson,SIMPSON'S,"Read the back, the back."
15735,86,80,450000,Blackbeard,SIMPSON'S,Arrr... 'Tis some kind of treasure map.
15736,86,81,453000,Benedict Arnold,SIMPSON'S,"You idiot, you can't read."
15737,86,82,453000,Blackbeard,SIMPSON'S,"Aye, 'tis true. My debauchery was my way of compensatin'."
15738,86,83,460000,Benedict Arnold,SIMPSON'S,"Dear Marge, you have given me your hand in marriage. All I can give you in return is my soul, which I pledge to you forever."
15739,86,84,463000,Lizzie Borden,SIMPSON'S,"We've heard enough. Your honor, we find that Homer Simpson's soul is legally the property of Marge Simpson and not of the devil."
15740,86,85,478000,Devil,SIMPSON'S,No.
15741,86,86,478000,Homer Simpson,SIMPSON'S,Woo hoo! Ow!
15742,86,87,484000,Devil,SIMPSON'S,All right Simpson. You get your soul back. But let that ill-gotten donut be forever on your head.
15745,86,90,493000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, stop picking at it."
15746,86,91,506000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But I'm so sweet and tasty. Well, time to go to work."
15747,86,92,510000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I wouldn't go outside if I were you."
15749,86,94,513000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, boys. He's gotta come out of there sometime."
15751,86,96,520000,Bart Simpson,NIGHT GALLERY-TYPE SET,The next exhibit in our ghoulish gallery is entitled...The school bus!? Oh oh... They must mean the ghoul bus.
15752,86,97,525000,Lisa Simpson,NIGHT GALLERY-TYPE SET,"Nope. It says right there, school bus."
15753,86,98,525000,Bart Simpson,NIGHT GALLERY-TYPE SET,"Well, there's nothing scarier than having to go to school. Ugh."
15755,86,100,538000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUS,"Hey, Bart, look! Krusty Trading Cards! The long awaited Eighth Series!"
15756,86,101,555000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUS,"Krusty Visits Relatives in Annapolis, Maryland..."
15757,86,102,555000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUS,Krusty Poses for Trading Card Photo.
15758,86,103,555000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUS,Hmm. He seems to be running a little low on ideas.
15759,86,104,564000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUS,"Well, at least you got the gum."
15760,86,105,564000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUS,Oww! I cut my cheek!
15764,86,109,573000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, I hope this is sweat."
15765,86,110,580000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, what's wrong?"
15766,86,111,583000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I just had a vision of my own horrible, fiery death."
15767,86,112,588000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,And...?
15768,86,113,588000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, your brother's obviously had a nightmare. Don't worry, honey, the scary part's over."
15769,86,114,591000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, look at all this great stuff I found at the marina! It was just sitting in some guy's boat!"
15772,86,117,598000,Seymour Skinner,School Bus,"Hello, Simpson. I'm riding the bus today because Mother hid my car keys to punish me for talking to a woman on the phone. She was right to do it."
15773,86,118,611000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,"Excuse me, Bart's a little upset this morning, so could everyone please be extra-nice to him?"
15774,86,119,617000,Jimbo Jones,School Bus,"Hey, where's your diaper, baby?"
15775,86,120,622000,Martin Prince,School Bus,Thank goodness he's drawn attention away from my shirt.
15776,86,121,628000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Milhouse. Milhouse, wake up. Quick, look out the window."
15777,86,122,642000,Milhouse Van Houten,School Bus,"No way, Bart. If I lean over, I leave myself open to wedgies, Wet Willies, or even the dreaded Rear Admiral."
15778,86,123,653000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Otto, you gotta do something! There's a gremlin on the side of the bus!"
15779,86,124,659000,Otto Mann,School Bus,"Hey, no problem-o, Bart-dude. I'll get rid of it."
15780,86,125,664000,Hans Moleman,School Bus,"No. Oh, no. I just made my last payment."
15781,86,126,668000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,Eyahh! Everybody! There's a monster on the side of the bus!
15782,86,127,683000,Jimbo Jones,School Bus,"Hey, there's no monster!"
15783,86,128,689000,Ralph Wiggum,School Bus,You're deceptive.
15784,86,129,689000,Otto Mann,School Bus,I don't see anything.
15785,86,130,691000,Milhouse Van Houten,School Bus,"Hey, who's driving the bus?"
15786,86,131,694000,Otto Mann,School Bus,"Oh, uno momento, por favor."

15794,86,139,720000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"No! No, it's true! There's a monster on the bus."
15795,86,140,720000,Seymour Skinner,School Bus,The only monster on this bus is a lack of proper respect for the rules.
15798,86,143,730000,Groundskeeper Willie,School Bus,Ach! My mule wouldn't walk in the mud! So I had to put 17 bullets in him.
15799,86,144,743000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"You believe me, don't you? You're my friend who believes me! Sweet, trustworthy Milhouse."
15800,86,145,753000,Milhouse Van Houten,School Bus,"Actually, Bart, you're kinda creepin' me out. Uh, I think I'm gonna go sit, uh... with that foreign exchange student."
15801,86,146,761000,Exchange Student,School Bus,Oh Guten tag! Vould you care for a bite of my VenglerStrasse bar? I also have a bag of marzipan Joy-Joys!
15802,86,147,781000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,The gremlin's taking off the wheel! Stop the bus or we're all gonna die!
15803,86,148,786000,Groundskeeper Willie,School Bus,Take me bridle and lash 'is hands to the seat!
15804,86,149,792000,Exchange Student,School Bus,Would you like another lick of my Flavor-Wax?

15815,86,160,858000,Ned Flanders,Flanders's Car,It's some sort of hideous monster.
15816,86,161,864000,Ned Flanders,Flanders's Car,"Aww, isn't that cute? He's trying to claw my eyes out."
15818,86,163,877000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Gad Zooks!
15819,86,164,879000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Look at the bus! I was right, I tell ya! I was right!"
15820,86,165,881000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Right or wrong, your behavior was still disruptive, young man. Perhaps spending the remainder of your life in a madhouse will teach you some manners."
15821,86,166,887000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw haw!
15823,86,168,894000,Bart Simpson,Ambulance,At least now I can get some rest.
15824,86,169,899000,Ned Flanders,Ambulance,"Hidilly ho, Bart!"
15827,86,172,908000,Bart Simpson,NIGHT GALLERY-TYPE SET,We come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the evening. To even gaze upon it is to go mad.
15828,86,173,917000,Homer Simpson,NIGHT GALLERY-TYPE SET,They're dogs! And they're playing poker!
15829,86,174,921000,Bart Simpson,NIGHT GALLERY-TYPE SET,"We had a story to go with this painting, but it was far too intense. So we just threw something together with vampires. Enjoy!"
15831,86,176,937000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Another local peasant has been found dead, drained of his blood, with two teeth marks on his throat. This black cape was found on the scene: police are baffled."
15832,86,177,948000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"We think we're dealing with a supernatural being, most likely a mummy. As a precaution, I've ordered the Egyptian wing of the Springfield Museum destroyed."
15833,86,178,958000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"That's nice work, Ed."
15834,86,179,960000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no, they're wrong! The creature they seek is the walking undead. Nosferatu! Das Wampyre!"
15835,86,180,970000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,A vampire!
15836,86,181,971000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Heh-heh-HEH. Lisa, vampires are make-believe. Just like elves, gremlins and Eskimos."
15837,86,182,978000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"In a completely unrelated story, Montgomery Burns has just closed a deal to buy the Springfield Blood Bank."
15838,86,183,983000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm very excited about this deal... Oh..."
15839,86,184,987000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Precious blood.
15840,86,185,990000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmmm... business deal.
15843,86,188,994000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,It sure was nice of Mr. Burns to invite us for a midnight dinner at his country house in... Pennsylvania.
15844,86,189,1004000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Ah, there's something fishy about this whole setup."
15845,86,190,1006000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Lisa, stop being so suspicious. Did everyone wash their necks like Mr. Burns asked?"
15846,86,191,1011000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Sure did.
15848,86,193,1017000,C. Montgomery Burns,Castle,"Welcome, come in. Ah, fresh victims for my ever-growing army of the undead."
15849,86,194,1024000,Waylon Smithers,Castle,"Sir, you have to let go of the button."
15850,86,195,1024000,C. Montgomery Burns,Castle,"Oh, son of a bi..."
15853,86,197,1036000,C. Montgomery Burns,BURNS' CASTLE,"Well if it isn't my good friends, the uh..."
15854,86,198,1038000,Waylon Smithers,BURNS' CASTLE,"Simpson family, master."
15855,86,199,1038000,C. Montgomery Burns,BURNS' CASTLE,"Simpson, eh? Excellent!"
15856,86,200,1044000,Lisa Simpson,BURNS' CASTLE,"Dad, do you notice anything strange?"
15857,86,201,1047000,Homer Simpson,BURNS' CASTLE,"Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer."
15858,86,202,1049000,C. Montgomery Burns,BURNS' CASTLE,I heard that!
15859,86,203,1049000,Homer Simpson,BURNS' CASTLE,It was the boy!
15860,86,204,1052000,Homer Simpson,BURNS' CASTLE,"Huh, ooooh, punch!"
15861,86,205,1054000,Lisa Simpson,BURNS' CASTLE,"Eww, Dad, this is blood."
15862,86,206,1057000,Homer Simpson,BURNS' CASTLE,Correction. Free blood.
15863,86,207,1057000,Homer Simpson,BURNS' CASTLE,Ahhh.
15864,86,208,1062000,Lisa Simpson,BURNS' CASTLE,Whoops. Bart and I have to go wash up.
15865,86,209,1066000,Bart Simpson,BURNS' CASTLE,"But, you didn't get any on m..."
15866,86,210,1066000,Bart Simpson,BURNS' CASTLE,Uhhh.
15867,86,211,1068000,Bart Simpson,BURNS' CASTLE,"Lisa, Burns isn't a vampire. And even if he was, we're not gonna stumble on his secret hiding place."
15868,86,212,1078000,Lisa Simpson,BURNS' CASTLE,You're probably right. Let's just go back...
15871,86,215,1078000,Lisa Simpson,SECRET ROOM,Satisfied?
15872,86,216,1078000,Bart Simpson,SECRET ROOM,Big deal. It's no different from the basement in Grampa's rest home.
15873,86,217,1089000,Lisa Simpson,SECRET ROOM,Look!
15874,86,218,1089000,Lisa Simpson,SECRET ROOM,Oh my God!

15878,86,222,1107000,Lisa Simpson,SECRET ROOM,"Yeah, I've seen your Curly too."
15880,86,224,1110000,Bart Simpson,SECRET ROOM,"I know I really shouldn't, but when am I going to be here again?"
