138659,533,2,135000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Poor Chip. Such a big part of everyone's life.
138660,533,3,139000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,People called him the sixth Simpson. Not sure why.
138661,533,4,143000,Hans Moleman,First Church of Springfield,Chip did such a wonderful job with my biography.
138662,533,5,156000,Bumblebee Man,First Church of Springfield,Chip me ayudó a lidiar con mi pena después que mis padres se murieron jugando paintball!
138663,533,6,156000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Chip was the life of Sector Six-F at the nuclear plant...but Chip once confessed to me... he did have a few regrets.
138665,533,8,166000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Chip regretted never ascending Mount Springfield from the south face. He regretted that the high school long jump record he set was wind-aided. We often spoke of that asterisk. He never broke par on hole seventeen at Springfield Mini Golf.
138609,533,9,183000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Let us pray.
138666,533,10,185000,Patty Bouvier,First Church of Springfield,"Eh, everyone has regrets."
138667,533,11,187000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Not me!
138668,533,12,188000,Patty Bouvier,First Church of Springfield,You?! Your marriage is a dead fish floating in a tank of stale beer. Your baby's addicted to pacifiers...and your son is out of control!
138669,533,13,201000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Let us kneel...
138670,533,14,208000,Joe Namath,First Church of Springfield,My knees! Forty years of healing gone!
138671,533,15,215000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,He's such a little dickens. Although Dickens was pretty well-behaved.
138672,533,16,219000,Patty Bouvier,First Church of Springfield,He's been screwed up since the moment Homer's D.N.A. staggered into your womb.
138673,533,17,223000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"I have no regrets about that. It was a perfect pregnancy. Didn't smoke, didn't drink, lost three pounds. And every night before bed, Homer would give me a little kiss... music. Could Bart have been prenatally screwed up by the KISS music?"
138675,533,19,240000,Marge Simpson,Marge and Homer's Old Apartment,GET UP / EVERYBODY'S GONNA MOVE THEIR FEET
138676,533,20,243000,Homer Simpson,Marge and Homer's Old Apartment,GET DOWN / EVERYBODY'S GONNA LEAVE THEIR SEAT
138677,533,21,246000,Marge Simpson,Marge and Homer's Old Apartment,YOU GOTTA LOSE YOUR MIND IN DETROIT ROCK CITY!
138678,533,22,252000,Homer Simpson,Marge and Homer's Old Apartment,"Man, this is the weirdest pregnancy craving ever."
138679,533,23,256000,Marge Simpson,Marge and Homer's Old Apartment,"Well, for some reason it relaxes me. Now do that thing Gene Simmons does."
138680,533,24,260000,Homer Simpson,Marge and Homer's Old Apartment,Overstay my welcome for forty years?
138682,533,26,267000,Kent Brockman's Thoughts,First Church of Springfield,"Regrets, eh? This local newsman's had a few, covering a town of backwater rubes who for some reason hate my guts."
138683,533,27,274000,Kent Brockman,First Church of Springfield,"This is Kent Brockman, live at the Springfield Peach Parade. Sir, could you give us eight seconds of your homespun wisdom?"
138684,533,28,283000,Cletus Spuckler,First Church of Springfield,"It's a little known fact that you can get head lice from peaches. This is my daughter, Peaches."
138685,533,29,289000,Kent Brockman,First Church of Springfield,We'll have more regrets at eleven tonight following an all-new bottle of scotch.
148642,533,30,294000,Homer's Thoughts,First Church of Springfield,"You have regrets, Mr. ""I Get To See The Weathergirl From The Side?"" I made the worst financial decision of all time. Oh, I can't think about it, I won't think about it, I don't want to think about it..."
138687,533,32,307000,Homer Simpson,Alley McBalls,I'm thinking about it!
138688,533,33,317000,Homer Simpson,Alley McBalls,That's the coolest bowling ball I've ever seen.
138689,533,34,323000,Homer Simpson,Alley McBalls,"Hello, Bear Stearns? I'd like to sell all my Apple stock so I can buy a fancy bowling ball. You heard me. Technology is a fad. Heavy blue balls are the future."
138691,533,36,335000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Now, let us text on our ubiquitous Apple tablets and phones..."
138692,533,37,343000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,You cost me a piece of all of that!
138693,533,38,347000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Aw, don't cry."
138694,533,39,349000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,"If it makes you feel worse, I'm the man who bought the stock you sold."
138695,533,40,353000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all.
138696,533,41,356000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,Just one.
138697,533,42,358000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,The girl that got away. She broke my first heart.
138698,533,43,362000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"So, is there truly anyone among us without regrets?"
138699,533,44,366000,Agnes Skinner,First Church of Springfield,I have no regrets!
138700,533,45,368000,Seymour Skinner,First Church of Springfield,"Really, mother?"
138701,533,46,369000,Agnes Skinner,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, I didn't see you there."
138703,533,48,377000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I'm Father O'Greedy! Dimes for the needy!
138705,533,50,381000,Luann Van Houten,First Church of Springfield,Milhouse! Are you the bottom half of that mischief?
138706,533,51,384000,Milhouse Van Houten,First Church of Springfield,Uh...
138707,533,52,384000,Milhouse Van Houten,First Church of Springfield,Uh... uh...
138708,533,53,387000,Jasper Beardly,First Church of Springfield,Oh my!
138709,533,54,389000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"My pants, like the Lord, work in mysterious ways."
138710,533,55,393000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Return those vestments!
138711,533,56,394000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,"Speaking of return on investments, my Apple stock is up thirty-five hundred percent!"
138712,533,57,398000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,You misheard that on purpose!
138713,533,58,404000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,Tithe denied! Tithe denied!
138714,533,59,407000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Must find way... to blame myself.
138716,533,61,413000,Homer Simpson,Marge's Bedroom,"Um... it says I should give you ""lumbar support."" Better go to the lumberyard..."
138717,533,62,419000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Bedroom,Lumbar! It means lower back. How many times will you make that mistake?
138718,533,63,424000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Bedroom,Just put on the KISS record.
137497,533,64,426000,Homer Simpson,Marge's Bedroom,Which one?
138719,533,65,426000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Bedroom,"Anything from ""Love Gun""!"
138720,533,66,430000,Homer Simpson,Marge's Bedroom,"Hey book, are you expecting this?"
138721,533,67,433000,Homer Simpson,Marge's Bedroom,And while I'm at it... burn dumb helpful books!
138722,533,68,438000,Homer Simpson,Marge's Bedroom,That is a good fire.
138723,533,69,444000,Milhouse Van Houten,Marge's Bedroom,"You're going down, Bart!"
138724,533,70,448000,C. Montgomery Burns,Marge's Bedroom,"Ah, reckless youth."
138725,533,71,448000,Waylon Smithers,Marge's Bedroom,He'll be okay.
138726,533,72,450000,C. Montgomery Burns,Marge's Bedroom,I was referring to him.
138727,533,73,453000,C. Montgomery Burns,Marge's Bedroom,"I had a spring in my step like that once, back when I met Lilah."
138729,533,75,459000,MR. BURNS.,Paris,Lilah ran a little crepe stand in the 7th arrondisement.
138731,533,77,464000,Lilah,ARTIST'S GARRET,"Oh Monty. Looking at you, I could lie in this unheated garret forever."
148258,533,78,471000,Young Burns,ARTIST'S GARRET,"There's heat, I just don't turn it on."
148259,533,79,473000,Young Burns,ARTIST'S GARRET,"Seeing you there, in the sweet light of Paris between the wars, there is a question I must pose."
148260,533,80,478000,Young Burns,ARTIST'S GARRET,I have something for you.
148261,533,81,479000,Young Burns,ARTIST'S GARRET,Nope. Not that.
148262,533,83,489000,Young Burns,ARTIST'S GARRET,Wrong box.
148263,533,84,489000,Young Burns,ARTIST'S GARRET,"Lilah, will you take that big step from cousin to wife?"
138733,533,85,489000,Lilah,ARTIST'S GARRET,"Oh, Monty... you must promise me one thing."
138734,533,86,497000,C. Montgomery Burns,ARTIST'S GARRET,Anything she wanted I was willing to do. Anything. Except...
138735,533,87,502000,Lilah,ARTIST'S GARRET,All I ask is that you set aside five minutes a day to think of others.
148264,533,88,507000,Young Burns,ARTIST'S GARRET,When you say others... could they be bars of gold?
138736,533,89,510000,Lilah,ARTIST'S GARRET,I shall find another husband. As good as you are evil.
148265,533,90,515000,Young Burns,ARTIST'S GARRET,No one's that good!
138737,533,91,518000,C. Montgomery Burns,ARTIST'S GARRET,All I have left is my drawing.

138742,533,96,540000,C. Montgomery Burns,ARTIST'S GARRET,That man could really put pressure on you.
138743,533,97,542000,Rachel Maddow,ARTIST'S GARRET,"Hello, Kent."
138745,533,98,543000,Kent Brockman,ARTIST'S GARRET,"Well, well, well, Rachel Maddow. Everyone came back for Chip's funeral."
138746,533,99,547000,Rachel Maddow,ARTIST'S GARRET,"I was flying from D.C. to New York, and of course I had the layover in Springfield. How's the gang at Channel Six?"
138747,533,100,553000,Kent Brockman,ARTIST'S GARRET,"Look, let's get this out of the way. Just because we both worked at Channel Six and you made it big and I didn't doesn't mean I'm bitter."
138748,533,101,553000,Rachel Maddow,ARTIST'S GARRET,Um... is that your car?
138749,533,102,560000,Kent Brockman,ARTIST'S GARRET,Maybe.
138750,533,103,562000,Rachel Maddow,ARTIST'S GARRET,"Kent, I'm going to tell you the most important mistake you ever made... after this break."
138751,533,104,568000,Rachel Maddow,ARTIST'S GARRET,"So Kent, that mistake you made? That fundamental life-changing error? That cosmic fail? That--"

138753,533,106,574000,Rachel Maddow,ARTIST'S GARRET,After this break.
138754,533,107,576000,Rachel Maddow,ARTIST'S GARRET,You could've come with me. But you were suckling the dual teats of infotainment and celebrifawning!
138755,533,108,585000,Rachel Maddow,ARTIST'S GARRET,"So, tell us about your new movie."
138756,533,109,587000,Rainier Wolfcastle,ARTIST'S GARRET,It's fantastic. The studio let us play in their sandbox.
138757,533,110,591000,Kent Brockman,ARTIST'S GARRET,Great! We have a clip.
138758,533,111,591000,Rainier Wolfcastle,ARTIST'S GARRET,"No! No, don't show it! There aren't five good seconds in the whole film!"
138760,533,113,599000,Kent Brockman,Luigi's,"I'm not a newsman anymore, I'm a geologist. I keep discovering a new rock bottom."
138761,533,114,604000,Rachel Maddow,Luigi's,"Kent, I think I've found my ticket out of this town, or at least to a better Springfield."
138762,533,115,609000,Luigi,Luigi's,You two newshounds working on a story? How 'bout this? Mario's down the street found a rat in their pasta.
138763,533,116,616000,Kent Brockman,Luigi's,When did that happen?
138764,533,117,617000,Luigi,Luigi's,Whenever you want Eh?

138767,533,120,624000,Luigi,Luigi's,"At Mario's, the picture of Sinatra on the wall... is signed by Frank Junior! The frame hides the Junior!"
138769,533,122,631000,Rachel Maddow,Springfield Forest,Someone's been dumping tires in the forest.
138770,533,123,635000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Forest,"Willikers! In my three years of soft news, I've never seen anything like this."
138771,533,124,639000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Forest,Those are tires from my ill-fated Krusty Town Car. It would explode if people gripped the wheel too tightly.
138772,533,125,647000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Forest,"You're not tellin' no one! As the four p.m. clown, I have complete control of Channel Six's news division."
138773,533,126,656000,Rachel Maddow,Springfield Forest,Local news is a joke. I'm going to cable.
138774,533,127,659000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Forest,Cable news? Bah! People only want news at six p.m. from white guys on weekdays and black guys on weekends.
138775,533,128,667000,Rachel Maddow,Springfield Forest,"We'll see about that. Yes, we shall see. About that, things will be seen. By us. Kent? You coming?"
138776,533,129,677000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Forest,He ain't comin'. This little piggy's afraid to leave his cushy anchorman slop trough.
138777,533,130,682000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Forest,"Could you uh, phrase that a little more nicely?"
138778,533,131,685000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Forest,"Sorry. He ""isn't"" coming."
138779,533,132,688000,Rachel Maddow,Springfield Forest,"You'll regret this Kent, when I have my own show and you're stuck here tracking Santa's flight from the North Pole. Oh look, he's over Greenland."

138781,533,134,705000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Forest,"Eh, it'll burn out in an hour or so."
138784,533,137,715000,Dexter Colt,Mansion,"Look Burns, I've got the dope on your sweetie. She's still alive and she just got over being mad at you last week."
138785,533,138,722000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,Lilah's alive?!
138786,533,139,723000,Dexter Colt,Mansion,"Yeah, well, uh, she's alive, but... she's a nun."
138787,533,140,727000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"Married to Jesus, eh? Does he beat her?"
138788,533,141,729000,Dexter Colt,Mansion,"Jesus? No, he's a real Eagle Scout, that one. But your penguin's not a Catholic. She's a Buddhist nun. Spent her life expressing her sexuality with a Zen garden."
138789,533,142,738000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"Those raked rocks could've been me! Now since you're so good at finding things, find the exit!"
138790,533,143,743000,Dexter Colt,Mansion,There is the little matter of my fee.
138791,533,144,746000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,You're becoming very tiresome.
138792,533,145,749000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,Who moved my desk?!

138822,533,178,920000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bathroom,Smithers! Which do I take first? The rhino horn or the tiger tongue?

138845,533,200,1000000,C. Montgomery Burns,Motel Room,"Oh Lilah, even at the end I waited too long. What if I give her the breath of life?"
138846,533,201,1008000,C. Montgomery Burns,Motel Room,Hoo boy. I guess one regret just leads to another.
138847,533,202,1011000,Waylon Smithers,Motel Room,"You know, sir, maybe it would bring you peace to honor the one thing Lilah ever asked of you."
138849,533,204,1019000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD SOUP KITCHEN,"There you are, my good man. A little broth will cure your mental illness."
138850,533,205,1021000,Waylon Smithers,SPRINGFIELD SOUP KITCHEN,"Sir, that's five minutes. You can stop thinking of other people now."
138851,533,206,1027000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD SOUP KITCHEN,You know what? I think I'll give it another five.
138852,533,207,1031000,Lilah,SPRINGFIELD SOUP KITCHEN,"I'm proud of you, Monty."
138853,533,208,1035000,Homeless Man,SPRINGFIELD SOUP KITCHEN,I ain't eatin' that.
138855,533,210,1040000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,"Chief, what are you doing to save our son?"
138856,533,211,1043000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Well, I've placed marksmen on the roof to shoot the balloons one-by-one, but frankly, they're not very good."
138857,533,212,1050000,Marksman,Springfield,"Chief, it happened again!"
138858,533,213,1052000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Oh c'mon guys, spread out! Arms length!"
138859,533,214,1055000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,It's all my fault. I should never have listened to those KISS albums when I was pregnant.
138860,533,215,1060000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Marge, with all due respect, that's ridiculous. My Sarah listened to Mozart and Churchill speeches when she was pregnant with Ralphie, and he can't even open a refrigerator. Pushing, always, always pushing."
138861,533,216,1071000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,Really?
138862,533,217,1072000,Lou,Springfield,"Oh yeah, that kid's a mess."
138863,533,218,1074000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Hey! Only I get to criticize him, Lou. The kid's scared to flush. He thinks its his brother."
138864,533,219,1079000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,Can we focus on my son? Up in the sky?
138865,533,220,1082000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield,"Oh, I've got a long-shot idea. By which I mean firing a shot over a long distance."
138866,533,221,1089000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield,"Yeah, you see, if we could fire an exactly twelve-and-half-pound weight into the basket, it would lower the boy very gently to the ground."
138867,533,222,1098000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield,"Unfortunately, all our cannonballs were melted down to make a statue of Joe Paterno, which we changed to look like Eugene Levy."
138868,533,223,1109000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,I think I just might have what you're looking for.
138870,533,225,1116000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Today I'm glad that I sold that stock.

138881,533,236,1173000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"You know what I think about regrets? As long as your family is together, every choice you've ever made is the right one."
138882,533,237,1180000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,And together we are.
