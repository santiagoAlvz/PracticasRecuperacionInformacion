17338,91,201,964000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe Mom just doesn't realize we miss her. We could go down to the casino and let her know.
17339,91,202,968000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, come on, Lisa, there's no reason to... Let's go see Mom."
17341,91,204,975000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,"Marge, we need to talk. You're spending too much time at the casino, and I think you may have a problem..."

17353,91,216,1009000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I know it's absurd, but I dreamed the Boogeyman was after me and he's hiding..."
17354,91,217,1014000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Boogeyman?! You nail the windows shut! I'll get the gun!
17355,91,218,1018000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, I don't want to alarm you, but there may be a Boogeyman or Boogeymen in the house!"
17358,91,221,1035000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What happened here?
17359,91,222,1035000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, nothing, Marge. Just a little incident involving the Boogeyman. Of course, none of this would've happened if you'd been here to keep me from acting stupid."
17362,91,223,1044000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm sorry. I have been spending too much time at the casino. I'll be around more from now on."
17363,91,224,1050000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Does this mean you'll help me with my costume?
17364,91,225,1053000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure, honey. I promise."
17365,91,226,1056000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, Mom."
17366,91,227,1058000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Aw. Just like on TV.
17368,91,229,1061000,Robert Goulet,Springfield Airport,Hi. Are you from the casino?
17369,91,230,1069000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Airport,I'm from a casino.
17370,91,231,1069000,Robert Goulet,Springfield Airport,Good enough. Let's go.
17372,91,233,1071000,Waylon Smithers,Mr. Burns' Casino,"I'm afraid Robert Goulet hasn't arrived yet, Sir."
17373,91,234,1078000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mr. Burns' Casino,"Very well, begin the thawing of Jim Nabors."
17375,91,236,1081000,Robert Goulet,Bart's Treehouse,Are you sure this is the casino? I think I should call my manager.
17376,91,237,1090000,Nelson Muntz,Bart's Treehouse,Your manager says for you to shut up!
17377,91,238,1092000,Robert Goulet,Bart's Treehouse,Vera said that? Hmmm.
17380,91,241,1094000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, Mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume, and she's not and the Geography Pageant is tonight."
17381,91,242,1103000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, your mom still loves you. It's just that she has a career, now. She's a slot jockey."
17382,91,243,1110000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"But Dad, if I don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the state of Florida, I'll be the laughing stock of the whole school."
17383,91,244,1116000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's always something isn't it? First, I have to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give birth to you, and now this."
17384,91,245,1123000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow...ow...ow...ow.
17385,91,246,1126000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
17386,91,247,1131000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad!
17387,91,248,1131000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh yeah, the costume."
17388,91,249,1134000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, Floreeda."
17389,91,250,1137000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm not a state, I'm a monster!"
17390,91,251,1140000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. I call him Gamblor. And it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws."
17392,91,253,1155000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,Marge! Where are you?! Damn this casino! Damn this casino!
17333,91,254,1162000,Wheelman,Mr. Burns' Casino,Double stars. Everybody wins.
17394,91,256,1172000,Croupier,Mr. Burns' Casino,Seven. Lucky seven.
17396,91,258,1177000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,Can't talk now.
17397,91,259,1185000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mr. Burns' Casino,Smithers! I don't want that unpredictable lunatic working in my casino!
17398,91,260,1190000,Waylon Smithers,Mr. Burns' Casino,"Fine. We'll transfer him to the nuclear plant, sir."
17399,91,261,1192000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mr. Burns' Casino,"Oh, my beloved plant... How I miss her."
17400,91,262,1195000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mr. Burns' Casino,Bah! To hell with this! Get my razor! Draw a bath! And get these Kleenex boxes off my feet!
17401,91,263,1200000,Waylon Smithers,Mr. Burns' Casino,"Certainly, sir. And the jars of urine?"
17402,91,264,1203000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mr. Burns' Casino,"Oh, we'll hang on to those. Now, to the plant! We'll take the Spruce Moose. Hop in."
17403,91,265,1210000,Waylon Smithers,Mr. Burns' Casino,But sir...
17404,91,266,1210000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mr. Burns' Casino,"I said, hop in."
17406,91,268,1215000,Marge Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,Homer! What is it? Slow down.
17408,91,270,1227000,Marge Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,Think before you say each word.
17409,91,271,1229000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,You broke a promise to your child.
17410,91,272,1229000,Marge Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,What?
17411,91,273,1233000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,"You promised Lisa to help her with her costume. You made her cry, then I cried. Then Maggie laughed. She's such a little trooper."
17412,91,274,1244000,Marge Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,"Lisa's costume. Homer, I didn't realize. I'm so sorry."
17413,91,275,1252000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,"Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling problem."
17414,91,276,1256000,Marge Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,"You know, you're right, Homer. Maybe I should get some professional help."
17415,91,277,1261000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,"No no, that's too expensive. Just don't do it anymore."
17417,91,279,1264000,Robert Goulet,Bart's Treehouse,JINGLE BELLS / BATMAN SMELLS / ROBIN LAID AN EGG! / BATMOBILE LOST ITS WHEEL / AND THE JOKER GOT AWAY! HEY! Thank you... Thank you very much.
17418,91,280,1275000,Robert Goulet,Bart's Treehouse,"Ooh. I'm sorry, kid."
17420,91,282,1277000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"And special awards go to the two students who obviously had no help from their parents, Lisa Simpson and Ralph Wiggum."
17421,91,283,1285000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,I'm Idaho.
17422,91,284,1285000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"Yes, of course you are."
17425,91,286,1288000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,"You know, Marge, for the first time in our marriage, I can finally look down my nose at you. You have a gambling problem."
17426,91,287,1296000,Marge Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,That's true. Will you forgive me?
17427,91,288,1298000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,Oh sure... Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches from Sears?
17429,91,290,1303000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,"Well, that's nothing, because you have a gambling problem! And remember when I let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he was dressed like Santa Claus?"
17431,91,292,1311000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,"Well, you have a gambling problem!"
17432,91,293,1315000,Marge Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,"Homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them like that."
17433,91,294,1318000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,"Aw, what a gyp."
17435,91,296,1320000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,And remember when I...
17436,91,297,1322000,Marge Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,Homer!
17437,91,298,1322000,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns' Casino,Oh yeah. I forgot already.
