63340,255,94,408000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Dad, come back! I can't walk home with all this stuff!"
63341,255,95,416000,Bernice Hibbert,South Street Squidport,Poor boy. Here's some money for bus fare.
63342,255,96,419000,Sideshow Mel,South Street Squidport,"My father was a monster, too."
63343,255,97,426000,PUPPETEER,South Street Squidport,"Come on, brothers. Dig deep."
63345,255,99,432000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Stupid, non-magical son, can't pay to fix my car."

63352,255,106,445000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,People. I guess they thought I was a charity case.
63353,255,107,448000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Really. Hey, maybe we could do that again. Can you look even more pathetic?"
63354,255,108,457000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh ho, ho, that's beautiful! We could make a fortune."
63355,255,109,461000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But wouldn't that make us con artists?
63356,255,110,465000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, yeah. But God conned me out of sixty-five hundred bucks in car repairs."
63357,255,111,471000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So in a way, we'd just be balancing out the universe."
63358,255,112,476000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,There ya go! We'd be stealing from people we know. It's just like the seasons.
63359,255,113,483000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Sounds good. Wanna eat my fat?
63360,255,114,486000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I think you know the answer to that.

63368,255,122,511000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you doing? Why are you frosting that old throw pillow?
63369,255,123,514000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I could ask you the very same question.
63370,255,124,516000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Should I just back out of the room?
63371,255,125,519000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Would you?
63373,255,127,526000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Okay, Dad. Ready for our first con?"
63374,255,128,528000,Homer Simpson,South Street Squidport,You bet. Let's trim the mark.

63382,255,135,554000,Homer Simpson,South Street Squidport,"What have you done, you clumsy little ox?! That cake was for your deaf sister!"
63383,255,136,558000,Kent Brockman,South Street Squidport,"Sir, it was my fault."
63384,255,137,560000,Homer Simpson,South Street Squidport,"No, no. Don't protect him. You'll work off that cake in the acid mines."
63385,255,138,565000,Kent Brockman,South Street Squidport,"No, no, no. I'll pay for the cake."
63386,255,139,567000,Homer Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Well, you're the mark."
63387,255,140,569000,Homer Simpson,South Street Squidport,... of integrity.
63388,255,141,571000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Wow, look at all this loot! What should we buy first?"

63392,255,145,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What in the hell are you talking about?
63393,255,146,584000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, right, the magic. The magic was great. It's really... the way to go."
63394,255,147,589000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How'd you do your act? You left your magic kit here.
63395,255,148,592000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Or so it would seem...
63396,255,149,595000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Suckers.
63397,255,150,596000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I dunno, Mom. I think they're up to something..."
63398,255,151,599000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, sure looks that way... But at least Bart and Homer are spending quality time together."
63399,255,152,605000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Is that a Long Island Iced Tea?
63400,255,153,607000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, this? Hmm. I think it is."

63406,255,159,630000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,South Street Squidport,"Oh, I'm sure he's around here somewhere."
63407,255,160,634000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,South Street Squidport,"Oh, dear Lord!"
63408,255,161,637000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,He's the bestest dog ever. He's light brown and he has a spot on him shaped like a heart.

63410,255,163,644000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,"I just gotta get him back!... Or if not him, a similar dog..."

63425,255,177,682000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,Why are we still grifting? The car's paid for. Doesn't that balance out the universe?
63426,255,178,687000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,In a way. But I also remembered some other stuff... like my bike that was stolen in third grade. Plus the baldness.
63427,255,179,693000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,"Okay, I'm sold."
63428,255,180,695000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Hello, is the lady of the house in?"

63466,255,218,826000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, this is terrible. Now who do we give the money to?"
63467,255,219,829000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,I guess we'll just have to haul the check back to headquarters. Too bad we couldn't just give it to these nice folks.
63468,255,220,835000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Forget it, Ed. Do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big? Why, the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head."
63469,255,221,843000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,You're right. We'd better just take this check back for shredding.
63470,255,222,845000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,"No, wait! We've got a hundred bucks each! Hang on!"
63472,255,224,853000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Thank you... no shoving... that's right, put your money in here... all of it... Is that everyone?"
63473,255,225,861000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"What's your problem, Sport? Afraid to be rich?"
63474,255,226,865000,Silver-haired Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Hold your horses, I'll get to ya..."
63475,255,227,868000,Silver-haired Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,FBI.
63477,255,229,870000,Silver-haired Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,You're under arrest for fraud.
63478,255,230,876000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Throw the book at him, Sonny."
63480,255,232,879000,FBI MAN,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Now, where's the inside man?"
63481,255,233,884000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Call me mint jelly, 'cause I'm on the lam!"
63482,255,234,891000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,So we're under arrest for fraud?
63483,255,235,895000,FBI MAN,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yes, fraud."
63485,255,237,904000,FBI MAN,Simpson Car,"Well, this is about the flashiest car I've ever impounded."
63486,255,238,907000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Thanks, woo, it took a lotta grifting."
63487,255,239,911000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Please, FBI man, don't throw us in jail. We just made one mistake."
63488,255,240,915000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Yeah. We're not criminals. We're just two crazy, mixed-up kids."
63489,255,241,921000,FBI MAN,Simpson Car,"Hmm... Okay, tell you what. I'll let you turn yourselves in. Maybe they'll go easier on you."
63490,255,242,927000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,You'd do that for us?
63491,255,243,929000,FBI MAN,Simpson Car,"Well, I did ruin the boy's birthday cake. Go on in. But I'll be watching."
63492,255,244,933000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Okay, thank you, sir."
63494,255,246,936000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Don't worry, son. I have an idea."
63495,255,247,939000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Chief, I'd like to scare my son straight. Could I show him a jail cell?"
63496,255,248,945000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Oh, sure. I'll put you in the Rick James suite. It's super-freaky."
63498,255,250,954000,Bart Simpson,JAIL CELL,"Okay, we're all locked up now..."
63499,255,251,954000,Homer Simpson,JAIL CELL,Yeah. Ya big idiot...
63500,255,252,959000,FBI MAN,JAIL CELL,Excellent. I guess I'll just be swiping your car now.
63502,255,254,964000,FBI MAN,JAIL CELL,"Oh, and this lovely bag of cash."
63503,255,255,967000,FBI MAN,JAIL CELL,"So long, suckers! Woo hoo!"
63504,255,256,971000,Bart Simpson,JAIL CELL,That's not an FBI badge.
63505,255,257,974000,Homer Simpson,JAIL CELL,Colgate Cavity Patrol?
63506,255,258,977000,Bart Simpson,JAIL CELL,That guy was a grifter!
63507,255,259,979000,Homer Simpson,JAIL CELL,"Yeah, he conned us good. Well, at least we still have our jobs at the sweepstakes place."
63508,255,260,984000,Homer Simpson,JAIL CELL,What?
63510,255,262,985000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Mom's gonna wonder where the car went. We'd better have a good story.
63512,255,263,989000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Lies got us into this mess, son. From now on it's honesty all the way."
63514,255,265,994000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You were carjacked in the church parking lot?!
63515,255,266,998000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Absolutely. We had stopped in for a quick prayer, when... Bart, would you call him a crazy man?"
63516,255,267,1003000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Definitely. Well, crazy about carjacking."
63517,255,268,1006000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What did he look like?
63518,255,269,1007000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, hmm, let's see, he was foreign and he had some..."
63519,255,270,1013000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wild, bushy hair, like an animal."
63520,255,271,1015000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Anything else?
63521,255,272,1016000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, well, he seemed like a loner... kept to himself, mostly."
63522,255,273,1020000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"And he said if we went to the cops, he'd come back for Maggie."
63523,255,274,1023000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, dear. We don't want that."
63524,255,275,1026000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Anyhoo, the whole nightmare has really made us sleepy. Let's hit the hay."
63526,255,277,1034000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Homie! Homie, wake up! They've captured your crazed foreign carjacker!"
63527,255,278,1038000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Huh? But that's impossible.
63528,255,279,1041000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,They're arresting him right now!
63529,255,280,1043000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Master Bedroom,"I didna do it, I tell ya."
63530,255,281,1046000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Uh-oh.
63531,255,282,1048000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Master Bedroom,At least let me comb me hair. It's all wild and bushy.
63532,255,283,1052000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Master Bedroom,"What do you care, loner?"
63533,255,284,1054000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Well, look at that. But who called the police?"
63534,255,285,1057000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,We did.
63535,255,286,1058000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"After we got Maggie to a safe house, of course."
63537,255,288,1061000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,She hasn't touched her Manwich.
63539,255,290,1064000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Master Bedroom,Ye cannot do this to Willie.
63540,255,291,1067000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Master Bedroom,"I'm innocent, I tell ya!"
63541,255,292,1069000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,They always say they're innocent. It's such a turn-off.
63542,255,293,1072000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Dad, Willie got arrested 'cause of us!"
63543,255,294,1074000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"'Course he did, son. He's a filthy crook. Now, let's all hit the hay."
63511,255,295,1079000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,It's ten in the morning!
63544,255,296,1080000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,I guess you haven't heard of chloroform.
63546,255,298,1088000,Prosecutor,Courtroom,Will you tell the court your whereabouts at the time of the carjacking?
63547,255,299,1092000,Groundskeeper Willie,Courtroom,I was alone in me Unabomber-style shack. I had nothing to do with that carjacking.
63548,255,300,1097000,Prosecutor,Courtroom,Carjacking? Who said anything about a carjacking?
63550,255,302,1103000,Groundskeeper Willie,Courtroom,But didn't ya just say...?
63551,255,303,1104000,Prosecutor,Courtroom,"I'll ask the questions here, Carjacker Willie!"
63552,255,304,1107000,Willie's Lawyer,Courtroom,Objection!
63553,255,305,1108000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,I'm going to allow it. It characterizes the defendant as a carjacker.
63554,255,306,1111000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,"Dad, we've got to tell everyone the truth."
63555,255,307,1114000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Let's see how this plays out.
63556,255,308,1116000,Prosecutor,Courtroom,"Mr. Simpson, could you describe your assailant to the court?"
63557,255,309,1120000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"I told you, my memory is fuzzy. Fuzzy!"
63558,255,310,1124000,Prosecutor,Courtroom,Fuzzy like Willie's beard?
63560,255,312,1128000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Yes, exactly! No, no! I mean, the whole incident is hazy."
63561,255,313,1133000,Prosecutor,Courtroom,Hazy like the moors of Scotland?
63563,255,315,1136000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Yes, exactly!"
63566,255,318,1144000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Hey? Mountain Dew?!
63569,255,321,1152000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?"
63570,255,322,1156000,Cletus Spuckler,Courtroom,I believe we was promised five dollars a day.
63571,255,323,1159000,Cletus Spuckler,Courtroom,"All right, then. Guilty!"
63573,255,325,1163000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Carjacker Willie, I sentence you to ten years in prison."
63574,255,326,1170000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,Dad! Tell them!
63575,255,327,1172000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,When the time is right...
63576,255,328,1173000,Groundskeeper Willie,Courtroom,Ten years?! But I didna do it!
63577,255,329,1176000,Chief Wiggum,Courtroom,"Suuure, you didna. Now, let's get you to Attica, and we can..."
63578,255,330,1180000,Groundskeeper Willie,Courtroom,No!
63580,255,332,1182000,Groundskeeper Willie,Courtroom,You'll never send me up the river!
63581,255,333,1184000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,Daa-ad!
63582,255,334,1185000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Let's see where he's going with this...
63584,255,336,1190000,Seymour Skinner,Courtroom,"Willie! As your employer, I insist that you..."
63585,255,337,1196000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Stop! This has gone on just long enough.
63586,255,338,1199000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Nobody carjacked me. I tried to pull a con and got conned myself. And then I lied to you all! So did Bart.
63587,255,339,1216000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"Okay, players! That's a wrap!"
63588,255,340,1223000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,"Nice work, everybody!"
63589,255,341,1224000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,Wait a minute. This whole thing was a set-up?!
63590,255,342,1227000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,But Skinner got shot!
63591,255,343,1230000,Seymour Skinner,Courtroom,Yep. Blanks and a blood pack.
63592,255,344,1233000,Chief Wiggum,Courtroom,"Hey, watch it!"
63593,255,345,1234000,Ralph Wiggum,Courtroom,I look like cable TV.
63594,255,346,1236000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,What about that bullet hole in your hair?
63595,255,347,1238000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,Squibs!
63597,255,349,1240000,Grampa Simpson,Courtroom,"Yeah, we hornswoggled you good."
63598,255,350,1244000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,But what about the guy who took my car?
63599,255,351,1248000,FBI MAN,Courtroom,"Devon Bradley. Character actor, dancer, singer. I'm a triple-threat!"
63600,255,352,1253000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"He's doing ""Dreamcoat"" at the dinner theater."
63601,255,353,1255000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,I can't believe everyone was in on it.
63602,255,354,1259000,Groundskeeper Willie,Courtroom,Willie wasn't!
63603,255,355,1260000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Wait a minute. You're telling me the police force, the TV news, a courthouse full of people, and a popular entertainer had nothing better to do than to teach me and Bart a lesson?"
63604,255,356,1270000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,"I know it seems farfetched, even insulting to your intelligence. But, there's a simple and highly satisfying explanation. You see..."
63605,255,357,1278000,Otto Mann,Courtroom,"Hey, everybody! Surf's up!"
63607,255,359,1283000,Bart Simpson,Ocean,Cowabunga!
