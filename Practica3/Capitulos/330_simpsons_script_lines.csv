85033,330,1,32000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, what are you doing?"
85034,330,2,34000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm changing the batteries in all the remotes. We're all out of triple A's, so I'm gonna whittle down a couple of these D's."
85035,330,3,41000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're getting acid in the bed!
85036,330,4,48000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna sleep on the couch.
85037,330,5,52000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,She sure loves that couch.
85039,330,7,57000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,It's the World Series of Kickball... Bart Simpson on the mound. The catcher gives him the signal...and here's the pitch!
85040,330,8,77000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh my God, I've shredded a child! Again!"
85041,330,9,85000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Venezuela, here I come!"
85042,330,10,87000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,... and while the school's only ball is being repaired...
85044,330,12,90000,Seymour Skinner,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"... the following alternative sports will be offered: dodge-rock, volley-brick, and base-game."
85045,330,13,96000,Milhouse Van Houten,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,I wanna play dodge-rock!
85046,330,14,98000,Nelson Muntz,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,You're out!
85047,330,15,99000,Seymour Skinner,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Finally, on a personal note, Mrs. Krabappel and I are to be joined in holy wedlock...this Saturday. We'll be honeymooning at Lake Shelbyville Lodge, Cabin Thirty-two, Room Three. And we do not wish to be disturbed."
85048,330,16,111000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Way to go, Mrs. K! You finally hooked the Skinfish!"
85049,330,17,114000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"It looks good... but I'm not gonna celebrate 'til he's gaffed, gutted, and hanging in my trophy room. Ha!"
85050,330,18,120000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"We have the same dream, ma'am."
85051,330,19,122000,Skinner On Plaque,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,MY BONNIE LIES OVER THE OCEAN / MY BONNIE LIES OVER THE SEA...
85054,330,22,132000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"All right, we got Sex With An Alligator, Screaming Orgasms, and Virgin Screaming Orgasms."
85055,330,23,139000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, sexy drinks, adult board games..."
85056,330,24,144000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm glad I sent the kids to Grampa's to protect their innocent minds.
85058,330,26,148000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,...and here's some more Germans we killed -- that flame-thrower really toasted their waffles!
85060,330,28,155000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Grampa, how do you sleep at night?"
85061,330,29,158000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,They drug us.
85063,330,31,161000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Simpson Home,It's... another pair of edible panties!
85065,330,33,165000,Lindsay Naegle,Simpson Home,Now that's sexual!
85067,330,35,173000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, this bachelor party seems to have peaked. Would you please return my pants and/or underpants so I can go home?"
85068,330,36,179000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Come on, it's your last night of freedom. You gotta have some fun."
85069,330,37,183000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,Who are all of you people?
85070,330,38,185000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"We're your buddies! Now come on, Homer's kids' principal, have a beer!"
85071,330,39,189000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,I can't -- I might be called upon to give directions later.
85072,330,40,192000,Gary Chalmers,Moe's Tavern,Skinner!
85073,330,41,193000,Gary Chalmers,Moe's Tavern,You were asked to chug-a-lug. And a-lug you shall chug!
85074,330,42,201000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,There's something I've wanted to say to you for a long time. Am I a good principal?
85075,330,43,209000,Gary Chalmers,Moe's Tavern,You're the best we could get with the funds at our disposal.
85078,330,46,215000,Duffman,Simpson Home,Delivering these ice cold Lady Duffs has made me hot. Really hot.
85079,330,47,224000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"C'mon, Duffman!"
85080,330,48,227000,Duffman,Simpson Home,"Thirty bucks an hour -- oh yeah! Oh ooh, ah, -- oh yeah!"
85081,330,49,233000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Sorry to bother you, but we got an anonymous tip about loud music and a strip-da-didilly-dipper."
85082,330,50,242000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Oh! Look girls, a policeman is here."
85083,330,51,246000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Well, we've been awfully naughty. You better lay down the law."
85084,330,52,253000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Hey, ladies, ladies, I-I really am a cop."
85085,330,53,258000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Whoa. Is that a five? Well, this uniform is a little snug! Oh yeah -- Woo!"
85086,330,54,267000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Uh, Eddie, Lou, how about a little back-up here?"
85087,330,55,271000,Lou,Simpson Home,"Like what you see, ladies?... all right."
85088,330,56,276000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Ah yeah. Oh... okay. I think uh, I... I think I threw my back out."
85090,330,58,288000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,"You know I wish I had an exciting life... like that class picture photographer. Ho, how many women has he had in that van? Two, that I know of."

85095,330,63,310000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Wussy!
85096,330,64,311000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Grinch.
85097,330,65,312000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, take it easy on Skinner. He's just down 'cause after tomorrow, everything he does is wrong."
85098,330,66,319000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Aw, marriage is gonna be great. Now you'll have someone who'll rub your back... without being asked."
85099,330,67,325000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Not this again.
85100,330,68,326000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Yes, this again!"
85101,330,69,328000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,"You know, Homer, Edna was bugging me and bugging me to set a date, and I picked one that seemed far away, and it zoomed up like a junebug flying in my windshield."
85102,330,70,339000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"What are you trying to tell me, Skinner?"
85103,330,71,343000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, Lenny...my man... I could never lie to you guys. I'm starting to get cold feet. Please don't tell anyone."
85104,330,72,356000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
85105,330,73,359000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Marge, guess what! Skinner wants to bail on his wedding!"
85106,330,74,362000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, you're still talking to me!"
85107,330,75,365000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh man, is this awkward. I'm outta here."
85109,330,77,373000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Principal Skinner is having second thoughts? Poor Edna!
85110,330,78,377000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah Marge, it looks like you got the last perfect man. Oh uh, by the way... can I borrow your car tomorrow? Mine's acting up."
85111,330,79,386000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Every day you find a new way to aggravate me.
85112,330,80,389000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, you're the one always bugging me to screw up our marriage."
85113,330,81,393000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Spice up! Spice up!
85114,330,82,395000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whatever. The important thing is to get Skinner to that altar. Because once a union has been sanctified by God, it takes at least six months to tear it apart."
85115,330,83,405000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Right, naked Duffman?"
85116,330,84,407000,Duffman,Simpson Home,"Hmm? Oh, uh... Oh, yeah!"
85119,330,87,416000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,I think Skinner might make a run for it -- he's eyeing the exits and doing calf stretches.
85120,330,88,426000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"Don't worry, I've got a man on the perimeter."
85121,330,89,428000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,Cowabunga One to Fat Load.
85122,330,90,431000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,This is Fat Load. I'd like to request a new codename.
85123,330,91,434000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,Denied.
85124,330,92,435000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"Okay, Fat Load here."
85125,330,93,436000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,Here comes the bride. Repeat. Here comes the bride.
85126,330,94,439000,Otto Mann,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"Mrs. K., you look awesome!"
85127,330,95,441000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"Thank you, Otto."
85128,330,96,444000,Otto Mann,Springfield Elementary School Gym,That cloud looks awesome. That rock looks awesome. My hands look awesome.
85129,330,97,467000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,Hey champ. Ready to take the plunge?
85130,330,98,469000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Gym,You know I'm not. We had a long discussion about that where I clearly indicated the coldness of my feet.
85132,330,100,479000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM,"Happy fiftieth anniversary, Seymour."
85133,330,101,481000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM,I was thinking it might be time to combine our CD collections.
85134,330,102,487000,Seymour Skinner,FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM,"I don't know Edna, I'm not quite ready to take that plunge."
85135,330,103,492000,Agnes Skinner,FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM,Seymour!
85136,330,104,493000,CYBORG SPIDER MRS. SKINNER,FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM,My larval sac fell in the toilet! Go fish it out.
85137,330,105,498000,Seymour Skinner,FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM,"Quick, Edna! I'll use your purse as a scoop."
85138,330,106,502000,Seymour Skinner,FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM,"Well, this is it, Edna. As I once said at the battle of Khe Sanh, I surrender."
85139,330,107,503000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM,We are gathered together today to join Seymour and Edna in Holy Matrimony. Does anyone present know any reason why these two should not be wed?
85140,330,108,524000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM,I do.
85141,330,109,527000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM,"No, you say that part later."
85142,330,110,530000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM,"I'm sorry, Seymour. I can't marry someone who doesn't want to be with me."
85143,330,111,539000,Bart Simpson,FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM,"We got a runner. Snipers, take your shot."
85145,330,113,545000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I can't do it! That dress is a Vera Wang.
85146,330,114,549000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Edna?!
85147,330,115,554000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Is this corn oil?
85148,330,116,556000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Canola.
85150,330,118,562000,Wedding Guests,Springfield Elementary School Gym,He drove her to it. / She was only doing it for the appliances.
85151,330,119,565000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Elementary School Gym,He's a she.
85152,330,120,566000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield Elementary School Gym,She's a he.
85153,330,121,568000,Cookie Kwan,Springfield Elementary School Gym,They're both both.
85154,330,122,570000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"Well, I'm uh, I'm afraid Edna has gone from tardy to absent. So uh, let's uh move onto the reception and forget this awkwardness with some delicious shrimp mocktail."
85156,330,124,585000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Principal Skinner, I feel so bad for you."
85157,330,125,588000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Well, in retrospect, I could have been a little more ""into"" the whole thing."
85158,330,126,593000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"""Just The Two Of Us."" I spent fifteen dollars on those dance lessons, might as well use 'em."
85159,330,127,603000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Forward, side, together. Back, side, together. Forward, side, together. Back, side, together..."
85160,330,128,611000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,This is so sad.
85161,330,129,613000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Yeah, he's crazy all right."
85165,330,132,615000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"All right students, what is the center of the circulatory system? It's the heart!"
85166,330,133,622000,Nelson Muntz,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"The heart? You mean like Principal Skinner's, which you broke?"
85167,330,134,626000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,What do you care? You hate Principal Skinner.
85168,330,135,629000,Nelson Muntz,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Eh, bro's before ho's."
85169,330,136,631000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Nelson, I'll see you after class."
85170,330,137,633000,Nelson Muntz,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,I'll be there. Will you?
85171,330,138,638000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Mom, what are you doin' here? Did our house burn down? Whoa, that'd be cool."
85172,330,139,643000,Marge Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"No, I'm here to have a little girl-talk with Mrs. Krabappel."
85173,330,140,647000,Marge Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"So, how are you holdin' up?"
85174,330,141,649000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Actually, I feel fine! Why should I settle for someone who's not passionate about me?"
85175,330,142,653000,Marge Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Oh, passion's for teens and immigrants. I'm just glad to have someone to look at when I wake up in the morning."
85176,330,143,660000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Really?
85177,330,144,660000,Marge Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Well...
85178,330,145,666000,Homer Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Unkink the hose!
85179,330,146,669000,Marge Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Sure there are downsides. But a relationship can't be all hand-holding and restaurant desserts.
85180,330,147,676000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Why not? If I can't have romance and excitement, then what's the point of being married?"
85181,330,148,681000,Marge Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Well, it's... in my case... hmm."
85183,330,150,687000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,"Oh God, I've lost the love of my life. Bart's right, I am a wiener."
85184,330,151,697000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Geez, Homer, this guy is bringin' the whole bar down. I finally got Barney back on the sauce. If he doesn't have fun, he could easily slip right back into sobriety."
85185,330,152,707000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Don't worry. If I feel the urge to sober up, I just talk to my sponsor."
85186,330,153,713000,White Rabbit,Moe's Tavern,Drink or I'll die.
85187,330,154,719000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Wait a minute. I thought you didn't wanna get married.
85188,330,155,722000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,"That was before I missed her smell, her warmth, her beautiful, beautiful penmanship!"
85189,330,156,730000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Don't worry, Principal Skinner."
85190,330,157,731000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,Seymour.
85192,330,158,732000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Really? Boy, it sucks to be you. Anyhoo, if there's one thing I know, it's how to win back a furious woman. We'll go to her house, and I'll whisper to you exactly what to say."
85193,330,159,743000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,Really? You'll be my Cyrano?
85194,330,160,746000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, if we get your girlfriend back I won't have to."
85196,330,162,748000,Homer Simpson,Edna's Apartment,"Okay, just repeat after me. ""Edna, I made a huge mistake and I want you back."""
85197,330,163,751000,Seymour Skinner,Edna's Apartment,"Edna, I made a huge mistake and I want you back. How's that, Homer?"
85198,330,164,763000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Edna's Apartment,"Oh God, it's Seymour. What do I say?"
85199,330,165,765000,Marge Simpson,Edna's Apartment,You just say...
85200,330,166,767000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Edna's Apartment,"It's too late! I'm free and lovin' it, Principal Skinner."
85201,330,167,775000,Seymour Skinner,Edna's Apartment,Every second without you is like a million kicks in the crotch.
85202,330,168,779000,Marge Simpson,Edna's Apartment,"Oh, that's so lovely. But it's too late to win us back with sweet talk!"
85203,330,169,781000,Homer Simpson,Edna's Apartment,Marge? Are you helping her?
85204,330,170,788000,Marge Simpson,Edna's Apartment,"I won't let Edna throw her life away for some passionless marriage where two people lie in bed together with no contact, whittling away the batteries until they die."
85205,330,171,799000,Homer Simpson,Edna's Apartment,Which are you saying is dead? Our marriage or our batteries?
85206,330,172,804000,Marge Simpson,Edna's Apartment,"Let's just say in an emergency, I wouldn't count on either one."
85207,330,173,807000,Seymour Skinner,Edna's Apartment,"Homer, Marge, if I could just speak to Edna for a moment."
85208,330,174,810000,Homer Simpson,Edna's Apartment,Shut up! I didn't tell you to say that!
85209,330,175,813000,Seymour Skinner,Edna's Apartment,Just why am I taking your advice?
85210,330,176,814000,Homer Simpson,Edna's Apartment,Because I'm successfully married.
85211,330,177,817000,Seymour Skinner,Edna's Apartment,There's no ring on that finger.
85212,330,178,819000,Homer Simpson,Edna's Apartment,Uh-oh.
85213,330,179,820000,Homer Simpson,Edna's Apartment,"Why did I take it off? Oh, right. To see if I could skip it across Lake Michigan."
85215,330,181,829000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,I'm here to return the gift you brought to our wedding.
85216,330,182,832000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Ah, yes. An Incredible Hulk melon baller."
85218,330,184,841000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Well, I'm glad you'll be able to enjoy it."
85219,330,185,843000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,I think you did the right thing. You didn't want your life to turn out like this.
85220,330,186,851000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Oh, you're cute. Is there a Mrs. Comic Book Guy?"
85221,330,187,856000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Well, I was married once... in an online fantasy game. We were thinking of having children, but that would have severely drained my power crystals."
85222,330,188,866000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Stop it, you big kidder!"
85223,330,189,869000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Yes, ""kidder."""
85224,330,190,869000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Would you like to get some coffee?
85225,330,191,872000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,And a family bucket of chicken!
