30519,141,1,28000,Sportscaster #1,Simpson Home,"Live from the famous brown sands of Public Beach, Delaware, it's the Grand Nationals of Sand Castle Building... Preview!"
30520,141,2,34000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Saturday afternoon TV is so boring.
30521,141,3,38000,Sportscaster #2,Simpson Home,Bikini girls! Dune buggies! Daredevil surfers!
30522,141,4,47000,Sportscaster #2,Simpson Home,"Ordinarily this beach would be swarming with them... but not today. Oh, no. They've all been cleared out to make way for painstaking sand preparation."
30523,141,5,55000,Sportscaster #1,Simpson Home,"That's right, Dick. Y'know, this year everyone's abuzz about one thing: The absence of Mark Rodkin. Oh, wait, there he is."
30524,141,6,65000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I'm bored."
30525,141,7,67000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you read something?
30526,141,8,68000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because I'm trying to reduce my boredom.
30527,141,9,70000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you could hand out these flyers for the neighborhood rummage sale."
30528,141,10,74000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You'd get some fresh air and exercise.
30529,141,11,77000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Eh. I'll do it anyway.
30530,141,12,78000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, boy, we're going to see the neighbors."
30532,141,14,84000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Good ol' Evergreen Terrace. The swankiest street in the classiest part of Pressboard Estates.
30533,141,15,90000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Well if you love it so much, why are you always littering?"
30534,141,16,93000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,It's easier. Duh.
30535,141,17,100000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Evergreen Terrace,"""THE DREAM POLICE / THEY LIVE INSIDE OF MY BED / THE DREAM POLICE POLICE / THEY COME TO ME IN MY HEAD / THE DREAM POLICE / THEY COME TO ARREST ME NOW / OH, NOOOO.... """
30536,141,18,113000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Evergreen Terrace,"Howdy, neighbor! May I spray you with the hose in a playful fashion?"
30537,141,19,118000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Uh, spray the boy."
30538,141,20,123000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Well, ready for the big rummage sale?"
30539,141,21,125000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Evergreen Terrace,"Oh, yes, indeed. I've got nothing but time until they fix that malfunctioning Squishee machine."
30542,141,24,140000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Hey, I never noticed this place!"
30543,141,25,144000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Dad, it's right across the street from us!"
30544,141,26,146000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,That fancy house'll never sell. Nobody who could afford it would want to live in this neighborhood.
30545,141,27,151000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Hey! What's wrong with this neighborhood? Big shot. Too good to buy a house here, Snobby?"
30546,141,28,156000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Who are you talking to, Homer?"
30547,141,29,158000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,The guy who doesn't live there.
30549,141,31,159000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Can we get rid of this ""Ayatollah"" T-shirt? Khomeini died years ago."
30550,141,32,164000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But, Marge, it works on any Ayatollah! Ayatollah Nakhbadeh, Ayatollah Zahedi... Even as we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power!"
30551,141,33,174000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't care who's consolidating their power. Well, we don't need this."
30552,141,34,179000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, that's the Rhinestone Nights Fashion Gun. I need it to rhinestone-up my old clothing."
30553,141,35,185000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Who's ""Disco Stu?"""
30554,141,36,186000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh. I wanted to write ""DISCO STUD"" but I ran out of space. Not that ""Disco Stu"" didn't get his share of the action!"
30556,141,38,196000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"So if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes, or an artificial Christmas tree -- trunk only, c'mon over to the Hibbert table. Pronto."
30557,141,39,205000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"Well sir, looks like we got some nice items here at Table Glick. Like this..."
30558,141,40,208000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"What the heckaroonie is this, Mrs. Glick?"
30559,141,41,211000,Mrs. Glick,Evergreen Terrace,"It is a candy dish, Ned! Ninety dollars!"
30560,141,42,214000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"Uh-huh. Well, I... uh, I guess you could put a lot of nice things in there--"
30561,141,43,218000,Mrs. Glick,Evergreen Terrace,"No! Just candy, Ned... Ninety dollars!"
30562,141,44,225000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"Well, looks like somebody sold something today."
30563,141,45,231000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Are you interested in that motorized tie rack, Principal Skinner?"
30564,141,46,236000,Seymour Skinner,Evergreen Terrace,Mmm. It's awfully loud.
30565,141,47,238000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Well, you can always take the motor out and use it as an ordinary tie rack..."
30566,141,48,243000,Seymour Skinner,Evergreen Terrace,"But now the ties are motionless. And those in back are virtually inaccessible! Well, it's a moot point, as I have only one tie to begin with. I believe I'll pass."
30567,141,49,255000,Seymour Skinner,Evergreen Terrace,Have you sold that tie rack yet?
30568,141,50,257000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,No.
30569,141,51,257000,Seymour Skinner,Evergreen Terrace,I'll take it.
30570,141,52,258000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"Now, folks, nothin' spells fun like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket!"
30571,141,53,263000,Guy In Crowd,Evergreen Terrace,"Stu, you should buy that."
30572,141,54,265000,Disco Stu,Evergreen Terrace,"Hey, Disco Stu doesn't advertise."
30573,141,55,269000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Uh, hey Ned, lemme help you with that."
30574,141,56,272000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Hey everybody! Who thinks Flanders should shut up?
30576,141,58,278000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"So, anyone here from... Evergreen Terrace?"
30578,141,60,283000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,I think this is the best neighborhood in town. Anybody agree with me?
30580,141,62,287000,Carl Carlson,Evergreen Terrace,"You're the king, Homer!"
30581,141,63,289000,Chief Wiggum,Evergreen Terrace,King of the neighborhood!
30582,141,64,291000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Say. That Ayatollah thinks he's better than America. Is he right?
30584,141,66,299000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Well, for only five dollars you can sock it to him in style!"
30585,141,67,303000,Moe Szyslak,Evergreen Terrace,Right here!
30586,141,68,304000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,And for the man who has everything: a tie rack motor!
30587,141,69,309000,Seymour Skinner,Evergreen Terrace,I'll take that.
30588,141,70,315000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Hey, big spender! / Dig this blender! / Rainbow suspenders!..."
30589,141,71,322000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Hey, big spender!..."
30590,141,72,324000,Crowd,Evergreen Terrace,We surrender!...
30591,141,73,328000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Spend some dough at Table Three!
30593,141,75,340000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Thank you, neighbors, thank you! Now let's give it up for Table Five! Ah-ah-ah-ah / Table Five, Table Five... Ah-ah-ah-ah / Table Fi-i-i-i-i-i-ve..."
30594,141,76,360000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Table Five, Table Five..."
30595,141,77,364000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Hey, what's the big deal? It's just some new guy moving in!"
30596,141,78,370000,Disco Stu,Evergreen Terrace,Disco Stu likes disco music.
30597,141,79,386000,George H.W. Bush,Evergreen Terrace,"Hi there, neighbors. I'm George Bush."
30598,141,80,393000,George H.W. Bush,Evergreen Terrace,Former President George Bush?
30600,141,82,398000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Okay, let's give it up for the new guy. Now let's all turn around and pay attention to me again. Hello? Hello?"
30602,141,84,414000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, a former president, living right across the street!"
30603,141,85,418000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why did he have to move in on my territory? Look at him. Thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot.
30604,141,86,425000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Stupid president. Why couldn't he just stay in his own state?
30605,141,87,429000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually this is one of the nine states where Mr. Bush claims residency, Dad. I wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood."
30606,141,88,437000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait a minute. If Lisa didn't vote for him, and I didn't vote for him--"
30607,141,89,442000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You didn't vote for anybody.
30608,141,90,444000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I voted for Prell to go back to the old glass bottle. After that, I became deeply cynical."
30610,141,92,449000,Agent Johnson,BUSH HOUSE,"And your business here, Mr. Flanders?"
30611,141,93,452000,Ned Flanders,BUSH HOUSE,"Well, sir, I'm welcoming the Bushes on behalf of the Neighborhood Association."
30612,141,94,458000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Never mind about that, Ray. Just give 'em a quick pass with the metal detector and let 'em on in. Hey, Bar, the neighbors are here!"
30613,141,95,465000,Ned Flanders,BUSH HOUSE,"Howdily-Doodily there, President Bush--or should I say President Neighbor! I'm Ned Flanders, and this is Maude, Rod and Todd."
30614,141,96,473000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Well howdily-doodily yourself there, Ned."
30615,141,97,476000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"This's my wife, Barbara. I call her ""Bar."" 'Dja like some lemonade?"
30616,141,98,479000,Ned Flanders,BUSH HOUSE,Tip-top-notch!
30617,141,99,480000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,Okily-Dokily!

30620,141,102,485000,GEORGE BUSH & FLANDERS,BUSH HOUSE,Fine and dandy! Like sour candy!
30621,141,103,487000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Bar's a whiz with cold drinks, aren'tcha, Bar? Don't understand lemonade myself. Not my forté."
30622,141,104,493000,Maude Flanders,BUSH HOUSE,What brings you to Springfield?
30623,141,105,495000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,"Well, George and I just wanted to be private citizens again. Go where nobody cared about politics. So we found the town with the lowest voter turnout in America."
30624,141,106,504000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Just happy to be here among good, average people with no particular hopes or dreams."
30625,141,107,509000,Rod Flanders,BUSH HOUSE,"But, Mr. President, we're not all good people."
30626,141,108,513000,Todd Flanders,BUSH HOUSE,"There's one little boy you should watch out for. He's a bad, bad little boy."
30627,141,109,519000,Ned Flanders,BUSH HOUSE,"Now, Todd, don't scare the president."
30629,141,111,536000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, look at those phonies, sucking up to Bush."
30631,141,113,544000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess you might say he's barking up the wrong bush. Heh heh heh.
148570,141,114,549000,Homer's Brain,Simpson Home,"There it is, Homer: the cleverest thing you'll ever say. And nobody heard it."
30634,141,117,556000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Just gonna relax with my U.S. News and World Whatnot. Oh, good, they're roasting the new guy!"
30635,141,118,564000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Helloooo, Mr. Bush!"
30636,141,119,567000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,"George, this is a neighborhood boy, Bart Simpson. He came over to say hi."
30637,141,120,572000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,Hello.
30638,141,121,573000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Hi!... Hey, what's this?"
30639,141,122,575000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,My electric card shuffler. Don't go near that --
30640,141,123,579000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Now I told you! Aw, those cards were from Air Force One... and they only give you so many packs!"
30641,141,124,585000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,"Oh, George, boys will be boys. Bart's just being friendly. Why don't you get off that sofa and show Bart your photos?"
30642,141,125,591000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Aw, but he'll gunk 'em all up. His hands are probably covered with mud and cookies."
30643,141,126,598000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Oh, probably stole a napkin."
30644,141,127,601000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Who's that, George?"
30645,141,128,602000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,That's me with Charlton Heston. He was --
30646,141,129,604000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Who's that, George?"
30647,141,130,605000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"See, you wouldn't know him. That's Bob Mosbacher. He was Secretary of--"
30648,141,131,609000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"That's a dumb name. Who's that, George?"
30649,141,132,611000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Maybe he thinks ""Bart"" is a dumb--"
30650,141,133,613000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"How many times were you president, George?"
30651,141,134,615000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,Just once. Bar? Isn't it time for dinner yet?
30652,141,135,618000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,I'm making rice. It'll be awhile.
30653,141,136,621000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Did your Secret Service goons ever whack anybody, George?"
30654,141,137,623000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"You know, in my day, little boys didn't call their elders by their first names."
30655,141,138,629000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Yeah, well, welcome to the twentieth century, George."
30656,141,139,631000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"I'll kick you right out of the Twentieth Century, you little..."
30658,141,141,637000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Oh, man, I've only got one minute 'til they stop serving those Breakfast Balls..."
30660,141,143,641000,George H.W. Bush,Springfield,"Let's see now, what do you folks have here, huh? Hmmm... a ""Krusty"" burger. That doesn't sound too appetizing. What kind of stew do you have today?"
30661,141,144,650000,Teenage Kid,Springfield,"Oh, we don't have stew."
30662,141,145,654000,Agent Johnson,Springfield,"Sir, why don't you just have the cheeseburger?"
30663,141,146,656000,George H.W. Bush,Springfield,"That's really more of a weekend thing, Ray."
30664,141,147,658000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Hey, jerk! Move your fanny!"
30665,141,148,661000,George H.W. Bush,Springfield,"That guy's louder than World War Two. Ray, go see what the rhubarb is, willya?"
30666,141,149,667000,Agent Johnson,Springfield,"Sir, could you pop your hood?"
30667,141,150,672000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Hey! My taxes paid for that horn!
30669,141,152,674000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Why hello, Mrs. Bush."
30670,141,153,676000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,"Hi, Bart. Mr. Bush is upstairs napping."
30671,141,154,679000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"You know, your husband's awful grumpy."
30672,141,155,681000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,"Oh, that's just his way. He really likes you... You know, it's time for him to get up and work on his memoirs. Why don't you go wake him?"
30673,141,156,692000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,What the?! Great Scott! Don't touch that! That's the alpenhorn Helmut Kohl gave me!
30674,141,157,697000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,Where'd you get those pajamas?
30675,141,158,699000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,They're presidential pajamas. You have to be president. And you're not president.
30676,141,159,703000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,Yes I am.
30677,141,160,704000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,No you're not! Bar!!
30678,141,161,710000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Hey, where's your candy?"
30679,141,162,712000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,We don't have any! Now go away!
30680,141,163,713000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,"George!... Older people don't eat much candy, Bart, but I could bake you some cookies if you like."
30681,141,164,721000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,Can't remember the last time she made cookies for me.
30682,141,165,724000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,What's that?
30683,141,166,724000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,Oh... nothing.
30685,141,168,725000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right. His story checks out. Marge, would you love me more if I were president? 'Cause I'll do it if it will make you happy."
30686,141,169,734000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie. As long as you keep the car full of gas, I'm happy."
30687,141,170,738000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you can always depend on that."
30689,141,172,745000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"""... and since I'd achieved all my goals as President in one term, there was no need for a second. The end."""
30690,141,173,758000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Good memoirs. Good, not great. Now let's look at that old outboard. Soup that baby up, rattle a few windows down in Kennebunkport next May. Heh heh."
30691,141,174,769000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Helloooo, Mr. Bush!"
30692,141,175,775000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,Whatcha doing?
30693,141,176,776000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Now, now don't upset the desk there... Careful, don't wanna horse around with--"
30694,141,177,779000,Bart Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Hey, cool, what does this do?"
30695,141,178,781000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Now don't you pull that cord, young man!"
30697,141,180,784000,George H.W. Bush,GARAGE,"Aw, now look what you-- whoops! Hey! Bar! My motor's gone loco!"
30698,141,181,788000,George H.W. Bush,GARAGE,"Aw, the birdhouse..."
30699,141,182,790000,George H.W. Bush,GARAGE,My prize orchids!...
30700,141,183,803000,George H.W. Bush,GARAGE,"Oh, no. Not the memoirs. Don't even think about it. Not gonna happen."
30702,141,185,817000,Bart Simpson,GARAGE,"Whoa, man."
30703,141,186,818000,George H.W. Bush,GARAGE,"Whoa, nothing. I'm gonna do something your daddy shoulda done a long time ago."
30704,141,187,827000,George H.W. Bush,GARAGE,"Now go home and think about what you've done, young man."
30706,141,189,832000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"He spanked you? You, Bart Simpson?"
30707,141,190,837000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I begged him to stop, but he said it was for the good of the nation."
30708,141,191,840000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Big deal! When I was a pup we got spanked by presidents 'til the cows came home! Grover Cleveland spanked me on two nonconsecutive occasions!
30709,141,192,849000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Grampa, I know in your day spanking was common, but Homer and I just don't believe in that kind of punishment."
30710,141,193,855000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,And that's why your no good kids are running wild!
30711,141,194,859000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"First Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun of the way I talk... probably..., now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! Well, that's it!"
30713,141,196,874000,Homer Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Hey, Bush! Get out here!"
30714,141,197,877000,Agent Johnson,BUSH HOUSE,"Excuse me, sir, where are you going?"
30715,141,198,880000,Homer Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,I'm going to punch George Bush in the face!
30716,141,199,882000,Agent Johnson,BUSH HOUSE,Okay is he expecting you?
30717,141,200,884000,Homer Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,You owe me an apology!
30718,141,201,885000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Hey, you owe me an apology! If you were any kind of a father you'd've disciplined that boy a long time ago."
30719,141,202,892000,Agent Johnson,BUSH HOUSE,"You wanna step back, sir. You're trampling the flowers."
30720,141,203,895000,Homer Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Oooh? Hiding behind your goons, eh, Bush? Oooh! Well, you are a wimp."
30721,141,204,905000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Wimp, am I?... Agent Johnson, Agent Heintz, you men stand down."
30722,141,205,915000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"All right, mister. You want trouble, you're gonna get trouble."
30723,141,206,919000,Homer Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Oh, I want trouble all right."
30724,141,207,921000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,Then you're gonna get trouble.
30725,141,208,922000,Homer Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"No, you're gonna get trouble."
30726,141,209,924000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Well, that's good, that's good, 'cause I want trouble."
30727,141,210,927000,Homer Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble.
30728,141,211,929000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Oh, yeah. Lots of trouble."
30729,141,212,931000,Homer Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,Trouble it is.
30730,141,213,932000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,For you.
30733,141,216,938000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This is gonna be sweet. Two hundred bottle rockets and George Bush doing toe touches by an open window.
30734,141,217,944000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you get one up his butt, it's a million points."
30736,141,219,954000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,"Why don't you just say you're sorry, George?"
30737,141,220,957000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Because I'm right! Oh, no, I'm gonna fix their wagon good. I've pulled some pranks in my time..."
30738,141,221,966000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,BUSH HOUSE,I... I don't understand. Are you saying you and Barbara are bad neighbors?
30739,141,222,971000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,No! That's not Bar and me; it's them!
30740,141,223,973000,Ned Flanders,BUSH HOUSE,Who? Maude and me?
30741,141,224,975000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"No! The man and his boy! You know! The boy is named Bart. I don't know the name of the man. Bar, what's the name of the man?"
30742,141,225,982000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,"I'm not getting involved, George."
30743,141,226,984000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Look, just never mind. I thought the banner was pretty straightforward, but I guess I'll just take it down."
30744,141,227,989000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,"George, it's time to get dressed."
30745,141,228,992000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Uh-unh, I'm not going outside today, not with those neighbors. Staying right here 'til my speech to the Elks Club."
30746,141,229,1000000,Homer Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,Yoo hoo?
30748,141,231,1004000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH PORCH,Who is it?
30749,141,232,1005000,Homer Simpson,BUSH PORCH,"It's your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush. Come outside, Dad!"
30750,141,233,1009000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH PORCH,"Oh, good. Bar, the boys are out in the front yard. They'll help me think of a plan to get those Simpsons."
30751,141,234,1015000,BARBARA,BUSH PORCH,"Oh, George, is that all you ever think about? The boys probably just want a letter of recommendation."
30752,141,235,1023000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH PORCH,Boys? Where you going?
30753,141,236,1024000,Homer Simpson,BUSH PORCH,"Okay, son! Give him the glue!"
30756,141,239,1036000,George H.W. Bush,ELKS LODGE,... And that's why I will continue to oppose teen alcoholism in all its forms.
30758,141,241,1047000,George H.W. Bush,ELKS LODGE,Now are there any questions?
30759,141,242,1048000,George H.W. Bush,ELKS LODGE,...Keeping in mind that I already explained about my hair?
30760,141,243,1053000,Elks,ELKS LODGE,"Oh, yeah / Right. / Etc."
30762,141,245,1064000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,President Bush is driving on our lawn! He must be lost.
30763,141,246,1068000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,He's not lost.
30764,141,247,1070000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Looks like we're experiencing some blow-back from the wig offensive.
30765,141,248,1073000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's time to hit him where he lives.
30766,141,249,1074000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,His house?
30767,141,250,1075000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bingo.
30769,141,252,1081000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"So I thought to myself, what would God do in this situation?"
30770,141,253,1081000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Locusts. They'll drive him nuts.
30771,141,254,1088000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"It's all in the Bible, son! It's the Prankster's Bible!"
30773,141,256,1100000,George H.W. Bush,Simpson Home,I can't decide if this'll be considered feisty or crazy.
30774,141,257,1105000,George H.W. Bush,Simpson Home,"Hey! What the...? If he thinks George Bush'll stay out of the sewer, he doesn't know George Bush!"
30776,141,259,1114000,George H.W. Bush,STORM DRAIN,"Hey, turkeys! Behind ya!"
30777,141,260,1117000,Homer Simpson,STORM DRAIN,"For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy!"
30778,141,261,1120000,George H.W. Bush,STORM DRAIN,Never! You make him apologize for destroying my memoirs!
30779,141,262,1124000,Homer Simpson,STORM DRAIN,You didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs! Never!
30780,141,263,1139000,Bart Simpson,STORM DRAIN,"Yay, Dad!"
30782,141,265,1141000,BARBARA,Simpson Home,"I really feel awful about your lawn, Marge. George can be so stubborn when he thinks he's right."
30783,141,266,1147000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well Homer, too. They're so much alike."
30784,141,267,1149000,BARBARA,Simpson Home,Too bad they got off on the wrong foot. It's just like the Noriega thing. Now he and George are the best of friends.
30786,141,269,1160000,George H.W. Bush,SEWER DRAIN,Here's a little something we learned in the C.I.A.
30787,141,270,1167000,Bart Simpson,SEWER DRAIN,"Get him, boys!!"
30789,141,272,1178000,GORBACHEV,BUSH HOUSE,Hello? Hello?

30791,141,274,1199000,GORBACHEV,BUSH HOUSE,I just drop by with present for warming of house. Instead find you grappling with local oaf.
30792,141,275,1205000,Homer Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?"
30793,141,276,1209000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"But Mikhail, they put a wig on my head and my memoirs..."
30794,141,277,1213000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,"George, this is the last straw! You apologize to Homer right now!"
30795,141,278,1217000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,But Bar! We can't show any weakness in front of the Russians!
30796,141,279,1221000,BARBARA,BUSH HOUSE,George...
30797,141,280,1227000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"Yes, dear."
30799,141,283,1235000,George H.W. Bush,BUSH HOUSE,"I'm sorry I spanked your boy, Homer."
30800,141,284,1238000,Homer Simpson,BUSH HOUSE,"Woo hoo! In your face, Bush! Now apologize for the tax hike."
30802,141,286,1248000,BARBARA,Simpson Home,"It's a shame it didn't work out, Marge, but George just felt this neighborhood brought out the worst in him and--"
30803,141,287,1259000,BARBARA,Simpson Home,"Oh, my. Well, so long."
30804,141,288,1267000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bye bye!
