27959,131,90,386000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Squalid hell hole... toilet paper hung in improper overhand fashion... Dogs mating on dining room table?
27960,131,91,393000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you doing with my children?!
27961,131,92,398000,Officer Noble,Simpson Home,We're taking them where you can't get them.

27973,131,104,446000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Mmm-hmm. All we want to do is give you kids a good home until they get their act together.
27974,131,105,450000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,You don't understand. Mom and Dad take good care of us.
27975,131,106,453000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,That was a baby tooth... it was loose...
27976,131,107,459000,Officer Noble,Flanders Home,"Don't you worry, little girl. We'll get you some nice county dentures."
27978,131,109,469000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times...
27979,131,110,469000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them away?!
27980,131,111,479000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, bitch, bitch, bitch."
27982,131,112,482000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe I put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family. That is so like me.
27983,131,113,488000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself. I'm the terrible parent. The boy bugs the hell outta me, I can't help Lisa with her homework. The only thing I'm fit to take care of is a houseplant."
27984,131,114,500000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lousy houseplant!
27986,131,116,515000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,Go with it!

27988,131,118,522000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,"Bart, I don't know if this should be an extra."
27989,131,119,524000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,Is your source on this reliable?
27990,131,120,527000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,I hate this place.
27991,131,121,529000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,"Yeah. It seems like our house, but everything's got a creepy Pat Boone-ish quality to it."
27992,131,122,534000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Hey, kids! Nachos, Flanders-style! That's cucumbers with cottage cheese."
27993,131,123,543000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh, Bart. I know you're still getting adjusted here. Tell you what. We'll do whatever you want to do."
27994,131,124,549000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,Watch Itchy and Scratchy!
27995,131,125,551000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Well, I guess a little television won't hurt. I used to let the boys watch ""My Three Sons,"" but it got 'em all worked up before bedtime."
27996,131,126,589000,Scratchy,Flanders Home,Why? Why? My only son.
27997,131,127,604000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,"Daddy, what's the red stuff coming out of Kitty's ears?"
27998,131,128,608000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Uh, er, that's just raspberry jam."
27999,131,129,611000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,"Dad, should I poke Rod with a sharp thing like the mouse did?"
28000,131,130,614000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"No, son. No sirree, Bob."
28002,131,132,621000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Can you see them?
28003,131,133,622000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I can see Lisa... but it might be a starfish. I've gotta call 'em!
28004,131,134,629000,Automated Voice,Simpson Home,The number you have dialed can no longer be reached from this phone... you negligent monster.
28005,131,135,635000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it. We're going downtown to get our kids back. Right now!
28008,131,138,643000,Marge Simpson,Courthouse,"We've always tried to be good parents. Please, I'm begging you, one mother to another -- you must have a family."
28009,131,139,650000,Judge Snyder,Courthouse,"No, I don't care for children."
28010,131,140,652000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,"Now wait a minute! Okay, I'm not gonna win Father of the Year. In fact, I'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. Wait, can I start again? Fathering children is the best part of my day... I'd do anything for Bart and Lisa!"
28011,131,141,668000,Judge Snyder,Courthouse,And Margaret?
28012,131,142,670000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,"Who? Lady, you got the wrong file."
28013,131,143,672000,Marge Simpson,Courthouse,It's Maggie!
28014,131,144,673000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,"Oh, Maggie. I got nothing against Maggie."
28015,131,145,675000,Judge Snyder,Courthouse,"I can see you sincerely want your children back. But you have a lot to learn about being parents. Before I can return your children, you'll have to complete a course called Family Skills. It teaches parents to listen to their..."
28016,131,146,687000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,Communication. Gotcha.
28017,131,147,687000,Judge Snyder,Courthouse,But it's important to...
28018,131,148,687000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,"Listen. Yes, I know."
28019,131,149,687000,Judge Snyder,Courthouse,But there's more to it than...
28020,131,150,692000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,I have listening skills!
28021,131,151,693000,Judge Snyder,Courthouse,"Mr. Simpson, would you please --"
28022,131,152,694000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,"Shut up, Judge!"
28024,131,154,696000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Peek-a-boo! I see you!
28026,131,156,699000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Peek-a-boo! I see you!
28028,131,158,701000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,I never heard Maggie laugh like that before.
28029,131,159,704000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,"Well, when was the last time Dad gave her that kind of attention?"
28030,131,160,708000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,"When she swallowed that quarter, he spent all day with her."
28031,131,161,711000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,"I thought I could ride this thing out, but everything's just too weird here."
28032,131,162,714000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,I know. They put honey on their pancakes instead of maple syrup.
28033,131,163,718000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,And they read Newsweek instead of nothing.
28034,131,164,720000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"C'mon, you Gloomy Gusses. Who's up for a big bowl of non-fat ice milk?"
28035,131,165,724000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,I want wintergreen!
28036,131,166,725000,Maude Flanders,Flanders Home,Unflavored for me!
28039,131,169,728000,Marge Simpson,CLASSROOM,...and then I saw my boy in a burlap sack and they told me he had lice!
28040,131,170,735000,Father In Burlap Sack,CLASSROOM,Is this story goin' somewhere?
28041,131,171,736000,Officer Goodman,CLASSROOM,"All right. Easy there, Flub. We're all gonna get a chance. Mrs. Skinner, why are you here?"
28042,131,172,741000,Agnes Skinner,CLASSROOM,The county is threatening to take my Seymour away. We had another fight over the inflatable bath pillow. I kept screeching and screeching at him but--
28043,131,173,752000,Officer Goodman,CLASSROOM,"All right... Very good. Now, who knows how the Skinners could have resolved this problem...without resorting to violence...or childish name-calling?"
28044,131,174,761000,Officer Goodman,CLASSROOM,"Anybody? Okay, that's okay, because making a happy home isn't like flipping on a light switch."
28045,131,175,768000,Cletus Spuckler,CLASSROOM,Light switch?
28046,131,176,770000,Officer Goodman,CLASSROOM,"There are a lot of little tricks to it, things you should have learned a long time ago. Such as: If you leave milk out, it can go sour. Put it in the refrigerator, or failing that, a cool, wet sack..."
28047,131,177,783000,Officer Goodman,CLASSROOM,"And put your garbage in a garbage can, people. I can't stress that enough. Don't just throw it out the window."
28048,131,178,789000,Marge Simpson,CLASSROOM,This is so humiliating.
28049,131,179,791000,Homer Simpson,CLASSROOM,Garbage in garbage can. Makes sense.
28051,131,181,795000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Nighty night, my sweet li'l foundling-a-dings."
28052,131,182,798000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,But it's only 7 o'clock.
28053,131,183,800000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,Yeah. The sun is still out.
28055,131,185,810000,Maude Flanders,Flanders Home,THEY SAY YOUR FOLKS CAN'T PAY THE RENT/ SO WE'RE WATCHING YOU BY ACT OF GOVERNMENT.
28056,131,186,816000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE / BUT YOU GOT US, AND BABY, WE GOT YOU."
28057,131,187,824000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"BABE. WE GOT YOU, BABE."
28058,131,188,828000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,"You know, Maggie hasn't been a Simpson as long as us. I think she's beginning to forget Mom and Dad."
28059,131,189,834000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,Remember how Mom used to microwave our underwear on cold days?
28060,131,190,838000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,Or the way Dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips?
28062,131,192,845000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,They're ten feet away and we can't even talk to them. I wish I could tell them how much I miss them.
28064,131,194,860000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's so quiet here without the kids.
28065,131,195,863000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What I wouldn't give to hear Lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes.
27981,131,196,868000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Saxa-ma-phone. Saxa-ma-phone.
28066,131,197,873000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I miss the way Bart would say something and then say ""dude."""
28067,131,198,873000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I wish I knew something about the baby I could miss now.
28068,131,199,882000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean Maggie?
28069,131,200,882000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it.
28070,131,201,884000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We've never been separated from the kids for so long. I don't know how much more I can take.
28071,131,202,890000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,There's Bart's ring!
28072,131,203,904000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Todd Smells. Aw, I already knew that."
28073,131,204,907000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, look at the other side."
28076,131,207,920000,Officer Goodman,Family Skills Class,"Okay, let's see if we've learned anything. I want you two to simulate a typical household problem... Go!"
28077,131,208,925000,Cletus Spuckler,Family Skills Class,"Paw, I cut myself on the screen door again."
28078,131,209,928000,Homer Simpson,Family Skills Class,Why you cotton pickin' --
28080,131,211,938000,Homer Simpson,Family Skills Class,"No! I've gotta pass this class for my kids. Son, let's stop the fussin' and a-feudin'."
