30261,140,1,1379000,Bart Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Omigod! The ""Mad Magazine Special Edition""! They only put out seventeen of these a year!"
30262,140,2,1379000,Milhouse Van Houten,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Boy, they're really socking it to that Spiro Agnew guy again! He must work there or something."
30263,140,3,1379000,Bart Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Let's do the fold-in.
30264,140,4,1379000,Milhouse Van Houten,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Okay. ""What higher power do TV evangelists worship?"""
30265,140,5,1379000,Bart Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,I'll say God.
30266,140,6,1379000,Milhouse Van Houten,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,I'll say Jesus.
30267,140,7,1379000,Milhouse Van Houten,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"""THE ALL-MIGHTY DOLLAR""?!!"
30269,140,8,1379000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"You fold it, you bought it."
30271,140,10,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo! ""Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions""! I'm great at these. Ask me if something smells funny in here, boy."
30272,140,11,1379000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Does something smell funny in here?
30273,140,12,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't think so, stupid!"
30274,140,13,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, you want pork chops?"
30275,140,14,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I want roast beef, you clod!"
30276,140,15,1379000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look at this! Special insert -- ""Iron-On Mad-ness!"" ""BAN THE BATH,"" ""DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER TEN,"" ""SOCK IT TO ME""..."
30277,140,16,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.
30278,140,17,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""The All igh-ty ollar?"" I get it."
30280,140,19,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Gee, business stinks tonight. Where's Barney, Lenny, and Carl?"
30281,140,20,1379000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Ahhh... they never come around anymore now that they've got their mistresses.
30282,140,21,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Eh, might as well close the dump."
30283,140,22,1379000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Moe's Tavern,I'm gonna drink you under the table.
30284,140,23,1379000,Quimby #2,Moe's Tavern,"No, I am going to drink you under the..."
30285,140,24,1379000,Quimbys,Moe's Tavern,Awwww.
30286,140,25,1379000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, you're closing. It's getting late. My kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. There's gotta be some other place we can go. Think, Moe. Think."
30288,140,27,1379000,Bowling Clerk,Barney's Bowlarama,"Sorry, it's ""League Night."" I couldn't give a lane to my own mother."
30289,140,28,1379000,Lunchlady Doris,Barney's Bowlarama,I have no son.
30290,140,29,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"Man, you go through life, you try to be nice to people, you struggle to resist the urge to punch 'em in the face, and for what?! For some pimply little puke to treat you like dirt unless you're on a ""team!"" Well I'm better than dirt... Well, most kinds of dirt... I mean, not that fancy store-bought dirt. That stuff's loaded with nutrients. I... I can't compete with that stuff."
30291,140,30,1379000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Barney's Bowlarama,That I cannot bowl wreaks havoc with my self-esteem as well. But who am I to complain?
30292,140,31,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. I wannabe a league bowler.
30293,140,32,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Hey, we can be a team!"
30295,140,33,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Excuse me, but my ""team"" is ready to bowl."
30296,140,34,1379000,Bowling Clerk,Barney's Bowlarama,You're short one person.
30297,140,35,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Uh...
30298,140,36,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,That longhair freak's bowled with us for years.
30299,140,37,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,"I don't care if it takes all night, I'm gonna get me that lobster harmonica!"
30300,140,38,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,"Come on, lobsti."
30301,140,39,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,Whoa.
30302,140,40,1379000,Bowling Clerk,Barney's Bowlarama,"Okay, then, I just need your five hundred dollar registration fee."
30303,140,41,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Five hundred dollars?! No problem. Would you take an out-of-state, two-party bad check?"
30305,140,43,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"No, I will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex!!"
30306,140,44,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Aw, come on, Marge! You're getting something in return! And I'm getting a bowling team. It's win/win!"
30307,140,45,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,It's sick! And I don't have that kind of money to spend on sex! Maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team. Like Mr. Burns.
30308,140,46,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Burns never gives money to anybody. Just last week, I asked him for fifteen hundred dollars."
30309,140,47,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,For what?
30310,140,48,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Ooh, I've got to get the third degree from you, too?"
30312,140,50,1379000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Bart's Classroom,Tonight's homework assignment is...
30313,140,51,1379000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Classroom,"Oh man, is it hot in here! I better take off my sweater."
30314,140,52,1379000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Bart's Classroom,Down... With... HOMEWORK?!
30315,140,53,1379000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Bart's Classroom,"Don't look at it, children!"
30316,140,54,1379000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Classroom,The shirt makes a good point.
30317,140,55,1379000,Nelson Muntz,Bart's Classroom,I'm with the shirt. Homework rots!
30318,140,56,1379000,Class,Bart's Classroom,Down with homework! Down with homework! Down with homework!
30320,140,58,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"As I was saying, my yearly evaluation couldn't've come at a better time."
30321,140,59,1379000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Well, Seymour, I must say for once I am impressed. In fact, I'm going to give this school a perfect ten. I'll just write the zero first. Now a vertical line to indicate the one..."
30322,140,60,1379000,Students,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,Down with homework! Down with homework! Down with homework!
30323,140,61,1379000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,Skinner!!! Why are there children walking on my head?
30325,140,63,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"So we meet again, Mad Magazine..."
30326,140,64,1379000,Bart Simpson,Skinner's Office,How do you know it's from Mad?
30327,140,65,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"The year was 1968. We were on re-con in a steaming Mekong delta. An overheated private removed his flak jacket, revealing a T-shirt with an iron-on sporting the Mad slogan, ""UP WITH MINI-SKIRTS."" Well, we all had a good laugh, even though I didn't quite understand it."
30328,140,66,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"But our momentary lapse of concentration allowed ""Charlie"" to get the drop on us. I spent the next three years in a POW camp, forced to subsist on a thin stew made of fish, vegetables, prawns, coconut milk and four kinds of rice. I came close to madness trying to find it here in the States, but they just can't get the spices right..."
30329,140,67,1379000,Bart Simpson,Skinner's Office,"... Ah, my punishment?"
30330,140,68,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Hmm... Oh. I'm going to have to think about that. Meanwhile, wear this home."
30332,140,70,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Oooo... I need some more ether. I can still feel the movement of the emery board.
30333,140,71,1379000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"We're fresh out, Sir. I'll get some more."
30334,140,72,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Leave the rag.
30335,140,73,1379000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Uh... Excuse me, Mr. Burns?"
30336,140,74,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Pop 'n Fresh! You glutinous little doughboy! Oh, there's something I've wanted to do to you for years."
30337,140,75,1379000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Mr. Burns, I, uh, was wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team... for five hundred dollars."
30338,140,76,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Oh, why, certainly, Pop 'n Fresh. I... I owe my robust physique to your tubes of triple-bleached goo."
30339,140,77,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Woo hoo!
30341,140,79,1379000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Outer Office,"Hey, everybody, if you want to ask Burns for a favor, now's the time! He's doped up or dyin' or something!"
30343,140,81,1379000,Hans Moleman,Burns's Office,"Ah, excuse me. I'd like to request seventeen dollars for a push-broom rebristling."
30344,140,82,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Why, it's that delightful TV leprechaun! I'm going to get your lucky charms."
30346,140,84,1379000,Hans Moleman,Burns's Outer Office,"Oh, no! My brains."
30347,140,86,1379000,Krusty the Clown,Barney's Bowlarama,"Hey, nice quote uniforms, end quote."
30348,140,87,1379000,Kent Brockman,Barney's Bowlarama,This just in. A new addition to our worst-dressed list... those guys.
30349,140,88,1379000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oh, forget this. I am far too fragile to withstand an evening of barbs like that."
30350,140,89,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oh, c'mon, if we quit now we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us."
30351,140,90,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,Ya... you're right. That's the kind of thing that would haunt you.
30352,140,91,1379000,Bumblebee Man,Barney's Bowlarama,"Si! Buenos noches, senoritas!"
30353,140,92,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,Whud he say?! Whud he say?! Was that about me?
30354,140,93,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,"Okay, Otto. Pressure's on. Don't-choke-don't-choke-don't-choke-dooooon't-- -- CHOKE!!"
30355,140,94,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oh, man! I knew I was gonna choke!"
30356,140,95,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"Well, that's a funny-looking strike."
30357,140,96,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"C'mon, guys. Let's be the team that supports each other. YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / HELP EACH OTHER OUT, THAT'LL BE OUR MOTTO..."
30358,140,97,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / YOU CAN DO IT OTTO...
30359,140,98,1379000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Barney's Bowlarama,MAKE THIS SPARE I'LL GIVE YOU FREE GELATTO...
30360,140,99,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,THEN BACK TO MY PLACE WHERE I WILL GET YOU BLOTTO...
30361,140,100,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"DOMO AREGATTO, MISTER ROBOTO..."
30362,140,101,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / YOU CAN DO IT...
30363,140,102,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,"Uh, guys. I made the spare. We won."
30364,140,103,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,Yayyy! / Way to go! / The Pin Pals did it! / We won! / Team work! /
30365,140,104,1379000,Al,Barney's Bowlarama,Those beers are five dollars apiece.
30367,140,106,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lemme set the scene for you, Marge."
30368,140,107,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,All right.
30369,140,108,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's a 7-10 split.
30370,140,109,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-huh.
30371,140,110,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The hardest shot in bowling. It was all up to me.
30372,140,111,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Ooh.
30373,140,112,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So I got up all my courage. Right away, my lips started to move and I came up with a chant that won the match."
30374,140,113,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Who knocked down the pins?
30375,140,114,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't know. You know, some guy. Otto, I guess."
30376,140,115,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Good for him!
30377,140,116,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you're missing the point. The individual doesn't matter. It was a team effort and I was the one who came up with the whole team idea. Me."
30378,140,117,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe Otto picked up a 7-10 split. He's phenomenal!
30379,140,118,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But... but...
30380,140,119,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Wow!
30382,140,121,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"Several days ago, a violent riot erupted, incited by an inflammatory T-shirt slogan."
30383,140,122,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,No! No! Now don't try to remember what that slogan was.
30384,140,123,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"To ensure that this frenzied dance of destruction is never repeated, I have decided, starting Monday, all students will be required to wear uniforms."
30385,140,124,1379000,Students,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,Uniforms?!
30386,140,125,1379000,Lunchlady Doris,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"Say hello to our little genius Martin, who looks even smarter in this vest and short pant combination from Mr. Boy of Main Street. Or how about Little Lisa Simpson..."
30387,140,126,1379000,Lunchlady Doris,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"She'll have no reason to play the blues in this snappy ensemble, topped off with a saucy French beret that seems to scream , ""Silence."""
30388,140,127,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"All right. Pick your size, extra-small or extra-large. We've got both. No pushing now... I... What?... Oh. I've just been informed we've run out of extra-large."
30390,140,129,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,"GO, MOE / GO MOE / DON'T MAKE HOMER SHOUT OUT !"
30391,140,130,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,Alright! The Pin Pals win again! Etc.
30392,140,131,1379000,Chief Wiggum,Barney's Bowlarama,"All right, Snake, make us proud."
30393,140,132,1379000,Snake Jailbird,Barney's Bowlarama,One... two... three... four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-ten -- 'Bye!
30394,140,133,1379000,Chief Wiggum,Barney's Bowlarama,Ahh... We forfeit.
30395,140,134,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"There it is, boys, the championship trophy!"
30396,140,135,1379000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Barney's Bowlarama,We will never possess it. The Holy Rollers have won it five years in a row.
30397,140,136,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"Ah, they think they're so high and mighty, just 'cause they never got caught drivin' without pants."
30398,140,137,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Ah, ha, ha, ha, God-boy couldn't get a strike."
30399,140,138,1379000,Ned Flanders,Barney's Bowlarama,It's me... Ned.
30402,140,140,1379000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Mom, my sling shot doesn't fit in these pockets. And these shorts leave nothing to the imagination. These uniforms suck!"
30403,140,141,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Bart! Where do you pick up words like that?
30404,140,142,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night! They just plain sucked! I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!"
30405,140,143,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Homer! Watch your mouth!
30406,140,144,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Gotta go. My damn wiener kids are listening.
30407,140,145,1379000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,We are not wieners!
30408,140,146,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Then what are you dressed like that for?
30409,140,147,1379000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,They made us!
30410,140,148,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"""They made us!"" That's loser talk! You gotta start acting more like me and my team, the future league champions of the world! Nothing's gonna stop us now!"
30412,140,150,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Stop everything! I don't remember writing a check for bowling!
30413,140,151,1379000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Uh, sir. That's a check for your boweling."
30414,140,152,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Oh, yes. That's very important."
30415,140,153,1379000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Yes, sir. Remember that month you didn't do it?"
30416,140,154,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Yes, that was unpleasant for all concerned. Anyway, back to the checks... Stop everything! I don't remember writing a check for bowling!"
30417,140,155,1379000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Hmmm. The memo says, ""To my pal, Pop 'n Fresh."""
30418,140,156,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Oh, yes. That greedy, grasping, glob of chemicals."
30419,140,157,1379000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Probably one of your ether-induced hallucinations, sir. I'll check the employee files to see who could pull off such an impersonation."
30420,140,158,1379000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Now, it was either Pops Freshenmeyer..."
30421,140,159,1379000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,Or Homer Simpson.
30422,140,160,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Simpson, eh? Let's shut down this bowling scam right now."
30424,140,162,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"COME ON HOMER, COME ON HOMER / PRETEND THIS IS BASEBALL / AND HIT US A HOMER!"
30425,140,163,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"Way to go, Homer! We win again! Good job! Etc."
30426,140,164,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"By the way, rhyming Homer with Homer..."
30427,140,165,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"Look at them, Smithers, enjoying their embezzlement."
30428,140,166,1379000,Waylon Smithers,Barney's Bowlarama,"I have a much uglier word for it, Sir: ""Misappropriation."""
30429,140,167,1379000,Waylon Smithers,Barney's Bowlarama,Simpson!
30430,140,168,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,Listen here... I want to join your team.
30431,140,169,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,You want to join my what?
30432,140,170,1379000,Waylon Smithers,Barney's Bowlarama,You want to what his team?
30433,140,171,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,I've had one of my unpredictable changes of heart. Seeing these fine young athletes reveling in the humiliation of a vanquished foe... I haven't felt this energized since my last... boweling.
30434,140,172,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oh, man, he'll blow our winning streak."
30435,140,173,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"Yeah. Call this an unfair generalization if you must, but old people are no good at everything."
30436,140,174,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Look, guys. It's not that simple, he's my boss. I'll tell you what: I'll give him a shot and if he stinks, it'll be easier to tell him no."
30438,140,176,1379000,Homer Simpson,Alley,Welcome aboard. It wasn't any easier.
30440,140,178,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Ahhh, these uniforms are a godsend. Horseplay is down 40 percent. Youthful exuberance has been cut in half, and high spirits are at an all-time low."
30441,140,179,1379000,Nurselady Doris,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,They've even begun blinking in unison.
30442,140,180,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,I love that sound.
30444,140,182,1379000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Bart's Classroom,"Now, children, while you're having quiet time, I'm going to make sure my desk is exactly parallel to the rear wall."
30445,140,183,1379000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Classroom,"Oh! There's something I used to do in this situation, but... can't... remember..."
30446,140,184,1379000,Nelson Muntz,Bart's Classroom,Haw... Ho?
30448,140,186,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,"Whoo, I can't believe I got booted off the team for Mister Businessman. I bet I'll get a little respect once I get that Harvard Diploma."
30449,140,187,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,Look at that. All the way to the end with only one push.
30450,140,188,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"Ah, that's the third game in a row he cost us, Homer!"
30451,140,189,1379000,Luigi,Barney's Bowlarama,Mama mia!
30452,140,190,1379000,Groundskeeper Willie,Barney's Bowlarama,Hoot mon!
30453,140,191,1379000,Cletus Spuckler,Barney's Bowlarama,Yee haw!
30454,140,192,1379000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Barney's Bowlarama,"Arrgh, me maties. Arrgh."
30456,140,193,1379000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Barney's Bowlarama,Whoo! They begged me to join their team. Begged me.
30457,140,194,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"Well, we certainly got walloped tonight, eh fellas?"
30458,140,195,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Uh, Mr. Burns, next week is the big championship game..."
30459,140,196,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"Ah, yes. That silly championship? The only ""ship"" worth a damn is friendship. Look, here comes the friend ship, sailing your way..."
30460,140,197,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oooh, here, let me get that, friend."
30461,140,198,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oops, lost a nail. Well, that's leprosy for you."
30463,140,200,1379000,Rod Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"You're ""it."""
30464,140,201,1379000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Now you are the one who is ""it."""
30465,140,202,1379000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Understood.
30466,140,203,1379000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Well, I've gotta hand it to you, Seymour. These drab student coverings have created the perfect distraction-free environment, thus preparing the children for permanent positions in tomorrow's mills and processing facilities. Best of all, with less than a minute to go before I leave, absolutely nothing has gone wrong."
30467,140,204,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Well, it is starting to rain, but I can hardly be blamed for that, can I?"
30468,140,205,1379000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Yes, very good."
30469,140,206,1379000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Wow, look at all the colors, man!"
30470,140,207,1379000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Red, green, yellow, orange! I remember all of these!"
30471,140,208,1379000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Playground,I'm freaking out!
30472,140,209,1379000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Hey, something's comin' back to me! Down with homework!"
30473,140,210,1379000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School Playground,And down with uniforms!
30474,140,211,1379000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Ow!Ow!Ow!Ow! Skinner!!! Why aren't these uniforms colorfast?
30475,140,212,1379000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,I don't understand it. I got them at the same place I buy Mother's dresses. Good Lord! Mother's in the park!
30476,140,213,1379000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Now this I gotta see!
30478,140,215,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Aw, Marge, we were so close to winning the championship. Now thanks to Burns it's never gonna happen. And I spent so much time building that trophy case."
30479,140,216,1379000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Homer, maybe Mr. Burns will bowl a great game and you will win your championship."
30481,140,217,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,So you're saying we're definitely gonna win? -- Woo hoo! I won't need this any more!
30482,140,218,1379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Marge! Someone broke the toilet!
30484,140,220,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"Don't worry about nothin', Homer. I have a feeling that Mr. Burns is gonna have a little accident that might keep him from bowling with us tonight. Heh, heh, heh..."
30485,140,221,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"Smithers, I'm afraid I won't be able to play tonight. My old gimpy knee has gone akimbo again, and..."
30486,140,222,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,Take that!
30487,140,223,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,Smithers! That precision assault popped it back into place! Thank you masked stranger!
30488,140,224,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"Aw, he's gonna ruin everything. All right, that's it Homer! Either Burns goes or Moe goes."
30489,140,225,1379000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Barney's Bowlarama,Yes. I am afraid that I am going to have to make a similar threat with my name in place of Moe's name.
30490,140,226,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"So, who's ready to kick some Christian keister?"
30491,140,227,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Mr. Burns, as team captain, it's my duty to inform you that..."
30492,140,228,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oh, I almost forgot. I brought you all a little something."
30493,140,229,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"Aw, would you look at that. The Pin Pals."
30494,140,230,1379000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Barney's Bowlarama,"At last, I finally have a garment fine enough to be married in."
30495,140,231,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"I've always been wealthy , but this is the first time I ever felt rich."
30496,140,232,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Awww.
30497,140,233,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"Now, Homer, you were about to say something to me..."
30498,140,234,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,You're off the team.
30499,140,235,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,What?
30500,140,236,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"Homer! He's just ribbing you, Monty."
30501,140,237,1379000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Barney's Bowlarama,Yes.
30502,140,238,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,You guys!
30503,140,239,1379000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Barney's Bowlarama,Hallelujah.
30504,140,240,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"Nice one, Homer."
30505,140,241,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Thanks.
30506,140,242,1379000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Barney's Bowlarama,Okay. The Holy Rollers are ahead by one pin and we only have one bowler left... Mr. Burns.
30507,140,243,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"Next time, a few steps more toward center, don't you think?"
30508,140,244,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Goodbye, trophy."
30401,140,245,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,"Whoa! Whatever I got ahold of, it's big!"
30455,140,246,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,Yes!!
29836,140,247,1379000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Barney's Bowlarama,Yes!
30268,140,248,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,Excellent.
30294,140,249,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Woo hoo! We won! We won!
30509,140,250,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,You mean I won.
30510,140,251,1379000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Barney's Bowlarama,"But we were a team, Sir."
30511,140,252,1379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oh. I'm afraid I've had one of my trademark changes of heart. You see, teamwork will only take you so far, then the truly evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory. Now, I must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win the title. Ta!"
30512,140,253,1379000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"I guess some people never change. Or they quickly change, and then quickly change back."
30513,140,254,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"You know what? We don't need him or his trophy. We got each other, huh?"
30514,140,255,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,GO HOMER YOU'RE OUR MAN / IF YOU CAN'T DO IT NO ONE CAN!
30516,140,257,1379000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,I guess no one can.
30517,140,258,1379000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"Run, before they're through feeding!"
