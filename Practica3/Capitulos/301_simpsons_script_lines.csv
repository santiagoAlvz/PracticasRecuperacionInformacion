77010,301,66,298000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No that's not it. He's got some secret. And I'm gonna find out what it is, no matter what it takes."
77012,301,68,305000,Homer Simpson,FLANDERS' KITCHEN,"Flanders, what's your secret? You never get arrested, you don't buy your clothes at ""Mr. Blob"" and look at your beautiful lawn. It sickens me."
77013,301,69,313000,Ned Flanders,FLANDERS' KITCHEN,"Well, whatever I've got I owe to hard work, honest living, and flossing my teeth, tail and toes. Plus a little prayer now and then."

77023,301,79,353000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"O, Merciful God, who has blessed mankind with two kinds of clam chowder, help me find the remote."

77046,301,103,498000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lord, please use your space-age, clog-busting powers on this stubborn drain. Then take some time off for yourself. Fly to France. Have a nice dinner."

77048,301,105,510000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Lord, I see thou art working through thy imperfect vessel, Marge. For thou art most wise..."

77053,301,110,530000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,How bad is it?
77054,301,111,531000,Plumber,Simpson Kitchen,Your pipes have more roots than the list of all-time top-rated TV shows.

77056,301,113,538000,Plumber,Simpson Kitchen,I don't think all that moisture's gonna do wonders for your drywall. And it ain't in such great shape as it is.
77058,301,115,552000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,You was hiding behind the drywall. Yes you were! I'm glad Social Services didn't see this. Yes I am!

148616,301,118,569000,Homer's Thoughts,First Church of Springfield,"Lord, this is a dire emergency. If you could fix my house, or make a new house from one of my ribs..."

76980,301,121,587000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I think my leg is broken.
77063,301,122,589000,Lawyer,First Church of Springfield,"Slip and fall? Can't go back to work? I'm Larry H. Lawyer, Junior. And I will fight for you! I also habla español."

77065,301,124,600000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Homer, we can't sue the church. They'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin."
77066,301,125,604000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,It wouldn't be the first time.
77067,301,126,606000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I couldn't help it. Those pews are so comfortable.
77068,301,127,610000,Lawyer,First Church of Springfield,You have rights. You deserve financial compensation.
77069,301,128,613000,NICK RIVIERA,First Church of Springfield,He got me sixty thousand dollars. And I was driving drunk in a graveyard.
77071,301,130,619000,Lawyer,Simpson Home,"Now you're my first client who actually is injured. According to this book, that's a big plus."
77072,301,131,624000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Homer, please don't sue the church. I'm asking you as your friend and neighbor."
77073,301,132,629000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Can I borrow your pen to sign this deposition?
77074,301,133,631000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Okely dokely.
77075,301,134,634000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Why do I always give in to him?
77076,301,135,636000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,It's his skull. It's hypnotic!
77078,301,137,638000,Bailiff,Court,Now hearing Homer Simpson versus The First Church of Springfield.
77079,301,138,642000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Court,"Morning, Judge. How is your lovely wife?"
77080,301,139,646000,Judge Snyder,Court,She was run over by a clergyman.
77083,301,142,650000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"We're very sorry for the victim's injury. But as this tape demonstrates, Mr. Simpson is accident prone."
77084,301,143,659000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,I can't see anything in this fog.
77085,301,144,668000,Cletus Spuckler,Courtroom,"Your Honor, we the jury find that to be America's funniest home video. Back to you, Bob Saget."
77086,301,145,677000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,This is a court of law!
77087,301,146,678000,Cletus Spuckler,Courtroom,Okey-doke. We find for Mr. Simpson in the sum of one million dollars.
77088,301,147,684000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Woo-hoo! Can I get that in lottery tickets, please?"
77089,301,148,687000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Courtroom,"Your Honor, we don't have that kind of money. We're not a synagogue."
77090,301,149,693000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,In that case I award Mr. Simpson the deed to the church.
77091,301,150,697000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Courtroom,You're giving him the church?
77093,301,151,699000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"He's not giving it to me, God is. Because I prayed for it."
77094,301,152,703000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,"Dad, I think this might be the work of Satan."
77095,301,153,705000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,It's all good.
77097,301,155,713000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Homer, for the last time..."
77098,301,156,713000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Please give the church back.
77099,301,157,718000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,That is gonna drive me nuts.
77100,301,158,720000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Look, this church is our only option. Don't you kids want to live here?"
77101,301,159,724000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Anything's better than that dump we came from.
77102,301,160,727000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,And there are so many places to cloister myself!
77103,301,161,730000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"The dog's on board, too."
77104,301,162,732000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Aw... he thinks he's papal.
77106,301,164,737000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Well, the court has spoken, so... here you go. The baptismal font tends to run, you have to jiggle the handle. Oh, and Wednesday is garbage day."
77107,301,165,747000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Sweet.
77108,301,166,748000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"I'm so sorry, Reverend."
77109,301,167,751000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, it's not so bad. We'll be staying with the Flanderses."
77110,301,168,754000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"And Rev, you'll be bunkin' with me!"
77112,301,170,772000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, I love this song."
77113,301,171,773000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU, BABY / YOU WERE MADE FOR LOVING ME..."
77114,301,172,781000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU, BABY..."
77115,301,173,785000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Dad, there's a bunch of people in the Community Outreach Center."
77116,301,174,787000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,We'll just see about that.
77118,301,176,792000,Barney Gumble,COMMUNITY OUTREACH CENTER,"If it weren't for Alcoholics Anonymous, I'd still be sucking the juice out of glow sticks."
77120,301,178,802000,Homer Simpson,COMMUNITY OUTREACH CENTER,"I'm so sorry for all your horrible problems, but this is our dog's room now."
77121,301,179,809000,Sideshow Mel,COMMUNITY OUTREACH CENTER,Wherever shall we go?
77122,301,180,811000,Moe Szyslak,COMMUNITY OUTREACH CENTER,You can come to my church.
77123,301,181,813000,Sideshow Mel,COMMUNITY OUTREACH CENTER,And what church might that be?

77125,301,183,818000,Barney Gumble,COMMUNITY OUTREACH CENTER,"Okay, let's go there."
77126,301,184,822000,Marge Simpson,COMMUNITY OUTREACH CENTER,"Homer, that was not very Christian of you."
77127,301,185,825000,Homer Simpson,COMMUNITY OUTREACH CENTER,"You're right, Marge. I'll make it up to them. By throwing the bitchin-est beer bash this church has ever seen!"
77130,301,188,842000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Bless you, bless you, how you doin'?"
77131,301,189,848000,Lenny Leonard,First Church of Springfield,"Wow Homer, this is like a party Dick Clark would throw."
77132,301,190,850000,Carl Carlson,First Church of Springfield,"Yeah, fun, but not too fun."
77133,301,191,852000,Lenny Leonard,First Church of Springfield,So where's Marge?
77134,301,192,854000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,She went to Lovejoy's temporary church. She's worried about her immortal soul.
77136,301,194,860000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Barney's Bowlarama,He said to his disciples...
77137,301,195,863000,Bowler,Barney's Bowlarama,"In your face, Bestway Linen Supply!"

77140,301,198,877000,Krusty the Clown,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oh, heh heh, sorry Padre. I didn't mean to embarrass you in front of the goyim."
77141,301,199,883000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Barney's Bowlarama,"As I was saying, if we keep our hearts pure we can-- Dr. Hibbert, must you play the claw machine?"
77142,301,200,891000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Barney's Bowlarama,I'll be right there. I've almost got me a kitty cat.
77143,301,201,900000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,I really enjoyed your sermon. Particularly the part about the pin in the gutter on lane fifteen.
77144,301,202,907000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Barney's Bowlarama,"That wasn't me, that was the manager."
77145,301,203,909000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Are you sure? Because it really spoke to me.
77146,301,204,913000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Barney's Bowlarama,"Marge, it's as plain as the bruise on my shin -- there's no place for me here."
77147,301,205,922000,Ned Flanders,Barney's Bowlarama,"Where you going, Reverend? The town's that way. Reverend? You're goin' the wrong way!"
77148,301,206,928000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"I'm sorry, Ned. Looks like God has packed up and left Springfield."
77150,301,208,933000,Ned Flanders,Barney's Bowlarama,"No, no, you're lying! You're lying! What makes you lie?"
77152,301,210,946000,Kent Brockman,Channel 6 Studios,Good evening. Springfield is still grappling tonight with the departure of Reverend Timothy Lovejoy. Local bible nut.
77153,301,211,953000,Kent Brockman,Channel 6 Studios,How is our community coping with this spiritual vacuum? Let's ask Arnie Pye in the sky.
77155,301,213,959000,Arnie Pye,Channel 6 Helicopter,"You wanna know what I see, Kent? I see a slow news day with nothing to fill it."
77156,301,214,964000,Kent Brockman,Channel 6 Helicopter,"Arnie, you're supposed to be filming people coping with the loss of their church."
77157,301,215,969000,Arnie Pye,Channel 6 Helicopter,"And how am I supposed to do that? Do I have a magic lens that can see into people's souls? Well, yours would be black, Kent! Black as the ace of spades!"
77159,301,217,989000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Homer, send these people home. This housewarming party's been going on for two days."
77160,301,218,994000,Moe Szyslak,First Church of Springfield,"Hey, hey, you can't throw us out. I just made a Cornish game hen with chestnut stuffing. Would you believe a pigeon stuffed with Spam? Would you believe a rat filled with cough drops?"
77162,301,220,1011000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,They've broken every commandment except one!
77163,301,221,1014000,Carl Carlson,Flanders Home,"Hey, Lenny, covet some more chili fries?"

77165,301,223,1018000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,That's it. The whole shebang.
77166,301,224,1023000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Lord, this town may have turned its back on you, but not the Flanderses. Wherever we are, you'll have your church. Are you with me, boys?"
77168,301,226,1034000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Speaking in tongues. What great kids.
77171,301,229,1041000,Moe Szyslak,CHURCH GROUNDS,"Full house, jacks over twos. Ha ha-ha, read 'em and strip, Barn."
77172,301,230,1047000,Moe Szyslak,CHURCH GROUNDS,"Ah, ah, ah. Slowly. Make me forget my troubles."
77173,301,231,1051000,Barney Gumble,CHURCH GROUNDS,"Aw, I hate this game."
77174,301,232,1056000,Lenny Leonard,CHURCH GROUNDS,"Look at all this, the great food, the party, the sunshine -- it's hard to believe one God came up with all this."
77175,301,233,1062000,Carl Carlson,CHURCH GROUNDS,"Well, there's probably a lot of gods."
77176,301,234,1064000,Lenny Leonard,CHURCH GROUNDS,"Yeah, and some of 'em's gotta be chicks."
77177,301,235,1066000,Carl Carlson,CHURCH GROUNDS,"Yeah, with like a thousand boobs."

77181,301,239,1088000,Marge Simpson,CHURCH GROUNDS,"Homer aren't you afraid you might be, I don't know, incurring God's wrath?"
77182,301,240,1094000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH GROUNDS,"Eh, God's cool."
77183,301,241,1095000,Marge Simpson,CHURCH GROUNDS,"See, I don't know that He is. In the bible he's always smiting and turning people into salt."
77184,301,242,1101000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH GROUNDS,"Oh look, God's giving us a little shower."
77185,301,243,1106000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH GROUNDS,"Everybody, look at the much-needed rain. Thank you, God. Now turn the rainwater into wine."
77189,301,247,1122000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Okay boys, this is it. The end of this sinful little suburb."
77190,301,248,1127000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,Yay!
77191,301,249,1128000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,Let every evil lung fill!
77193,301,251,1135000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Garage,"Okay, I've got two of every animal. But only males -- I don't want any hanky-panky. Hey, hey, hey, cut that out!"
77195,301,253,1146000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH ROOF,"Oh, wet and wonderful God, your flood has driven us to the roof of your church. Surely this has proven whatever point you had."
77196,301,254,1157000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH ROOF,God's ignoring me.
77197,301,255,1159000,Bart Simpson,CHURCH ROOF,"Dad, maybe you should stop praying. See if that makes It happy."
77198,301,256,1163000,Sideshow Mel,CHURCH ROOF,This heretic has doomed us all!
77199,301,257,1166000,Moe Szyslak,CHURCH ROOF,"Yeah, I say we skin him alive and set him on fire."
77200,301,258,1170000,Carl Carlson,CHURCH ROOF,"Yeah, that'll appease God."
77201,301,259,1171000,Moe Szyslak,CHURCH ROOF,Appease who now?
77202,301,260,1174000,Booming Voice,CHURCH ROOF,Leave that man alone!
77203,301,261,1179000,Marge Simpson,CHURCH ROOF,It's Reverend Lovejoy!
77205,301,263,1182000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,CHURCH ROOF,Let us pray.
77206,301,264,1184000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,CHURCH ROOF,"Dear Lord, please spare this sinful town. They were misled by a demon in blue pants."
77207,301,265,1200000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH ROOF,I guess I learned something here. God is capable of great anger and great mercy. But mostly great anger.
77208,301,266,1207000,Lisa Simpson,CHURCH ROOF,"There are perfectly logical explanations for everything that happened. The bonfire sent soot into the air which created rain. And with all the trees cut down, a flood was inevitable."
77209,301,267,1217000,Bart Simpson,CHURCH ROOF,"Yeah, but what made the rain stop?"
77210,301,268,1219000,Lisa Simpson,CHURCH ROOF,I'unno. Buddha?
77212,301,270,1223000,Buddha,HEAVEN,"Hey, they've suffered enough."
77213,301,271,1225000,God,HEAVEN,"Keep that popcorn chicken coming, Colonel."
77214,301,272,1229000,God,HEAVEN,Mmmm. Mmmm. Not bad. Think it's about time you told me what's in those spices.
