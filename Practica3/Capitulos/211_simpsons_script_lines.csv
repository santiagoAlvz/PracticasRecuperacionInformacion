49689,211,3,91000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"And the tumbleweeds tumble at 2, 4 and 6! Plus a midnight tumbling on weekends."
49690,211,4,95000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"It's so sweet of you to take us out like this, Homie. Come on, kids, three cheers for your father! Hip hip--"
49691,211,5,102000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Mom, don't."
49692,211,6,103000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Hip hip--
49693,211,7,104000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,We heard you the first time.
49694,211,8,105000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Hip hip--
49695,211,9,106000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Hey, I'm trying to drive here!"
49696,211,10,108000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Hey, Dad, that light says, ""Check Engine."""
49697,211,11,108000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Uh-oh. Tape must have fallen off.

49703,211,19,131000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Come on, come on, come on. Start, damn you. Start!"
49704,211,20,135000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Car,Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me...
49708,211,24,147000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Two hours? Why'd they build this ghost town so far away?
49709,211,25,152000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,Because they discovered gold right over there--
49710,211,26,154000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"It's because they're stupid, that's why. That's why everybody does everything."
49713,211,29,167000,Marge Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,This should be very educational. I want you kids to pay attention.
49714,211,30,172000,Tour Guide,Bloodbath Gulch,"Founded by prostitutes in 1849, and serviced by prostitute express riders who could bring in a fresh prostitute from St. Joe in three days, Bloodbath Gulch quickly became known as a place where a trail hand could spend a month's pay in three minutes."
49715,211,31,189000,Homer Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,Three minutes?
49716,211,32,191000,Marge Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,I never realized history was so filthy.
49717,211,33,194000,Tour Guide,Bloodbath Gulch,"First on our tour is the whorehouse. Then we'll visit the cat house, the brothel, the bordello, and finally, the old mission."
49718,211,34,202000,Marge Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,"Oh, thank heaven."
49719,211,35,204000,Tour Guide,Bloodbath Gulch,Lots of prostitutes in there.
49721,211,37,211000,Tour Guide,Bloodbath Gulch,"But there was more to the old west than just sex, folks. A-A lot more. If you look off to your left, you'll see a real old west hitching post, possibly used by bandits, possibly during some exciting adventure."
49723,211,39,226000,Tour Guide,Bloodbath Gulch,And these planks below us were often used as a sidewalk by people who may or may not have been bandits.
49725,211,41,237000,Marge Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,That's a keeper!
49726,211,42,239000,Tour Guide,Bloodbath Gulch,"Uh, yes, sir?"
49727,211,43,240000,Homer Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,Do we have to listen to you?
49728,211,44,241000,Tour Guide,Bloodbath Gulch,"Oh, well... no, you don't... but if you have any interest in history..."
49729,211,45,245000,Homer Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,I'm done.
49730,211,46,252000,Bart Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,Wow! Have you ever seen so many robot cowboys?
49731,211,47,260000,Homer Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,"Hey robot, get your fat, metal ass down here!"
49732,211,48,265000,Bartender,Bloodbath Gulch,"First of all, I'm not a robot. And second, I got this metal ass in 'Nam, defending this country for lazy jerks like you. Now, what'll you have, partner?"
49733,211,49,275000,Homer Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,"Let's see. One, two, three... six whiskeys!"
49734,211,50,278000,Bart Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,All right!
49735,211,51,279000,Bartender,Bloodbath Gulch,"We only serve sarsparilla, Mac. No alcohol."
49737,211,53,282000,Marge Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,You can get drunk when we get home.
49738,211,54,282000,Homer Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,Duh.
49739,211,55,285000,Robot Cowboy #1,Bloodbath Gulch,"Hey, these cards are marked."
49740,211,56,289000,Robot Cowboy #2,Bloodbath Gulch,Now look what you've done.
49741,211,57,291000,Robot Cowboy #1,Bloodbath Gulch,I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me.
49742,211,58,295000,Robot Cowboy #3,Bloodbath Gulch,Let's forget this whole thing happened.
49743,211,59,297000,Homer Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,"What the heck is this, a tea party? Somebody kill somebody!"
49744,211,60,306000,Marge Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,What is it with you and robots?
49745,211,61,321000,Grampa Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,"Ooh, hello, sweet cheeks."
49746,211,62,327000,Marge Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,Look who's a little cowgirl!
49747,211,63,330000,Bart Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,"Hey, Mom, look what I got."
49748,211,64,332000,Marge Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,"Oh, that's cute. Did you get it in the souvenir shop?"
49749,211,65,336000,Bart Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,"No, that security guard is handing them out."
49750,211,66,351000,Tour Guide,Bloodbath Gulch,"Uh-oh, better run for cover, pardners. Some varmints are havin' a shootout!"
49751,211,67,356000,Cowboys,Bloodbath Gulch,"You stole my prostitute! / Missed me! / C'mon, yellow belly!"
49752,211,68,373000,Curly,Bloodbath Gulch,Which way's the gunfight?
49753,211,69,378000,Tour Guide,Bloodbath Gulch,"There's Old Curly. He played the town preacher until we laid him off, but he still hangs around."
49754,211,70,385000,Old Curly,Bloodbath Gulch,"Help me, please. I'm sick."
49756,211,72,389000,Marge Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,Homer!
49757,211,73,390000,Homer Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,"But it's funny, Marge. The guy's sick."
49758,211,74,398000,Lisa Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,"Uh, should we help him?"
49759,211,75,399000,Bart Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,He knows what he's doing.
49760,211,76,406000,Grampa Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,Can't get a good sarsaparilla like this back in Springfield. It angries up the blood.
49761,211,77,412000,Bartender,Bloodbath Gulch,"You like it, huh?"
49762,211,78,413000,Grampa Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,Up yours!
49763,211,79,418000,Grampa Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,Can I go to the bathroom before we leave?
49764,211,80,421000,Homer Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,"Oh, we've gotta get home. I don't wanna miss, ""Inside the Actor's Studio."" Tonight it's F. Murray Abraham."
49765,211,81,428000,Grampa Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,But I really need to--
49766,211,82,429000,Homer Simpson,Bloodbath Gulch,F. Murray Abraham.
49768,211,84,437000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Car,There's a rest area. Pull over.
49769,211,85,439000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Can't stop now. We're making great time.
49770,211,86,443000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Car,Can I go behind a tree?
49771,211,87,446000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"What are you, an animal?"
49773,211,89,447000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,"Whoever keeps saying ""please stop"" back there, better quit it."
49776,211,92,452000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Wow, get a load of that toilet."
49777,211,93,455000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Car,Please go back! You can make it my birthday present.
49778,211,94,459000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"We're almost home, Dad. Only a couple more times over the horizon."
49779,211,95,463000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Car,But I might explode.
49780,211,96,465000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,You just sit back and relax. I'm not gonna let anything happen to my old dad.
49782,211,98,471000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Oh dear God!
49783,211,99,473000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,This man's kidneys have exploded. There's nothing left.
49784,211,100,476000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Oh, no!"
49785,211,101,478000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Yep, that's what happens when you get older. It's one of those natural things. Beautiful in its way."
49786,211,102,483000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Uh, actually, his kidneys were fine yesterday when he had his annual checkup."
49787,211,103,487000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Excuse me, doctor. I think I know a little something about medicine..."
49788,211,104,491000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Homer, with all due respect, this x-ray reveals a textbook kidney blow-out -- which would explain those loud pops you heard."
49789,211,105,499000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,So... you're saying I don't need a new muffler?
49790,211,106,502000,Grampa Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,I don't feel so good. Maybe I oughta eat something.
49791,211,107,506000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Oh, I'm afraid your eating days are over."
49793,211,109,519000,Grampa Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"How long do I have to live, Doc?"
49794,211,110,522000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,I'm amazed you're alive now.
49795,211,111,524000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Oh, I blame myself for this."
49253,211,112,527000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,We all blame you.
49796,211,113,529000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"C'mon, Doc. There's gotta be something I can do to help my dad."
49797,211,114,533000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Well, you could give him a kidney."
49798,211,115,534000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"A kidney? Okay, fine."
49799,211,116,537000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"You see, the waiting list for a kidney is very long and..."
49800,211,117,541000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"I said ""fine."" What is it about the word ""sure"" you don't understand?"
49801,211,118,545000,Grampa Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Oh, thank you, son."
49802,211,119,548000,Grampa Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Hmm, I'll take the left one -- it's good and springy. Though the right one's not without its charm."
49804,211,121,558000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Pork chops, sloppy joes, hot dogs, and pork chops?"
49805,211,122,562000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Doctor Hibbert said you have to build up your strength."
49806,211,123,565000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Besides, nothing's too good for a wonderful, generous man like you."
49807,211,124,569000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well now that's what I always thought, but somehow..."
49808,211,125,571000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Check it out, Dad. I rented all your favorite gorilla movies. ""Gorilla Squadron,"" ""Gorilla Island VI,""..."
49809,211,126,577000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Apes-A-Poppin'!"" Oooh, the airline version!"
49810,211,127,581000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Can I fluff your pillow?
49811,211,128,582000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Nothing's too good for me.
49812,211,129,584000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ahhh. I'm the luckiest man in the world, now that Lou Gehrig's dead."
49814,211,131,592000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I gotta hand it to you, Homer. You're really brave to go through with this operation."
49815,211,132,596000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"It's not an operation, Moe. The doctor says it's just a procedure."
49816,211,133,600000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Nah, nah, no. Makin' polenta, that's a procedure. You're talkin' about deadly, life-threatening surgery, here."
49817,211,134,605000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Really? You think it's dangerous?
49818,211,135,608000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, yeah. And, and even if you survive the operation --"
49819,211,136,611000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Procedure. Deadly procedure.
49820,211,137,614000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Whatever. The point is, with only one kidney, you won't be able to drink yourself stupid no more."
49821,211,138,619000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Now you're just tryin' to scare me.
49822,211,139,620000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Plus they'll put you on one of those organ donor sucker lists. Everybody who wants an eyeball or a spine or a vestigial tail will be after you.
49823,211,140,628000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,But I don't want that.
49824,211,141,630000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Listen, I'm just gonna get right to the point, here. Can I have your buttocks? I mean, if you die. They look pretty comfortable."
49825,211,142,636000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, I guess."
49826,211,143,638000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"And, uh, are those your original lips?"
49827,211,144,640000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, actually I-- Hey! Quit harvesting me with your eyes!"
49828,211,145,645000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh yeah, that would look so good on me."
49830,211,147,649000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I've been thinking. What if, instead of donating one of my old, worn-out kidneys, I gave Grampa that artificial kidney I invented?"
49831,211,148,657000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer, that was just a beer can with a whistle glued to it."
49832,211,149,660000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But I don't want them cutting up my soft, supple body. Why didn't somebody tell me what I was volunteering for? This is everybody's fault but mine."
49833,211,150,670000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I know you're scared, Homie. But remember why you're doing this. It's for your father. The man who raised you and nurtured you."
49834,211,151,680000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Jack and Jill went up the hill aaaand... Jill came tumbling after. The end. Good night.
49835,211,152,686000,3-Year-Old Homer,Simpson Home,"Is that the same Jack from ""Jack and the Beanstalk""?"
49836,211,153,689000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, son, I believe it is."
49837,211,154,691000,3-Year-Old Homer,Simpson Home,"And Jack Sprat? Is that him, too?"
49838,211,155,694000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure, why not... good night."
49839,211,156,695000,3-Year-Old Homer,Simpson Home,Is he the same as Jack be nimble? And Jack Frost? And little Jack Horner?
49840,211,157,700000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Say, how 'bout a little NyQuil?"
49841,211,158,704000,3-Year-Old Homer,Simpson Home,All gone!
49842,211,159,706000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I love you, son."
49843,211,160,709000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I owe Dad so much. Those bedtime stories began my lifelong love affair with the printed word.
49844,211,161,717000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, giving him a kidney is a wonderful way to show him how you feel."
49845,211,162,721000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're right, Marge. I'll do it. But if I die during the operation, will you do one thing for me?"
49846,211,163,727000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ohh, anything, sweetheart."
49847,211,164,730000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Blow up the hospital.
49848,211,165,731000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well... I said I'd do it, so I guess I'll have to."
49849,211,166,737000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's my girl.
49852,211,169,744000,Voice,Hospital,Dr. Martins to podiatry.
49853,211,170,745000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,Liability waiver?
49854,211,171,747000,Admitting Nurse,Hospital,Don't read it. Just sign it.
49855,211,172,749000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,"Yeah, but all these skulls and crossbones on here... I don't usually sign stuff like that."
49856,211,173,753000,Admitting Nurse,Hospital,It simply says you won't hold us responsible if you die as a result of gross negligence. It's a standard form.
49857,211,174,761000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,Oh.
49858,211,175,766000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital,"I love you, son."
49859,211,176,767000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,"I love you, Dad."
49860,211,177,773000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Now, don't you fellas worry. This'll all be over soon. And..."
49861,211,178,777000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,What the...?!
49862,211,179,780000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,We gotta get rid of that window.
49863,211,180,782000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital,Where'd he go?
49867,211,184,793000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,I can't imagine Dad running away like this. Leaving his father to die.
49868,211,185,797000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,Even I wouldn't do that. And I'm America's Bad Boy.
49869,211,186,799000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,It's a heartbreaking situation.
49870,211,187,804000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital,Am I dead yet?
49871,211,188,806000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,No.
49872,211,189,807000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital,How 'bout now?
49873,211,190,808000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,No.
49874,211,191,808000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital,Now?
49875,211,192,810000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,"I'll tell you when you're dead, Grampa."
49876,211,193,812000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital,Thank you.
49878,211,195,830000,Homer Simpson,Waterfront,I'm not worthy to live among civilized people.
49879,211,196,837000,Homer Simpson,Waterfront,Even those guys look too civilized for me.
49880,211,197,844000,Homer Simpson,Waterfront,I could live at sea! The sea forgives all. Not like those mean old mountains. I hate them so much.
49881,211,198,855000,Homer Simpson,Waterfront,Hmmm... the sea won't stand for this.
49883,211,200,861000,Homer Simpson,Clothing Store,"Uh, excuse me, I'm fleeing in shame and I'd like to look my best."
49885,211,202,869000,Homer Simpson,Ship,"Um, can I be a mate on your ship? Preferably First Mate."
49886,211,203,873000,Taffy Shop Clerk,Ship,"Well, if you look closely, you'll see this is a taffy shop shaped like a ship."
49887,211,204,878000,Homer Simpson,Ship,"Oh, I like taffy, but I don't deserve taffy."
49889,211,206,884000,Krusty the Clown,Hospital Room,"Hey, hey!"
49891,211,208,887000,Krusty the Clown,Hospital Room,"Krusty here to cheer you up as part of the hospital's ""Last Laugh Program."""
49892,211,209,893000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital Room,Last laugh?
49893,211,210,894000,Krusty the Clown,Hospital Room,"So, how 'bout that hospital food? Uh?"
49894,211,211,898000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital Room,I wouldn't know. I'm not allowed to eat.
49895,211,212,901000,Krusty the Clown,Hospital Room,"Okayyyy... well, let's have a look at the old chart. Uh-- Ho ho, boy. Looks like we're both short on time so I'll go to the big finish. ""You are so beautiful to... meee!"""
49896,211,213,919000,Krusty the Clown,Hospital Room,Feel better!
49897,211,214,920000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital Room,"Come back, doctor."
49899,211,216,927000,Homer Simpson,Waterfront,A tramp steamer! That's perfect!
49901,211,218,935000,Homer Simpson,TRAMP STEAMER,"Oh, I'd like to apply for a job. Any job. If you don't have a captain, I could be that."
49902,211,219,940000,Captain Horatio McCallister,TRAMP STEAMER,"Arr, what other ships have ye been on?"
49903,211,220,943000,Homer Simpson,TRAMP STEAMER,I've been on that one. The taffy shop.
49904,211,221,946000,Captain Horatio McCallister,TRAMP STEAMER,Good enough.
49905,211,222,951000,Captain Horatio McCallister,TRAMP STEAMER,"Welcome aboard ""The Ship Of Lost Souls""."
49906,211,223,957000,Homer Simpson,TRAMP STEAMER,"The name on the back says ""Honeybunch."""
49907,211,224,958000,Captain Horatio McCallister,TRAMP STEAMER,"Arr, I've been meaning to paint over that. Now come and meet the rest of the damned. Did I mention they're lost souls?"
49908,211,225,968000,Homer Simpson,TRAMP STEAMER,"Well, actually, you did..."
49909,211,226,969000,Captain Horatio McCallister,TRAMP STEAMER,Arr.
49910,211,227,977000,Sad-looking Frenchman,TRAMP STEAMER,"Ahh, another lost soul has joined our world-weary ensemble."
49911,211,228,983000,Homer Simpson,TRAMP STEAMER,"Say, who are you guys?"
49912,211,229,987000,Man In Dinner Jacket,TRAMP STEAMER,Who are we? No one. Where are we sailing? Nowhere. Do we even exist? Who knows?
49913,211,230,994000,Homer Simpson,TRAMP STEAMER,"H-Heyy, let me off this thing."
49914,211,231,996000,British Raj Man,TRAMP STEAMER,"Oh, don't listen to him. We exist all right."
49915,211,232,999000,Homer Simpson,TRAMP STEAMER,Whew.
49916,211,233,1000000,Woman In Wedding Dress,TRAMP STEAMER,"We wander the seven seas, trying to forget."
49917,211,234,1004000,Homer Simpson,TRAMP STEAMER,Forget what?
49918,211,235,1005000,British Raj Man,TRAMP STEAMER,"Oh boy, here we go."
49919,211,236,1007000,Woman In Wedding Dress,TRAMP STEAMER,"My story of jilted love is long and bittersweet. If anyone has to go to the bathroom, go now. I don't want you walking around during my story."
49920,211,237,1015000,British Raj Man,TRAMP STEAMER,My story's better. It has tigers.
49921,211,238,1018000,Woman In Wedding Dress,TRAMP STEAMER,"I was born into wretched poverty. So one day I stole a loaf of bread, put it in the freezer until it was very hard, then robbed a bank with it."
49922,211,239,1031000,Man In Dinner Jacket,TRAMP STEAMER,"... And when Mr. Dinkley saw what I had done, I was banned from the car wash forever."
49923,211,240,1038000,Woman In Wedding Dress,TRAMP STEAMER,Forever? How awful.
49924,211,241,1040000,Sad-looking Frenchman,TRAMP STEAMER,I would have killed Dinkley for that.
49925,211,242,1042000,British Raj Man,TRAMP STEAMER,"As you can see, we're a contemptible lot of cads, bounders, and tiger stabbers."
49926,211,243,1047000,Sad-looking Frenchman,TRAMP STEAMER,"Come, stranger, join our circle of infamy. Tell us your story of en-nui."
49927,211,244,1054000,Homer Simpson,TRAMP STEAMER,"Well, back on land, my name was Homer Simpson. And I guess it is here, too. I promised my Dad one of my kidneys, but I chickened out at the last minute and left him on his deathbed."
49928,211,245,1066000,Caribbean Outcast,TRAMP STEAMER,Good Lord!
49929,211,246,1068000,Woman In Wedding Dress,TRAMP STEAMER,"Oh, how could you?"
49930,211,247,1069000,British Raj Man,TRAMP STEAMER,I think I'm going to be sick.
49931,211,248,1070000,Sad-looking Frenchman,TRAMP STEAMER,"I stole this accordion from a blind monkey, but you... you disgust even me."
49932,211,249,1077000,Homer Simpson,TRAMP STEAMER,"Well, yeah, I know..."
49934,211,251,1087000,Homer Simpson,TRAMP STEAMER,That's the last time I trust the strangest people on earth.
49936,211,253,1098000,Homer Simpson,Waterfront,Even the sea won't forgive me.
49937,211,254,1100000,Son,Waterfront,"That's the best sandcastle we've ever built, Dad."
49938,211,255,1103000,Father,Waterfront,"We make a great team, son."
49939,211,256,1106000,Homer Simpson,Waterfront,"Oh, I wish I had that kind of relationship with my father... or my kids. Well, I guess it's up to me to take the first step."
49940,211,257,1122000,Father,Waterfront,Hey!
49942,211,259,1124000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"All right, this is it. No more living in shame. I'm going to show my family the kind of man I really am."
49943,211,260,1135000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"All right, I'm gonna..."
49944,211,261,1146000,Marge Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Aren't you going to give him the last rites?
49946,211,262,1149000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield General Hospital,"That's Catholic, Marge. You might as well ask me to do a voodoo dance."
49947,211,263,1154000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Doctor Hibbert, I thought you'd located another kidney for Grampa."
49948,211,264,1157000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Larry Hagman took it. He's got five of them now. And three hearts. We didn't want to give them to him, but he overpowered us."
49949,211,265,1164000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Don't worry about old Grampa. I'm goin' to a better place. Shelbyville Hospital!
49950,211,266,1172000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Oh, who'm I kiddin'? I'm a goner."
49951,211,267,1176000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"No you're not, Dad."
49952,211,268,1178000,Marge Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Homer!
49953,211,269,1178000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Dad!
49954,211,270,1179000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Son!
49956,211,272,1181000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,"I'm sorry, Dad. The way I behaved was shameful. I guess fear made me run away. But love made me come back."
49957,211,273,1189000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital,"Bless you, son. I knew you'd come through for me."
49958,211,274,1195000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Now, Homer, this may sting just a tiny bit, b--"
49959,211,275,1202000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital,"Aw, son of a--!"

49967,211,283,1222000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,"Oh, Homie. I'm so glad you're all right."
49969,211,285,1227000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,"Try not to move, Dad. You swallowed a lot of motor oil."
49970,211,286,1231000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,"I'm sorry I ran off again. Oh, I guess Dad must be dead by now. When I get better, and after I've built those shelves for the kitchen, we'll visit his grave..."
49971,211,287,1243000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital,Grave nothin'!
49972,211,288,1244000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital,I never felt more alive!
49973,211,289,1248000,Grampa Simpson,Hospital,"Oh! Boy, I shouldn'ta done that."
49974,211,290,1251000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,It's a miracle! You recovered!
49975,211,291,1258000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,What? What? Hey!
49976,211,292,1263000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"While we were setting your broken bones and putting your blood back in, we helped ourselves to a kidney and gave it to your father."
49977,211,293,1270000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,You butchers! Give it back! Gimme that! Gim--
49979,211,295,1277000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,"Don't you dance out that door you... I'll get my kidney back, old man! You have to sleep sometime!"
49980,211,296,1283000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,"I know you're a little peeved at Grampa, Dad, but you've done a wonderful thing."
49981,211,297,1288000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,"Yes. You've shortened your life significantly, so someone else can have a slight extension of theirs."
49982,211,298,1294000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,"Yeah, I guess you're right. Gimme a hug."
49983,211,299,1299000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,I don't need two kidneys. I have everything I need right here...
49984,211,300,1305000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,Hmmm...
49985,211,301,1306000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,"Dad, you're tickling me."
49986,211,302,1308000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,"Yesss, tickling."
