51279,216,9,97000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"It's ""America's Funniest Tornadoes."""
51281,216,11,103000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"And at 9:30, ""All In The Family 1999."""
51282,216,12,107000,Archie Bunker,Simpson Home,"Aw geez, there they got me living with an African-American, a Semite-American and a Woman-American, there. And I'm glad. I love youse all. I love everybody. I wish I'd saved my money from the first show."
51283,216,13,120000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I can't wait. Look, Marge, I had a scorecard printed up at that all-night scorecard place."
51284,216,14,126000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Isn't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows that weren't good enough for the fall schedule?
51285,216,15,131000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're thinking of all the other years. This year's shows are classics.
51286,216,16,135000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"There's ""The Laughter Family."" That's animated. Networks like animation 'cause they don't have to pay the actors squat."
51287,216,17,141000,Bad Flanders,Simpson Home,Plus they can replace 'em and no one can tell the diddily-ifference.
51288,216,18,144000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"And now... mid-season kicks off with ""Admiral Baby."""
51289,216,19,150000,Lieutenant,Simpson Home,We're taking the entire Sixth Fleet to Candy Island?
51290,216,20,154000,Commander,Simpson Home,Those are the admiral's orders.
51291,216,21,159000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's hard to believe someone that young could have risen to the rank of Admiral.
51292,216,22,165000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Gee... I never thought I'd say this about a TV show, but this is kinda stupid. Hey, ""PoliceCops."" That sounds like a lethal combination."
51293,216,23,182000,Bank Robber #1,Simpson Home,Let's get this bank back to our hideout and we'll break into it later.
51294,216,24,186000,Bank Robber #2,Simpson Home,It's the cops!
51295,216,25,187000,Bank Robber #1,Simpson Home,Worse. The PoliceCops.
51296,216,26,200000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,This isn't bad.
51297,216,27,200000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Isn't bad? Tell me one thing mankind's ever done that's any better.
51298,216,28,206000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The Renaissance.
51299,216,29,207000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This is better.
51300,216,30,208000,POLICECOP #2,Simpson Home,Let's book 'em and roll.
51301,216,31,210000,POLICECOP #1,Simpson Home,And that's the enda that chapter.
51302,216,32,212000,Banker,Simpson Home,You men saved my bank. I'd like to donate forty dollars to charity in your honor.
51303,216,33,215000,Banker,Simpson Home,"But, uh, I don't know your names."
51304,216,34,221000,POLICECOP #2,Simpson Home,Lance Coffman.
51305,216,35,222000,POLICECOP #1,Simpson Home,Simpson. Detective Homer Simpson.
51307,216,36,228000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,He's named like my name!
51308,216,37,234000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"I don't get it, Homer. You're a millionaire and you've got all the babes you want. Why aren't you living it up in your palace in Europe?"
51309,216,38,241000,DETECTIVE HOMER SIMPSON,Simpson Home,"Well, let's just say I hate crime."
51310,216,39,249000,DETECTIVE HOMER SIMPSON,Simpson Home,Arrest that guy. And that's the end of that chapter...
51311,216,40,257000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wow. They've captured my personality perfectly. Did you see the way Daddy caught that bullet?
51312,216,41,263000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's not really you, Dad. He's just a fictional character who happens to have the same name."
51313,216,42,269000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't confuse Daddy, Lisa."
51314,216,43,271000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, it's just a coincidence, like that guy named Anthony Michael Hall who stole your car stereo."
51315,216,44,276000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Right. Coincidence.
51316,216,45,282000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Another person wants to congratulate you for having a famous name.
51317,216,46,286000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Y'ello... yes, this is the original Homer Simpson. Who's this?... The Debbie Pinson who was the homecoming queen at high school?... Yes, I'm still available."
51318,216,47,298000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No he's not.
51319,216,48,300000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, that was Debbie Pinson. DEB-BIE PIN-SON."
51320,216,49,305000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No dating.
51323,216,52,310000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hey Homer! Homer! Check it out. Bottom of page twelve.
51324,216,53,313000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Local Man Has Same Name. A TV character has the same name as Springfield resident Homer Simpson.
51325,216,54,315000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, you're famous."
51326,216,55,322000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,And that's the end of that chapter.
51328,216,57,326000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, Mr. Simpson, sir, can I get your autograph?"
51329,216,58,329000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,All right. And what's the name?
51330,216,59,331000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, Homer, we've worked together for ten years. It's Carl."
51331,216,60,334000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You only wrote my name. Um, I wanted yours."
51332,216,61,340000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Take it or leave it... Carl.
51334,216,63,345000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"So, uh, what kind of adventure you gonna be involved in tonight, Homer?"
51336,216,64,348000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Mmm, who knows? Maybe I'll have to foil an assassination, or stop a peace conference."
51337,216,65,353000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"So they really based that Homer Simpson character on you, huh?"
51338,216,66,356000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Yup. Right down to the scarf.
51339,216,67,360000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ooh, there it is!"
51340,216,68,366000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,"Nice beating, Lance. Especially around the eyes. Say, where's your partner? Where's Homer Simpson?"
51341,216,69,372000,DETECTIVE HOMER SIMPSON,Moe's Tavern,"Coming, Chief."
51342,216,70,376000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,"Now what have you done, Simpson?"
51343,216,71,378000,DETECTIVE HOMER SIMPSON,Moe's Tavern,I was supervising the guns for toys program.
51344,216,72,382000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,It's toys for guns.
51345,216,73,384000,DETECTIVE HOMER SIMPSON,Moe's Tavern,Now you tell me!
51346,216,74,386000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,Simp-sonnnn!!
51347,216,75,392000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, what's going on? That guy's not Homer Simpson. He's fat and stupid."
51348,216,76,397000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, looks like they changed the character into a bumbling sidekick."
51349,216,77,401000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"No, no, he can't be. I know, maybe he's just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots. Yeah, that's gotta be it."
51350,216,78,409000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,You destroyed that drug shipment?
51351,216,79,412000,DETECTIVE HOMER SIMPSON,Moe's Tavern,Yes indeedy.
51352,216,80,414000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,That was my insulin!
51353,216,81,415000,DETECTIVE HOMER SIMPSON,Moe's Tavern,"Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's!"
51354,216,82,420000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,Simp-sonnnn!!
51355,216,83,422000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Hey Homer, that character is you all over."
51356,216,84,425000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Come on, Homer, act all stupid. Like you do on TV."
51357,216,85,428000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, come on, dum-dum, do something unintelligent, there."
51358,216,86,432000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Shutup! I'm not your clown! Don't diminish me!
51359,216,87,437000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Gentlemen, I bid you--"
51360,216,88,437000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa!
51362,216,90,450000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Geez, what an exit."
51363,216,91,452000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh man, what's he gonna do for an encore?"
51364,216,92,456000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ooh. I don't think he'll be, doin' no encores for a while."
51366,216,94,465000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't understand what happened. Why did they change Homer Simpson's character from cool to stupid?
51368,216,95,471000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"The first episode was just a pilot, Dad. Producers fiddle with shows all the time. They change characters, drop others, and push some into the background."
51369,216,96,479000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Your character provides the comic relief. Like... Ohhh... Marlon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now."""
51370,216,97,487000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I wish I hadn't bought a hundred of these.
51372,216,99,491000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Get ready, everybody."
51373,216,100,494000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,He's about to do something stupid.
51374,216,101,497000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, but you seem to have me confused with a character in a fictional show. Now if you'll excuse me, my fondue is just about..."
51376,216,103,509000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,There goes Albany!
51377,216,104,511000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's!"
51378,216,105,515000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, man."
51380,216,107,518000,Otto Mann,Springfield Mall,"Hey, it's that Homer Simpson dude."
51381,216,108,520000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Mall,Haw haw.
51382,216,109,521000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"People are laughing at me, Marge. Let's get outta here. Forget the baby's medicine."
51383,216,110,526000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,But her forehead's on fire.
51384,216,111,527000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Fine. I'll be in the car, driving home."
51385,216,112,531000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,"Well, if it isn't that stupid cop from TV."
51386,216,113,535000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Mall,"Ahh, yeah."
51387,216,114,538000,Crowd,Springfield Mall,That's Homer Simpson. / His name's on TV. / Let's crowd him.
51388,216,115,542000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield Mall,Your catch phrase is hysterical. Please say it clearly for my answering machine tape.
51389,216,116,547000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's."
51390,216,117,550000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield Mall,Worst reading ever.
51391,216,118,552000,Townspeople,Springfield Mall,"How 'bout an autograph? / Picture, Mister?"
51393,216,120,555000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"C'mon, people. Enough is enough."
51394,216,121,557000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Mall,"Oh, it's never enough, not for them. Once they get a taste of you, they want more and more and more. That reminds me, do you mind if my nephew kicks you in the belly?"
51395,216,122,566000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,Okay.
51397,216,124,570000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Mall,"Aw, the flash didn't go off. Ya got another one in you, Josh?"
51398,216,126,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The whole town's laughin' at me. Even that cat out there. Bart, kill that cat!"
51399,216,127,586000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay.
51400,216,128,587000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And that big yellow flower.
51401,216,129,588000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, your growing insanity is starting to worry me. Why don't you talk to the producers of the show? Maybe they'll make your character suave again."
51402,216,130,598000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmmmm, I guess I could... But while I'm gone, keep an eye on that weird-looking kid down there."
51403,216,131,606000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart?
51404,216,132,607000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah. ""Bart."""
51406,216,134,607000,Homer Simpson,Tv Production Company,"Uh, so, I just want to know how come you made your Homer Simpson character so..."
51407,216,135,621000,Producer,Tv Production Company,"Stupid? Well, I can assure you, it happened organically."
51408,216,136,624000,Homer Simpson,Tv Production Company,It better have.
51409,216,137,626000,Producer,Tv Production Company,"The thirteen of us began with a singular vision: ""Titanic"" meets ""Frasier."""
51410,216,138,630000,2nd Producer,Tv Production Company,But then we found out that ABC had a similar project in development with Annie Potts and Jeremy Piven.
51411,216,139,635000,Homer Simpson,Tv Production Company,Who's Jeremy Piven?
51412,216,140,636000,3rd Producer,Tv Production Company,We don't know.
51413,216,141,637000,4th Producer,Tv Production Company,But it scared the hell out of us. So we slapped together a cop show instead.
51414,216,142,641000,Homer Simpson,Tv Production Company,PoliceCops.
51415,216,143,642000,5th Producer,Tv Production Company,"Uh, no, actually, it was called ""Badge Patrol."""
51416,216,144,645000,Producer,Tv Production Company,But the network idiots didn't want a show about high-tech badges that shoot laser beams.
51417,216,145,649000,2nd Producer,Tv Production Company,"So we asked ourselves, who's behind the badge?"
51418,216,146,649000,3rd Producer,Tv Production Company,Police.
51419,216,147,649000,4th Producer,Tv Production Company,Cops.
51420,216,148,654000,5th Producer,Tv Production Company,PoliceCops.
51421,216,149,656000,Homer Simpson,Tv Production Company,"Yeah, but why does the Homer Simpson character have to be so stupid?"
51422,216,150,659000,Producer,Tv Production Company,"Oh, he's not stupid. He's a street-smart, fish-out-of-water in a world he never made."
51423,216,151,664000,Homer Simpson,Tv Production Company,I'm begging you. I'm a human being. Let me have my dignity back.
51426,216,154,674000,DETECTIVE HOMER SIMPSON,Simpson Home,"Let me down, Chief. I'm begging you. I'm a human being. Let me have my dignity back."
51427,216,155,683000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Now he's stupid and whiny.
51367,216,156,685000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That does it! There's only one thing I can do.
51430,216,159,689000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Your honor, I'd like to sue the producers of ""PoliceCops"" for twenty million dollars for improper use of my name."
51431,216,160,696000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Court finds in favor of ""PoliceCops."" Next case."
51432,216,161,702000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Then I'd like to legally change my name.
51433,216,162,704000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,What name would you prefer?
51434,216,163,706000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Any of these will be fine.
51435,216,164,707000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Hmm. ""Hercules Rockefeller,"" ""Rembrandt Q. Einstein,"" ""Handsome B. Wonderful."" I'm going to give you the only name you spelled correctly. From this day forward your name shall be..."
51437,216,166,720000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Max Power??
51438,216,167,720000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dynamic, isn't it?"
51439,216,168,724000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I love it, Max."
51440,216,169,725000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You changed your name without consulting me?
51441,216,170,728000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's the way Max Power is, Marge. Decisive, uncompromising, and rude."
51442,216,171,734000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, wait a minute. The family name is my legacy to you. I got it from my father, and he got it from his father. And he traded a mule for it. And that mule went on to save Spring Break..."
51443,216,172,749000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But this will be so confusing. The mailman won't know what to do. Did you think of the mailman at all before you did this?
51444,216,173,757000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, briefly."
51445,216,174,759000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And what about the tattoo on my you-know-what?
51446,216,175,761000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh honey, they have acids that can burn that off."
51447,216,176,765000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"But I fell in love with Homer Simpson. I don't want to snuggle with ""Max Power."""
51448,216,177,772000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Nobody snuggles with Max Power. You strap yourself in and feel the G's.
51449,216,178,776000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Lord."
51450,216,179,777000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And it doesn't stop in the bedroom. Oh no, I'm taking charge. Kids, there's three ways to do things -- the right way, the wrong way, and the Max Power way."
51451,216,180,787000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Isn't that the wrong way?
51452,216,181,788000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but faster."
51454,216,183,792000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We should really put that in the corner.
51457,216,185,798000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"MAX POWER / HE'S THE MAN / WHOSE NAME YOU'D LOVE TO TOUCH / BUT YOU MUSTN'T TOUCH / HIS NAME SOUNDS GOOD IN YOUR EAR / BUT WHEN YOU SAY IT, YOU MUSTN'T FEAR / 'CAUSE HIS NAME CAN BE SAID BY ANYONE..."
51458,216,186,823000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Ah! Max Power! How's every little thing?
51459,216,187,826000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You remembered my name!
51460,216,188,828000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, who could forget the name of a magnetic individual like you? Keep up the good work, Max."
51461,216,189,833000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Mr. Power.
51462,216,190,833000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes, of course. Mr. Power."
51465,216,193,833000,Homer Simpson,DRESS SHIRT COUNTER,So I want the monogram to read M-A-X P-O-W-
51466,216,194,833000,Saleswoman,DRESS SHIRT COUNTER,"Sir, traditionally, a monogram is just initials."
51467,216,195,848000,Homer Simpson,DRESS SHIRT COUNTER,"Max Power doesn't abbreviate. Each letter is as important as the one that preceded it. Maybe more important. No, as important."
51468,216,196,857000,Saleswoman,DRESS SHIRT COUNTER,Very well...
51469,216,197,858000,Homer Simpson,DRESS SHIRT COUNTER,"And if you have enough room, add some exclamation points and a pirate flag."
51470,216,198,862000,TRENT,DRESS SHIRT COUNTER,The man knows what he likes.
51471,216,199,863000,Homer Simpson,DRESS SHIRT COUNTER,Just takin' care of business.

51473,216,201,867000,Homer Simpson,DRESS SHIRT COUNTER,"Homer Sim-- Uh, Max Power."
51474,216,202,870000,TRENT,DRESS SHIRT COUNTER,"Oh, heyyy, great name."
51475,216,203,872000,Homer Simpson,DRESS SHIRT COUNTER,"Yeah, isn't it? I got it off a hair dryer."
51476,216,204,875000,TRENT,DRESS SHIRT COUNTER,"I like a man who can poke fun at himself. Ooh, hey, my one o'clock canceled. Have you had any lunch?"

51491,216,219,919000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I guess your new name is really opening doors for you."

51503,216,231,969000,Marge Simpson,GARDEN PARTY,"Oh look, it's Woody Harrelson."
51504,216,232,971000,Guest #1,GARDEN PARTY,I can't believe those pants are made entirely out of hemp.
51505,216,233,977000,Marge Simpson,GARDEN PARTY,"And there's Ed Begley, Jr."
51506,216,234,978000,"Ed Begley, Jr.",GARDEN PARTY,And this one solar collector can gather enough energy to run this colorful pinwheel.
51507,216,235,987000,"Ed Begley, Jr.",GARDEN PARTY,"Wait, wait, I-I got it. I got it."
51508,216,236,991000,Bill Clinton,GARDEN PARTY,"Very nice, Ed. Your inventions continue to impress me and the entire nation."

51515,216,243,1019000,Homer Simpson,GARDEN PARTY,"Anyway, Marge. Uh, how do you feel about the economy?"
51516,216,244,1025000,Homer Simpson,GARDEN PARTY,"So I said ""if this is the house of pancakes, how come I can't eat the walls?"""
51517,216,245,1033000,TRENT,GARDEN PARTY,"Ah, you are too much, Max."
51518,216,246,1035000,Guest #2,GARDEN PARTY,I thought I knew all the players in Springfield. Where have you been hiding yourself?
51519,216,247,1039000,Homer Simpson,GARDEN PARTY,"Well, I spend a lot of time on the couch..."
51520,216,248,1042000,Guests,GARDEN PARTY,Tell me about it. / Haven't we all? / I hear that.
51521,216,249,1047000,Bill Clinton,GARDEN PARTY,"I know you don't think you're good enough for me, but believe me you are. Hell, I've done it with pigs. Real no-foolin' pigs."
51522,216,250,1055000,Marge Simpson,GARDEN PARTY,Are you sure it's a Federal law that I have to dance with you?
51523,216,251,1059000,Bill Clinton,GARDEN PARTY,"You know I'd change that law if I could, Marge. But I can't."
51524,216,252,1065000,Bill Clinton,GARDEN PARTY,"Aw, shoot. Quebec's got the bomb. Well, I gotta go, but look, if you're ever near the White House, there's a tool shed out back. I'm in there most of the day."

51531,216,259,1098000,TRENT,GARDEN PARTY,We all have to give something back to the world that's been so good to us.
51532,216,260,1102000,Homer Simpson,GARDEN PARTY,Give something back? Boo! Get a haircut!
51533,216,261,1106000,TRENT,GARDEN PARTY,"I'm talking, of course, about our endangered forests."
51535,216,263,1113000,TRENT,GARDEN PARTY,"We have to protect them, because trees can't protect themselves. Except, of course, the Mexican Fighting Trees."
51536,216,264,1120000,Homer Simpson,GARDEN PARTY,Somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up.
51537,216,265,1122000,TRENT,GARDEN PARTY,Can we let the wanton destruction of our nation's forests continue?
51538,216,266,1126000,Guests,GARDEN PARTY,No!

51547,216,275,1148000,"Ed Begley, Jr.",Bus,I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt mother earth.
51548,216,276,1150000,"Ed Begley, Jr.",Bus,It's a go-cart powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.
51550,216,278,1163000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,"Oh, this is the worst party ever."
51551,216,279,1165000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Forest,I don't know. Remember that New Year's Eve at Lenny's... he didn't even have a clock!
51552,216,280,1171000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,"Oh, Marge. I thought it would be fun to be on Springfield's ""A"" list, but these people are nuts."
51553,216,281,1176000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Forest,You can't blame them for having a social conscience.
51554,216,282,1179000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,Sure you can. Buncha no-good do-gooders.
51555,216,283,1182000,"Ed Begley, Jr.",Springfield Forest,"Hang in there, Max. Saving the environment is a hard, grueling job."
51556,216,284,1186000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,"That's what I'm saying! See Marge, this guy gets it."
51557,216,285,1194000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Forest,"All right, what's goin' on here?"
51558,216,286,1196000,"Ed Begley, Jr.",Springfield Forest,"We can't allow you to destroy these beautiful trees, which have the same rights you have..."
51559,216,287,1200000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Forest,"Man, I have really had it with you tree-huggers."
51560,216,288,1203000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,Tree-huggers...
51561,216,289,1205000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Forest,"Something funny, Nature Boy?"
51562,216,290,1206000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,"No, I just thought it was cute when you called him..."
51563,216,291,1209000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Forest,"All right, ""Max Power."" Eddie, swab this joker's eyes with mace."
51564,216,292,1214000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Forest,Swab? I thought it was a spray.
51565,216,293,1216000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Forest,"Okay, she's second."
51566,216,294,1223000,"Ed Begley, Jr.",Springfield Forest,"Don't give 'em the satisfaction of screaming, Max. It'll only burn for..."
51568,216,296,1228000,Eddie,Springfield Forest,"Hey, hold still."
51569,216,297,1230000,"Ed Begley, Jr.",Springfield Forest,"Keep runnin', Max!"
51570,216,298,1231000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,I can't lose them!
51571,216,299,1232000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Forest,"Help him out, Lou!"
51572,216,300,1236000,Lou,Springfield Forest,"Uh, you better call for backup, Chief!"
51573,216,301,1237000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,Eep! Leave me alone! Go swab Begley. He likes it!
51574,216,302,1243000,Eddie,Springfield Forest,"Slow down, punk!"
51575,216,303,1247000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,I'm free! Woo hoo!
51577,216,305,1260000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Forest,"Oh, no!"
51580,216,307,1266000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Forest,What a tragedy. That car was just two days away from retirement.
51581,216,308,1276000,TRENT,Springfield Forest,This is terrible.
51582,216,309,1279000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,"So, Trent, where's the party bus headed now?"
51583,216,310,1283000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,What?
51585,216,312,1286000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm glad you changed your name back to Homer Simpson."
51586,216,313,1290000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, I learned you've gotta be yourself. G'night, honey."

51588,216,315,1297000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I almost forgot. While I was at the courthouse, I had them change your name."
51589,216,316,1302000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,To what?
51590,216,317,1303000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Chesty LaRue.
51591,216,318,1304000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Chesty LaRue?!
51592,216,319,1305000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just try it for two weeks. If you're not completely satisfied, you can be Busty St. Claire."
51593,216,320,1310000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't want to be Chesty LaRue or Busty St. Claire!
51594,216,321,1313000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. Hooty McBoob it is.
51595,216,322,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Goodnight, Homer."
51596,216,323,1317000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sleep tight, Hooty."
