127620,492,1,13000,Paleontologist,Duff Center Arena,"Our journey begins sixty-five million years ago, when amazing creatures took their first steps..."
127621,492,2,20000,Marge Simpson,Duff Center Arena,It's so cute that all these children are excited to see their favorite dinosaurs!
127623,492,4,30000,Milhouse Van Houten,Duff Center Arena,These aren't dinosaurs -- dinosaurs sing!
127624,492,5,34000,Ralph Wiggum,Duff Center Arena,I wanna go back in mommy!
127625,492,6,41000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Duff Center Arena,I paid eight-hundred dollars for five minutes.
127626,492,7,43000,Paleontologist,Duff Center Arena,"... the dinosaurs ruled the earth for millions of years -- until a massive asteroid collided with the earth, bringing their reign to an end."
127627,492,8,56000,Homer Simpson,Duff Center Arena,Ex-tinct!
127629,492,9,58000,Paleontologist,Duff Center Arena,"So remember, take good care of the earth, or we could suffer the same fate as the dinosaurs."
127630,492,10,64000,Marge Simpson,Duff Center Arena,"Ooo kids, did you hear that lesson?"
127631,492,11,67000,Bart Simpson,Duff Center Arena,How is that the lesson? The point of the dinosaurs is: no matter what we do an asteroid's gonna wipe us out. So we should party hard and wreck the place.
127632,492,12,77000,Homer Simpson,Duff Center Arena,"Yeah, why should the asteroid have all the fun?"
127633,492,13,84000,Marge Simpson,Duff Center Arena,What? They've got a point.
127635,492,15,91000,Lisa Simpson,OUTER CONCOURSE,Gift shop!
127636,492,16,94000,Homer Simpson,OUTER CONCOURSE,"All right, you can each have one toy."
127637,492,17,98000,Bart Simpson,OUTER CONCOURSE,Lisa has a big toy! No fair! That means I get two small toys!
127638,492,18,103000,Lisa Simpson,OUTER CONCOURSE,"No fair! This isn't big, it's medium!"
127639,492,19,105000,Bart Simpson,OUTER CONCOURSE,"No fair, then I get four small toys and Lisa gets one medium and one small."
127640,492,20,110000,Lisa Simpson,OUTER CONCOURSE,What?
127641,492,21,110000,Lisa Simpson,OUTER CONCOURSE,He gets four and I only get two?! No fair!
127642,492,22,113000,Homer Simpson,OUTER CONCOURSE,"All right, that's it! Forget it! No toys for anyone!"

127645,492,25,120000,Lisa Simpson,OUTER CONCOURSE,NO FAIR!

127647,492,27,128000,Lisa Simpson,OUTER CONCOURSE,Hey -- I know you...
127649,492,29,132000,Lisa Simpson,OUTER CONCOURSE,Wait! Wait! Come back! Dad! Follow that dinosaur!
127650,492,30,136000,Homer Simpson,OUTER CONCOURSE,I've waited my whole life to hear that!
127653,492,33,145000,Stagehand #1,Backstage Area,"Triceratops head, comin' through!"
127654,492,34,148000,Stagehand #2,Backstage Area,"Stegosaurus backplates, used for either defense or control of body temperature, comin' through!"
127655,492,35,154000,Homer Simpson,Backstage Area,So tired... go on without me.
127658,492,38,165000,Lisa Simpson,Changing Room,You're T.R. Francis! You wrote the Angelica Button books! They're my favorite fantasy novels!
127659,492,39,172000,T.R. Francis,Changing Room,"Um... Yes, it's me, the creator of your beloved magical world! Full of whimsy and... chapters... Now off you go! Bye-bye now!"
127661,492,40,182000,Lisa Simpson,Changing Room,But why are you working at a dinosaur show? And why did you run away from me? And how did Angelica get a new wand after Baron Mortdeath burned the Wandwood Forest? And--
127662,492,41,191000,T.R. Francis,Changing Room,"Look, you seem like a smart kid, so here's the truth: T.R. Francis isn't real."
127663,492,42,196000,Lisa Simpson,Changing Room,Of course you're real! Everybody knows you got the idea for this series after an explosion at a crumpet factory knocked you off a double-decker bus. How could that be made up?!
127664,492,43,208000,T.R. Francis,Changing Room,"I'm just an actress they used for the jacket photo. That ""inspirational life story"" is pure fiction. Oh, I hate to break it to you..."
127666,492,45,214000,T.R. Francis,CORPORATE SKYSCRAPER,...but all the books you kids love are conceived in executive boardrooms...The plots are based on market research...
127668,492,47,220000,T.R. Francis,Skyscraper,...and the pages are churned out by a room full of pill-popping lit majors desperate for work.
127670,492,49,231000,T.R. Francis,Bookaccino's,"Publishers rake in the cash and unsuspecting kids get ten books a year by their favorite ""author."""
127671,492,50,231000,Lisa Simpson,Bookaccino's,Everything I believed about young adult literature is a lie!
127672,492,51,245000,Homer Simpson,Bookaccino's,It's not against the law to sleep in a Tyrannosaurus head!
127673,492,52,249000,Wiseguy,Bookaccino's,"Sir, you're inside an Allosaurus."
127674,492,53,251000,Homer Simpson,Bookaccino's,I demand to speak to my paleontologist!
127676,492,55,260000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Can I have my allowance early? I need to buy some carbon-offset credits so I can burn all my Angelica Button books.
127677,492,56,266000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh honey, I'm sorry your book lady turned out to be a dinosaur. But you liked the stories when you read them, so what does it matter?"
127678,492,57,273000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Doesn't it bother you that Betty Crocker is an invention of twenties-era ad men?
127679,492,58,278000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"I know you're hurting, but that's no reason to lash out at me."
127680,492,59,282000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks?
127681,492,60,286000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,A million bucks?
127682,492,61,288000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Every book on the ""Young Adult"" charts is written by five idiots who just want to take advantage of kids!"
127683,492,62,294000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I know five idiots!
127684,492,63,296000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,And they just cash their checks and get away with it every time! It's the perfect crime -- as long as you don't mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds.
127685,492,64,305000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"The perfect crime, eh?"
127687,492,66,317000,Bart Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,"Whatever the job is, I'm not interested."
127688,492,67,319000,Homer Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,A million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.
127689,492,68,321000,Bart Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,I like the beat -- play me the tune.
127690,492,69,323000,Homer Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,We're taking down kids who read.
127691,492,70,325000,Bart Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,"Chapter-book crowd? That's a juicy peach, but what's the cream?"
127692,492,71,327000,Homer Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,I'm putting together a tween-lit gang-write.
127693,492,72,330000,Bart Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,Tween-lit gang-write?
127694,492,73,330000,Homer Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,Tween-lit gang-write. But this Babar needs a Zephyr.
127695,492,74,333000,Bart Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,A Zephyr?
127696,492,75,333000,Homer Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,You're the Zephyr.
127697,492,76,335000,Bart Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,This better not turn out like Kansas City.
127698,492,77,336000,Homer Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,It won't be like Kansas City.
127700,492,79,346000,Bart Simpson,Skinner Home,"Come on, Skinner, you're the best kid-man in the business. You've read their notes, searched their lockers -- you know how tweens think."
127701,492,80,352000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"No thanks, gentlemen, I've got a nice quiet life here, and I mean to keep it that way."
127702,492,81,357000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,Your friends are lookin' at my bloomers -- wash 'em again!
127703,492,82,363000,Bart Simpson,Skinner Home,"With your share of the money, you could get your own studio apartment..."
127704,492,83,366000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,The refrigerator could have my magnets on it.
127705,492,84,370000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,I'm in.
127706,492,85,373000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,"Come on beautiful, I can't do the job without you, so what do you say?"
127708,492,87,378000,Bart Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Our crew needs you, Bouvier. You've read enough fantasy novels to choke a Hippogriff!"
127709,492,88,384000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"It's true. I am fluent in every imaginary language, from Dothraki to Parseltongue."
127712,492,91,394000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I wouldn't join one of your hare-brained schemes for all the Japanese girlfriend pillows in Kyoto!
127628,492,92,399000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"We're not here for you, we're here for Lenny."
127713,492,93,401000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Sorry, guys. I just adopted a Capuchin monkey and I can't leave it alone during the bonding phase."
127714,492,94,408000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, I want in! What does your crew need? A safecracker? A wheel man?"
127715,492,95,411000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,The caper is writing a kids' fantasy novel.
127716,492,96,414000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I don't like to brag about it, but I did publish five modestly successful children's books."
127717,492,97,422000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,All we need now is a computer guy...
127719,492,99,425000,Homer Simpson,House,Do you have a computer?
127720,492,100,426000,Professor Jonathan Frink,House,"Uh, yes."

127722,492,102,428000,Professor Jonathan Frink,House,In what?
127724,492,104,429000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I keep going over the job from every angle, but I can't shake the feeling that we're missing something."
127725,492,105,434000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Relax, with the team we put together, our book'll fly off the shelves, and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in Shelbyville."
127726,492,106,445000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You're group-writing a book?! But the only reason anyone would ever do that is... profit!
127727,492,107,452000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Like no one ever writes for money, Lisa. I don't see your boyfriend William Shakespeare missing too many meals."
127728,492,108,457000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll show you! I'll write a book myself! A personal story my readers will connect with!
127729,492,109,463000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait, you're gonna be all the guys? How would that work?"
127732,492,112,471000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"This is how real writers do it. I'll just bang out two thousand words and then I'll stop, even if I'm on fire. I gotta pace myself. ""Chapter one."" Wait, I can't start without music to inspire me."
127733,492,113,484000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Why is Bach next to Muddy Waters? That's my problem -- I gotta get these CDs organized!
127734,492,114,492000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"There, finished. Now if I win just two more games of online Boggle, I'll be ready to start writing."
127735,492,115,498000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Spot, stop, sop, top-tops, pot-pots, opt-opts, post!"
127737,492,117,507000,Bart Simpson,Bookaccino's,"Okay, we've cased a lot of tween books -- what's their M.O.?"
127738,492,118,511000,Patty Bouvier,Bookaccino's,The heroes are all orphans...
127660,492,119,514000,Seymour Skinner,Bookaccino's,"And they're set at a place kids relate to. Say, a school."
127739,492,120,518000,Seymour Skinner,Bookaccino's,But it's actually magic!
127740,492,121,520000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Bookaccino's,And the protagonist always discovers that he is supernatural!
127741,492,122,524000,Homer Simpson,Bookaccino's,"Okay, our book will be about... an orphan who goes to a magical school... where he discovers he's... a vampire!"
127742,492,123,534000,Patty Bouvier,Bookaccino's,Vampires... like these?
127744,492,125,542000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Bookaccino's,So many vampires! With the fangs and the capes and the medals nobody knows how they earned them!
127745,492,126,547000,Moe Szyslak,Bookaccino's,"Hey, this job's fallin' apart! Everyone head for a different airport and we meet in Rio in a year with new faces!"
127746,492,127,554000,Bart Simpson,Bookaccino's,"No one's goin' anywhere. Okay, the vampire genre is sucked out. All we gotta do is find a new monster to be our hero."
127747,492,128,563000,Kids,Bookaccino's,A troll!
127748,492,129,565000,Moe Szyslak,Bookaccino's,"Hey, I ain't a troll. Look, I bleed red just like you."
127749,492,130,568000,Moe Szyslak,Bookaccino's,"The first part is always green, but it turns red."
127750,492,131,572000,Bart Simpson,Bookaccino's,"A troll, that's it! Our book could be about an orphan troll!"
127751,492,132,575000,Seymour Skinner,Bookaccino's,Trolls live under bridges -- the school should be under a bridge! The Brooklyn Bridge!
127752,492,133,580000,Patty Bouvier,Bookaccino's,"And the cool kids are elves, the cheerleaders are pixies, the stoners are... gargoyles!"
127753,492,134,587000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Bookaccino's,And they play a complicated sport which makes no sense called Fuzzlepitch!
127754,492,135,591000,Moe Szyslak,Bookaccino's,"Yeah, that's good!"
127755,492,136,592000,Patty Bouvier,Bookaccino's,We've cracked it!

127757,492,138,595000,Man,Bookaccino's,"Pardon me, but are you scheming to coauthor a successful series of children's fantasy novels?"
127758,492,139,602000,Moe Szyslak,Bookaccino's,"Okay Stonehenge, let's see how good you are at eavesdroppin' without a throat!"
127759,492,140,606000,Patty Bouvier,Bookaccino's,Don't kill him! That's Neil Gaiman!
127760,492,141,608000,Moe Szyslak,Bookaccino's,"I don't care if he's the guy who wrote ""Sandman Volume One: Preludes And Nocturnes,"" no one spies on us!"

127766,492,146,635000,Lisa Simpson,Bookaccino's,"Sitting in a coffee shop -- I couldn't feel more like a real writer! Oh, Better set up my wi-fi in case I need to do some research! But if I'm gonna use their free internet, I really should buy something."

127821,492,200,907000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"But Lis, when this book comes out, you'll be beloved! Not just by Milhouses, you'll get attention from Jacksons, Xanders -- even Aidens!"
127822,492,201,916000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Aww, I've always wanted an Aiden..."
127823,492,202,920000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,Here it is: an advance copy.
127824,492,203,924000,Patty Bouvier,Moe's Tavern,"""The Vampire Twins Of Transylvania Prep?!"" Where's the trolls?"
127825,492,204,932000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Moe's Tavern,"The trolls are now vampires, the Brooklyn Bridge is now a castle, and Fuzzlepitch is now Bloodball! Oh! Weak! Weak! And lame!"
127826,492,205,940000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"How could the publishers change our book? If they had been in charge of the Sistine Chapel, the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the pope's private naked dude mural!"
127828,492,207,950000,Slick Publisher,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,"Look, we market-tested the book, and it really got dinged on the whole ""trolls"" thing. I mean dinged! So we made some changes. Don't feel bad. Before we got our hands on ""Twilight,"" it was about a girl who fell in love with a golem."
127829,492,208,961000,Slick Publisher,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,But teenagers weren't going to spend their allowances to join Team Schmul.
127830,492,209,965000,Homer Simpson,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,"But the trolls were the best part! Do the characters still say ""troll-y"" instead of ""cool?"""
127831,492,210,970000,Slick Publisher,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,No.
127832,492,211,970000,Homer Simpson,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,"Oh, that is so untroll-y!"
127833,492,212,972000,Slick Publisher,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,"Hey, if you don't want your words changed, write a screenplay. We own your book -- so why don't you go and cry into your million-dollar check."
127834,492,213,979000,Patty Bouvier,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,How could they do this to our book?
127835,492,214,981000,Seymour Skinner,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,It was the singular vision of seven people.
127836,492,215,985000,Neil Gaiman,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,"What you're feeling is called ""pride of authorship."" You thought you only cared about money, but you actually care more about what you've created together."
127837,492,216,994000,Homer Simpson,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,British Fonzie is right. Our story is actually more important... than money.
127838,492,217,1001000,Patty Bouvier,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,"I was gonna buy the apartment next door and fill it with dolls, but now that just sounds stupid!"
127839,492,218,1006000,Seymour Skinner,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,They can't do this to us -- we've gotta fight back!
127840,492,219,1009000,Gang,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,Yeah! / Let's get 'em! / Oh yes! / He's right!
127841,492,220,1012000,Bart Simpson,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,"Rule number one of book heists: ""never fall in love with the book."" We queer the deal -- we lose the money!"
127842,492,221,1017000,Seymour Skinner,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,"Bart, remember the thousand-year war between the trolls and the ogres?"
127843,492,222,1021000,Bart Simpson,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,Yeah?
127844,492,223,1021000,Seymour Skinner,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,Now it's a dance contest at the vampire prom.
127845,492,224,1028000,Bart Simpson,SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE,Let's steal back our book.
127847,492,226,1041000,Homer Simpson,LITERARY TOWERS,Somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece.
127848,492,227,1045000,Bart Simpson,LITERARY TOWERS,"The book prints at midnight. So if we swap in the original version , they'll print the wrong book -- our book."
127849,492,228,1051000,Patty Bouvier,LITERARY TOWERS,"And before the publishers can do anything about it, ""The Troll Twins Of Underbridge Academy"" will be in every bookstore in America!"
127850,492,229,1059000,Seymour Skinner,LITERARY TOWERS,"This is the Fuzzlepitch Finals, and tonight, we drink from the Wazzle Cup!"
127852,492,231,1063000,Seymour Skinner,LITERARY TOWERS LOBBY,"Hello, I'm the pizza delivery man."
127853,492,232,1065000,Guard,LITERARY TOWERS LOBBY,We didn't order a pizza.
127854,492,233,1066000,Seymour Skinner,LITERARY TOWERS LOBBY,"No, of course you didn't. The establishment I work for delivers pizzas to everyone, and then gives the customer the option of accepting or refusing delivery."
127855,492,234,1074000,Guard,LITERARY TOWERS LOBBY,That's a terrible business strategy.
127856,492,235,1076000,Seymour Skinner,LITERARY TOWERS LOBBY,"No, no, it's quite sound."
127857,492,236,1078000,Guard,LITERARY TOWERS LOBBY,"Okay, fine. Where's the pizza?"
127858,492,237,1080000,Seymour Skinner,LITERARY TOWERS LOBBY,Pizza?
127860,492,239,1106000,Bart Simpson,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,The central computer is through here. All we have to do is upload our file and--
127861,492,240,1114000,Slick Publisher,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,"Good evening, gentlemen."
127862,492,241,1116000,Bart Simpson,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,Kansas City.
127863,492,242,1117000,Homer Simpson,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,Kansas City.
127864,492,243,1119000,Slick Publisher,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,"So, you thought you would un-ruin your book. If it's any consolation, you never had a chance."
127865,492,244,1125000,Homer Simpson,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,Woo-hoo! All right!
127866,492,245,1126000,Slick Publisher,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,Someone in your gang tipped me off to your little caper.
127867,492,246,1129000,Bart Simpson,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,A traitor?
127868,492,247,1133000,Moe Szyslak,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,I bet it's the Earl of Marmalade over here.
127870,492,249,1136000,Lisa Simpson,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,"No, guys... it was me."
127871,492,250,1138000,Gang,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,/ It can't be! / Oh betrayal!
127872,492,251,1140000,Patty Bouvier,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,It's always a dame.
127765,492,252,1141000,Homer Simpson,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,But why?
127795,492,253,1143000,Slick Publisher,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,Because a little girl wants her dream to come true...
127873,492,254,1147000,Lisa Simpson,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,My name is finally on a book!
127874,492,255,1149000,Lisa Simpson,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,And they're letting me write the sequel! A hard deadline is just the kick in the pants I need to focus and get some serious writing done!
127875,492,256,1158000,Slick Publisher,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,Now to enter the password and to authorize final publication. My favorite theme of wall calendars...
127876,492,257,1165000,Slick Publisher,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,"Lisa, would you care to do the honors?"
127877,492,258,1169000,Lisa Simpson,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,I'm sorry.
127878,492,259,1178000,Slick Publisher,PRINTING ROOM FLOOR,"Oh, by the way, the audio book is only available... abridged! Abridged!!!"
127880,492,261,1186000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Well, we may have lost, but we gave the bad guy a laugh -- that's something."
127881,492,262,1195000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,Our book! The real one!
127882,492,263,1196000,Gang,Springfield,/ Yes! / Wonderful words!
127883,492,264,1199000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"No need to thank me, boys."
127884,492,265,1199000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Hey, you wouldn't say that... unless there was a need to thank you."
127885,492,266,1206000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,You could never have printed your version of the book without the publisher's password...
127886,492,267,1206000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,So I pretended to betray you... then after he typed the password...
127887,492,268,1214000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,I secretly switched the flash drives.
127888,492,269,1219000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,You switched the drives?
127889,492,270,1221000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,I got the idea from every movie ever made.
127891,492,272,1233000,Lisa Simpson,BOOKACCINOS,"And the best part is, my face is still on the back flap."
127893,492,274,1239000,Lisa Simpson,BOOKACCINOS,Gaiman!
127894,492,275,1246000,Neil Gaiman,BOOKACCINOS,"Poor Lisa, did it never occur to her that there might be three flash drives?"
127895,492,276,1252000,Neil Gaiman,BOOKACCINOS,I've heisted my way to the bestseller list once again. And the most brilliant part is... I don't even know how to read.
127896,492,277,1275000,Moe Szyslak,BOOKACCINOS,"Gaiman, I've been waitin' to do this for a long time."
127897,492,278,1282000,Moe Szyslak,BOOKACCINOS,"Congratulations, partner! We did it."
127898,492,279,1286000,Moe Szyslak,BOOKACCINOS,"Neil, how come you watched me drink mine but didn't drink yours?"
127899,492,280,1290000,Neil Gaiman,BOOKACCINOS,"It's simple, Moe. I don't like the taste... of poison."
127900,492,281,1294000,Moe Szyslak,BOOKACCINOS,Awwww... crap.
