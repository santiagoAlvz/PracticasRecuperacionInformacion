73815,290,144,643000,Lou,MRS. BELLAMY'S HOUSE,"I found her will, Chief. It was just changed to leave the Simpsons fifty thousand dollars."
73816,290,145,650000,Homer Simpson,MRS. BELLAMY'S HOUSE,"Oh-ho, so it's a good thing she died. From our point of view. Financially."

73828,290,157,695000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh dear, now everyone will think Homer and I did it. The real killer is the man with the braces."
73829,290,158,702000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, if Dad killed everyone he talked about killing, would any of us be here?"
73830,290,159,706000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You'd be dead a million times.
73832,290,161,711000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Do you really think Homer could be a killer?
73833,290,162,713000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,I just can't believe a man we sat and drank with all these years could do such a horrible thing.
73834,290,163,718000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, we've all got that voice in our heads telling us to kill. You just have to drown it out."

73855,290,185,794000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,What? It goes right by our house.
73857,290,187,801000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is ridiculous. You've been through my delicates, my silkies, my dainties, and my unmentionables."
73858,290,188,808000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,I insist on searching every inch of this home personally.
73859,290,189,812000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Here's my underwear drawer.
73860,290,190,813000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Where's that robot?

73867,290,197,830000,Homer Simpson,Maggie's Bedroom,"You know Chief, if you let us go, there's a diamond necklace in it for you."
73868,290,198,835000,Chief Wiggum,Maggie's Bedroom,"I hope you're not suggesting that I would take that necklace as a bribe. Think again, dirtbag! Because I can just swipe it later from the evidence locker."
73869,290,199,848000,Lou,Maggie's Bedroom,"Your wife's gonna look pretty good in that, Chief."
73870,290,200,851000,Chief Wiggum,Maggie's Bedroom,"Yeah, she's a super lady."
73872,290,202,861000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,I can't believe we've been arrested for murder.
73873,290,203,865000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Don't worry, Marge. I'll cut us a deal by becoming a jailhouse snitch. I know who stopped up the toilet!"

73894,290,224,952000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,But we're innocent! It was the man with the braces.
73895,290,225,956000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Can't you do anything? Surprise witnesses? Evidence tampering? Play the race card. Play it.
73898,290,228,966000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,"We appreciate your coming to comfort us, but we're not Catholic."
73899,290,229,972000,Priest,Springfield Prison,"Oh, dear, dear, dear. Well, then I hope you enjoy your stay in Hell."
73900,290,230,979000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Prison,Nice dress.
73901,290,231,981000,Priest,Springfield Prison,Go home and have sex with your wife?
73902,290,232,983000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Prison,"That's it, bring it on!"
73903,290,233,992000,Priest,Springfield Prison,"C'mon, ya stinkin'..."
73904,290,234,1001000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,How can you have such an appetite at a time like this?
73906,290,235,1005000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,Let's just say I'm planning a little surprise for the execution. This cannon is going to be full when I go off. Ka-boom!
73907,290,236,1014000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Y'know, this is our last night... and our cells are side-by-side..."
73908,290,237,1021000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,It's hard to get in the mood... with all those murderous eyes staring at us...
73909,290,238,1026000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,Just think of them as twinkling stars.
73910,290,239,1029000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Homie, I'm sorry. I can't. I just keep thinking about everything we're gonna miss. The kids growing up, grandchildren..."
73911,290,240,1044000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,I want to confess. I killed and robbed the old lady all by myself. Marge is completely innocent. The only thing she's guilty of is loving too much the murder I did.
73912,290,241,1059000,Prison Warden,Springfield Prison,"Congratulations, Mrs. Simpson. Your husband confessed to everything. You're free to go."

73919,290,248,1097000,Michael Clark Duncan,DEATH ROW,"You want some cornbread, Mr. Jingles? Well you can forget it, because I'm gon kill you!"
73922,290,251,1122000,Guard,Springfield Prison,"Hello? Yes, Governor. No, Governor, it's not too late. Yes, Governor, I'll tell him right away."
73923,290,252,1133000,Guard,Springfield Prison,The Governor says that he hopes you're a twitcher. Oh yes.
73925,290,254,1139000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Prison,"Chin up, Homer... We've gotta put an electrode there to ground the brain stem."

73931,290,260,1160000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,What?!
73932,290,261,1161000,Man With Braces,Springfield Prison,"That's right. Homer Simpson, you're the latest victim of the new reality show ""Frame-Up""!"
73933,290,262,1169000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,It's the man with the braces!
73905,290,263,1171000,Man With Braces,Springfield Prison,I'm also your host. Now let's meet a ghost!
73934,290,264,1176000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,Mrs. Bellamy?
73935,290,265,1178000,Mrs. Bellamy,Springfield Prison,There never was a Mrs. Bellamy.
73936,290,266,1181000,Carmen Electra,Springfield Prison,"Only me, Carmen Electra!"
73937,290,267,1184000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,I knew it!
73938,290,268,1186000,Man With Braces,Springfield Prison,And I'm some actor they hired!
73939,290,269,1188000,Carmen Electra,Springfield Prison,"""Frame Up"" is Fox's latest hit! Right after ""No Pants Island"" and ""Fart Date."""
73940,290,270,1194000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,"This whole thing was a joke? Oh, I've never been so relieved! Relieved and angry."
73941,290,271,1202000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Prison,"So wait a minute, wait a minute. You tied up the judicial system -- costing the city millions of dollars -- just for a TV show?"
73942,290,272,1208000,Carmen Electra,Springfield Prison,Yes!
73943,290,273,1210000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Prison,And I-I'm going to be in the show?
73944,290,274,1211000,Carmen Electra,Springfield Prison,Yes!

73946,290,276,1212000,Carmen Electra,Springfield Prison,Yep.
73947,290,277,1215000,Man With Braces,Springfield Prison,"Now, what are your last names?"
73948,290,278,1217000,Lou,Springfield Prison,We don't have them. We're like Cher.
73949,290,279,1219000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Oh Homie, I'm so lucky to be married to such a selfless and loving man."
73950,290,280,1228000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Mom, Dad, thank God you're okay."
73951,290,281,1231000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Prison,We were in the Green Room. I had so much shrimp!
73952,290,282,1235000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Well, I'm glad everyone's all right, but I think you should be ashamed -- toying with a human life for TV ratings."
73953,290,283,1243000,Carmen Electra,Springfield Prison,"Uh Homer, my face is up here."
73954,290,284,1246000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,I've made my choice.
