35433,160,1,32000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Skin-ner!!!
35434,160,2,34000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, Superintendent Chalmers! What's wrong?!"
35435,160,3,38000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Nothing. I just bought myself a car!
35436,160,4,40000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh... oh, good. This will sound crazy but at first I... I thought I'd enraged you again."
35437,160,5,47000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Skin-ner!!!
35438,160,6,48000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,What?! What?!
35439,160,7,49000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Now you're getting paranoid.
35440,160,8,51000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"You know, I used to think a car was just a way of getting from Point A to Point B... and on weekends, Point C. But that was the old me. That man died the moment I laid eyes on the 1979 Honda Accord."
35441,160,9,64000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I've always admired car owners. And I hope to be one myself, as soon as I finish paying off Mother. She insists I pay her retroactively for the food I ate as a child."
35442,160,10,74000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, yes, that's unfortunate... Well, Seymour, I make Superintendent money, which amply covers both food and car. Holy Jumping Caesar's Catfish!!"
35443,160,11,84000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,My 'H' has been stolen! Oh! That's how people know it's a Honda! What's the point of having a Honda if you can't show it off?!
35444,160,12,93000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Sir, if you'll just stop yelling at me, I'm sure I can find a replacement..."
35445,160,13,99000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I'll just...
35446,160,14,100000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, get away from my car!"
35447,160,15,102000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Uh-oh!
35448,160,16,102000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Uh-oh!
35449,160,17,102000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,This way!
35452,160,20,115000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Eh, mornin', Apu."
35453,160,21,117000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Good morning. One donut with sprinkles, and... Wait a minute -- these are not sprinkles, Sir!"
35454,160,22,124000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Whaddya mean?
35455,160,23,125000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,You have clearly taken items from the candy rack and placed them on top of the donut in an attempt to pass them off as sprinkles!
35456,160,24,130000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, it was like that when I got here. It really was."
35457,160,25,134000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"A Mounds bar is not a sprinkle! A Twizzler is not a sprinkle! A Jolly Rancher is not a sprinkle, Sir! -- Perhaps in Shangri-la they are, but not here!"
35458,160,26,146000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Thank you, come again."
35459,160,27,150000,Chief Wiggum,Kwik-E-Mart,"Ah, looks like we put the kibosh on another two-bit telephone swindle, boys. Frankly, I would've expected better from Jimmy the Scumbag."
35460,160,28,162000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey, what's this thing?"
35463,160,29,163000,Chief Wiggum,Kwik-E-Mart,"Huh? Oh, that's an auto-dialer. This bird was using it to pull a telemarketing scam, but instead he's gonna rot in the slammer for the next twenty years -- bread and water, icy showers, guards whompin' your ass 'round the clock, and the only way out is suicide."
35464,160,30,179000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Telemarketing, eh?"
35466,160,32,189000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, you think this stolen 'H' is a laugh riot, don't you? Well, I'll tell you something that's not so funny: right now, Superintendent Chalmers is at home crying like a little girl!"
35468,160,34,203000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I guess it is a little funny... Nonetheless, I will find the culprit. We'll start with, oh, I don't know... Bart Simpson!"
35469,160,35,217000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Um, I don't think you want to look in there, sir."
35470,160,36,219000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Balderdash. I'll just stick my head right in and --
35471,160,37,222000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Half a dozen eggs?!
35472,160,38,225000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, that would be the complete dozen... All right. Rather than tempt fate, I'll move along now."
35473,160,39,231000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,So we reach the bottom of the barrel: Nelson Muntz.
35474,160,40,237000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Dum-da-da-dum!
35475,160,41,237000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"The cold, hard process of elimination places the 'H' squarely in your locker!"
35476,160,42,245000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw haw!
35477,160,43,248000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Damn! Dang! Darn!
35478,160,44,255000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"A principal's ransom in stolen goods! Well sir, who's ""haw-hawing"" now, hmm?"
35479,160,45,262000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"I'unno, but he's got lethal tuna-breath."
35480,160,46,266000,All Students,Springfield Elementary School,Ooooohh...
35481,160,47,268000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Who does Nelson think he's impressing, anyway, acting so cool all the time?"
35482,160,48,272000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Not me!
35483,160,49,274000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"All right, Mr. Smartenheimer, that does it!"
35484,160,50,276000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"First, you're going to give back everything you've stolen, then I'm sentencing you to one week of the lowest, most degrading work known to man: janitorial work."
35485,160,51,284000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Aw, Jees, I'm standin' right here, sir."
35461,160,52,289000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, yes. Uh, take a good look at him, Nelson, cause that's where you're headed."
35462,160,53,296000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"After you claim your stolen merchandise, go directly to Mr. Muntz for an apology."
35486,160,54,301000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Bite me... Cram it... You're dead... Get bent, ma'am..."
35487,160,55,308000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Why do you have to be such a pain all the time? Don't you realize you're getting a bad reputation?
35488,160,56,312000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Don't you realize your butt sticks out?
35489,160,57,314000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,It does not!
35490,160,58,316000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Hey!
35491,160,59,316000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw haw!
35493,160,61,321000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"An automatic dialer? Is that legal? I don't want you getting arrested, Homer..."
35494,160,62,325000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I won't.
35495,160,63,326000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Or swindling our neighbors.
35496,160,64,329000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Let me show you how it works. This baby has every phone number in town programmed into it. It automatically calls them one by one and plays my message. Listen.
35497,160,65,343000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Ahoy-hoy?
35498,160,66,344000,Homer's Recording,Simpson Home,"Greetings, friend. Do you wish to look as happy as me? Well, you've got the power inside you right now. So use it. And send one dollar to Happy Dude, 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield. Don't delay! Eternal happiness is just a dollar away."
35499,160,67,363000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Hmm. One dollar for eternal happiness... Mmmm, I'd be happier with the dollar."
35500,160,68,370000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in!
35501,160,69,375000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars. It's nothing but panhandling!
35502,160,70,381000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Tele-panhandling.
35504,160,72,383000,Dewey Largo,Springfield Elementary School,"... And should there be a request for an encore, we will reprise ""Pop Goes the Weasel."" Otherwise, we won't file out quietly."
35505,160,73,394000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,And that's how Willie waters. Now you take the hooze.
35506,160,74,398000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,The moose?
35507,160,75,400000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,The hooze! The hooze!
35508,160,76,401000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Is this right?
35509,160,77,402000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Ach! Turn off the noozle!
35510,160,78,404000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,The noodles? What noodles?
35511,160,79,406000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,The noozle on the end of the hooze! Ach!
35513,160,81,409000,Dewey Largo,Springfield Elementary School,"Miss Simpson, do you find something funny about the word ""tromboner?"""
35514,160,82,413000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No, sir. I was laughing at something outside."
35413,160,83,417000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,She was looking at Nelson!
35515,160,84,419000,All Students,Springfield Elementary School,Lisa likes Nelson!
35516,160,85,421000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,She does not!
35517,160,86,423000,All Students,Springfield Elementary School,Milhouse likes Lisa!
35518,160,87,425000,JANEY,Springfield Elementary School,He does not!
35519,160,88,426000,All Students,Springfield Elementary School,Janey likes Milhouse!
35520,160,89,429000,Ãœter,Springfield Elementary School,She does not!
35521,160,90,430000,All Students,Springfield Elementary School,Uter likes Milhouse!
35522,160,91,432000,Dewey Largo,Springfield Elementary School,"Nobody likes Milhouse! Lisa, you've got detention!"
35523,160,92,447000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, how does Bart do this every week?"
35524,160,93,450000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, Brainiac, since when do you get detention?"
35525,160,94,453000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,It's your fault! I accidentally laughed at your immature prank.
35526,160,95,457000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Haw. Yeah, the best part was when he got wet! Hey, you're doin' that the stupid way."
35527,160,96,463000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"If you use that deal with the five chalks, you'll get done faster."
35528,160,97,466000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Thanks, but I prefer the honest way."
35529,160,98,468000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Whatever. Smell ya later!
35530,160,99,486000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Wow, that was a good idea. And I can't believe it came from Nelson."
148688,160,100,492000,Lisa's Thoughts,Springfield Elementary School,"He's not like anybody I've ever met. He's like a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a vest. He sure is ugly, though. So why can't I stop staring at him?"
148689,160,101,504000,Lisa's Thoughts,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, no... I think I'm getting a crush on Nelson Muntz!"
35531,160,102,510000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, Willie, catch the football!"
35532,160,103,512000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,All right I--
35534,160,105,526000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Milhouse, I've never told anyone this kind of thing before... but I've never felt this way before. I think I have a crush..."
35535,160,106,534000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, really?"
35536,160,107,537000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,...on Nelson Muntz.
35537,160,108,540000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Way to drink, Poindexter!"
35538,160,109,543000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,You like Nelson?! But he's a creep and he chipped one of my permanent teeth!
35539,160,110,548000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"But I bet underneath, he's a sweet, sensitive person -- like you. I guess you could say I want to bring out the Milhouse in Nelson."
35540,160,111,556000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"But I'm all Milhouse! Plus, my Mom says I'm the handsomest guy in school!"
35542,160,112,562000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I like you, too, Milhouse, but not in that way. You're more like a big sister."
35543,160,113,567000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,No I'm not! Why does everybody keep saying that?!
35544,160,114,571000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Would you do me a favor? When you get back to class, just give him this note."
35546,160,116,577000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Please?
35547,160,117,579000,Milhouse's Thoughts,Springfield Elementary School,"When she sees you'll do anything she says, she's bound to respect you."
35548,160,118,584000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Sure, what's a big sister for? Oh, I shouldn'ta said that..."
35549,160,119,594000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Guess who likes you?
35550,160,120,594000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Milhouse, I'm so sorry..."
35551,160,121,607000,Paramedic,Springfield Elementary School,He can't hear you now. We had to pack his ears with gauze.
35552,160,122,613000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Nelson! Um... that note Milhouse gave you... it wasn't from him. It was from... me.
35553,160,123,622000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,You? Why would you like me? No girls like me. Are you wearing a wire?
35554,160,124,629000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I don't know why I like you. I just do. So... what do you think?
35555,160,125,635000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,It's okay... I guess. Do I have to do anything?
35556,160,126,640000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Well... would you like to come over to my house after school?
35557,160,127,643000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay... But if anybody sees us, I'm just there to steal your bike."
35559,160,129,654000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo! Two dollars! It's working!
35561,160,131,659000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,I don't feel any happier. How 'bout you?
35562,160,132,663000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,Umm... a little.
35564,160,134,666000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, you've got to see this, it's so cute what she does. Be the baby, kitty. Go on, be the baby."
35565,160,135,674000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,C'mon!
35567,160,137,676000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Snowball! I - don't - understand. She loves to climb in h--
35569,160,139,683000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,I believe you! I don't care!
35570,160,140,685000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Lis, Mom said you had the toenail clippers and-- Whoa, Lisa! Look out! Nelson's in our house!"
35572,160,141,690000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's okay, I invited him over. Nelson's my new... friend."
35573,160,142,695000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Are you nuts? I'll probably never say this to you again, but you can do better."
35574,160,143,699000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Please don't ruin this for me, Bart. I think he's starting to like me!"
35575,160,144,703000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Milhouse likes you.
35576,160,145,704000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, please. Milhouse likes Vaseline on toast."
35577,160,146,707000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmmm.
35579,160,148,712000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Aw, pawns can't move that way! Ya stupid arm..."
35580,160,149,716000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Lab...
35581,160,150,718000,Homer's Recording,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Greetings, friend. Do you wish to look as happy as me? Well, you've got the power inside you right... Etc."
35582,160,151,721000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Why it's the AT-5000 Autodialer, my very first patent! Aw, wouldja listen to the gibberish they've got you saying! It's sad and alarming. You were designed to alert schoolchildren about snow days and such. Well, let's get you home to Frinky. Hope your wheels still work."
35583,160,152,748000,Homer Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Oh, no you don't!"
35585,160,154,754000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,You're the first person I've had over to the house since my Dad went nuts.
35587,160,156,770000,Lisa Simpson,NELSON'S ROOM,"""Nuke the whales?"" You don't really believe that, do you?"
35588,160,157,773000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S ROOM,I'unno... Gotta nuke somethin'!
35589,160,158,776000,Lisa Simpson,NELSON'S ROOM,TouchÃ©.
35590,160,159,778000,Lisa Simpson,NELSON'S ROOM,You play the guitar?
35591,160,160,779000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S ROOM,"Oh, yeah, I'm a superstar."
35592,160,161,782000,Lisa Simpson,NELSON'S ROOM,Would you... play a song for me?
35593,160,162,784000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S ROOM,Oh... okay.
35594,160,163,794000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S ROOM,Joy to the world / The teacher's dead! / We bar-b-qued her head! / What happened to her bod-dy? / We flushed it down the pot-ty! / And round and round it goes / And round and round it... goes --
35595,160,164,813000,Lisa Simpson,NELSON'S ROOM,I wish I could laugh at the idea of a teacher being decapitated.
35596,160,165,817000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S ROOM,"I know. Haw. It's funny, huh?"
35597,160,166,820000,Lisa Simpson,NELSON'S ROOM,Hardly.
35598,160,167,822000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S ROOM,"Listen, I'm gettin' pretty tired. I'm goin' to go to sleep for a while. Smell ya later!"
35599,160,168,828000,Lisa Simpson,NELSON'S ROOM,How am I supposed to get home?
35601,160,169,830000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S ROOM,I 'unno. Y'shoulda thought of that before you came over. Huh.
35603,160,171,835000,Lisa Simpson,Marge's Station Wagon,"I feel so stupid, Mom. Nelson's not right for me at all. And I don't think he ever will be."
35604,160,172,841000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Station Wagon,"Well, most women will tell you that you're a fool to think you can change a man... but those women are quitters!"
35605,160,173,848000,Lisa Simpson,Marge's Station Wagon,What?
35606,160,174,849000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Station Wagon,"When I first met your father, he was loud, crude, and piggish. But I worked hard on him, and now he's a whole new person!"
35607,160,175,857000,Lisa Simpson,Marge's Station Wagon,Mom...
35608,160,176,858000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Station Wagon,"He's a whole new person, Lisa!"
35609,160,177,862000,Lisa Simpson,Marge's Station Wagon,"Oh, I know."
35611,160,179,865000,Lisa Simpson,Marge's Station Wagon,I wonder if I could change Nelson...
35613,160,181,868000,Lisa Simpson,Wee Monsieur,Very sharp!
35614,160,182,870000,Nelson Muntz,Wee Monsieur,"Aw, but I feel like such a tool!"
35615,160,183,873000,Lisa Simpson,Wee Monsieur,"I know it's a change, but it really highlights your sweet and sensitive side."
35616,160,184,876000,Nelson Muntz,Wee Monsieur,"Aw, crap."
35618,160,186,879000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Observatory,"Isn't it nice up here? What are you thinking, Nelson?"
35619,160,187,883000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Observatory,What am I thinking about what?
35620,160,188,884000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Observatory,About anything.
35621,160,189,885000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Observatory,Nothin'.
35622,160,190,886000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Observatory,What do you feel? What's inside you right now?
35623,160,191,890000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Observatory,Guts and black stuff... and about fifty Slim Jims.

35668,160,237,1080000,Jimbo Jones,Skinner Home,Why's he wasting his time with that Simpson chick?

35700,160,268,1196000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Well, I... I can't be everywhere at once, Lou, now can I? You know, in most cities, the Chief of Police doesn't even go out on calls like these."

35707,160,275,1220000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Observatory,Wait'll he finds what I left in his birdbath!
35709,160,277,1229000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Observatory,I thought you weren't there.
35710,160,278,1231000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Observatory,"Huh? Oh, yeah, uh, I guess I was."
35711,160,279,1234000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Observatory,You lied to me.

35715,160,283,1241000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Observatory,"No. You don't understand, Nelson. A kiss doesn't mean anything if it's dishonest."
35716,160,284,1246000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Observatory,Um... there's a niceness to it...
35717,160,285,1250000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Observatory,I was foolish to think I'd actually changed you. Maybe I was seeing things in you that weren't really there.
35718,160,286,1256000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Observatory,Definitely.
35719,160,287,1257000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Observatory,Then why did you want to be with me?
35720,160,288,1259000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Observatory,"Mmm-hmm. Maybe 'cause you were the first person that ever thought there was a nice guy inside me. Well, guess you really blew that one, huh?"
35721,160,289,1270000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Observatory,"Well, I guess this is it..."
35722,160,290,1272000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Observatory,"You mean, like, goodbye?"
35723,160,291,1274000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Observatory,"Let's just call it ""Smell ya later."""
35724,160,293,1274000,Milhouse Van Houten,Street,"Hi, Lisa! Could I talk to you, or would that just make Nelson whale on me again?"
35725,160,294,1299000,Lisa Simpson,Street,Don't worry. Nelson and I don't like each other anymore.
35726,160,295,1302000,Milhouse Van Houten,Street,Really? You got anybody in mind for your next crush?
35727,160,296,1307000,Lisa Simpson,Street,"Well, I'm really not thinking about that now."
35728,160,297,1311000,Lisa Simpson,Street,I suppose it could be almost anybody...
35729,160,298,1314000,Milhouse Van Houten,Street,Yesssss!!
35730,160,299,1328000,Homer's Recording,Street,"Hello, this is Homer Simpson, a.k.a. ""Happy Dude."" The court has ordered me to call every person in town to apologize for my telemarketing scam.
