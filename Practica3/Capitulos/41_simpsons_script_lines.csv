2713,41,96,385000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Dad, that's Hebrew. Krusty must be Jewish."

2725,41,108,435000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Well, okay. First of all, my real name isn't Krusty the Clown, it's Hershel Krustofsky. My father was a rabbi. His father was a rabbi. His father's father -- well, you get the idea."
2727,41,110,449000,Krusty the Clown,Lower East Side of Springfield,My father was the most respected man in the lower east side of Springfield. People would come from miles around to ask his advice.
2728,41,111,458000,Man #1,Lower East Side of Springfield,"Reb Krustofsky, should I finish college?"
2729,41,112,461000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Lower East Side of Springfield,Yes. No one is poor except he who lacks knowledge.
2730,41,113,464000,Woman,Lower East Side of Springfield,"Rabbi, should I have another child?"
2731,41,114,466000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Lower East Side of Springfield,"Yes, another child would be a blessing on your house."

2733,41,116,472000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Lower East Side of Springfield,"Could you rephrase that as a, as a ethical question?"
2734,41,117,476000,Man #2,Lower East Side of Springfield,Hmm... is it right to buy a Chrysler?
2735,41,118,478000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Lower East Side of Springfield,"Yes, for great is the car with power steering and dyna-flow suspension."
148267,41,119,483000,Young Krusty,Lower East Side of Springfield,"Papa, when I grow up, can I be a clown?"
2709,41,120,487000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Lower East Side of Springfield,No! A clown is not a respected member of the community.
148266,41,121,489000,Young Krusty,Lower East Side of Springfield,But I want to make people laugh.
2737,41,122,491000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Lower East Side of Springfield,"Hershel, life is not fun. Life is serious. Seltzer is for drinking, not for spraying. Pie is for noshing, not for throwing."
2738,41,123,499000,Krusty the Clown,Lower East Side of Springfield,"But papa, can't..."
2739,41,124,499000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Lower East Side of Springfield,But nothing! You'll do as I say or you'll get such a zetz that you won't even know what hit you.
2741,41,126,505000,Krusty the Clown,Yeshiva Classroom,"Dad wanted me to follow in his footsteps, but the pull of clowning was too strong. I got my first big laughs at Yeshiva impersonating my father."
148268,41,127,515000,Young Krusty,Yeshiva Classroom,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, Moses! Blah, blah, blah, blah some prayer!"
2743,41,129,525000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps."
2744,41,130,529000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, I don't even like using the bathroom after you."
2745,41,131,531000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little...
2746,41,132,534000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Krusty, please continue."
2747,41,133,535000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Okay.
2749,41,135,536000,Krusty the Clown,Krustofsky Home,My father tried to extinguish the comedy bug. But it was no use.
2750,41,136,541000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Krustofsky Home,What are you doing in that bathroom?
2751,41,137,542000,Krusty the Clown,Krustofsky Home,Go away.

2756,41,142,549000,Krusty the Clown,GROSSINGERS,Then came my big break. A Talmudic conference in the Catskills and I was the entertainment.
2757,41,143,557000,Krusty the Clown,GROSSINGERS,But the Lord works in mysterious ways.
2758,41,144,562000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,GROSSINGERS,"Do you know that my son Hershel was first in his Yeshiva class. As a matter of fact, he was voted ""The Most Likely to Hear God."""
2759,41,145,568000,Rabbi #1,GROSSINGERS,"Oh go on, Hymie. You're exaggerating again. You're so proud of your son."
2760,41,146,572000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,GROSSINGERS,"A rabbi would never exaggerate. A rabbi composes; he creates thoughts; he tells stories that may never have happened, but he does not exaggerate."
2761,41,147,581000,Krusty the Clown,GROSSINGERS,"My father would have never have suspected a thing, were it not for one rowdy rabbi."
2762,41,148,586000,Rowdy Rabbi,GROSSINGERS,"Hey, Funny-man!"
2763,41,149,592000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,GROSSINGERS,Hershel? Hershel! Oy vay iz mir!
2765,41,150,596000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,GROSSINGERS,"You have brought shame on our family. Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive. But, but-but this? I never want to see you again. You... you... clown!"
2767,41,152,612000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,And I haven't seen my father since.
2768,41,153,614000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That is so sad.
2769,41,154,616000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Krusty, do you think about your father a lot?"
2770,41,155,618000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,All the time. Except when I'm at the track. Then it's all business.
2771,41,156,632000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Look at you, Bart."
2772,41,157,634000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Oh, isn't that fun?"
2773,41,158,637000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Hey, whoa."
2774,41,159,639000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Oh, the Fourth of July. I can't believe that little boy in the pictures is you, Bart."
2775,41,160,644000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I've got a lot of fond memories."
2776,41,161,648000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, look at the time. Almost midnight."
2777,41,162,651000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Do you have any yearbooks?
2778,41,163,653000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, that's it. You've seen everything."
2779,41,164,655000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"So uh, Milhouse, know any knock-knock jokes?"
2780,41,165,659000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I want to go home.
2781,41,166,661000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home."
2782,41,167,664000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Gladly.
2783,41,168,669000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Wow. The Concert For Bangladesh.
2784,41,169,674000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Goodnight, Krusty. Sorry about your dad."
2785,41,170,677000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Don't worry about me, I'm a survivor."
2786,41,171,680000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Hey, did I leave my keys inside?"

2800,41,183,725000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Rabbi Krustofsky's Bedroom,"What's this? I hear a phone ring and all of a sudden there's nothing. I'm listening and there's no talking. Hello. Mister, who are you? Why would they call ya if they don't want to talk to ya."
2803,41,186,757000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Didn't Itchy Jr. look happy playing with his father? And didn't Scratchy Jr. look happy playing with his dad until they got run over by a thresher? Wasn't that a beautiful cartoon? For the love of God, cut to a commercial."
2804,41,187,774000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Poor Krusty.
2805,41,188,775000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,A man who envies our family is a man who needs help.
2806,41,189,780000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,We've got to do something.
2807,41,190,781000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Let's move.
2809,41,192,784000,Bart Simpson,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,"Reverend Lovejoy, we need you to help us find a rabbi."

2811,41,194,795000,Lisa Simpson,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,"No, no. We're not converting, we just want to find a Rabbi Krustofsky."
2812,41,195,799000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,"Rabbi Krustofsky? Why, I do a radio call-in show with him every Sunday night."
2813,41,196,803000,Bart Simpson,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,Really?
2814,41,197,803000,Lisa Simpson,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,I didn't know that.
2815,41,198,805000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,"Gee, I mention it in my sermon every week."
2816,41,199,808000,Bart Simpson,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,"Oh, oh, that radio show."
2817,41,200,810000,Lisa Simpson,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,"Oh yeah, it's all the kids talk about on Monday at school."

2828,41,216,856000,D.J.,Radio Station,"And in order to keep our broadcasting license, we devote Sunday night dead time to public service shows of limited appeal."
2829,41,217,863000,D.J.,Radio Station,"In that spirit, we bring you ""Gabbin' about God,"" sponsored by Ace Religion Supply where they say: ""If we don't got it, it ain't holy."""
2830,41,218,863000,D.J.,Radio Station,"With us tonight, once again, our very own three wise men: Reverend Timothy Lovejoy, Monsignor Kenneth Daley, and Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky."

2832,41,220,883000,Caller,Radio Station,"Yes, hi, with all the suffering and injustice in the world, do you ever wonder if God really exists?"

2835,41,223,889000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Radio Station,Not at all.
2836,41,224,890000,D.J.,Radio Station,Great. Good conversation there. Our next call now is for the good Rabbi.
2837,41,225,894000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Radio Station,"Hello? Anybody there? I hear breathing but I don't hear talking. What's going on here? Hello, mister. Hello... hello."
2838,41,226,903000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Radio Station,Some people got nothing to do but call people and hang up. There's all kinds of meshugoyim in the world.
2841,41,229,909000,D.J.,Radio Station,"Okay, let's clear the board. Our next caller is a young boy from right here in Springfield."
2842,41,230,912000,Bart Simpson,Radio Station,"Hello, my name's Dimitri. I'm a first time caller, long time listener."
2844,41,232,916000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"My question is, ""If a son defies his father, and chooses a career that makes millions of children happy, shouldn't the father forgive the son?"""
2846,41,234,924000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Radio Station,I think so.
2847,41,235,925000,MONSIGNOR DALEY,Radio Station,"Yes, of course."
2848,41,236,926000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Radio Station,No way. Absolutely not. Never! Never! Who screens these calls? Who's in charge here? There's nobody in charge. They leave a building without people watching it and anybody who wants can call any stupid person they please...
2850,41,238,933000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Lis. I've got a plan that can't fail."
2852,41,240,939000,Bart Simpson,YIDDLE'S SHOP,"Yiddle my man, you're a genius."

2855,41,243,943000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Park,"Oh, the best charity is to give and not let other people know."
2856,41,244,948000,Rabbi #2,Park,But what if your example encourages others to give?
2857,41,245,952000,Bart Simpson,Park,"Speaking of charity, Rabbi Krustofsky, don't you think it's time you forgave your son?"
2858,41,246,957000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Park,"Don't you understand that my boy broke my heart? He turned his back on our traditions and our faith, and on me. Get out of here you little pisher!"
2860,41,248,965000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oy, this guy's tough."
2861,41,249,967000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, we're gonna have to out smart him."
2862,41,250,969000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't know, he's pretty sharp. He saw right through this disguise."
2864,41,252,972000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Temple,"What? Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize winning Jewish novelist. He wants to have lunch with me? Ah ah, It's a date! Izzy's Deli, one o'clock, I'll be there."

2873,41,261,1004000,Waitress,Izzy's Deli,And for you sir?
2874,41,262,1006000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Izzy's Deli,"Oh, let's see. I want a nice sandwich, but the Joey Bishop, ugh, too fatty... the Jackie Mason, I don't know, sauerkraut makes me gassy. The Bruce Willis, I don't even like his work... What is this?... Krusty the Clown!?"
2875,41,263,1016000,Waitress,Izzy's Deli,"That's ham, sausage and bacon with a smidge of mayo..."
2876,41,264,1019000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Izzy's Deli,What?
2877,41,265,1020000,Waitress,Izzy's Deli,... on white bread.
2878,41,266,1021000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Izzy's Deli,"Listen, you tell Mr. Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize winning Jewish novelist, that I lost my appetite."
2879,41,267,1032000,Krusty the Clown,Izzy's Deli,"Uh, could you direct me to President Francois Mitterrand's table?"
2880,41,268,1035000,Waitress,Izzy's Deli,You think you're funny?
2881,41,269,1037000,Krusty the Clown,Izzy's Deli,Fifty million Frenchmen can't be wrong.
2884,41,271,1041000,Lisa Simpson,Izzy's Deli,"Bart, we've been going about this all wrong. What's the one thing rabbis prize above everything else?"
2885,41,272,1047000,Bart Simpson,Izzy's Deli,Those stupid hats?
2886,41,273,1048000,Lisa Simpson,Izzy's Deli,No Bart. Knowledge.
2888,41,275,1051000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Library,We're gonna hit him where it hurts. Right in the Judaica.
2889,41,276,1062000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Library,"Ahhh, Noah, Noah, save us, save us... No!!"
2890,41,277,1062000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Library,This looks good Bart. Take it to him.
2892,41,279,1071000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,TEMPLE HALLWAY,You I told to go away.
2893,41,280,1072000,Bart Simpson,TEMPLE HALLWAY,"But... but... but, but Rabbi, does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud... And I quote, ""A child should be pushed aside with the left hand, and drawn closer with the right."""
2894,41,281,1081000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,TEMPLE HALLWAY,Yes.
2895,41,282,1082000,Bart Simpson,TEMPLE HALLWAY,Then doesn't your religion command you to make up with Krusty?
2896,41,283,1085000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,TEMPLE HALLWAY,"But in Exodus, the fifth commandment says, ""Honor thy Father and thy Mother."" End of story."
2898,41,285,1093000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Library,"Oh, it's hopeless."
2899,41,286,1094000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Library,Not quite. I got some dynamite stuff from Rabbi Simon ben Eleazar.
2901,41,288,1100000,Bart Simpson,STEAMBATH,At all times let a man be supple as a reed and not rigid as a cedar.
2902,41,289,1100000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,STEAMBATH,"But, my short learned friend, the Book of Joshua says, ""You shall meditate on the Torah all day and all night."""
2905,41,292,1121000,Bart Simpson,Gammill's Home,"Is it not written in the Talmud, ""Who will bring redemption? The jesters."""
2906,41,293,1125000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Gammill's Home,"Sorry my friend, I'm still not convinced. And this is hardly the time or place to discuss it."
2908,41,295,1134000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Library,"Here you go, Bart. It's a long shot, but, that's all I can do without learning ancient Hebrew."
2909,41,296,1141000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Library,Bart! I am not gonna learn ancient Hebrew.
2915,41,298,1145000,Bart Simpson,Park,"Rabbi, did not a great man say, and I quote, ""The Jews are a swinging bunch of people. I mean, I've heard of persecution, but what they went through is ridiculous! But the great thing is after thousands of years of waiting and holding on and fighting, they finally made it."" End quote."
2916,41,299,1164000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Park,"Ohh, I never heard the plight of my people phrased so eloquently. Who said that, Rabbi Hillel?"
2917,41,300,1169000,Bart Simpson,Park,Nope.
2918,41,301,1170000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Park,It was Judah the Pious?

2923,41,306,1174000,Bart Simpson,Park,"I'm afraid not, Rabbi. It's from ""Yes, I Can"" by Sammy Davis Jr. An entertainer like your son."
2924,41,307,1181000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Park,The candy man?
2925,41,308,1183000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Park,"If a performer can think that way, maybe I'm completely upside-down on this whole problem. All the years of joy that I've lost. Why? Because of my stubborn ways."
2926,41,309,1194000,Lisa Simpson,Park,"There, there, Rabbi. It's not too late."
2928,41,311,1204000,Krusty the Clown,KRUSTY SET,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, kids... Today's show is gonna be the funniest, sidesplitin'est, cavalcade of... ah the hell with it. Roll the cartoon."

2939,41,322,1242000,Krusty the Clown,KRUSTY SET,"Boys and girls, I'd like to be serious for a moment if I may. Spotlight, please."
2940,41,323,1247000,Krusty the Clown,KRUSTY SET,I just wanted... I just wanted... Come on guys. I'm not doing the spotlight bit.
2941,41,324,1253000,Krusty the Clown,KRUSTY SET,"Let's have a warm Krusty welcome for my estranged father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky."
