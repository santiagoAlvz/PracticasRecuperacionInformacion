112748,434,216,983000,Homer Simpson,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S PUB,"Well, we need help. Someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm."
112750,434,218,994000,Grampa Simpson,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S,"Moe, you shipped yourself here?"
112751,434,219,997000,Moe Szyslak,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S,"No, it's how you fly coach on Delta now."
112752,434,220,999000,Homer Simpson,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S,"Moe, something terrible has happened! The Irish have become hardworking and sober!"
112753,434,221,1003000,Moe Szyslak,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S,"Here's how you turn this place around. I let people do things in my bar they can't do nowhere else. You wanna drink on a Sunday morning? No problem. You wanna slow-dance with a goat? I'll be doin' a lot of things, but judgin' ain't one of 'em."
112754,434,222,1017000,Grampa Simpson,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S,Are you sayin' we should break the law?
112755,434,223,1020000,Moe Szyslak,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S,The law? That jerk?
112757,434,225,1024000,Homer Simpson,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S PUB,"So, what can't people do in modern Ireland?"
112759,434,227,1031000,Moe Szyslak,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S PUB,"Well, they're certainly liberal when it comes to romance."
112731,434,228,1037000,Irish Maitre D',TOM O'FLANAGAN'S PUB,"Sorry, but smokin' in pubs ain't part of the new Ireland. Also, you can't text while driving."
112761,434,229,1041000,Irish Guy,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S PUB,What has happened to the ways of old?
112762,434,230,1044000,Homer Simpson,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S PUB,People can't smoke indoors in Ireland!
112763,434,231,1048000,Moe Szyslak,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S PUB,"Then you let 'em. Open a ""smoke-easy."""
112764,434,232,1050000,Grampa Simpson,TOM O'FLANAGAN'S PUB,"Gentlemen, we have a lot of work to do!"
112766,434,234,1069000,Homer Simpson,Simpson & Son Pub,"Moe, you were right!"
112767,434,235,1071000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson & Son Pub,"Thanks. Now I'm gonna go look for my Grandfather, based on this childhood photo."
112768,434,236,1076000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson & Son Pub,All I remember about him is he was part of a complete breakfast.
112769,434,237,1081000,Old Irishman,Simpson & Son Pub,"The day they banned smoking from pubs, a little bit of Ireland died, but thanks to these two sweet Yanks , our lungs are black with joy! To Homer and his Da!"
112770,434,238,1093000,Smokers,Simpson & Son Pub,Homer and his Da!
112771,434,239,1095000,Homer Simpson,Simpson & Son Pub,"Well, ""Da,"" it looks like all your ""der"" have come ""ter."""
112772,434,240,1095000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson & Son Pub,"Aw, my son's first stroke."
112774,434,242,1108000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson & Son Pub,Look at all this euro dough! These shamrocks sure love their tobaccy.
112775,434,243,1112000,Irish Cop,Simpson & Son Pub,"So, it's a smoke-easy you're runnin' then?"
112776,434,244,1117000,2nd Irish Cop,Simpson & Son Pub,"So, it's escapin' you're thinkin' of, then?"
112777,434,245,1120000,Homer Simpson,Simpson & Son Pub,I can't tell if those are questions or statements.
112778,434,246,1122000,Irish Cop,Simpson & Son Pub,"So, it's our syntax you're criticizing then? Close 'er down, boys!"
112780,434,248,1141000,2nd Irish Cop,Simpson & Son Pub,"Throw 'em in the paddy wagon! I mean the ""us"" wagon."
112783,434,251,1157000,Grampa Simpson,Cell,"Son, this was all my fault. You were just trying to make an old man happy."
112784,434,252,1162000,Homer Simpson,Cell,"Don't worry, Dad. We'll get out. America is the New York Yankees of countries -- powerful and respected until the year two thousand."
112785,434,253,1170000,Grampa Simpson,Cell,"Oh son, you know how I love a good analogy."
112786,434,254,1175000,Homer Simpson,Cell,It was apt.
112788,434,256,1177000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Let me say I've always admired the Irish. Knute Rockne, Larry Bird, and especially Mr. Potato Head."
112789,434,257,1184000,Irish Judge,Courtroom,Go on.
112791,434,258,1186000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"But I ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on Expectant Mothers drink free night?"
112792,434,259,1200000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"So I hope you'll forgive two well-meaning Americans for trying to take Ireland back to the good old days of ""Angela's Ashes."" Thank you."
112793,434,260,1211000,Irish Judge,Courtroom,That was absolutely terrible.
112794,434,261,1213000,Irish Judge,Courtroom,"But fortunately for you, the punishment for your offense is deportation and a small fine."
112795,434,262,1219000,Grampa Simpson,Courtroom,"Thank you, Your Honor. And may I say: I'm glad I could see Ireland again, even if it isn't what I remembered."
112796,434,263,1226000,Irish Judge,Courtroom,"It got a lot nicer since we sent all our incompetent halfwits to America, where you, for some reason, made them police officers."
112797,434,264,1233000,Chief Wiggum,Courtroom,"Top of the morning to ya! Chief Clancy Wiggum here to pick up the Simpsons, and take them back to the--"
112798,434,265,1235000,Chief Wiggum,Courtroom,"Jeez, that smarts. Better put a little ""Ouchie"" spray on it."
112799,434,266,1248000,Chief Wiggum,Courtroom,"Oh, boy. I better call for some backup."
112800,434,267,1252000,Chief Wiggum,Courtroom,This is unit one-niner-ninerrrr .
