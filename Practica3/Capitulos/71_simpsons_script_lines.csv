11380,71,5,115000,Carl Carlson,Other Part of Nuclear Plant,I hear they dump them in an abandoned chalk mine and cover 'em with cement.
11381,71,6,119000,Lenny Leonard,Other Part of Nuclear Plant,I hear they're sending 'em to one of those southern states where the governor's a crook.
11382,71,7,123000,Carl Carlson,Other Part of Nuclear Plant,Either way I'm sleepin' good tonight!
11383,71,8,134000,Waylon Smithers,Other Part of Nuclear Plant,"Well, sir, where shall we dump this batch -- the playground?"

11388,71,13,164000,Agent,Springfield Park,"Agent Malone, Environmental Protection Agency. Some Boy Scouts stumbled on your little game of ""hide the ooze."""
11390,71,15,168000,Judge Snyder,Springfield County Court House,"Mr. Burns, in light of your unbelievable contempt for human life, this court fines you three million dollars."
11391,71,16,183000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield County Court House,"Smithers, my wallet's in my right front pocket."

11404,71,28,259000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of."
11405,71,29,263000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Like a giant billboard that says, ""No fat chicks""?"
11406,71,30,266000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No.

11418,71,42,300000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Of course. How silly of me.
11419,71,43,303000,Maude Flanders,Springfield Town Hall,"Excuse me, we could use the money to hire firemen to finally put out that blaze on the east side of town."
11420,71,44,309000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Bo-ring!
11421,71,45,310000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Town Hall,"Hello. My name is Mr. Snrub, and I come from... eh, someplace far away. Yes, that will do. Anyway, I-I say we invest that money back in the nuclear plant."
11422,71,46,323000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Town Hall,I like the way Snrub thinks.
11423,71,47,335000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Springfield Town Hall,"Pardon me, but I would like to see this money spent on more police officers. I have been shot eight times this year, and as a result I almost missed work."

11425,71,49,346000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,My name is Marge Simpson and I have an idea. It may sound a little boring at first...
11426,71,50,352000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Chat away. I'll just amuse myself with some pornographic playing cards.
11427,71,51,358000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Well surely you've all noticed the terrible condition Main Street is in.
11428,71,52,365000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight.
11429,71,53,373000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Woo-hoo, look at that pavement fly!"
11430,71,54,376000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,And those potholes are becoming a real nuisance.
11431,71,55,385000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Now hold on just one minute. Sure, we could fix up Main Street. We could put all our eggs in one basket..."
11432,71,56,395000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Shut up! I wasn't done yet. I'm just saying we could blow all our money on a stupid little street, but.."
11433,71,57,407000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"I ain't fer it, I'm agin' it."

11435,71,59,413000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"All those in favor of Grampa Simpsons' plan for re-building Main Street, please..."
11436,71,60,419000,LANLEY,Springfield Town Hall,"You know, a town with money's a little like the mule with a spinning wheel. No one knows how he got it and danged if he knows how to use it!"
11437,71,61,429000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Heh-heh... mule.
11438,71,62,431000,LANLEY,Springfield Town Hall,"The name's Lanley. Lyle Lanley. And I come before you good people tonight with an idea. Probably the greatest... Ah, it's not for you. It's more of a ""Shelbyville"" idea."
11439,71,63,444000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Now wait just a minute. We're twice as smart as the people of Shelbyville. Just tell us your idea and we'll vote for it.
11440,71,64,450000,LANLEY,Springfield Town Hall,All right. I tell you what I'll do. I'll show you my idea.
11441,71,65,455000,LANLEY,Springfield Town Hall,I give you the Springfield Monorail!
11442,71,66,461000,LANLEY,Springfield Town Hall,"I've sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville, and North Haverbrook and, by gum, it put them on the map!"
11443,71,67,467000,LANLEY,Springfield Town Hall,"Well, sir, there's nothing on earth like a genuine, bona-fide, electrified, six-car monorail. What'd I say?"
11444,71,68,473000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Town Hall,Monorail.
11445,71,69,474000,LANLEY,Springfield Town Hall,What's it called?

11448,71,72,480000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Town Hall,I hear those things are awfully loud.
11449,71,73,483000,LANLEY,Springfield Town Hall,It glides as softly as a cloud.
11450,71,74,485000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Springfield Town Hall,Is there a chance the track could bend?
11451,71,75,487000,LANLEY,Springfield Town Hall,"Not on your life, my Hindu friend."
11452,71,76,489000,Barney Gumble,Springfield Town Hall,What about us brain-dead slobs?
11453,71,77,491000,LANLEY,Springfield Town Hall,You'll be given cushy jobs.
11454,71,78,493000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Were you sent here by the devil?
11455,71,79,495000,LANLEY,Springfield Town Hall,"No, good sir, I'm on the level."
11456,71,80,497000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Hall,The ring came off my pudding can!

11470,71,94,534000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,I still think we should have spent the money to fix Main Street.
11471,71,95,537000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Well, you should have written a song like that guy."
11474,71,98,541000,Miss Hoover,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"Thank you for coming, Mr. Lanley. I'm Miss Hoover."
11475,71,99,544000,LANLEY,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"""Miss"" Hoover? That is hard to believe."
11476,71,100,547000,Miss Hoover,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"Oh, you."
11477,71,101,548000,LANLEY,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"Now, I'm here to answer any questions you children may have about the monorail."
11478,71,102,553000,Ralph Wiggum,Miss Hoover's Classroom,Can it outrun The Flash?

11481,71,105,558000,LANLEY,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"Eh, sure, why not? Hello, little girl, wondering if your dolly can ride the monorail for free?"
11482,71,106,564000,Lisa Simpson,Miss Hoover's Classroom,Hardly. I'd like you to explain why we should build a mass transit system in a small town with a centralized population.
11483,71,107,572000,LANLEY,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"Ha, ha. Young lady, that's the most intelligent question I've ever been asked."
11484,71,108,575000,Lisa Simpson,Miss Hoover's Classroom,Really?
11486,71,109,576000,LANLEY,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"Oh, I could give you an answer, but the only ones who'd understand it would be you and me... And that includes your teacher."
11488,71,111,585000,LANLEY,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"Next question -- You there, eating the paste."
11490,71,113,588000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"Coming soon, it's ""Truckosaurus, the Movie"" starring Marlon Brando as the voice of John Truckosaurus."

11526,71,148,694000,Barney Gumble,Monorail Construction Site,I hate that sound.
11528,71,150,697000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"According to this book, the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour. What if something goes wrong?"
11529,71,151,702000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""What if?"" What if I'm taking a shower and I slip on a bar of soap? Oh, my God, I'd be killed!"
11530,71,152,708000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe.
11531,71,153,712000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We monorail conductors are a crazy breed. Half in love with death -- gobbling up danger like ordinary men eat peanuts... Am I turning you on?
11532,71,154,721000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
11533,71,155,722000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What if I undo this button?
11534,71,156,723000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Goodnight, Homer."
11535,71,157,725000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What if I talk like this?
11536,71,158,727000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What if I SING TO YOU? I GAVE MY LOVE A CHICKEN THAT HAD NO BONE/ Mmmm chicken.
11538,71,160,739000,LANLEY,Monorail Conductor Class,"...so then, ""mono"" means ""one"" and ""rail"" means ""rail."" And that concludes our intensive three-week course."
11539,71,161,748000,Otto Mann,Monorail Conductor Class,"Hey, wait, man. Who gets to be conductor?"
11540,71,162,751000,LANLEY,Monorail Conductor Class,"Oh, right, that. Well, I've been monitoring your progress closely..."
11541,71,163,752000,LANLEY,Monorail Conductor Class,But this gentleman here clearly stands out above the rest.

11549,71,171,781000,Marge Simpson,Monorail Cockpit,"Homer, there's a family of opossums in here!"
11550,71,172,784000,Homer Simpson,Monorail Cockpit,I call the big one Bitey.
11551,71,173,786000,Marge Simpson,Monorail Cockpit,I'm going to see Mr. Lanley.

11557,71,179,811000,LANLEY,Office,Good.
11558,71,180,813000,Marge Simpson,Office,"Well, bye."
11559,71,181,814000,LANLEY,Office,I don't know why I leave this lying around.
11561,71,183,817000,LANLEY,North Haverbrook,"I've sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville and North Haverbrook."
11562,71,184,822000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,North Haverbrook,Is there a chance the track could bend?
11563,71,185,825000,Homer Simpson,North Haverbrook,I call the big one Bitey.

11566,71,188,834000,Homer Simpson,North Haverbrook,I call the big one Bitey.
11568,71,190,852000,Waitress,CAFE,Go away! There ain't no monorail and there never was!
11569,71,191,863000,Sebastian Kobb,CAFE,"Excuse me, Miss, you asked about the monorail?"
11570,71,192,866000,Marge Simpson,CAFE,Who are you?
11571,71,193,867000,Sebastian Kobb,CAFE,My name is Sebastian Kobb. Lanley hired me to build his monorail. He cut corners everywhere... bad wiring... faulty brakes... and the celebrity on the maiden voyage was Gallagher.
11572,71,194,879000,Sebastian Kobb,CAFE,This is all that's left of one of the crappiest trains ever built.
11573,71,195,885000,Marge Simpson,CAFE,"Mr. Kobb, what can we do?"
11574,71,196,888000,Sebastian Kobb,CAFE,You just better have a damn good conductor.

11591,71,212,952000,NIMOY,Monorail Dais,I'd say this vessel could do at least warp five.
11592,71,213,958000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Monorail Dais,"And let me say, ""May the force be with you."""
11593,71,214,958000,NIMOY,Monorail Dais,Do you even know who I am?
11594,71,215,964000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Monorail Dais,I think I do. Weren't you one of the Little Rascals?
11596,71,217,970000,Lisa Simpson,Main Street,Mr. Lanley! Aren't you gonna ride the monorail?
11597,71,218,974000,LANLEY,Main Street,"Little lady, I'd love to. But I have to catch a plane."
11598,71,219,976000,Lisa Simpson,Main Street,But the ride only takes a minute.
11599,71,220,978000,LANLEY,Main Street,"Yeah, well my plane leaves in less than one minute."
11600,71,221,987000,LANLEY,Main Street,His car SCREECHES off.
11603,71,224,987000,Homer Simpson,Cockpit,All aboard!
11606,71,227,1003000,Marge Simpson,MONORAIL PLATFORM,We're too late!
11607,71,228,1004000,Sebastian Kobb,MONORAIL PLATFORM,I shouldn't have stopped for that haircut. Sorry.
11609,71,230,1016000,NIMOY,Monorail Cabin,"Actually, you see the doors on Star Trek were not mechanical. We had a stagehand on either side who would pull the door open when he saw you approach."
11610,71,231,1024000,Man,Monorail Cabin,Uh-huh.
11612,71,233,1025000,Homer Simpson,Monorail Cockpit,"Stick your head out the window, boy. It's the greatest!"

11620,71,241,1060000,Marge Simpson,MONORAIL PLATFORM,How fast are they going?
11622,71,243,1064000,Sebastian Kobb,MONORAIL PLATFORM,"Well, judging by your husband's cowardly scream, 180 miles an hour."
11625,71,246,1064000,Chief Wiggum,COMMAND CENTER,Ahhh. It's making me dizzy. I'm gonna take a nap.
11626,71,247,1076000,Mayor Joe Quimby,COMMAND CENTER,"All right, I'm in charge here."
11627,71,248,1077000,Chief Wiggum,COMMAND CENTER,"Ah, run along, Quimby. I think they're dedicating a phone booth somewhere."
11628,71,249,1081000,Mayor Joe Quimby,COMMAND CENTER,"Watch it, you talking tub of donut batter."
11629,71,250,1083000,Chief Wiggum,COMMAND CENTER,"Hey, I got pictures of you, Quimby!"
11630,71,251,1085000,Mayor Joe Quimby,COMMAND CENTER,"You don't scare me. That could be anyone's ass. Now, beat it. I'm calling the shots."
11631,71,252,1090000,Chief Wiggum,COMMAND CENTER,"I think that sash is cutting off the air to your brain. The town charter says in an emergency, I run the show."
11632,71,253,1097000,Mayor Joe Quimby,COMMAND CENTER,"Well, we'll just see about that. Let's go to town hall."
11633,71,254,1099000,Chief Wiggum,COMMAND CENTER,"Fine. Should we take one car, or should I follow you?"
11635,71,256,1105000,Chief Wiggum,HALL OF RECORDS,"Hey, according to the charter, as Chief Constable I'm supposed to get a pig every month ""... and two comely lasses of virtue true."""
11636,71,257,1109000,Mayor Joe Quimby,HALL OF RECORDS,Keep the pig. How many broads do I get?
11637,71,258,1115000,Chief Wiggum,HALL OF RECORDS,"Hey. Hey, hey, let go! You're rippin' it."
11638,71,259,1117000,Mayor Joe Quimby,HALL OF RECORDS,"No, you are."
11639,71,260,1118000,Chief Wiggum,HALL OF RECORDS,"No, you are."
11640,71,261,1119000,Mayor Joe Quimby,HALL OF RECORDS,"Let go, that's the charter."
11642,71,263,1121000,Engineer #1,COMMAND CENTER,"Wait a minute, we can just shut off the power!"
11643,71,264,1125000,Engineer #2,COMMAND CENTER,"No such luck, it's solar powered."
11644,71,265,1126000,Engineer #1,COMMAND CENTER,"""Solar"" power. When will people learn?"
11647,71,268,1132000,NIMOY,Monorail,A solar eclipse. The cosmic ballet goes on.
11648,71,269,1136000,Man,Monorail,Does anyone wanna switch seats?
11649,71,270,1147000,Homer Simpson,Monorail,I did it!

11654,71,276,1161000,LANLEY,Airplane,"North Haverbrook? Where have I heard that name before? Oh, no. Oh, no!"
11656,71,278,1166000,Haverbrook Man,North Haverbrook,There he is! Seat 3-F.
11659,71,281,1176000,Krusty the Clown,Monorail Cabin,Krusty wants out!
11660,71,282,1181000,NIMOY,Monorail Cabin,No. The world needs laughter.
11662,71,284,1184000,Homer Simpson,Monorail Cockpit,"Are we gonna die, son?"
11663,71,285,1185000,Bart Simpson,Monorail Cockpit,"Yeah, but at least we'll take a lot of innocent people with us."
11664,71,286,1189000,Marge Simpson,Monorail Cockpit,Homer? Homer?
11665,71,287,1191000,Homer Simpson,Monorail Cockpit,Y'ello.
11667,71,289,1191000,Marge Simpson,COMMAND CENTER,"Homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you."
11668,71,290,1195000,Homer Simpson,COMMAND CENTER,Batman?
11669,71,291,1195000,Marge Simpson,COMMAND CENTER,"No, he's a scientist."
11670,71,292,1197000,Homer Simpson,COMMAND CENTER,Batman's a scientist.
11671,71,293,1198000,Marge Simpson,COMMAND CENTER,It's not Batman!
11672,71,294,1199000,Sebastian Kobb,COMMAND CENTER,I think I have a way to stop the train. You need to find an anchor of some sort.
11674,71,296,1209000,Bart Anchor,Cockpit,"Think harder, Homer."
11676,71,298,1218000,Homer Simpson,Cabin,I'll take that.
11678,71,300,1230000,Bart Simpson,Cockpit,Uh... Dad?
11681,71,303,1248000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Doctors Office,Now separating Siamese Twins is a long and costly procedure.
11683,71,305,1259000,Captain Horatio McCallister,ANCHOR STORE,Arr. Ye call that an anchor?
11686,71,308,1279000,Homer Simpson,Monorail Cockpit,Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?
11687,71,309,1283000,Bart Simpson,Monorail Cockpit,"Dad, you're a hero!"
11688,71,310,1285000,Homer Simpson,Monorail Cockpit,"Yes, son. I'm the best mono-thingy guy there ever was."
11690,71,312,1291000,NIMOY,MONORAIL PLATFORM,"Well, my work is done here."
11691,71,313,1293000,Barney Gumble,MONORAIL PLATFORM,"Whadaya mean, your work is done? You didn't do anything."
11692,71,314,1298000,NIMOY,MONORAIL PLATFORM,Didn't I?
11694,71,316,1304000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,And that was the only folly the people of Springfield ever embarked upon -- except for the Popsicle stick skyscraper... and the fifty foot magnifying glass... and that escalator to nowhere.
