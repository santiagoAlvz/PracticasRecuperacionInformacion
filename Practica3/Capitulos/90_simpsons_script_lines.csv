16872,90,46,260000,Agent #1,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Look, Mr. Burns. We want to see some changes. For starters, you can reverse your sexist employment policies and hire at least one woman."

16938,90,113,500000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"""Your infatuation is based on a physical attraction. Talk to the woman, and you'll realize you have nothing in common."""
16939,90,114,508000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Barney. That is so insightful. How did you come up with that?
16940,90,115,512000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,It was on one of these bar napkins.
