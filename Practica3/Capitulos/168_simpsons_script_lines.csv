37560,168,1,36000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, everybody got their ticket? Then get ready for today's Super-Barto jackpot drawing!"
37561,168,2,45000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Come on, cantaloupe!"
37562,168,3,47000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Aannd 'round and 'round she -- uh-oh.
37565,168,6,61000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No refunds! Force majeure! Read the back of your ticket!
37566,168,7,66000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nine hundred dollars? Well, we'll have to dip into the retirement fund again."
37568,168,9,83000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, nuts. Hel-lo? China? Little help?"
37569,168,10,89000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I never thought it would come to this, but I guess we'll have to sell Grandma's Civil War doll."
37570,168,11,95000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, Mom, are you sure you want to sell a family heirloom to pay the gas bill? I mean, what would your Grandma say?"
37571,168,12,102000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm, dry underwear."
37572,168,13,108000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That is so true.
37575,168,16,115000,Seymour Skinner,Cockamamie's,"Hmmm. These campaign buttons are all partisan. Don't you have any neutral ones? ""May The Better Man Win?""... ""Let's Have a Good, Clean Election?"" That sort of thing?"
37576,168,17,125000,Hip Saleswoman,Cockamamie's,"Uh, no, but we do have some old shirt buttons. They're kind of kooky and fun."
37577,168,18,129000,Seymour Skinner,Cockamamie's,"Missy, you just talked yourself right out of a sale."
37578,168,19,135000,Bart Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Hey, Lis, check it out! Pogo Stilts! These were banned in all 50 states!"
37579,168,20,141000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,What happened?
37580,168,21,145000,Lisa Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Wow! An actual robot from the movie ""Clank! Clank! You're Dead!"""
37581,168,22,145000,Lisa Simpson,Cockamamie's,Ech! Think of how awful it would be for the poor midget inside...
37582,168,23,153000,Bart Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Aw, boo hoo. That's what they get paid for."
37583,168,24,162000,Marge Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Oh, Homer, look! Look! A TV Guide owned by Jackie O.!"
37584,168,25,166000,John,Cockamamie's,"Oh, you should see the crossword puzzle! She thought that ""Mindy"" lived with ""Mark!"""
37585,168,26,168000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,Give her a break! Her husband was killed!
37586,168,27,173000,John,Cockamamie's,"Oh, I know! Wasn't that awful? Hi, I'm John. Can I help you with anything?"
37587,168,28,176000,Marge Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Yes, I have something that I'd like to sell."
37588,168,29,179000,John,Cockamamie's,Please tell me it's your hair.
37589,168,30,182000,Marge Simpson,Cockamamie's,Nooo. It's an heirloom my grandmother passed down to me -- a very rare old figurine from the Civil War.
37590,168,31,189000,Lisa Simpson,Cockamamie's,Please don't construe our ownership of this as an endorsement of slavery.
37591,168,32,192000,John,Cockamamie's,"Hmm. Well, see... he--here's the thing on this. It's a Johnny Reb bottle, early 1970's. One of the J&R Whiskey ""Liquor Lads."" Two books of Green Stamps, if I'm not mistaken."
37592,168,33,203000,Marge Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. No. It's a very, very old figurine."
37593,168,34,209000,John,Cockamamie's,"No, it's-- it's a liquor bottle. See?"
37594,168,35,218000,John,Cockamamie's,Ahhh. That'll make your Bull Run.
37595,168,36,220000,Marge Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Well, I guess it'll always be a monument to Grandma's secret drinking problem..."
37597,168,37,225000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, but look at what you're selling!"
37598,168,38,230000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,Fifty bucks for a toy? No kid is worth that.
37599,168,39,233000,John,Cockamamie's,"Oh, but this is the Rex Mars Atomic Discombobulator! Don't you just love the graphics on this box?"
37600,168,40,239000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,"No. How can you love a box, or a toy, or graphics? You're a grown man."
37601,168,41,245000,John,Cockamamie's,It's camp! The tragically ludicrous? The ludicrously tragic?
37602,168,42,251000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Oh, yeah. Like when a clown dies."
37603,168,43,254000,John,Cockamamie's,"Well, sort of... But I mean more like inflatable furniture or ""Last Supper"" TV trays or even this bowling shirt. Can you believe someone gave this to Goodwill?"
37604,168,44,266000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,And that kind of stuff is worth money?
37605,168,45,268000,John,Cockamamie's,Boy howdy!
37606,168,46,269000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Man, you should come over to our place. It's full of valuable, worthless crap!"
37607,168,47,273000,John,Cockamamie's,"Well, if you're inviting me over --"
37608,168,48,275000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,"I practically insist. Shall we say, 5 o'clock? The snacking hour?"
37609,168,49,279000,John,Cockamamie's,My heart is palpitating.
37611,168,51,283000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,...pimento nose... and voila! Mommy's patented Happy-Cracker Snack Platter!
37612,168,52,296000,John,Simpson Home,"Ding Dong! Classic! I mean -- that says it all, doesn't it?"
37613,168,53,300000,John,Simpson Home,"Oh, man, you weren't kiddin' about this place! Well, I just love it!"
37614,168,54,305000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Do I know you?
37615,168,55,306000,John,Simpson Home,"Oh! The color scheme. And the rabbit ears. And the two point three children... I mean, where's the Hi-C?"
37616,168,56,313000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hi-C! And Fluffernutters!
37617,168,57,314000,John,Simpson Home,"Oh, and pearls on a little girl? It's a fairy tale!"
37618,168,58,321000,John,Simpson Home,"Oh, I've got the exact same curtains, only in my bathroom. Didn't you just die when you found these?"
37619,168,59,327000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Not really. They just had corn on them. Kitchen -- corn.
37620,168,60,334000,John,Simpson Home,Oh!...
37621,168,61,338000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow! Why you little...
37622,168,62,340000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad! Dad! Company! Company!
37623,168,63,344000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh. I'll just be another minute, John. Have a seat."
37625,168,65,356000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, do those records have ""camp value?"""
37626,168,66,358000,John,Simpson Home,"Everything here does. You yourself are worth a bundle, Homer. Why, I could wrap a bow around you and slap on a price tag!"
37627,168,67,368000,John,Simpson Home,"C'mon, Homer! Join the party!"
37628,168,68,372000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, John likes ""Itchy and Scratchy"" as much as we do -- maybe more!"
37629,168,69,376000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, and he collects toy robots!"
37630,168,70,378000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He is quite a charmer. Your father's certainly taken a shine to him...
37631,168,71,383000,John,Simpson Home,"Oof! Homer, you are the living end!"
37632,168,72,389000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That John is the greatest guy in the world. We've gotta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime.
37633,168,73,395000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mmm, I don't think he's married, Homer."
37634,168,74,397000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? Well, there's lots of foxy ladies out there..."
37635,168,75,404000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, didn't John seem a little... festive to you?"
37636,168,76,408000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Couldn't agree more. Happy as a clam.
37637,168,77,410000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He prefers the company of men!
37638,168,78,413000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who doesn't?
37639,168,79,414000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, listen carefully: John is a ho-mo--"
37640,168,80,419000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Right...
37641,168,81,421000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,... sexual.
37643,168,83,428000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! I danced with a Gay! Marge, Lisa, promise me you won't tell anyone. Promise me!"
37644,168,84,434000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're being ridiculous.
37645,168,85,436000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Am I, Marge? Am I? Think of the property values! Now we can never say only straight people have been in this house!"
37646,168,86,442000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm very sorry you feel that way. Because John invited us all out for a drive today, and we're going."
37647,168,87,448000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, not me. And not because John's gay, but because he's a sneak. He should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he's that way."
37648,168,88,458000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What on earth are you talking about?
37649,168,89,460000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know me, Marge: I like my beer cold, my TV loud, and my homosexuals fla-ming."
37650,168,90,473000,John,Simpson Home,Zzzzapp!
37652,168,92,479000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, at least come out and say hello."
37653,168,93,480000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No! No, no, no, no..."
37654,168,94,480000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Come on. You liked John this morning.
37655,168,95,484000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no! I'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!"
37656,168,96,489000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Dad, you are the living end."
37657,168,97,497000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, where'd that cool creepy Santa come from?"
37658,168,98,500000,John,Simpson Home,"Japan. Except over there, they call him ""Annual Gift-Man,"" and he lives on the moon!"
37659,168,99,510000,John,Simpson Home,"They DRIVE off. Homer, in the window, gawks at the scene."
37661,168,101,510000,John,DOWNTOWN STREETS,...And that's where Kent Brockman was caught cheating in the Springfield Marathon...
37663,168,103,515000,John,DOWNTOWN STREETS,...And there's where Lupe Velez bought the toilet she drowned in...
37666,168,106,521000,Bart Simpson,Sha-Boom Ka-Boom! Cafe,"That was a killer tour, man."
37667,168,107,524000,Lisa Simpson,Sha-Boom Ka-Boom! Cafe,I never realized how many celebrities humiliated themselves right in our own backyard!
37668,168,108,528000,John,Sha-Boom Ka-Boom! Cafe,"This is a sordid little burg, isn't it? Makes me sick in a wonderful, wonderful way."
37669,168,109,533000,Waylon Smithers,Sha-Boom Ka-Boom! Cafe,John!
37670,168,110,533000,John,Sha-Boom Ka-Boom! Cafe,Uh... Waylon! I'd like you to meet the Simpsons.
37671,168,111,538000,Waylon Smithers,Sha-Boom Ka-Boom! Cafe,"I know the Simpsons. So this is your ""sick mother?"""
37672,168,112,542000,Waylon Smithers,Sha-Boom Ka-Boom! Cafe,"Don't do this to me, Waylon!"
37674,168,114,550000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"How'd it go? Tell me everything that happened! He didn't give you Gay, did he? Did he?"
37675,168,115,554000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, geez Louise, you don't even know what you're worried about anymore. John's a witty, urbane person."
37676,168,116,561000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, and I'm not."
37677,168,117,562000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Dad, look what I got! Zzzapp!! Zzzapp! Zzzapp! Zzzapp!"
37678,168,118,575000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! Where'd you get that shirt?
37679,168,119,578000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'unno. Came outta the closet.
37680,168,120,580000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uhh... huh.
37681,168,121,583000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I hope you all saved room, because I made your favorite dessert: store-bought snack cakes! Both kinds!"
37683,168,123,602000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I can hear you chewing on your pillow. What's wrong?"
37685,168,125,606000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, the boy was wearing a Hawaiian shirt!"
37542,168,126,609000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,So?
37686,168,127,610000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"There's only two kinds of guys who wear those shirts -- gay guys, and big fat party-animals. And Bart doesn't look like a big fat party-animal to me."
37687,168,128,619000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So if you wore a Hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?"
37688,168,129,622000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Right. Thank you. I hope you realize this is all your fault. I mean, do you have to be so effeminate around the boy?"
37689,168,130,630000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I don't think there's a problem with Bart. But if there is, it's probably because you're not spending any time with him. Goodnight."
37690,168,131,645000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, boy! Come on! Today we're gonna--"
37691,168,132,652000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Gonna what, Homer?"
37692,168,133,654000,John,Simpson Home,"... And Helen Lovejoy -- sure she looks blonde, but I've heard cuffs and collar don't match, if you get my drift..."
37693,168,134,662000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't, but I loved hearing it!"
37694,168,135,665000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You! I should have known!
37695,168,136,667000,John,Simpson Home,"Well, good morning, Sunshine."
37696,168,137,669000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, John brought us cactus candy!"
37697,168,138,671000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, John, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all. Just stay the hell away from my family!"
37698,168,139,676000,John,Simpson Home,"Well, now you don't get any candy. No, that's cruel. Take a teensy piece."
37699,168,140,681000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
37700,168,141,682000,John,Simpson Home,"Homer, what have you got against gays?"
37701,168,142,684000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know. It's... it's not... usual! If there was a law, it would be against it!"
37702,168,143,689000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer, please. You're embarrassing yourself."
37703,168,144,692000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No I'm not, Marge! They're embarrassing me! They're embarrassing America! They turned the Navy into a floating joke! They ruined all our best names, like Bruce and Lance and Julian! Those were the toughest names we had, now they're just..."
37704,168,145,708000,John,Simpson Home,Queer?
37705,168,146,709000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah! And that's another thing! I resent ""you people"" using that word. That's our word for making fun of you. We need it! Well, I'm taking back our word and I'm taking back my son!"
37706,168,147,722000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer storms out.
37708,168,149,722000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Don't worry, boy. We're gonna set you straight. By tomorrow morning, you'll be a regular Burt Reynolds."
37709,168,150,728000,Bart Simpson,Car,"What are you talking about, Homer? Where are we going?"
37710,168,151,730000,Homer Simpson,Car,Just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places. Father and son.
148577,168,152,735000,Homer's Brain,Car,You're leaving the arm there too long! You wanna make it worse?!
148578,168,153,739000,Homer's Brain,Car,"No, no! He'll know you're on to him -- quick, shake his hand!"
37711,168,154,742000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Just remember, son, whatever happens --I'll always love you."
148579,168,155,747000,Homer's Brain,Car,As...? As...?!
37712,168,156,748000,Homer Simpson,Car,... as a father! A father!! A regular father!! Whooh!
37714,168,158,758000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD FREEWAY,What am I supposed to do here?
37715,168,159,759000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD FREEWAY,Nothing. Just sit. I'll be back.
37716,168,160,771000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD FREEWAY,Well it's been two hours. How do you feel?
37717,168,161,772000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD FREEWAY,I'unno. I kinda want a cigarette.
37718,168,162,775000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD FREEWAY,That's a good start. Let's get you a pack. What's your brand?
37719,168,163,779000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD FREEWAY,Anything slim!
37720,168,164,781000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD FREEWAY,"Okay, that didn't work. But I know something that will..."
37722,168,166,788000,Homer Simpson,Ajax Steel Mill,"Bart, I want you to shake hands with -- what's your name, fella?"
37723,168,167,791000,Foreman,Ajax Steel Mill,Roscoe.
37724,168,168,792000,Homer Simpson,Ajax Steel Mill,Roscoe here runs this mill. He's gonna show us around and let you get a first-hand look at real All-American Joes doin' what they do best.
37725,168,169,800000,Bart Simpson,Ajax Steel Mill,Why the hell would I want to see that?
37726,168,170,801000,Homer Simpson,Ajax Steel Mill,You'll thank me on your wedding night.
37727,168,171,810000,Foreman,Ajax Steel Mill,"Hey, listen up! I want all of youse to say hello to the Simpsons!"
37728,168,172,814000,100 Workers,Ajax Steel Mill,Hel-lo!!
37729,168,173,818000,Homer Simpson,Ajax Steel Mill,Has the whole world gone insane?
37730,168,174,820000,Worker,Ajax Steel Mill,"Stand still, there's a spark in your hair!"
37731,168,175,823000,Worker #2,Ajax Steel Mill,"Get it, get it, get it...!"
37732,168,176,826000,Buffed Worker,Ajax Steel Mill,"Hot stuff, comin' through!"
37734,168,178,829000,Bart Simpson,Ajax Steel Mill,"Dad, why did you bring me to a gay steel mill?"
37735,168,179,831000,Homer Simpson,Ajax Steel Mill,I don't know! This is a nightmare! You're all sick!
37736,168,180,837000,Worker In Crowd,Ajax Steel Mill,"Oh, be nice."
37737,168,181,839000,Homer Simpson,Ajax Steel Mill,"Ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! The whole world's gone gay!"

37740,168,186,866000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,...and the entire steel mill was gay!
37741,168,187,868000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Where ya been, Homer? Entire steel industry's gay."
37742,168,188,872000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, aerospace, too. And the railroads. And ya know what else? Broadway!"
37743,168,189,877000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,I always hoped Bart'd grow up to be just like us. What happened?
37744,168,190,882000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, it ain't no mystery -- whole modern world got a swishifyin' effect on kids today. And their MTV's and their diet sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight neither. You gotta do it yourself, Homer. And you gotta do it fast."
37745,168,191,894000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,But what would turn Bart into a man fast? You have to think for me!
37746,168,192,898000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, lessee now... uh, time was, you'd send a boy off to war. Shootin' a man'd fix him right up. But there's not even any wars no more thank you very much Warren Christopher!"
37747,168,193,908000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, better yet, Bart could shoot a deer. That's like shooting a beautiful man!"
37748,168,194,913000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, he's right, Homer. After the boy bags a deer, all the diet sodas in the world won't turn him back. Then you just sit back and watch the grandkids roll in!"
37749,168,195,921000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hunting, eh?"
37753,168,199,935000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Stand aside, Marge. I'm taking the boy deer hunting. He's going to grow up straight for once."
37754,168,200,940000,Marge Simpson,Cockamamie's,"What? You never went hunting before, and you're perfectly straight!"
37755,168,201,944000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,Oh yeah?! How long since you've had a baby?
37756,168,202,946000,Lisa Simpson,Cockamamie's,"But, Dad, it's barbaric! How does killing a deer make you more of a man?"
37757,168,203,950000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,It just does! Name me one gay Indian!
37758,168,204,952000,John,Cockamamie's,"Uh-oh, something's gonna die!"
37759,168,205,954000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Butt out, butt-insky! What would you know about hunting?"
37760,168,206,957000,John,Cockamamie's,"I know this much: I wouldn't wear that hideous hat. Here, take this one -- it was worn by Yale Summers in ""Daktari."""
37761,168,207,961000,Homer Simpson,Cockamamie's,"Hang onto it, Toy-Boy! You might need it when it starts raining naked ladies!"
37763,168,209,971000,Barney Gumble,MOE'S PICK-UP,"Today you're gonna be a man, Bart!"
37764,168,210,974000,Bart Simpson,MOE'S PICK-UP,You guys gonna teach me to drive?
37766,168,211,975000,Moe Szyslak,MOE'S PICK-UP,"Oh, yeah, let a twinkle-toes drive Betsy. Right."
37767,168,212,980000,Homer Simpson,MOE'S PICK-UP,"No, boy. You can't drive, you're only 10. You're going hunting!"
37768,168,213,985000,Moe Szyslak,MOE'S PICK-UP,"Y'ever been huntin' before there, Barty?"
37769,168,214,987000,Bart Simpson,MOE'S PICK-UP,Nope. Something about a bunch of guys alone together in the woods... seems kinda gay.
37770,168,215,994000,Homer Simpson,MOE'S PICK-UP,"That is a very immature attitude, young man."
37772,168,217,1000000,Moe Szyslak,Woods,"Remember, guys, the truck only holds six carcasses, so don't shoot nothin' but trophy bucks, huh?"
37773,168,218,1016000,Barney Gumble,Woods,"Aw, we shoulda just stayed at the bar and shot some rats."
37774,168,219,1020000,Moe Szyslak,Woods,"Hey, those ain't your rats, Barn. Well, Homer, you ready to call it quits?"
37775,168,220,1024000,Homer Simpson,Woods,Well... but... Wait a minute. Bart's not fixed yet! He hasn't even --
37776,168,221,1028000,Moe Szyslak,Woods,Homer...
37779,168,224,1037000,Moe Szyslak,Outskirts Of Springfield,"C'mon, don't take it so hard, Homer. You still got that other kid... uh, Lisa. Let's take her out huntin' tomorrow, make her into a man."
37780,168,225,1046000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Springfield,"Oh, she'd never go. She's a vegetarian."
37781,168,226,1049000,Moe Szyslak,Outskirts Of Springfield,"...Aw, geez, Homer! Geez! You and Marge ain't cousins, are ya?"
37782,168,227,1055000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Springfield,No... This whole thing is my fault. I've been a lousy dad.
37783,168,228,1065000,Moe Szyslak,Outskirts Of Springfield,"Cheer up, Homer. Christmas is comin' early this year!"
37786,168,231,1078000,John,Simpson Home,Did he say where they were going?
37787,168,232,1080000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No. They were just going to find a deer and make Bart shoot it.
37788,168,233,1084000,John,Simpson Home,Deer? Not around here. They all migrated north when the state park converted to AstroTurf.
37789,168,234,1089000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"But if there're no deer out there, then what are they hunting?"
37790,168,235,1092000,John,Simpson Home,"Well, the only thing around here that's even close to deer is...."
37792,168,237,1105000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,"Hey, boy, wake up! Your old man found some deer!"
37793,168,238,1108000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Village,"Huh? You did? Wait, man, those are reindeer."
37794,168,239,1115000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,"Yep, and it's your shot, son."
37796,168,240,1118000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Village,What? I'm not gonna shoot a reindeer in a pen.
37797,168,241,1121000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,"C'mon, Bart. Be a sport and kill Blitzen, okay?"
37798,168,242,1125000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Village,Da-ad --
37799,168,243,1126000,Moe Szyslak,Santa's Village,"Aw, criminy! Here come the waterworks."
37800,168,244,1129000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,"Bart, I'm gonna turn my back -- and when I turn around, I wanna see a whole pile of dead reindeer."
37801,168,245,1139000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,"Attaway, son! You made your old man proud!"
37802,168,246,1143000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Village,I didn't do anything.
37803,168,247,1146000,Barney Gumble,Santa's Village,They're goin' nuts! Like in those nature films!
37804,168,248,1149000,Moe Szyslak,Santa's Village,"Yeah, it must be matin' season!"
37806,168,250,1160000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Village,"Dad, I'm scared."
37807,168,251,1162000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,"Me too, son."
37808,168,252,1167000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Village,"No, don't! You have to protect yourself!"
37809,168,253,1169000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,"Son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must -- GAAHHH!!"
37810,168,254,1169000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,UNNGHH!!
37811,168,255,1177000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Village,"Dad, are you hurt?"
37812,168,256,1179000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,Just... my bones... and organs...
37814,168,258,1192000,Mechanical Voice,Santa's Village,Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.
37815,168,259,1197000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,What the -- ?
37816,168,260,1200000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,"Bart, look! It's Santa Claus!"
37817,168,261,1207000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Village,"Whoa, it's Santa, all right! And he is kickin' ass!"
37818,168,262,1215000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,It's a miracle!
37819,168,263,1217000,John,Santa's Village,"No, Ultrasuede is a miracle. This is just good timing."
37821,168,265,1223000,Marge Simpson,Santa's Village,"Oh, Homie, I'm so glad you're safe! Hmmm, you feel softer than before."
37822,168,266,1229000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,I've been tenderized.
37823,168,267,1231000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Village,How'd you know that thing would work?
37824,168,268,1232000,John,Santa's Village,"Well, the sound is just brutal. And I figured reindeer would naturally be afraid of their cruel master, Santa Claus. I mean, wouldn't you be?"
37825,168,269,1240000,Barney Gumble,Santa's Village,"Is it okay to come out now, Mr. Gay Man, sir?"
37826,168,270,1245000,Moe Szyslak,Santa's Village,I'll do anything you say! Anything!
37827,168,271,1249000,Barney Gumble,Santa's Village,"Aw, Moe, we were saved by a sissy."
37828,168,272,1253000,Moe Szyslak,Santa's Village,"Yeah, yeah, we'll never live it down. Oh, boy, it looks like it's suicide again for me."
37830,168,273,1259000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,"Hey, we owe this guy. And I don't want you calling him a sissy. This guy's a fruit! And a -- No, wait, wait, wait -- ""queer!"" Queer, queer. That's what you like to be called, right?"
37831,168,274,1272000,John,Santa's Village,"Well, that, or John."
37832,168,275,1274000,Lisa Simpson,Santa's Village,"This is about as tolerant as Dad gets, so you should be flattered."
37833,168,276,1277000,John,Santa's Village,"Great! Well, Homer, I won your respect, and all I had to do was save your life. Now if every gay man could just do the same, you'd be set."
37834,168,277,1286000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Village,Amen to that.
37836,168,279,1291000,Homer Simpson,ROAD TO SPRINGFIELD,"Y'know, Bart, maybe it's just the concussion talking, but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me."
37837,168,280,1300000,Bart Simpson,ROAD TO SPRINGFIELD,Huh?
37838,168,281,1301000,Lisa Simpson,ROAD TO SPRINGFIELD,He thinks you're gay.
37839,168,282,1302000,Bart Simpson,ROAD TO SPRINGFIELD,He thinks I'm gay?
