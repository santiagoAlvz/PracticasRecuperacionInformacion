59429,242,113,564000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"I-I don't know. Plastic surgery might make you look good on the outside, but you still might feel bad on the inside."
59430,242,114,570000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"But I'd look good on the outside, right?"
59431,242,115,572000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, but you'd feel bad inside."
