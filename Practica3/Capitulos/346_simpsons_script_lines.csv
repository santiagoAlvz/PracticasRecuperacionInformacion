89493,346,1,79000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Happy three in the morning, everyone! In a mere five hours, we'll be gazing at Springfield's most exciting glacier, Springfield Glacier. I hope you're all wearing glacier-appropriate clothing."
89494,346,2,90000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, check out my T-shirt. It's wicked relevant!"
89495,346,3,93000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"It's part of my ""Things Suck"" line of clothing."
89496,346,4,95000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, well, while I disagree with your T-shirt's assertion, I do encourage anything that raises glacier awareness. Busward to adventure!"
89498,346,6,109000,Bart Simpson,Bus,"So, Lis, ready for your trip?"
89499,346,7,111000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,Sure am!
89500,346,8,112000,Bart Simpson,Bus,See ya next fall.
89501,346,9,116000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,You make those same stupid jokes every field trip!
89502,346,10,119000,Bart Simpson,Bus,"Eh, you work in the business as long as I have, you're bound to repeat yourself."
89503,346,11,124000,Bart Simpson,Bus,See you next fall!
89507,346,15,138000,Seymour Skinner,School Bus,"So, Edna, I uh, I wrote up some possible discussion topics for this trip. Oh, here's one: I'm still in love with you. Discuss?"
89508,346,16,147000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,School Bus,"Seymour, I've moved on. Our romance is in the history books -- and there's nothing worth highlighting. Ha!"
89509,346,17,153000,Seymour Skinner,School Bus,The Skin-man doesn't give up that easily.
89510,346,18,158000,Otto Mann,School Bus,"Ooh, these icy roads are gettin' pretty gnarly."
89512,346,20,162000,Kids,Mountain Road,Whoooa! Whoooa! Whoooa! Whoooa!
89514,346,22,170000,Seymour Skinner,Bus,"Oh, I'm not worried."
89515,346,23,173000,Seymour Skinner,Bus,My indemnity waivers! Stop the bus!
89516,346,24,175000,Seymour Skinner,Bus,We'll just use the chains.
89519,346,27,181000,Üter,Mountain Road,"I feel like I'm in ""Fitzcarraldo!"""
89520,346,28,184000,Nelson Muntz,Mountain Road,That movie was flawed!
89522,346,30,187000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER PARK,"Behold, children. The majesty of Springfield Glacier! Crane your necks skyward to behold its icy glory."
89523,346,31,200000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER PARK,What happened to the glacier? It's nearly melted. This must be due to global warming!
89524,346,32,206000,Ranger Johnson,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER PARK,"Young lady, the federal government's position on global warming is that it does not exist. This glacier is doing just fine."
89525,346,33,212000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER PARK,No it isn't -- it's a lump of slush! Look at it!
89526,346,34,215000,Ranger Johnson,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER PARK,I have a little girl like you at home. That's where she stays. At home.
89528,346,36,223000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Oh, I just love it here. So many things, and so many things of each thing!"
89530,346,38,229000,Grampa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,Welcome to Sprawl*Mart! Can I get you a cart or a basket?
89531,346,39,233000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,"Grampa, you're a greet grater! I mean a great greeter! Now look who's senile!"
89532,346,40,243000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,I'll take a cart.
89533,346,41,245000,Grampa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,All right.
89534,346,42,248000,Grampa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,Darn thing's stuck. I'll give it a good yank...
89535,346,43,253000,Grampa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,Gnoooooo... mes!
89536,346,44,263000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,"Oh, Dad. How I'll miss your cap, your walking stick, your plaster base..."
89537,346,45,268000,Grampa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,"I'm down here, you idiot!"
89538,346,46,270000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,"Dad, where's your base?!"
89539,346,47,272000,Grampa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,Don't worry about that! Someone's gotta greet the customers!
89540,346,48,277000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,"Eh, they'll be fine."
89541,346,49,278000,Grampa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,No! They're helpless without a greeting -- look at 'em.
89542,346,50,286000,Grampa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SPRAWL*MART,Make me proud... or at least less ashamed.
89544,346,52,294000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,"I'm gonna get a glacier postcard and send it to my Nanna! She'll be like ""no way!"""
89545,346,53,298000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,Score!
89546,346,54,302000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,I'm going to exchange this beach towel I bought at Sequoia National Park.
89547,346,55,306000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,I learned too late that it implied tumescence.
89548,346,56,313000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,"Ah, pre-modern man. If these wise warriors could speak, what would they tell us?"
89549,346,57,317000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,They left a message right here.
89551,346,59,323000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,"Actually carved into the rock. Nice work, Simpson."
89552,346,60,326000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,Feel free to make a rubbing.
89555,346,63,331000,Homer Simpson,SPRAWL*MART,"Welcome to Sprawl*Mart... Pimple cream in aisle five! Buenos nachos -- ask about our señor discount. Hey, Rabbi, Jesus loves ya. Just kidding."
89556,346,64,341000,Store Manager,SPRAWL*MART,"Son, you are on fire! A million times better than that worthless old coot you replaced."
89557,346,65,347000,Homer Simpson,SPRAWL*MART,That coot happens to be my father. Please continue.
89558,346,66,350000,Store Manager,SPRAWL*MART,How would you like to be a full-time Sprawl*Mart greeter?
89559,346,67,353000,Homer Simpson,SPRAWL*MART,Is there a chance for advancement?
89560,346,68,353000,Store Manager,SPRAWL*MART,No.
89561,346,69,355000,Homer Simpson,SPRAWL*MART,Woo hoo! No pressure!
89563,346,71,356000,Ranger Johnson,GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,Evidence suggests that this ice-age female was alone when she fell into a crevasse.
89564,346,72,361000,Seymour Skinner,GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,"Dying alone, huh? Terrible fate to befall any woman -- ice-age or modern-day."
89565,346,73,368000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,"Seymour, I will now demonstrate how over you I am. See that man?"
89566,346,74,373000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,Take note of how he's not you. Now watch.
89567,346,75,377000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,"So, is there a Mrs. Park Ranger Johnson?"
89568,346,76,381000,Ranger Johnson,GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,"No ma'am. I'm married to the glacier. But uh, it's an open marriage."
89569,346,77,386000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,"Then bring it, fool!"
89570,346,78,390000,Seymour Skinner,GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,"Oh for goodness sake. You've moved on, have you? Well, so have I."
89571,346,79,398000,Seymour Skinner,GLACIER VISITOR CENTER,Just play along.
89573,346,81,405000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glacier,"Listen, people!"
89574,346,82,408000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glacier,"How can you stand there eating snacks and being children, when the world's glaciers are vanishing?"
89575,346,83,413000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glacier,We have to do something about it!
89576,346,84,415000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glacier,Glaciers are nature's alarm clock...and it's time for us to wake up. Can there be any doubt that the culprit is greenhouse gas produced by man?
89578,346,86,426000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glacier,The only gas is coming from Lisa's butt!
89580,346,88,429000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glacier,"People, please! I'm talking about toxic vapors."
87181,346,90,434000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glacier,Emanations!
87693,346,92,436000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glacier,Miasmas!
89582,346,93,440000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Glacier,"Hey, whoever's doing that, get off the frequency."
89584,346,95,442000,Chief Wiggum,Woods,We're combing the woods -- there's a killer loose out here.
89585,346,96,445000,Lou,Woods,"Aw, let him do it, Chief. It lightens the mood."
89586,346,97,449000,Lou,Woods,Oh my God!
89588,346,99,452000,Lou,Springfield Glacier,That used to be a face!
89589,346,100,452000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glacier,Baaart!
89590,346,101,459000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glacier,Help! I'm sinking in the lake!
89591,346,102,462000,Ranger Johnson,Springfield Glacier,"You mean, you're walking on the glacier!"
89592,346,103,465000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glacier,Whatever!
89593,346,104,472000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glacier,Check it out -- that frog has a nerd on its butt!
89596,346,107,485000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,"Bart, you are the meanest, nastiest little boy that ever lived."
89597,346,108,489000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Hey, there's a dog in the next car lookin' at me. Hey, dog."
89598,346,109,493000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,You don't even care how upset I am! But this time you have gone too far.
89599,346,110,498000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"What are you gonna do, tell Mom and Dad? They're powerless figureheads."
89600,346,111,501000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,"You'll see. Oh, you will see."
89602,346,113,508000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good morning, world! Eat my shorts!"
89603,346,114,511000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"There'll be no shorts eaten today, young man."
89604,346,115,514000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Bart Simpson, this is your restraining order. From now on, you must stay at least twenty feet away from your sister."
89605,346,116,519000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Restraining order?! Bull spit! No piece of paper keeps me from whaling on my sister.
89607,346,118,526000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD JAIL,"So, you see what happens when you don't obey your restraining order?"
89608,346,119,530000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD JAIL,"Yes, Chief Wiggum."
89609,346,120,531000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD JAIL,"And Snake, do you see what happens when you kidnap the President?"
89610,346,121,535000,Snake Jailbird,SPRINGFIELD JAIL,"Yes, Chief Wiggum."
89611,346,122,537000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD JAIL,"And Lou, do you see what happens when my coffee comes back cold?"
89612,346,123,541000,Lou,SPRINGFIELD JAIL,"Chief, you ordered an ice coffee."
89613,346,124,543000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD JAIL,I said a nice coffee. Nice.
89616,346,126,550000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, you took out a restraining order against your own brother?"
89617,346,127,553000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes. The clerk also gave me this bench warrant for Dad's arrest.
89618,346,128,558000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, dammit! Chief, how are we supposed to live with our kids constantly separated?"
89619,346,129,563000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Hey, I don't make the laws, I just... something with them."
89620,346,130,567000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Look, this videotape should answer all your questions."
89621,346,131,581000,Announcer,Simpson Home,Get Out Of My Dreams And Also Out Of My Car: A Guide To Your Restraining Order
89622,346,132,581000,Gary Busey,Simpson Home,"Hi, I'm Gary Busey. I'm here to explain about restraining orders. The answers to all your questions are in this video."
89623,346,133,595000,Gary Busey,Simpson Home,"""So You've Got A Restraining Order."" Meet Joe. Last name: Spaghetti-o. One night, Joe went to a party and fell in love with a girl named Mary."
89624,346,134,602000,Gary Busey,Simpson Home,"Oh man, I've been there."
89625,346,135,604000,Gary Busey,Simpson Home,"At first Joe felt discouraged, but then he remembered what his father taught him: ""Never say die,"" ""Quitters never prosper"", and ""No means yes."""
89626,346,136,609000,Gary Busey,Simpson Home,The next day Mary got a restraining order against Joe.
89627,346,137,641000,Gary Busey,Simpson Home,Now Joe can't come within five hundred feet of Mary. He also can't call her or burn his name in gas on her lawn.
89628,346,138,648000,Gary Busey,Simpson Home,"I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Joe is me. And Mary is a composite of twelve different women and a small independent film company, all of whom couldn't deal with me because I'm too real."
89629,346,139,665000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I always hoped we wouldn't be one of those restraining order families.
89630,346,140,671000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,How am I supposed to know if I'm twenty feet away?
89631,346,141,674000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, son -- no one's gonna make you count to twenty. I have a more humane solution."
89632,346,142,683000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"This twenty-foot pole will make Bart's restraining order oh-so-easy to enforce. And I used my Sprawl*Mart employee discount to buy this fancy pole cover. It'll keep your pole looking great, poke after poke after poke!"
89634,346,144,698000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, this really works."
89635,346,145,702000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, why did you put the screwdriver at the end?"
89636,346,146,705000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Show you what it's like in the real world!
89638,346,148,709000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, because of your sister's restraining order, there is no place in this school you can legally occupy, without violating your order. Observe."
89639,346,149,717000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"A.m. kindergarten made the Bart doll. P.m. kindergarten made the Lisa. The point is, we're not allowed to have you in this building."
89640,346,150,729000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I've never been one to break the law..."
89641,346,151,731000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"So long, Seymour. Gimme a jingle sometime."
89642,346,152,733000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I will. But there is one place on school property that falls outside all laws of man or God.
89643,346,153,741000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,No... you don't mean...
89645,346,155,744000,Bart Simpson,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,"Oh, this place smells, and something's dripping on me."
89646,346,156,747000,Groundskeeper Willie,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,The smell is manure. And the drippin's manure. Now turn to chapter one of Math Safari.
89647,346,157,754000,Bart Simpson,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,But we're already on chapter seven.
89648,346,158,756000,Groundskeeper Willie,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,Then you'll be teachin' Willie.
89650,346,160,786000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,I'm afraid your arm has sustained extensive nerve damage. The only cure is this anti-poking potion.
89651,346,161,794000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,"Oops, missed the vein. Dang, missed it again. Sorry, I'm distracted. My housekeeper is suing me for sexual harassment. She hung the mistletoe. What was I supposed to do?"
89653,346,163,811000,Lisa Simpson,SPRAWL*MART,"I like eating here with you, Dad. Especially without ""Don't have a cow, man."""
89654,346,164,815000,Homer Simpson,SPRAWL*MART,"Yeah, he's all ""Cowabunga, dude!"" What's that mean? Nothing, I bet."
89655,346,165,825000,Lisa Simpson,SPRAWL*MART,"Oops, need more soda."
89656,346,166,827000,Store Manager,SPRAWL*MART,"Homer, would you be interested in the position of Executive Greeter?"
89657,346,167,830000,Homer Simpson,SPRAWL*MART,Woo hoo! That's been my dream ever since I heard it existed right now. What do I get?
89658,346,168,835000,Store Manager,SPRAWL*MART,You get to work overtime without us paying you extra.
89659,346,169,838000,Homer Simpson,SPRAWL*MART,I won't do it.
89660,346,170,840000,Store Manager,SPRAWL*MART,"If you don't, we'll ship you right back to Mexico."
89661,346,171,842000,Homer Simpson,SPRAWL*MART,But I'm a U.S. citizen.
89662,346,172,844000,Store Manager,SPRAWL*MART,Uh-huh. How sure of that are you?
89663,346,173,849000,Homer Simpson,SPRAWL*MART,Dios mio!
89664,346,175,852000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I can't take it anymore! Every time I try to relax, she-- ow, my neck!"
89665,346,176,857000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Can't I even finish my milk?
89668,346,179,867000,Marge Simpson,FAMILY COURT,"Please lift this restraining order, Judge Harm. It's poking our family apart."
89669,346,180,872000,Judge Harm,FAMILY COURT,"Bart, do you have anything to say?"
89670,346,181,874000,Bart Simpson,FAMILY COURT,My sister has no sense of humor. I'm sure you understand. It's why you became a judge instead of finding a husband.
89671,346,182,881000,Judge Harm,FAMILY COURT,I have a husband!
89672,346,183,882000,Bart Simpson,FAMILY COURT,"What is he, blind and deaf?"
89673,346,184,884000,Judge Harm,FAMILY COURT,"From now on, the restraining order is set at two hundred feet!"
89675,346,186,890000,Judge Harm,FAMILY COURT,That's sixty-one meters!
89677,346,188,893000,Frenchman,FAMILY COURT,Sacre bleu!
89679,346,190,895000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, boy. This is the only place that's two hundred feet from Lisa but still on our property."
89680,346,191,901000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's pretty scary out here, Dad. Dad?"
89681,346,192,912000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I bet they miss me."
89684,346,195,934000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, could be worse."
89685,346,196,940000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, Lisa went over to Janey's. Quick, run inside and go potty!"
89686,346,197,946000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why should I go inside? The world is my toilet now.
89689,346,200,967000,Homer Simpson,Store,"Hey, why'd you lock the door? We're still inside!"
89690,346,201,970000,Store Manager,Store,It's a chance for you to catch up on all the work I'm assigning you now.
89691,346,202,973000,Homer Simpson,Store,"I've never worked all night, never! And I worked at an all-night diner for three years! I slept on the grill."
89692,346,203,980000,Store Manager,Store,See this? It's the bathroom key. See you in the morning.
89693,346,204,985000,Homer Simpson,Store,You monster!
89695,346,206,989000,Store Manager,Store,We placed a compliance chip in the back of your neck during the company physical.
89696,346,207,995000,Homer Simpson,Store,"That's it, mister. I am disgruntled. And up until now, I was relatively gruntled!"
89615,346,208,1001000,Store Manager,Store,"Oh, better increase the juice."
89697,346,209,1010000,Homer Simpson,Store,I did it! I pulled it out! And with no brain damage-amage-amage-amage-amage-amage.
89698,346,210,1015000,Homer Simpson,Store,"Now, we'll get all your chips out, go to the police, and shut this place down!"
89699,346,211,1021000,Employee,Store,"Homer, we took our chips out years ago."
89700,346,212,1023000,Homer Simpson,Store,Really? Then why do you still work here?!
89701,346,213,1025000,Employee,Store,We've learned to accept the things we cannot change. And steal everything that's not nailed down.
89702,346,214,1034000,Employee,Store,I hope you won't judge us harshly...
89703,346,215,1037000,Homer Simpson,Store,I'll be back for tall kitchen bags!
89706,346,218,1072000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, don't you think your brother's suffered enough?"
