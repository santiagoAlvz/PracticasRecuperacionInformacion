24840,120,10,88000,Broker,Discount Brokerage,"Homer, you knucklebeak, I told you a hundred times, you gotta sell your pumpkin futures before Halloween. Before!"
24841,120,11,96000,Homer Simpson,Discount Brokerage,"All right, let's not panic. I'll make the money back by selling one of my livers. I can get by with one."
24843,120,13,101000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How am I going to tell Marge we're broke? I need a miracle.

24845,120,15,114000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Hello, Homer."
24846,120,16,117000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, we had a deal. Your sisters don't come here after six, and I stop eating your lipstick."
24847,120,17,124000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This is a special occasion. Patty and Selma just got promoted at the DMV.
24848,120,18,128000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Yeah, Homer, let your wife have a glimpse of success, for once."
24849,120,19,133000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, that's the last straw. It's time to take out the trash. But first, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
24851,120,21,151000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry. Homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man."
24852,120,22,156000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wrong!
24797,120,23,157000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"When are you going to wake up and smell your husband, Marge?"
24853,120,24,160000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Granted, you got some kids out of him. But when the seeds have been planted, you throw away the envelope."
24854,120,25,166000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I wish you wouldn't put Homer down like that. He may not be a big success like you, but I can always count on him to provide for the family."
24855,120,26,173000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweet, trusting Marge. I can't let you down. I'll get some money somehow."
24856,120,27,181000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello Vegas? Give me 100 bucks on red. All right, I'll send you a check."
24857,120,28,190000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,If only I could think of an invention. Something that would really make money. Must concentrate and work harder than I've ever worked...
24859,120,30,204000,Executive,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,"Congratulations, Mr. Simpson. This invention of yours has made us all rich. Especially you. It's simple, yet ingenious and it fits right in the palm of your hand!"
24860,120,31,213000,Executive,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,"Every person in America now owns one of these, and in many cases three or four."
24861,120,32,217000,Homer Simpson,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,"Uh, could I just get a look at that?"
24862,120,33,218000,Executive,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,Why would you need to see it? You're the genius who invented... the product in question.
24863,120,34,222000,Homer Simpson,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,"But uh, could I just..."
24864,120,35,224000,Executive,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,Now don't worry. You'll get to see it just as soon as we unveil our new ad campaign.
24865,120,36,230000,Homer Simpson,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,Let me see! Let me see! Out of the way!
24866,120,37,231000,Marge Simpson,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,Homer!
24867,120,38,232000,Marge Simpson,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,"Homer, wake up. There's still a few minutes 'til our usual bedtime."
24868,120,39,236000,Homer Simpson,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,"No, my invention! All my money problems could've..."
24869,120,40,239000,Marge Simpson,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,"Money problems? Homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?"
24870,120,41,246000,Homer Simpson,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,"Oh, Marge, my loyal wife, of course not."
24871,120,42,250000,Homer Simpson,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,"And Lisa, my little princess."
24872,120,43,250000,Homer Simpson,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,And who could forget dear Rat boy?
24873,120,44,257000,Bart Simpson,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,Rat boy? I resent that.
24874,120,45,257000,Marge Simpson,CORPORATE BOARDROOM,"Bart, I told you before, stop gnawing on the drywall."
24876,120,47,263000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"What a day, eh Milhouse? The sun is out, birds are singing, bees are trying to have sex with them - as is my understanding..."
24877,120,48,270000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Street,It is a gorgeously fabulous day. Marvelous even.
24824,120,49,274000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"So, uh, what's your hurry to get to school?"
24878,120,50,278000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Street,Nothin'. What's your hurry?
24879,120,51,283000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Street,"That's enough, Bart. Fun is fun but if we're late we're gonna get in trouble."
24880,120,52,287000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"You're right, Milhouse. Fun is fun."
24882,120,54,294000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Attention students. It's time once again to choose a gym class for the coming term. So let's all prove how adult we can be by filing to the gym in a calm and orderly manner. Even though it's first-come first-serve, and the most popular sports fill up fast."
24883,120,55,309000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Arrg, too many wee ones."
24885,120,57,314000,Richard,Gym,This gets uglier every year. Any sign of Bart and Milhouse?
24886,120,58,318000,Lewis Clark,Gym,"No. And if they don't get here soon, it'll be T.S. for them..."
24888,120,60,324000,Ralph Wiggum,Swimming Pool,I don't feel right.
24890,120,62,328000,Milhouse Van Houten,Street,"Did you hear that, Bart? That was the tardy bell. ""Truant! Truant! Truant!"" they'll all say!"
24891,120,63,333000,Bart Simpson,Street,"Aw, who needs him. I can have fun all by myself."
24892,120,64,337000,Bart Simpson,Street,S'allright?
24893,120,65,338000,Bart's Fist,Street,S'allright.

24896,120,68,340000,Bart Simpson,Street,S'allright?
24897,120,69,340000,Bart's Fist,Street,S'allright.
24899,120,71,345000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Sure, Homer, I can loan you all the money you need. However since you have no collateral, I'm gonna have to break your legs in advance."
24900,120,72,353000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Gosh, Moe, I use these all the time. Couldn't you just bash my head in?"
24901,120,73,357000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, hey! Are you a loan shark? Do you understand how finance works? Now let's do this thing."
24903,120,75,370000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,Oh no. It's P.E. sign up day!
24904,120,76,372000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,How could you forget? They had signs posted all over the library.
24905,120,77,375000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"Better sign up for somethin' fast, man. Baseball just filled up--"
24906,120,78,379000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School Gym,So did Tae Kwon Do.
24909,120,80,390000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"There is only one class left, but it happens to be the ""coolest"" one of all."
24910,120,81,397000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,Ballet? Dancin' is for girls!
24911,120,82,400000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Gym,Well you should have gotten here earlier.
24913,120,84,402000,Homer Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,"Uh, I need an another extension on my mortgage payments."
24914,120,85,406000,Lender,First National Bank of Springfield,"I understand that, Mr. Simpson. But according to our computer, your credit history is not good. It says here that you've been pre-declined for every major credit card. It also says that you once grabbed a dog by the hind legs and pushed him around like a vacuum cleaner."
24915,120,86,419000,Homer Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,That was in the third grade.
24916,120,87,421000,Lender,First National Bank of Springfield,"Yeah, well it all goes on your permanent record. I'm sorry, but if you don't come up with that money by tomorrow-- the bank is going to take your house."
24917,120,88,427000,Homer Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,"Well, good luck finding it because I'm gonna take the numbers off tonight."
24918,120,89,430000,Lender,First National Bank of Springfield,Well we'll look for the house with no numbers.
24919,120,90,431000,Homer Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,Then I'll take off the numbers on my neighbor's house.
24920,120,91,433000,Lender,First National Bank of Springfield,Well then we'll look for the house next to the house with no numbers.
24921,120,92,438000,Homer Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,"All right, you'll get your money."
24923,120,94,440000,Homer Simpson,DOORWAY,"You're my last-last chance, bottom of the barrel, Hail Mary, long shot, wish you would do it but probably won't, final resort, to lend me money."
24924,120,95,448000,Selma Bouvier,DOORWAY,We'll take care of you.
24925,120,96,450000,Patty Bouvier,DOORWAY,Yes. Care.
24926,120,97,472000,Patty Bouvier,DOORWAY,Cut him a check and get him the hell out of here.
24928,120,99,481000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,What a wonderful dinner. What a beautiful family. Someone get a picture of me with my arm around this steak.
24929,120,100,486000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"You're certainly in a good mood tonight, Dad."
24930,120,101,489000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Well, Lisa, I managed to solve a little problem today. And to celebrate, I'm going to tilt my chair."
24931,120,102,496000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Mmmm, slanty."
24932,120,103,500000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Patty, Selma. What are you doing here?"
24933,120,104,503000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Dining Room,"Oh, we thought we'd stop by unexpectedly for dinner."
24935,120,105,506000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Dining Room,"Now bring us some extra chairs, like a good blubber-in-law!"
24936,120,106,509000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,Time to fertilize the lawn. A couple five-hundred-pound bags should do it.
24937,120,107,514000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Homer, be careful with my sisters' heads. Their necks are brittle."
24938,120,108,517000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Dining Room,"That's okay, Marge, nothing's broke."
24939,120,109,519000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Dining Room,Except Homer.
24940,120,110,520000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,What's that supposed to mean?
24941,120,111,522000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Dining Room,It means...
24942,120,112,525000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.
24943,120,113,531000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Dining Room,Now there's a stink I coulda done without.
24945,120,115,534000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"This has been such a nice, peaceful dinner, it calls for a celebration. I'm going to make the most international coffee in the house, Montreal Morn."
24946,120,116,546000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"All right, you had your fun. Now get lost."
24947,120,117,548000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, our fun hasn't begun yet."
24948,120,118,550000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Hunh?
24949,120,119,554000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,We know something you don't want Marge to know. Now we own you like Siegfried owns Roy.
24950,120,120,562000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"I'm sorry. All we have is Nescafe. I'm very, very sorry."
24951,120,121,567000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,"Oh Marge, Marge. You're just in time. Homer's getting ready to give us a foot rub."
24952,120,122,572000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,You are?
24953,120,123,574000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,No! I'm giving them a foot massage. At least let me have that.
24954,120,124,582000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,You can start with the corns.
24955,120,125,585000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,Then you can move on to bunion country.
24957,120,127,587000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, steady Bart. Taking ballet doesn't make you any less of a man."
24958,120,128,598000,Ballet Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,"All right, girls. Today we learn the dance of the fairy queens. You can either be a fairy or a queen, it's wide open."
24960,120,130,609000,Ballet Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, and what have we here? A young man, maybe, who thinks he can be the next Baryshnikov?"
24961,120,131,614000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I don't want to be the next anything. I'm only taking this stupid class because they made me.
24964,120,132,618000,Ballet Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,"So, he has fire in the belly. But it will take more than belly-fire to be the next Baryshnikov!"
24965,120,133,623000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Look, Boris. I think ballet's for sissies."
24966,120,134,627000,Ballet Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,"Ballet is for the strong, the fierce, the determined. But for the sissies? Never. Now put on this fuchsiatard. You are a fairy."
24968,120,136,637000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Quittin' time!
24969,120,137,638000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Let's go, Homer. On the way home, we're all stopping at Moe's for a Zima."
24970,120,138,641000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, maybe I'll just stay and work overtime. My sisters-in-law are at my house again."
24971,120,139,646000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Homer, quit wallowing in self-pity. Pull yourself together and come get drunk with us."
24973,120,141,657000,Ballet Teacher,Ballet Class,"Is something wrong, Mr. Simpson?"
24974,120,142,658000,Bart Simpson,Ballet Class,"I don't like wearing tights, ma'am."
24975,120,143,660000,Ballet Teacher,Ballet Class,"But so many of your heroes wear tights. Batman, for example. And Magellan."
24976,120,144,666000,Bart Simpson,Ballet Class,"Look, I don't like this cootie platoon and I never will. I'm outta here and I'm out of this stupid outfit."
24977,120,145,675000,Bart Simpson,Ballet Class,"Wait! Joy of movement increasing... Love of dance, impossible to resist... Toes twinkling... Look at me, girls. I'm doing ballet...and I love it!"
24979,120,147,691000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,"Am I wrong, or did it just get fatter in here?"
24980,120,148,695000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Request permission to slink by.
24981,120,149,697000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,"Permission pending. First, light our cigarettes."
24982,120,150,702000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,But you're already smoking cig...
24983,120,151,707000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,You're really pushing it.
24984,120,152,709000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,"C'mon, Homer. You can't spell obsequious without ""IOU."""
24985,120,153,710000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I'll have to trust you on that.
24986,120,154,715000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,"Well, Marge was always a good speller. Let's ask her."
24987,120,155,718000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,No! Don't tell Marge! I'll be good. I'll be good!
24988,120,156,725000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,Ah-ah-ah-ah! Just for that you have to crawl around on the floor like the dog you are.
24989,120,157,734000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"But... Yes, ma'am."
24990,120,158,736000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,"Now say ""I am Homer Simpson, the lowly dog."" In a dog voice."
24908,120,159,742000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Rye am Romer Rimpson...
24962,120,160,744000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,"Well good. Jump, Homer, jump."
24991,120,161,745000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,What's going on in here?
24992,120,162,747000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Rabsolutely rothing, Rarge."
24993,120,163,748000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,What's that paper?
24994,120,164,748000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,What paper?
24995,120,165,756000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Homer, is this projection accurate? Did you borrow money from my sisters?"
24996,120,166,761000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"I don't know Marge, I can't be expected to keep track of all my wheelings and dealings."
24997,120,167,765000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,He blew all your savings on jack-o-lanterns.
24998,120,168,768000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,You told!
25000,120,170,774000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sorry Marge.
25001,120,171,777000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I never want to see you again! You either!
25002,120,172,780000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, Homer why didn't you tell me?"
25003,120,173,784000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I was ashamed, Marge. I failed you as a husband and a provider, and at best, I was a B-plus dog. I'll understand if you want to sleep on the couch tonight."
25005,120,175,800000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"How's Dad, today?"
25006,120,176,801000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Not too good, Lisa. Frankly, he's underneath the table."
25007,120,177,807000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Nobody make me any breakfast. A man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.
25008,120,178,811000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,But I like to make you breakfast.
25009,120,179,813000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"In that case, I'll just have french toast with double butter and a side of bacon. But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it. Maybe a little powdered sugar."
25011,120,181,828000,Bart Simpson,Ballet Class,"See that? I started to do like a little arabesque, but then I just fully went for it and pulled off the demi-entrechant. Not that I'm into that kind of thing."
25012,120,182,838000,Ballet Teacher,Ballet Class,"Bravissimo, Bart. Next week, class gives its first recital. And you... you will dance the male lead."
25013,120,183,846000,Bart Simpson,Ballet Class,Dance in front of my whole school? What is it with you and ballet?
25014,120,184,850000,Ballet Teacher,Ballet Class,"I know you have great conflict, Bart. You love ballet, yet you fear the boys will laugh at you. No?"
25015,120,185,857000,Bart Simpson,Ballet Class,"No, I fear the girls will laugh at me. I fear the boys will beat the living snot out of me."
25017,120,187,863000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Hey Dad, whatcha doing?"
25019,120,188,865000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Daddy has very important work to do. He's looking through the Want Ads to find a part-time job.
25020,120,189,870000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival."
25021,120,190,873000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, no wonder I didn't hear about Bart being elected world's greatest sex machine."
25022,120,191,877000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I'll never pay off that debt.
25023,120,192,879000,Narrator,Simpson Living Room,Need money fast? Got no experience? Step up to elegance. Become a limo driver at Classy Joe's.
25024,120,193,885000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"That's it! I'll make money with a chauffeur job. Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa."
25025,120,194,891000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I didn't turn it on. I thought you turned it on.
25026,120,195,893000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"No. Well anyway, turn it off."
25027,120,196,896000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,It is off.
25030,120,199,902000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,You're gonna have to work hard to win this crowd over. Most of them are here as part of detention.
25031,120,200,907000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,Pretty big crowd.
25032,120,201,909000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,Mm hm. We even bussed in troublemakers from other schools.
25034,120,203,923000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,That spikey-haired masked dancer is really something. I wonder who he is.
25035,120,204,928000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,He's graceful yet masculine. So it's okay for me to enjoy this.
25036,120,205,933000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"This reminds me of the movie ""Fame"" and to a lesser extent the TV series, which was also called ""Fame."""
25038,120,207,944000,Homer Simpson,Limousine,"Oh wow! I can't believe my very first passenger is comedy legend, Mel Brooks! I love that movie, ""Young Frankenstein"". ...Scared the Hell out of me."
25039,120,208,954000,Mel Brooks,Limousine,"Uhm, thanks."
25040,120,209,955000,Homer Simpson,Limousine,"Hey, let's do that two thousand pound man thing. I'll be that Carl Reiner guy, you be what's his face."
25041,120,210,960000,Mel Brooks,Limousine,"Homer, it's not that easy. It takes the genius of Carl Reiner and the rhythm and timing that only he and I..."
25042,120,211,966000,Homer Simpson,Limousine,"Sir, today every country has a national anthem. Did they have national anthems two thousand years ago?"
25043,120,212,972000,Mel Brooks,Limousine,"Sure, sure we had. Of course, we was caves, but every cave had a national anthem. I'll never forget my cave's national anthem."
25018,120,213,981000,Homer Simpson,Limousine,What was that -- national anthem?
25045,120,214,982000,Mel Brooks,Limousine,"LET 'EM ALL GO TO HELL, EXCEPT CAVE SEVENTY-SIX..."
25046,120,215,988000,Mel Brooks,Limousine,What's with the si... what's with the siren?
25047,120,216,992000,Chief Wiggum,Limousine,Evening Simpson... You got a short in your taillight. It started blinkin' when you made that turn. Let's see your chauffeur's license.
25048,120,217,998000,Homer Simpson,Limousine,"Chauffeur's license, eh? Mel, buckle your borscht belt!"
25049,120,218,1005000,Chief Wiggum,Limousine,"Ah, since you're trying to make a getaway in park, I'm guessing you don't have a license. Better head down to the DMV. These two broads'll help you out."
25050,120,219,1015000,Mel Brooks,Limousine,"Well. Officer, uh, this man is making me a little edgy. Could you please give me a ride to the airport?"
25051,120,220,1021000,Chief Wiggum,Limousine,"Well, hey, hey! You're Mel Brooks! Sure I'll give you a ride."
25052,120,221,1025000,Mel Brooks,Limousine,Thank you.
25053,120,222,1027000,Chief Wiggum,Limousine,"Uh, on the way, we can do that two thousand dollar man thing."
25055,120,224,1030000,Chief Wiggum,Limousine,"You be Carl Reiner and I'll be uh, Police Chief Wiggum."
25056,120,225,1034000,Mel Brooks,Limousine,Listen. Why don't you play Carl Reiner and let me play Police Chief Wiggum? I hate Carl Reiner!
25058,120,227,1041000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"I haven't been moved like this since ""The Joy Luck Club."""

25064,120,234,1066000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Go ahead and laugh. But I took a chance and did something I wanted to do. And if that makes me a sissy, well then, I guess I'm a sissy."
25065,120,235,1075000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,He's a sissy! Let's rush him!

25071,120,241,1104000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Street,"Well, as long as he's hurt."
25073,120,242,1110000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,"Bart, I am so proud of you. You showed a sensitive side of yourself that can never be erased. From this day forward we are kindred spirits."
25074,120,243,1119000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Why did she just leave me here when I clearly need medical attention?
25076,120,245,1127000,Homer Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV where stupid Patty and stupid Selma work. Sometimes I think God is teasing me, just like he teased Moses in the desert."
25077,120,246,1136000,Marge Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,"""Tested,"" Homer, God tested Moses. And try to be nice to my sisters. It's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time."
25078,120,247,1143000,Homer Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Oh, okay Marge, I'll get along with them. Then I will hug some snakes! Yes, I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes. Now that's sarcasm."

25084,120,253,1167000,Homer Simpson,Driver's Test Car,"You won't be happy 'til my family thinks I'm a loser, will you?"
25085,120,254,1169000,Patty Bouvier,Driver's Test Car,"You are a loser, Homer. And we're winners. You gotta learn that."
25086,120,255,1173000,Selma Bouvier,Driver's Test Car,"Ooh, seat belt twisted, minus one point."

25096,120,265,1207000,Marge Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,"So Homer, how'd you do?"
25097,120,266,1207000,Homer Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Well, I..."
25100,120,267,1211000,Supervisor,Department of Motor Vehicles,Ladies. Please don't tell me you're smoking in a government building. Because that is precisely the kind of infraction that can cost a couple of sisters their promotion.
25101,120,268,1220000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Well uh, we...."
25102,120,269,1220000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,uh... she uh...
25103,120,270,1233000,Homer Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,I'll never forgive myself for this.

25108,120,275,1249000,Supervisor,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Ladies, I apologize. And you, sir, are worse than Hitler."
25109,120,276,1253000,Patty Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Homer, I'm -- I'm speechless. You just saved our hides."
25110,120,277,1259000,Homer Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your hides."
25111,120,278,1262000,Marge Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,That's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.
25112,120,279,1265000,Homer Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,"I didn't do it for them. I did it for you, Marge. I'd kill for you. Please ask me to kill for you."
25113,120,280,1272000,Marge Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,"No, Homie. You see. You see, this is the stuff I've been telling you about that you never see."
25114,120,281,1278000,Patty Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Homer, we're... sorry."
25115,120,282,1284000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,If there's anything we can do to make it up...
25116,120,283,1285000,Homer Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,Call off the debt?
25117,120,284,1286000,Patty Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Or, say, we could let you pass your driver's test."
25118,120,285,1289000,Homer Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,Call off the debt?
25119,120,286,1290000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,Uh... well...
