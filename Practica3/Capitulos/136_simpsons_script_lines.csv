29257,136,6,52000,Carl Carlson,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,"Hey, where's Homer? How'd he get out of this?"
29258,136,7,55000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,Hey everybody! Up here!
29259,136,8,59000,Waylon Smithers,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,"Simpson, stop frolicking and get to work!"
29260,136,9,61000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,"Right away, Mr. Smithers! I'll just walk across these slippery rooooock --"
29261,136,10,67000,Carl Carlson,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,"Oh, no! He's going over the falls!"
29262,136,11,72000,Lenny Leonard,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,"Oh, good! He snagged that tree branch!"
29263,136,12,74000,Carl Carlson,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,Oh no! The branch broke off!
29264,136,13,78000,Lenny Leonard,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,Oh good! He can grab onto them pointy rocks!
29265,136,14,80000,Carl Carlson,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,Oh no! The rocks broke his arms and legs!
29266,136,15,84000,Lenny Leonard,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,Oh good! Those helpful beavers are swimming out to save him!
29267,136,16,87000,Carl Carlson,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,Oh no! They're biting him! And stealing his pants!
29268,136,17,93000,Waylon Smithers,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,Good lord! He'll be sucked into the turbine!
29269,136,18,101000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,"Smithers, who was that corpse?"
29270,136,19,103000,Waylon Smithers,SPRINGFIELD HIGHWAY,"Homer Simpson, sir. One of the finest, bravest men ever to grace Sector 7G. I'll cross him off the list."
29272,136,21,116000,Bart Simpson,TOP OF SPRINGFIELD FALLS,"That dummy worked like a charm, Dad."
29273,136,22,118000,Homer Simpson,TOP OF SPRINGFIELD FALLS,"Best six hundred bucks I ever spent. C'mon, boy. We've earned this Saturday, now let's make the most of it."
29275,136,24,129000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sixty-one... Sixty-two... Sixty-three...
29276,136,25,138000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"Marge, we can't tell you how sorry we are."
29277,136,26,141000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"You have our deepest condol-diddly-olences. I'm sorry. I'm just nervous, I didn't mean any disrespect."
29278,136,27,147000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you talking about?
29279,136,28,148000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,You know...
29280,136,29,150000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Homer's passing...away.
29281,136,30,155000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Into death.
29282,136,31,156000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What?!
29284,136,32,159000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's ridiculous. Homer's not dead, he's right out back in the hammock."
29285,136,33,166000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oh, Marge. Of course Homer's alive. He's alive in all our hearts."
29286,136,34,171000,Maude Flanders,Simpson Home,"Yes, Marge, I can see him."
29287,136,35,173000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hi, everybody."
29288,136,36,176000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"Marge, I'm going to give you the card of our juvenile counselor..."
29289,136,37,182000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,A tombstone?!
29290,136,38,184000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"It came with the burial plot. But that's not important. The important thing is, Homer's dead."
29291,136,39,189000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,We've been saving for this since your wedding day.
29292,136,40,191000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Get out of here, you ghouls!"
29293,136,41,194000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oy, yoy yoy yoy yoy."
29295,136,43,199000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, excuse me, sir, I think there's been a mistake."
29296,136,44,203000,Line Man,Simpson Home,"Oh, no mistake. Your electricity is in the name of Homer J. Simpson, deceased. The juice stays off until you get a job or a generator. Oh, and uh, my deepest sympathies."
29297,136,45,212000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer?
29298,136,46,214000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's m'name.
29299,136,47,215000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"When I asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death, you told me ""no."" You go downtown first thing in the morning and straighten this out."
29300,136,48,222000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom! Dad! Bart ran into a door frame and bit his tongue!
29301,136,49,226000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Whuth va hell ith going on heah?!
29303,136,51,231000,Homer Simpson,HALL OF RECORDS,"Listen here. My name is Homer J. Simpson. You guys think I'm dead, but I'm not. Now I want you to straighten this out without a lot of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo-jumbo."
29304,136,52,238000,County Clerk,HALL OF RECORDS,"Okay, Mr. Simpson, I'll just make the change here ...and you're all set."
29305,136,53,243000,Homer Simpson,HALL OF RECORDS,"I don't like your attitude, you water-cooler dictator. What do you have in that secret government file, anyway? I have a right to read it."
29306,136,54,249000,County Clerk,HALL OF RECORDS,You sure do.
29307,136,55,251000,Homer Simpson,HALL OF RECORDS,"""Wife: Marjorie. Children: Bartholomew, Lisa..."" Aha! See, this thing is all screwed up. Who the heck is ""Margaret"" Simpson?"
29308,136,56,260000,County Clerk,HALL OF RECORDS,"Uh, your youngest daughter."
29310,136,57,261000,Homer Simpson,HALL OF RECORDS,"""Youngest daughter..."" Well, how about this? This thing says my mother's still alive. She died when I was a kid."
29311,136,58,269000,Homer Simpson,HALL OF RECORDS,You see that stone angel up there? That's my mother's grave. My Dad points it out every time we drive by.
29312,136,59,275000,County Clerk,HALL OF RECORDS,"Mr. Simpson, maybe you should actually go up there."
29314,136,61,282000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,"Oh, Mom. I'm sorry I never come to see you. I'm just not a cemetery person."
29315,136,62,287000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,"""Here lies... Walt Whitman""?!!"
29316,136,63,292000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,"Damn you, Walt Whitman! I... hate... you... Walt... freakin'... Whitman! ""Leaves of Grass"" my ass! Wait a minute. Maybe it's that other grave. The one that says ""Simpson."""
29317,136,64,309000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,Why does my death keep comin' back to haunt me?!
29318,136,65,314000,Woman,Cemetery,"You awful, awful man. Get out of my son's grave."
29319,136,66,318000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,"I hate to rain on your parade, lady, but this is my grave. Hey, wait a minute... Mom?"
29320,136,67,326000,Woman,Cemetery,Homer?
29321,136,68,331000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,I thought you were dead.
29322,136,69,332000,Woman,Cemetery,I thought you were dead.
29323,136,70,334000,Grave-digger,Cemetery,Dang blasted! Isn't anybody in this dad-gummed cemetery dead?
29324,136,71,339000,Hans Moleman,Cemetery,"I didn't want to cause a fuss, but now that you mention it..."
29326,136,73,346000,Mona Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"Oh, Homer, you grew up so handsome."
29327,136,74,350000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,Some people say I look like Dan Aykroyd. I can't believe you're here. Dad always told me you died while I was at the movies.
29328,136,75,358000,Mona Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"Oh, my poor baby. You must have been so upset... but I suppose Abe has his reasons."
29329,136,76,366000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"Yeah. Well, where have you been all this time?"
29330,136,77,369000,Mona Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"Oh, it's a very complicated story. Let's just enjoy this moment."
29331,136,78,374000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"Mom, there's something you should know about me. I almost always spoil the moment."
29332,136,79,382000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,I'm sorry.
29333,136,80,384000,Mona Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"That's okay, darling. It wasn't your fault."
29335,136,82,389000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, everybody, I've got a big surprise for you! Presenting: my mother!"
29336,136,83,400000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,Hello.
29309,136,84,401000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is so weird. It's like something out of Dickens or ""Melrose Place."""
29337,136,85,406000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Where have you been, Granny? Did they freeze you or something?"
29338,136,86,410000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my, such clever grandchildren. So full of questions and bright, shiny eyes."
29339,136,87,415000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know what to say. I finally have a mother-in-law. No more living vicariously through my girlfriends!
29340,136,88,424000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life, you owe me years of back presents: Christmases, birthdays, Easters, Kwaanzas, good report cards...at seventy-five bucks a pop, plus interest and penalties... You owe me twenty-two thousand dollars."
29341,136,89,440000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll Kwaanza you!
29342,136,90,443000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, don't be so hard on little... What is his name?"
29343,136,91,448000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This is my room. This is my dresser. It's where I keep my shirts when I'm not wearing them.
29344,136,92,452000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, yes. Right in the drawers."
29346,136,94,458000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You remembered.
29348,136,96,461000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I've missed moments like this... Mom."
29349,136,97,465000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"I saw all your awards, Lisa. They're mighty impressive."
29350,136,98,469000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I just keep them out to bug Bart."
29351,136,99,471000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't be bashful. When I was your age, kids made fun of me because I read at the 9th grade level."
29352,136,100,476000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Me, too!"
29353,136,101,478000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Mom, lookit me! Look at what I can do!"
29354,136,102,481000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"I see you, Homer. That's very nice. Although I hardly consider ""A Separate Peace"" the 9th grade level."
29355,136,103,488000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,More like pre-school.
29356,136,104,490000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,I hate John Knowles.
29357,136,105,491000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Me, too."
29359,136,107,497000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Mo-om! You're not looking!
29360,136,108,500000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, Lisa, I feel like I have an instant rapport with you."
29361,136,109,504000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, you didn't dumb it down! You said ""rapport!"""
29362,136,110,506000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,Gotta run... Gramma stuff.
29363,136,111,520000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,There. Now no one should be able to hear us.
29364,136,112,522000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What?
29365,136,113,524000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, we don't need the dryer."
29366,136,114,526000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What?
29367,136,115,526000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just shut up and listen. There's something fishy about Grandma. Whenever we ask her where she's been all this time, she changes the subject. And just now when a police car drove by, she ran into the house."
29368,136,116,537000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I don't trust her either. When I was going through her purse, look what I found."
29369,136,117,541000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mona Simpson, Mona Stevens, Martha Stewart, Penelope Olsen, Muddy Mae Suggins..."
29370,136,118,541000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,These are the calling cards of a con artist.
29371,136,119,553000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo! I'm so glad to have my mom back! I never realized how much I missed her.
29372,136,120,560000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,She's nice.
29373,136,121,562000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But?
29374,136,122,563000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twenty-five years. You could get hurt again.
29375,136,123,569000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"First, it wasn't 25 years. It was 27 years. And second, she had a very good reason."
29376,136,124,576000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Which was?
29377,136,125,577000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I 'unno. I guess I was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.
29378,136,126,583000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie. C'mon, you're a sweet, kind, loving man. I'm sure you were a wonderful son."
29379,136,127,589000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Then why did she leave me?
29380,136,128,591000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Let's find out.
29381,136,129,595000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mother Simpson, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your past."
29382,136,130,599000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"Can't reminisce, sleeping."
29383,136,131,604000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Spill it, Muddy Mae, or we're calling the cops!"
29384,136,132,606000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,Please don't.
29385,136,133,607000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, then we'll call your husband: Grampa."
29386,136,134,610000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,Noooo! I'll talk. I'll tell you everything. I've wanted to tell you. It all started in the '60s...
148070,136,135,619000,Young Homer,Simpson Home,Take out wrenched ankle.
148071,136,136,622000,Young Homer,Simpson Home,Mom! Mom! Mom!
29387,136,137,627000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my little Homie-bear! Time for bed."
148072,136,138,631000,Young Homer,Simpson Home,"Sing me my bedtime song, mom."
29388,136,139,634000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"GOOEY, GOOEY, RICH AND CHEWY INSIDE / GOLDEN, FLAKY, TENDER CAKE-Y OUTSIDE / WRAP THE INSIDE IN THE OUTSIDE / IS IT GOOD?"
148073,136,140,642000,Young Homer,Simpson Home,Darn tootin'
29389,136,141,643000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,It's the...
148074,136,142,643000,Young Homer,Simpson Home,... big Fig Newton!
28868,136,143,646000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,Here's the tricky part...
29283,136,145,653000,Mona Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,"Abe, isn't Homer cute?"
29390,136,146,655000,Grampa Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,"Probably. I'm trying to watch the Super Bowl. If people don't support this thing, it might not make it."
29391,136,147,660000,Howard Cosell,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,"Joe Willie Namath, swaggering off the field, his sideburns an apogee of sculpted sartorium. The foppish follicles pioneered by Ambrose Burnside. Appomattox, 1865..."
29392,136,148,679000,Mona Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,"His wild, untamed facial hair revealed a new world of rebellion, of change. A world where doors were open for women like me. But Abe was stuck in his button-down plastic-fantastic Madison Avenue scene."
29393,136,149,693000,Grampa Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,"Look at them sideburns. He looks like a girl. Now Johnny Unitas, there's a haircut you can set your watch to."
29394,136,150,700000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,"So, Mother Simpson, where did your new-found sense of irresponsibility take you?"
29395,136,151,704000,Mona Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,I soon found people who shared my views at the State College...
29397,136,153,709000,Protestors,Germ Warfare Lab,"Anthrax, gangrene, swimmer's ear! / Get your germ lab out of here!"
29398,136,154,717000,Mona Simpson,Germ Warfare Lab,How could I not become a radical when we were fighting a force of pure evil?
29399,136,155,721000,Protestors,Germ Warfare Lab,Hey! Hey! Mr. Burns! / Enough already with the germs!
29400,136,156,725000,C. Montgomery Burns,Germ Warfare Lab,Their flower power is no match for my glower power.
29402,136,158,733000,Student Wiggum,Germ Warfare Lab,"That's some nice glowering, Mr. B."
29404,136,160,736000,Mona Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,We'd met the enemy and it was Montgomery Burns. Drastic action had to be taken to stop his war machine.
29405,136,161,743000,Mona Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,"I put Homer to bed, Abe. And now I'm going out. It could be a late night. I'm meeting my destiny."
29406,136,162,749000,Grampa Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,So long.
29408,136,164,759000,Dennis Hopper,Germ Warfare Lab,"When this baby goes off, Burns' lab is gonna be history, man. Germ history. Oh, man, I got the munchies."
29409,136,165,787000,Student Wiggum,Germ Warfare Lab,No!... No! Wait a minute. Bronchial tubes clearing... Asthma disappearing! Acne remains. But asthma disappearing!
29410,136,166,801000,C. Montgomery Burns,Germ Warfare Lab,My germs! My precious germs! They never harmed a soul! They never even had a chance! Whoever did this will never get past me!
29411,136,167,813000,Mona Simpson,Germ Warfare Lab,You poor man. Let me help you up.
29413,136,168,819000,C. Montgomery Burns,Germ Warfare Lab,You just made a very big mistake. You'll spend the rest of your life in pris--
29414,136,169,824000,Student Wiggum,Germ Warfare Lab,My asthma's gone! Listen to me breathe!
29415,136,170,832000,Mona Simpson,Germ Warfare Lab,"From that moment on, my life as I knew it was over."
29417,136,172,836000,Kent Brockman,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,Only one member of the Springfield Seven was identified.
29418,136,173,839000,Kent Brockman,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,"She's been described as a woman in her early thirties, yellow complexion, and may be extremely helpful. For channel six news, I'm Kenny Brockelstein."
29419,136,174,847000,Mona Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,Homer?
29420,136,175,855000,Mona Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,"I'll miss you, Homer."
29422,136,177,861000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought I dreamed that kiss.
29423,136,178,865000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm so sorry I misjudged you, Mom. You had to leave to protect your family."
29424,136,179,870000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How did you survive?
29425,136,180,872000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I had help from my friends in the underground. Jerry Rubin gave me a job marketing his line of health shakes. I proofread Bobby Seale's cookbook. And I ran credit checks at Tom Hayden's Porsche dealership."
29426,136,181,883000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait a minute. There's one thing I don't understand. In all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me?"
29427,136,182,889000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,But I did. I sent you a care package every week.
29428,136,183,893000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, come on, Mom. We use that same line on the kids when they're at camp."
29429,136,184,896000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,But I did! I really did! I'll prove it to you.
29431,136,186,902000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Post Office,Any undelivered mail for Homer J. Simpson?
29432,136,187,904000,Postal Clerk,Springfield Post Office,"No. Oh, wait. This."
29433,136,188,907000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Post Office,Hey!
29434,136,189,907000,Postal Clerk,Springfield Post Office,That's what happens when you don't tip your letter carrier at Christmas.
29435,136,190,910000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Post Office,"Yes, I'd like to send this letter to the Prussian consulate in Siam by aero-mail. Am I too late for the 4:30 auto-gyro?"
29436,136,191,916000,Postal Clerk #2,Springfield Post Office,I better look in the manual.
29437,136,192,918000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Post Office,Ach. The ignorance.
