33056,151,2,48000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"Open the door, Maude! I don't have time for the secret knock!"
33057,151,3,52000,Maude Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"Oh, I'm panicking, Neddy. I can't work the knob!"
33060,151,6,68000,Kent Brockman,Sky,"This is Kent Brockman with a special report from the Channel 6 newscopter. A large bear-like animal, most likely a bear, has wandered down from the hills, in search of food or perhaps employment. Please, remain calm. Stay in your homes."
33062,151,8,88000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Looks like bad news for the... ...""Impson"" family."
33063,151,9,95000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Let's all calm down. Everyone's going to be just fine, as long as I've got enough beer."
33064,151,10,103000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, that does it. If I'm gonna be trapped inside the house I gotta go out and buy some beer."
33065,151,11,116000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now to drop gracefully through the windshield.
33066,151,12,123000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've got ya, dad!"
33068,151,14,135000,Chief Wiggum,Evergreen Terrace,"Sweet dreams, Smokey."
33069,151,15,140000,Barney Gumble,Evergreen Terrace,Animal tranquilizer!
33070,151,16,148000,Barney Gumble,Evergreen Terrace,Smooth.
33072,151,18,155000,Chief Wiggum,Evergreen Terrace,"Book 'em, Lou. One count of being a bear. And one count of being an accessory to being a bear."
33073,151,19,172000,Maude Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"Oh Marge, it was horrible. We were trapped in the house all afternoon and, well, we had to drink toilet water."
33074,151,20,181000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Well, things were bad everywhere."
33075,151,21,184000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,I'm sick of these constant bear attacks! It's like the freakin' country bear jamboroo around here.
33076,151,22,189000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"Well, now realistically, Homer, I've lived here some 30-odd years. This is the first and only bear I've ever seen."
33077,151,23,195000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Hey -- if you want wild bears eating your children and scaring away your salmon, that's your business. But I'm not gonna take it! Who's with me?"
33078,151,24,205000,Mob,Evergreen Terrace,/ I am! / We are! / etc.
33080,151,26,208000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,WE'RE HERE! WE'RE QUEER! WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BEARS!
33081,151,27,212000,Mob,Springfield Town Hall,WE'RE HERE! WE'RE QUEER! WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BEARS!
33082,151,28,216000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Town Hall,"Hey, Homer, that's a pretty catchy chant. Where'd you learn it?"
33083,151,29,219000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Oh, I heard it at the Mustache Parade they have every year."
33085,151,31,222000,Aide,MAYOR QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"Sir, there's an unruly mob to see you."
33086,151,32,226000,Mayor Joe Quimby,MAYOR QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Does it have an appointment?
33087,151,33,227000,Aide,MAYOR QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"Ahm, yes it does."
33088,151,34,229000,Seymour Skinner,MAYOR QUIMBY'S OFFICE,I phoned ahead.
33089,151,35,231000,Homer Simpson,MAYOR QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"Mr. Mayor, I hate to break it to you, but your city is infested with bears."
33090,151,36,236000,Moe Szyslak,MAYOR QUIMBY'S OFFICE,And these ones are smarter than the average bear. They swiped my pic-a-nic basket!
33091,151,37,241000,Helen Lovejoy,MAYOR QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Think of the children.
33092,151,38,242000,Mayor Joe Quimby,MAYOR QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Very well. I promise swift and decisive action against these hibernating hucksters.
33096,151,42,261000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Ahh, not a bear in sight. The bear patrol must be working like a charm."
33097,151,43,267000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"That's specious reasoning, Dad."
33098,151,44,269000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Thank you, Honey."
33099,151,45,270000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"By your logic, I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away."
33100,151,46,273000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Oh, how does it work?"
33101,151,47,275000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,It doesn't work.
33102,151,48,276000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Uh-huh.
33103,151,49,277000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,It's just a stupid rock.
33104,151,50,278000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Uh-huh.
33105,151,51,278000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"But I don't see any tigers around here, do you?"
33106,151,52,282000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Lisa, I want to buy your rock."
33107,151,53,292000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Woo-hoo! A perfect day -- zero bears, and one big fat hairy paycheck!"
33108,151,54,298000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Hey... how come my pay is so low?
33109,151,55,301000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"""Bear Patrol Tax: $5?!"" What?! This is an outrage! It's the biggest tax increase in history!"
33110,151,56,309000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"Actually, Dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history."
33111,151,57,312000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Let the bears pay the bear tax. I pay the Homer Tax.
33112,151,58,314000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,That's the Home-Owner Tax.
33113,151,59,316000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Well, anyway, I'm still outraged."
33115,151,61,323000,Mob,QUIMBY'S WAITING ROOM,DOWN WITH TAXES! DOWN WITH TAXES!
33117,151,63,327000,Helen Lovejoy,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Won't you think of the children?
33118,151,64,330000,Mayor Joe Quimby,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Are these morons getting dumber or just louder?
33119,151,65,333000,Aide,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"Uh, dumber, sir. They won't give up the Bear Patrol, but they won't pay taxes for it, either."
33120,151,66,338000,Mayor Joe Quimby,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Ducking this issue calls for real leadership.
33122,151,68,341000,Mayor Joe Quimby,QUIMBY'S OUTER OFFICE,"People, your taxes are high because of illegal immigrants! That's right, illegal immigrants. We need to get rid of them!"
33123,151,69,352000,Mob,QUIMBY'S OUTER OFFICE,Illegal immigrants?! / etc.
33124,151,70,354000,Moe Szyslak,QUIMBY'S OUTER OFFICE,"Immiggants?! I knew it was them! Even when it was the bears, I knew it was them!"
33125,151,71,359000,Helen Lovejoy,QUIMBY'S OUTER OFFICE,"Oh, won't somebody please think of the children?"
33126,151,72,363000,Mayor Joe Quimby,QUIMBY'S OUTER OFFICE,"In one week, the town will vote on a special referendum -- whether or not to deport all illegal immigrants from Springfield. It shall be known as Proposition 24!"
33129,151,75,381000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey German boy, go back to Germania!"
33130,151,76,385000,Ãœter,Springfield Elementary School,I do not deserve this. I have come here legally as an exchange student!
33131,151,77,390000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Young man, the only thing we exchanged for you is our national dignity."
33133,151,79,397000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,You want to pick on immigrants?! Then pick on Willie!
33134,151,80,400000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Willie, please. The children want to pick on someone their own size."
33135,151,81,405000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Ach.
33137,151,83,411000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't see how you can support Proposition 24, Dad."
33138,151,84,415000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Open your eyes, Lisa. Our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like Bart have lost the will to learn."
33139,151,85,422000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"There's no denying it, Sis."
33140,151,86,423000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"But immigration is what America's all about. Even the Simpson family immigrated to America. Right, Grampa?"
33141,151,87,429000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, you twisted my arm. The Simpson story begins back in the old country... I forget which one exactly..."
33143,151,89,437000,Grampa Simpson,GREAT GRAMPA SIMPSONS' HOME,My father would drone on and on about America. He thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread -- sliced bread having been invented the previous winter.
33144,151,90,448000,GREAT GRAMPA,GREAT GRAMPA SIMPSONS' HOME,"See this, son? That's where we're going to live. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but some day."
33145,151,91,455000,Grampa Simpson,GREAT GRAMPA SIMPSONS' HOME,"Later that day, we set sail for America."
33147,151,93,459000,Great Grampa Simpson,NEW YORK HARBOR,There it is! Our new home.
148161,151,95,464000,Young Grampa,Statue of Liberty,"Whee, I love America!"
33149,151,96,467000,GREAT GRAMMA SIMPSON,Statue of Liberty,Abe! Supper's on!
33150,151,97,469000,Grampa Simpson,Statue of Liberty,We had to move out once we'd filled the head with garbage. The end.
33152,151,99,476000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Yeah, when those immigrants get deported, there'll be more elbow room for regular Joes like you and me, Apu."
33153,151,100,482000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Ah... Mr. Simpson? It may astonish you to learn that I am an immigrant.
33154,151,101,487000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,You? Pfft. I don't believe it.
33155,151,102,489000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"No. In truth, an illegal immigrant, Sir. If Proposition 24 passes, I shall be forced to leave this country."
33156,151,103,497000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, I wish... Oh, I wish I could have stayed just one more year or two. There was so much I wanted to see and to do and to have done to me."
33157,151,104,507000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh my God. I got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of Proposition 24, I never stopped to think it might affect someone I cared about."
33158,151,105,517000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"You know what, Apu... I am really, really gonna miss you."
33160,151,107,539000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ya know what really aggravazes me, is them immiggants. They want all the benefits of livin' in Springfield, but they ain't even bothered to learn themselves the language."
33161,151,108,548000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Yeah. Those are exactly my sentimonies.
33163,151,110,555000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Eh, you said it, Barn."
33165,151,112,564000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Make the protesters go away and I'll give you the entire bottle.
33166,151,113,568000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, thank goodness. My first customers in a week."
33167,151,114,572000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,It's hard to believe someone so close to our family could be an illegal alien.
33168,151,115,576000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Alas, it is true. I came here shortly after my graduation from Cal Tech -- Calcutta Technical Institute..."
33170,151,117,584000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Calcutta Technical Institute,"As the top student in my graduating class of 7 million, I was accepted for graduate study in the United States."
33172,151,119,597000,Apu's Father,India,"Wherever you go and whatever you do, we will always love you. Make us proud, son."
33173,151,120,604000,Apu's Mother,India,Never forget who you are.
33174,151,121,606000,Young Apu,India,"I won't, mother. And I won't forget you, Manjula. I'm so sorry our arranged marriage will not come to pass."
33175,151,122,614000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,India,"Farewell, my beloved."
33177,151,124,615000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Springfield Heights Institute of Technology,I enrolled at Springfield Heights Institute of Technology under the tutelage of the brilliant Professor John Frink.
33179,151,126,623000,Young Frink,Computer Lab,"Well, sure, the Frinkiac 7 looks impressive -- Don't touch it. But I predict that within one hundred years, computers will be twice as powerful, ten thousand times larger, and so expensive that only the five richest kings of Europe will own them."
33180,151,127,638000,Young Apu,Computer Lab,Could it be used for dating?
33181,151,128,640000,Young Frink,Computer Lab,"Well, theoretically, yes. But -- the computer matches would be so perfect, as to eliminate the thrill of romantic conquest."
33182,151,129,649000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Computer Lab,"Nine glorious years later, I completed my Ph.D. thesis."
33183,151,130,653000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Computer Lab,"200,000 precisely-ordered punch cards comprising the world's very first tic-tac-toe program. Only the top human players could beat it."
33184,151,131,663000,Bart Simpson,Computer Lab,"Hey, what's this one for?"
33186,151,133,666000,Marge Simpson,Computer Lab,"So Apu, why didn't you go back to India when your student visa expired?"
33187,151,134,671000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Computer Lab,I did not feel right leaving without paying off my student loans.
33188,151,135,675000,Marge Simpson,Computer Lab,Uh-huh.
33189,151,136,676000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Computer Lab,"So I took a job at the Kwik-E-Mart. When my debts were wiped clean, I was all set to go, but by then I had made so many friends here."
33190,151,137,685000,Marge Simpson,Computer Lab,"What you're saying is so understandable... and really, your only crime was violating U.S. law."
33191,151,138,691000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Computer Lab,"Oh, you are one of the good ones."
33192,151,139,693000,Marge Simpson,Computer Lab,"You know what? I'm going to vote ""no"" on 24."
33193,151,140,697000,Lisa Simpson,Computer Lab,"Mom, you're the greatest. Can I have this licorice?"
33195,151,142,706000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Kwik-E-Mart,"Uh, good evening, young man. My name is Charles Norwood. Furthermore to this beer, I would also like three of your finest, cheapest cigars. Here's my I.D., which confirms my adultivity."
33196,151,143,724000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey, Kearney, this fake I.D., it is truly excellent."
33197,151,144,729000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Say, if you tell me where you obtained it, I'll overlook the ice cream sandwiches concealed in your armpits. Eh?"
33198,151,145,736000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Kwik-E-Mart,Deal.
33200,151,147,743000,Fat Tony,DARK ALLEY,"Okay, here are your fraudulent documents, Mr. Nahasapeemapetilan: your U.S. Passport, social security card, birth certificate, and your death certificate... just hold onto that one in your safe deposit box."
33201,151,148,757000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,DARK ALLEY,Most humble and grateful thanks to you.
33202,151,149,759000,Fat Tony,DARK ALLEY,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Can the courtesy, you're an American now. Remember: you were born in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Your parents were Herb and Judy Nahasapeemapetilan. And if you do not wish to arouse suspicion, I strongly urge you to act American."
33204,151,151,779000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey there, Homer, how's it hangin'?"
33205,151,152,781000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Low and lazy, so -- Hey! Say something again."
33206,151,153,788000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, you're just noticing the way I'm talking to you now. You see, it turns out I am an American citizen after all."
33207,151,154,796000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Apparently, I just plumb forgot about it. Say, let's take a relaxed attitude toward work and watch the baseball match. The NY Mets are my favorite squadron."
33208,151,155,809000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue."
33209,151,156,813000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh yeah, what was I thinking with that? Who needs the infinite compassion of Ganesha when I've got Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman staring at me from ""Entertainment Weekly"" with their dead eyes?"
33210,151,157,828000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Look at me. I've betrayed my Indian heritage, Sir. What would my parents think of me now?"
33211,151,158,836000,Tom Cruise,Kwik-E-Mart,"Make us proud, son."
33212,151,159,839000,Nicole Kidman,Kwik-E-Mart,Never forget who you are.
33213,151,160,841000,Cat,Kwik-E-Mart,Don't make the same mistake I did.
33214,151,161,846000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, forgive me, Mother, Father, I failed you!"
33215,151,162,857000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Who am I kidding. I am no citizen. This passport is a cheap forgery. A cheap two thousand dollar forgery.
33216,151,163,867000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"I have brought shame to my parents, to my homeland, and to myself."
33217,151,164,870000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Don't forget Ganesha.
33220,151,165,874000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"I cannot deny my roots and I can not keep up this charade. I only did it because I love this land, where I have the freedom to say and to think and to charge whatever I want. I want to stay, but as the real me -- not as some yahoo from Green Bay."
33221,151,166,896000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Wow. You must love this country more than I love a cold beer on a hot Christmas morning. Darn it, Apu, I'm not gonna let them kick you out!"
33222,151,167,908000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,I never should have bought this button. Can I have my three dollars back?
33223,151,168,911000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Store credit only.
33225,151,170,916000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Marge, look what I brought home."
33226,151,171,919000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer. Are you rounding up immigrants?"
33227,151,172,922000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Marge. Apu convinced me that Proposition 24 is a big mistake."
33228,151,173,927000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right! Now you've got all the Simpsons behind you, Apu!"
33229,151,174,931000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"That's nice, although three of you are below voting age."
33230,151,175,934000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And I'm not registered!
33231,151,176,936000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"I do appreciate your concern, really, but it is hopeless. The latest poll shows a whooping 85% support for Proposition 24."
33232,151,177,944000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Apu, why don't just marry some American broad, then dump her after you get your citizenship?"
33234,151,179,952000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Hello, Selma? Selma my dear? How are you? Uh-huh... uh-huh... uh-huh... Listen, shut up for a second. How would you like to marry Apu so he doesn't get deported?"
33235,151,180,963000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Kitchen,"I'd rather eat poison. My name's already Selma Bouvier Terwilliger Hutz McClure. God knows it's long enough without Nahasapeemapeti-whatever. From now on, I'm only marrying for love. And possibly once more for money."
33237,151,182,980000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oh, listen, it is hopeless. Poor Apu...."
33238,151,183,983000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, the government don't control the sky. What if you lived in a balloon?"
33239,151,184,988000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it!
33240,151,185,989000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Didja hear that, Mom? She's as dumb as me!"
33241,151,186,992000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, not what he said -- what he is. Grandfather. As in ""grandfather clause"". Apu, how long ago did your visa expire?"
33242,151,187,1001000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Seven years, but I don't--"
33218,151,188,1002000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,There was an amnesty declared for people who've been here as long as you! That means you can take the citizenship test!
33243,151,190,1009000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"But Apu, the vote on Proposition 24 is Tuesday. You'll have to pass the test before then."
33244,151,191,1015000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Oh no. That is not nearly enough time to learn over 200 years of American history.
33245,151,192,1020000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh. It can't be that many. C'mon, Apu. I'll be your tutor."
33246,151,193,1029000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Please identify this object.
33247,151,194,1031000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,It appears to be the flag which disappeared from the public library last year.
33248,151,195,1035000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Correct. Now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck. But why does the American flag have precisely 47 stars?
33249,151,196,1043000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Because this particular flag is ridiculously out of date. The library must have purchased it during the brief period in 1912 after New Mexico became a state but before Arizona did.
33250,151,197,1054000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... partial credit.
33251,151,198,1056000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, they may ask you to locate your town on a map of the U.S, so let's do that. Uh, Springfield, Springfield... Ah, right here."

33253,151,200,1071000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, whatcha doin -- studyin'?"
33254,151,201,1072000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,I'm so confused! I don't even know where I'm getting kicked out of anymore.
33256,151,203,1086000,Lou,Springfield Harbor,"Sign's floatin' away, Chief."
33258,151,205,1088000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"...Executive, legislative, and, uh, judicial."
33259,151,206,1092000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no, and no. Maybe we should start all over with the electrical college."
33260,151,207,1098000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Please, Mr. Simpson, my brain needs sleep. The test is in six hours, and many of these facts you speak of are completely new to me."
33261,151,208,1105000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sleep is for the weak, Apu! Now I'm gonna go to bed while you look over my notes from ninth grade history."
33262,151,209,1110000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Okay, Apu: stay awake and stay focused. ""Cotton Mather..."""
33263,151,210,1122000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Oh no! I fell asleep. I have forgotten everything that Mr. Homer taught me!
33264,151,211,1127000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Perfect. Let's roll.
33269,151,214,1150000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Harbor,"Alright men, here's the order of deportations. First we'll be rounding up your tired, then your poor, then your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."
33270,151,215,1160000,Eddie,Springfield Harbor,Breathers -- got it.
33272,151,217,1162000,I.N.S. AGENT,IMMIGRATION SERVICE,"All right, here's your last question: What was the cause of the Civil War?"
33273,151,218,1166000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,IMMIGRATION SERVICE,"Actually, there were numerous causes. Aside from the obvious schism between abolitionists and anti-abolitionists, economic factors both domestic and international played a significant--"
33274,151,219,1175000,I.N.S. AGENT,IMMIGRATION SERVICE,Hey...
33275,151,220,1176000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,IMMIGRATION SERVICE,What?

33283,151,228,1199000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"You know, Apu, in a way, all Americans are immigrants -- except Native Americans."
33284,151,229,1207000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Yeah, native Americans like us."
33285,151,230,1209000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"No, I mean American Indians."
33286,151,231,1210000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Backyard,Like me.

33296,151,241,1260000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,NO ON 24! NO ON 24! NO ON 24! NO - ON - TWEN - TY - FOUR!
