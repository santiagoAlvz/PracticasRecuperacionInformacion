147585,568,2,32000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Love you guys!
147586,568,3,59000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Jet pack! Of course I'm Clancy Wiggins, you idiot."
147587,568,4,69000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Chief... Clancy... Jetpack.
147589,568,6,76000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Okay, okay, I think I got it."
147590,568,7,104000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Now I got it. I got it.
147592,568,9,120000,Lou,Springfield Police Station,"Oof. Why don't you take that thing off, chief? It's starting to smell."
147593,568,10,139000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"What, so you can steal it and be Sky Police? Ohhh no. No way."
147594,568,11,147000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Um. Oh. Well... there's only one floating future cop who can find that missing jet pack -- the Sky Police!
147596,568,13,171000,Chief Wiggum,ABOVE SPRINGFIELD,THIS IS THE END OF SKY POLICE...
147597,568,14,179000,Chief Wiggum,ABOVE SPRINGFIELD,You were the wind beneath my ass.
147601,568,18,214000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,What percentage of prayers really come true?
147602,568,19,216000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Well, not all of them. Like, um, ninety percent?"
147603,568,20,221000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"God doesn't hear my prayers. If he did, I'd be at home on the couch playing video games in a diaper."
147604,568,21,227000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Oh, God gets your prayers, but he just clicks delete without reading them, like email updates from LinkedIn."
147607,568,24,235000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I hope no one was hurt.
147609,568,26,247000,Gil Gunderson,First Church of Springfield,"Don't worry, Reverend, according to your policy, your church is covered for everything but acts of God."
147611,568,27,254000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,But we believe everything that happens everywhere is an act of God.
147612,568,28,259000,Gil Gunderson,First Church of Springfield,"My jiminy, you're right! We're off the hook!"
147613,568,29,267000,Gil Gunderson,First Church of Springfield,Go Southern Illinois!
147614,568,30,269000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Saluki Strut!
147617,568,33,292000,Sideshow Mel,RUINED CHURCH,It's a mixed-use nightmare!
147619,568,35,321000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,But you don't go to our church.
147620,568,36,323000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Granted, I do not share your faith. But the yahoos in this town need a church to deliver weekly reminders not to steal -- from me, not to take a life -- my life."
147621,568,37,335000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Kwik-E-Mart,"Without organized religion I've lost me moral compass. Also I've, uh, I've been addicted to Oxy for a while now... yar."
147622,568,38,346000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Now this is what I have got in mind...
147623,568,39,348000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,I will whisper even though we are alone.
147626,568,42,350000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,FLANDERS,Marge has brought this heathen to aid us in our time of need.
147627,568,43,356000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FLANDERS,"Please do not call me a heathen. It offends Hanuman, the monkey-headed lord of winds, who believed the sun to be a ripe mango... Okay, I get it. I get why you say it."
147628,568,44,365000,Marge Simpson,FLANDERS,Apu thinks we can get the money -- at the casino playing blackjack.
147629,568,45,372000,Helen Lovejoy,FLANDERS,The casino?!
147630,568,46,373000,Agnes Skinner,FLANDERS,Blackjack's for suckers. My brother? He used to own three Arby's franchises -- lost 'em all at the tables and gave himself a shotgun tonsillectomy.
147631,568,47,387000,Agnes Skinner,FLANDERS,What I told you was to wait in the car.
147632,568,48,395000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FLANDERS,The Mumbai Institute of Tantric Sex... where I was recruited by a card-counting ring.
147633,568,49,414000,Ned Flanders,FLANDERS,Am I hearing this right? Is the church council truly considering... gambling?
147634,568,50,418000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,FLANDERS,"You know Ned, the Bible never explicitly condemns gambling. Biblical folks were always playing games of chance, like uh... drawing lots."
147635,568,51,439000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FLANDERS,Card counting is not gambling. It is math.
147636,568,52,442000,Marge Simpson,FLANDERS,And it's not even against the rules.
147638,568,53,444000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FLANDERS,Exactly. If you are caught you cannot be charged with any crime. The worst they will do is beat you with a phone book or break some fingers... But what is a little pain if your church is to be saved!
147639,568,54,457000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FLANDERS,It is all good.
147641,568,56,463000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Counting cards requires absolute focus. You must ignore all casino distractions.
147642,568,57,474000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"And beware of cocktail waitresses with free drinks and eyeball-height cleavage! They're not attractive, but you cannot look away!"
147643,568,58,481000,COCKTAIL WAITRESSES,Kwik-E-Mart,"Freshen your drink, hon? / Who had the scotch and soda? / Cocktails! Cocktails! / Another one hon?"
147644,568,59,486000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,You -- what is the count?
147646,568,61,491000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Get your head in the game, Mel!"
147647,568,62,493000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Remember, for this legal but-frowned-upon scheme to work, we must have complete secrecy. Do not tell anyone what you are doing."
147648,568,63,501000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Not even Homer?
147649,568,64,503000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Kwik-E-Mart,"Homer is many things, but not a good accomplice. If he gets involved and this scheme fails, what happens to our church?"
147650,568,65,519000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Even I saw that. I guess I can't tell Homer.
147652,568,67,534000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, to raise money, we're... putting on a revue."
147653,568,68,545000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, so, uh, I'm going out to rehearse... the revue."
147654,568,69,550000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Go, go make magic. You just go."
147655,568,70,554000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Revue...
147657,568,72,566000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,RIVERBOAT CASINO,Card counting is simple.
147658,568,73,568000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,RIVERBOAT CASINO,"You all sit at different tables, betting low, playing hand after hand, ""counting"" in your head how many high cards are left in the deck."
147659,568,74,577000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,RIVERBOAT CASINO,Ignore all distractions!
147660,568,75,585000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,RIVERBOAT CASINO,"When the count is high, you have a ""hot deck"" and the odds are in your favor. Then, you use a secret signal to call in The Closer."
147661,568,76,590000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,RIVERBOAT CASINO,"The Closer bets big, wins bigger, and the casino never suspects that it has been the victim of a morally-acceptable screw job."
147663,568,77,603000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,RIVERBOAT CASINO,"But use caution. There are eyes everywhere. Sooner or later, the casino will catch on..."
147665,568,79,624000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,SKOBO'S,What a haul!
147666,568,80,640000,Agnes Skinner,SKOBO'S,I think we can do something a little harder than that.
147667,568,81,646000,Sideshow Mel,SKOBO'S,Mmm! Now that's a marshmallow-y s'more-garita!
147671,568,85,653000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh boy oh boy.
147673,568,87,673000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,One AM lovin' and two AM steak? Night marriage rules! I guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue.
147674,568,88,683000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... the revue."
147675,568,89,689000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What are the skits about?
147676,568,90,690000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... pop culture and current events.
147677,568,91,693000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How do you transition between scenes -- hard blackouts or spotlight fades?
147678,568,92,698000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Both.
147679,568,93,698000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nice. You know, it wouldn't be a revue without songs. Tell me about one."
147680,568,94,703000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay... There's a song about, um... how Democrats and Republicans can't get along. It's called ""Cats and Dogs."""
147681,568,95,721000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You got yourself one hell of a show, Marge. One hell of a show."
147684,568,98,729000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FLANDERS' BASEMENT,"Okay, okay, don't get cocky, you rapture-waiting baby-baptizers! You had one good night, but now the casino is on to you. They're not going to let you anywhere near those blackjack tables... unless you wear these."
147685,568,99,743000,Marge Simpson,FLANDERS' BASEMENT,Disguises? I'm worried that our scam is becoming dishonest.
147686,568,100,753000,Ned Flanders,FLANDERS' BASEMENT,"Why, I bet the Lord is pleased as punch that we're using that dirty casino money to rebuild his temple. Our mission is one hundred percent pure."
147687,568,101,760000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,FLANDERS' BASEMENT,Where has this been all my life?
147688,568,102,765000,Sideshow Mel,FLANDERS' BASEMENT,I could be Sideshow anyone!
147690,568,104,769000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm telling mom about how the school freezer broke and they had to cook all the tater tots and the teachers took the extra tots home in manila envelopes!
147691,568,105,775000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm telling her!
147578,568,106,776000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You never let me tell!
147610,568,107,778000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, the freezer broke and--!"
147692,568,108,779000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Cook all the tater tots! / There were too many tots! / And the teachers took them home in manila envelopes! / I hate you!
147693,568,109,785000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ok, Mel. I'll be at the casino by ten. Meet me at the lounge by the J. Geils cover band."
147694,568,110,794000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you... a hostess?
147695,568,111,797000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Actually... my friends and I are using a system to win money to save the church.
147696,568,112,803000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe you're gambling.
147697,568,113,806000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not gambling! It's math.
147698,568,114,809000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Is Dad in on this takedown?
147699,568,115,810000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not a takedown! And I haven't told him about it -- yet.
147700,568,116,815000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"But it's okay for you guys to know, because you're finally grown-up enough to be trusted with adult information."
147701,568,117,822000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, we are grown up."
147702,568,118,824000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I know how much to tip a waiter.
147703,568,119,826000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I go on hikes with my friends where we talk about our problems.
147704,568,120,829000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll tell your dad everything in the morning when we have the money. But until then, I appreciate you keeping this very grown-up secret."
147711,568,127,872000,Marge Simpson,Motel Room,"Homie, Homie, I can finally tell you how we really got the money..."
147712,568,128,900000,Homer Simpson,Motel Room,"Marge? Some casino guys have me, and they want the money you took from them, or else."
147713,568,129,906000,Marge Simpson,Motel Room,This is all my fault.
147714,568,130,908000,Homer Simpson,Motel Room,"Just tell me one thing, Marge. Why did you lose faith in the revue? I mean, ""Cats and Dogs"" writes itself. CATS AND DOGS ON CAPITAL HILL / THEY DON'T GET ALONG AND NEVER WILL"
147715,568,131,920000,Homer Simpson,Motel Room,"CATS AND DOGS, SQUABBLE'S NEVER ENDING / EVEN WITH SO MUCH LEGISLATION PENDING!"
147717,568,133,932000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie. How did you end up at the casino?
147719,568,135,935000,Homer Simpson,RIVERBOAT CASINO,"Well, I was taking a moment to enjoy my after dinner night cap..."
147637,568,137,940000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, mom trusted us with a secret--"
147662,568,138,943000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,--but she hasn't come home yet and we're worried she's in trouble!
147722,568,140,947000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom's counting cards at the casino!
147723,568,141,950000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,If anything happens to Marge... we'll all be orphans!
147726,568,144,955000,Homer Simpson,RIVERBOAT CASINO,I'm comin' for ya baby!
147727,568,145,957000,Homer Simpson,RIVERBOAT CASINO,Have you seen this woman? Have you? Have you seen my wife?
147728,568,146,962000,SECURITY THUG #1,RIVERBOAT CASINO,This is your wife?
147729,568,147,963000,Homer Simpson,RIVERBOAT CASINO,Do you know where she is?
147730,568,148,964000,SECURITY THUG #2,RIVERBOAT CASINO,"Uh, we'd like to ask you some questions in our ""beating room."""
147731,568,149,964000,Homer Simpson,RIVERBOAT CASINO,"All right, as long as it's just questions."
147733,568,151,972000,Marge Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,Reverend! Reverend! They took Homer!
147734,568,152,978000,Helen Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Oh, Asphodel..."
147735,568,153,983000,Helen Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,Your corpse bride is getting cold!
147736,568,154,986000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Uh, one second, Belladonna! Helen and I have found that, uh, these new personas have been quite liberating..."
147737,568,155,992000,Helen Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,Was that a woman's voice? Send her in!
147738,568,156,998000,Marge Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"If we don't give back the money we won counting cards, the casino people are going to hurt Homer!"
147742,568,160,1028000,Homer Simpson,RIVERBOAT CASINO,Are you gonna put my head in a vise?
147743,568,161,1030000,SECURITY THUG #1,RIVERBOAT CASINO,We don't do that. We don't even have a vise.
147744,568,162,1032000,SECURITY THUG #2,RIVERBOAT CASINO,We just want the money your wife stole from us.
147745,568,163,1036000,Homer Simpson,RIVERBOAT CASINO,Stole? How is counting cards stealing?
147746,568,164,1038000,SECURITY THUG #2,RIVERBOAT CASINO,"Well, it's not really stealing."
147747,568,165,1040000,Homer Simpson,RIVERBOAT CASINO,Is it even cheating?
147748,568,166,1041000,SECURITY THUG #2,RIVERBOAT CASINO,"No, but-- it's just not allowed."
147749,568,167,1044000,Homer Simpson,RIVERBOAT CASINO,"I don't get it. Football players can do the quarterback sneak, and baseball players can steal bases. Why can't I just remember which cards have been played?"
147750,568,168,1051000,SECURITY THUG #1,RIVERBOAT CASINO,I can't take any more of this guy. Get the vise.
147751,568,169,1054000,Homer Simpson,RIVERBOAT CASINO,I knew you had a vise! I knew it!
147753,568,171,1062000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,BURNED CHURCH,"I'm sorry, Marge. Maybe your husband's suffering was all part of God's plan."
147754,568,172,1067000,Marge Simpson,BURNED CHURCH,"God's plan?! God isn't some video gamer up there controlling us like we were pac men and dig dugs! God isn't Sky Police. God didn't do this. I lied to my husband, and made my kids lie too! We did this."
147755,568,173,1084000,Ned Flanders,BURNED CHURCH,She's right. We thought we could enter the den of sin and emerge unscathed. But we were scathed! Those free ginger ales at the casino... I didn't declare them on my taxes!
147756,568,174,1096000,Marge Simpson,BURNED CHURCH,I'm going to do what I should've done in the first place.
147757,568,175,1100000,Sideshow Mel,BURNED CHURCH,Put on a revue?
147759,568,177,1112000,Marge Simpson,CASINO FLOOR,"I don't know if you watch us all the time, or if we're just like an ant farm you got for your birthday and left on the shelf, and every once in a while you check out what kind of crazy tunnels we've built."
147760,568,178,1123000,Marge Simpson,CASINO FLOOR,"Maybe we got it all wrong praying for things we want and hoping we get them. Maybe prayer is just taking a moment to tell yourself that there is good in the universe. And I'm going to sit here and focus on that good, and maybe, just maybe, I'll get my husband back."
147764,568,182,1157000,Marge Simpson,CASINO FLOOR,My family loves your microwave lasagnas.
147765,568,183,1160000,Casino Manager,CASINO FLOOR,It's not my division. But I'll tell Bill Kelley you said so.
147766,568,184,1174000,Marge Simpson,CASINO FLOOR,I want my husband back!
147767,568,185,1176000,Casino Manager,CASINO FLOOR,"Hm. Let me run it by Jennifer Yang. Oh wait, she's on maternity leave. Don't worry. I'm sure Chuck Bennett will sign off on it."
147768,568,186,1184000,Casino Manager,CASINO FLOOR,We are going to release your husband.
147769,568,187,1186000,Ned Flanders,CASINO FLOOR,"See Marge, someone up in the sky did hear your prayers..."
147770,568,188,1190000,Marge Simpson,CASINO FLOOR,They sure did... casino management.
147771,568,189,1195000,Casino Manager,CASINO FLOOR,You are free to leave as long as your faith-based card counting group never return to this or any other river or maritime casino.
147772,568,190,1203000,Homer Simpson,CASINO FLOOR,No deal!
147773,568,191,1203000,Marge Simpson,CASINO FLOOR,But we don't need to come back. We saved the church.
147774,568,192,1208000,Homer Simpson,CASINO FLOOR,No! An injustice has gone on here for too long.
147775,568,193,1211000,Homer Simpson,CASINO FLOOR,I'm not leaving this casino until you stop punishing people for counting cards. They're just playing the game by the rules!
147779,568,198,1227000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Homie, after all this, do you still believe in God?"
147780,568,199,1230000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,On a beautiful night like tonight... how could I not?
147782,568,201,1292000,Lou,Springfield Elementary School,"Next week on ""Sky Police""."
147786,568,205,1292000,Chief Wiggum,Warehouse District,Sky police!
