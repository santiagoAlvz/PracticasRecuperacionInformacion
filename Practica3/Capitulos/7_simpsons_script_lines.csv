150628,7,3,107000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,"Shut up, Flanders. Hey dad, how come we can't get a decent mower like the Flanders?"
150630,7,4,113000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,"Just be happy with what you got, son. Don't try to keep up with the Flanderses."
150632,7,6,124000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Front Yard,"How do you like my new wheels, Simpson?"
150633,7,7,126000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,"Wow, man! What an RV!"
150634,7,8,129000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,Bart! I suppose it has..uh..various features?

150636,7,10,139000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,A satellite dish!
150637,7,11,141000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Front Yard,Yes indeedilly-doodily.
150638,7,12,142000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,"But how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while... you make only twenty-seven dollars a week more than I do."
150639,7,13,149000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Front Yard,"Simple, Simpson. Credit."
150640,7,14,151000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,Oooh! Credit.
150642,7,16,163000,Cowboy Bob,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),"Thank you God. Heh, heh. May I help you?"
150643,7,17,167000,Marge Simpson,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),"We're just browsing, thank you."
150644,7,18,168000,Homer Simpson,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth?
150645,7,19,170000,Cowboy Bob,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),"Yes, I do. That would be... the Ultimate Behemoth."
150646,7,20,170000,Homer Simpson,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),Where is it?
150647,7,21,177000,Marge Simpson,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),Homer.
150648,7,22,177000,Cowboy Bob,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),We're standing in its presence. Behold! Isn't she... Look at this thing...
150649,7,23,184000,Cowboy Bob,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),Can you believe it? Man built this. It's a vehicle.
150651,7,25,186000,Bart Simpson,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),"Does it have its own satellite dish, sir?"
150652,7,26,188000,Cowboy Bob,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),"You can tell your son, it has its own satellite. The VanStar One launched last February, just for this thing. That's all."
150653,7,27,196000,Bart Simpson,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),Oh man!
150654,7,28,197000,Marge Simpson,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),I'm not sure that we can afford...
150655,7,29,199000,Homer Simpson,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),Does it have a deep fryer?
150656,7,30,201000,Cowboy Bob,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),It has four of them. One for each part of the chicken.
150657,7,31,204000,Marge Simpson,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),"I don't think we can afford this, Homer."
150658,7,32,205000,Salesman,Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us),Let's worry about that later. C'mon let's take a tour. Want to? C'mon.
150660,7,34,212000,Bart Simpson,INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH,Aye carumba!
150661,7,35,213000,Lisa Simpson,INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH,This is better than our house!
150662,7,36,216000,Homer Simpson,INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH,Wait till Flanders gets a load of this.
150663,7,37,219000,Marge Simpson,INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH,It all seems so expensive...
150664,7,38,221000,Homer Simpson,INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH,"Hey, how much is it?"
150665,7,39,225000,Cowboy Bob,INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH,You're a man of convict... You just wanted to ask that and blurted it out. Didn't you?
150666,7,40,230000,Homer Simpson,INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH,"Yeah, how much is it?"
150667,7,41,231000,Cowboy Bob,INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH,"Well, first of all, I want you to know, I like your face."
150668,7,42,235000,Homer Simpson,INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH,You do?
150669,7,43,236000,Cowboy Bob,INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH,Really. I really do. I'm not just saying that. I mean it. You've got color in there. You're not Roman are you?
150670,7,44,242000,Homer Simpson,INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH,No.
150671,7,45,243000,Cowboy Bob,INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH,"You look like a God, sort of. Why don't we step into the credit office, Zeus? Hey your dad's just gonna come in here and work it out. Then you'll drive home in this."
150673,7,47,254000,Cowboy Bob,INSIDE CREDIT OFFICE,"I'm not gonna quote you a price until I check your credit rating. Lemme. I want to make myself clear on this. This is a formality. If you're saying to me, Bob, is this guy good for it? I say, yes. I don't check this machine. But I don't own the place. Even though my name's up there. Long story. But that doesn't matter. I'm gonna have to run it through the computer."
150674,7,48,276000,Homer Simpson,INSIDE CREDIT OFFICE,Is that a good siren? Am I approved?
150675,7,49,279000,Cowboy Bob,INSIDE CREDIT OFFICE,"You ever known a siren to be good? Ha! No, Mr. Simpson, it's not. It's a bad siren. That's the computer in case I went blind telling me, sell a vehicle to this fellow and you're out of business. That's what the siren says."
150676,7,50,292000,Homer Simpson,INSIDE CREDIT OFFICE,Oh.
150677,7,51,292000,Cowboy Bob,INSIDE CREDIT OFFICE,It seems the Ultimate Behemoth is a wee bit out of your price range. And wee bit is me being polite. You couldn't afford this thing if you lived to be a million.
150678,7,52,301000,Homer Simpson,INSIDE CREDIT OFFICE,"Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? I don't want to go away empty-handed, Bob."
150679,7,53,307000,Cowboy Bob,INSIDE CREDIT OFFICE,Take it easy there. Don't ruin this feeling I'm getting from you. Perhaps I can show you something a little more... you.
150681,7,55,317000,Cowboy Bob,BACK OF THE RV LOT,"Well, what do you think?"
150682,7,56,321000,Marge Simpson,BACK OF THE RV LOT,"Used, isn't it?"
149553,7,57,323000,Cowboy Bob,BACK OF THE RV LOT,What'd you say?
149765,7,58,324000,Homer Simpson,BACK OF THE RV LOT,Is it used?
150683,7,59,325000,Cowboy Bob,BACK OF THE RV LOT,"Mr. Simpson, you're never gonna own a better RV. And I don't mean that in a good way. I mean literally, buddy, this is it for you. You know, it's this or a wagon."
150684,7,60,332000,Homer Simpson,BACK OF THE RV LOT,How much do you want for it?
150685,7,61,335000,Cowboy Bob,BACK OF THE RV LOT,"This is for you? This is yours? The price I'm quoting you? You're not gonna hand it to someone else? 'Cause I'm gonna give you a price for you, not for someone else... someone else, I'm doubling this."
150686,7,62,340000,Homer Simpson,BACK OF THE RV LOT,I swear it Bob.
150687,7,63,341000,Cowboy Bob,BACK OF THE RV LOT,This is you and me?
150688,7,64,341000,Homer Simpson,BACK OF THE RV LOT,Yeah!
150689,7,65,343000,Cowboy Bob,BACK OF THE RV LOT,"In other words, two months from now I see this vehicle, your head's in that window?"
150690,7,66,345000,Homer Simpson,BACK OF THE RV LOT,On my honor.
150691,7,67,346000,Cowboy Bob,BACK OF THE RV LOT,Three-fifty a month.
150692,7,68,347000,Homer Simpson,BACK OF THE RV LOT,"Oh, well, I don't know. Would it be alright if I conferred with my family?"
150693,7,69,352000,Cowboy Bob,BACK OF THE RV LOT,"Mr. Simpson, if you have to go talk it over with those humans out there, then, there's something wrong with all of us. You look like a man who is able to make a decision or I wouldn't be wasting my... See that man right over there?"
150694,7,70,361000,Homer Simpson,BACK OF THE RV LOT,Yeah!
150695,7,71,363000,Cowboy Bob,BACK OF THE RV LOT,He's buying this. Did you know that?
150696,7,72,363000,Homer Simpson,BACK OF THE RV LOT,No.
150697,7,73,364000,Cowboy Bob,BACK OF THE RV LOT,"Called me two minutes before you came in, said, 'Save the little one, I'm coming down'. Here he is. Now, do you want it or not?"
150698,7,74,370000,Homer Simpson,BACK OF THE RV LOT,All right. All right! I'll take it.
150699,7,75,371000,Cowboy Bob,BACK OF THE RV LOT,Best decision you're ever gonna make. You're gonna... This is gonna change your life.
150701,7,77,380000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey Flanders! Look what I got!
150702,7,78,384000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oooh, She's a beaut. Hey, congratulations, Simpson. I'm sure you'll have loads of fun."
150703,7,79,390000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Jealous. Everybody ready?
150704,7,80,392000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I hate this. I don't want to go.
150705,7,81,394000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"that's the spirit. Ready or not, nature here we come!"
150707,7,83,402000,Bart Simpson,Freeway,Turkey farm?
150708,7,84,403000,Lisa Simpson,Freeway,No.
150709,7,85,404000,Bart Simpson,Freeway,Skunks?
150710,7,86,405000,Lisa Simpson,Freeway,No.
150711,7,87,406000,Bart Simpson,Freeway,Slaughter house?
150712,7,88,407000,Lisa Simpson,Freeway,No.
150714,7,89,408000,Marge Simpson,Freeway,What are you two doing back there?
150715,7,90,410000,Lisa Simpson,Freeway,"We're playing ""What's that odor?""."
150716,7,91,410000,Bart Simpson,Freeway,Dad's feet.
150717,7,92,413000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,Bart!
150718,7,93,413000,Lisa Simpson,Freeway,"You win, Bart."
150719,7,94,414000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,Lisa!
150720,7,95,415000,Bart Simpson,Freeway,"Are we there yet, dad?"
150721,7,96,416000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,I'll tell you when we get there. Go back to your smell game.
150724,7,99,424000,Marge Simpson,Van,"Homer, I'm telling you this is not the Interstate."
150725,7,100,428000,Homer Simpson,Van,Pfft. Maps.
150726,7,101,429000,Marge Simpson,Van,Shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions?
150727,7,102,432000,Homer Simpson,Van,Don't worry. This is an all-terrain vehicle.
150728,7,103,438000,Marge Simpson,Van,My feet are getting wet!
150729,7,104,441000,Homer Simpson,Van,"Ah, come on. We're going back to nature."
150730,7,105,444000,Lisa Simpson,Van,"Mom, I'm scared."
150731,7,106,445000,Marge Simpson,Van,"We all are, dear. Your father says there's nothing to worry about."
150734,7,109,463000,Homer Simpson,Van,What do you think? Should we stop here?
150735,7,110,465000,Lisa Simpson,Van,Yes!!!
150736,7,111,466000,Homer Simpson,Van,All righty.
150737,7,112,471000,Homer Simpson,Van,"Well, here we are!"
150739,7,114,474000,Lisa Simpson,Van,Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
150740,7,115,485000,Homer Simpson,Van,"Okay, nobody move. Nobody panic. When I give the word, everyone ever so slowly open your door and slide out. On the count of three. One..."
150741,7,116,513000,Lisa Simpson,Van,The Simpsons have entered the forest.
150743,7,118,526000,Homer Simpson,NEAR THE EDGE OF CLIFF,"Well, heh heh, now we get a chance to be real pioneers."
150744,7,119,529000,Homer Simpson,NEAR THE EDGE OF CLIFF,"Yes sir! This is a real adventure. Why, I bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like this."
150745,7,120,536000,Bart Simpson,NEAR THE EDGE OF CLIFF,You mean like we just did?
150746,7,121,539000,Homer Simpson,NEAR THE EDGE OF CLIFF,Will somebody help her?
150747,7,122,540000,Lisa Simpson,NEAR THE EDGE OF CLIFF,"Look, Maggie! Birdies!"
150748,7,123,546000,Marge Simpson,NEAR THE EDGE OF CLIFF,"Oh, Homer. What are we going to do?"
150752,7,124,548000,Homer Simpson,NEAR THE EDGE OF CLIFF,"Now don't worry. Our situation isn't as bad as it seems. And you're forgetting, I'm an experienced woodsman. Now you all stay here for a minute while I go over this way and try to get my bearings."
150753,7,125,564000,Homer Simpson,NEAR THE EDGE OF CLIFF,What am I going to do? I've murdered us all.
150754,7,126,569000,Homer's Canyon Echo,NEAR THE EDGE OF CLIFF,I've murdered us all... us all.. us all... us all.
150755,7,127,572000,Homer Simpson,NEAR THE EDGE OF CLIFF,Shut up!
150756,7,128,573000,Homer's Canyon Echo,NEAR THE EDGE OF CLIFF,Shut up... shut up... shut up.
150760,7,132,579000,Homer Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,There! Finished.
150761,7,133,580000,Lisa Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,You are?
150762,7,134,581000,Homer Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"Well, it's a quick job, but it's shelter."
150763,7,135,583000,Marge Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,It is?
150764,7,136,583000,Homer Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"Uh-huh. Okay, we'll be back with help before you know it. You girls just stay here and relax."
150765,7,137,590000,Lisa Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"Remember, Dad. The handle of the Big Dipper points to the North Star."
150766,7,138,594000,Homer Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. We're in the woods."
150767,7,139,607000,Lisa Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"Should Maggie be going with them, Mom?"
150768,7,140,609000,Marge Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"Oh, I don't think they'll be gone long and she's in good hands, Lisa."
150769,7,141,618000,Bart Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"There aren't any dangerous animals in this forest are there, Dad?"
150770,7,142,621000,Homer Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"Well, might be a few. But don't worry about it. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone."
150771,7,143,626000,Bart Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,It's a deal.
150772,7,144,627000,Homer Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"And remember not to act afraid. Animals can smell fear. And they don't like it. Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of."
150773,7,145,634000,Bart Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,Right.
150774,7,146,638000,Homer Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,A rattler!
150775,7,147,639000,Bart Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not..."
150776,7,148,641000,Homer Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"Run, you fool!"
150779,7,151,653000,Homer Simpson,DEEP WOODS,"Through here, boy. Back to civilization."
150780,7,152,657000,Bart Simpson,DEEP WOODS,How do you know?
150781,7,153,658000,Homer Simpson,DEEP WOODS,"When you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things. It becomes natural. Like a third sense."
149795,7,154,682000,Homer Simpson,DEEP WOODS,Wahhhhhhhhh!
149859,7,155,682000,Homer Simpson,DEEP WOODS,Yahhhhhhhh!
150749,7,156,682000,Homer Simpson,DEEP WOODS,Wahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
150782,7,158,682000,Marge Simpson,The Girls' Campsite,The boys certainly are taking a long time. I hope Maggie isn't slowing them up too much.
150785,7,161,709000,Homer Simpson,BASE OF WATERFALL,"Bart? Where are you, Bart?"
150786,7,162,711000,Homer Simpson,BASE OF WATERFALL,His lucky red hat! Oh dear God! No! Bart!
150787,7,163,718000,Homer Simpson,BASE OF WATERFALL,"Bart! Oh Bart! Bart, Bart! Oh, Bart, my beautiful son. Why couldn't you have taken me? Of all the fates of heaven and earth, why did this one befall me?"
150788,7,164,738000,Bart Simpson,BASE OF WATERFALL,"Don't have a cow, Dad."
150789,7,165,740000,Homer Simpson,BASE OF WATERFALL,What the--? You're alive!... and... buck nekkid.
150790,7,166,746000,Bart Simpson,BASE OF WATERFALL,"I'm not the only one, Homeboy."
150791,7,167,748000,Homer Simpson,BASE OF WATERFALL,What? Oooh! Jungle Man!
150794,7,170,768000,Homer Simpson,SOMEWHERE IN WOODS,"The first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy: Conceal your nakedness."
150795,7,171,773000,Bart Simpson,SOMEWHERE IN WOODS,"Yeah, man."
150796,7,172,775000,Homer Simpson,SOMEWHERE IN WOODS,"Okay, slap a fern on there, boy. Now, some mud. There. Ooh! That requires a little mollusk. And mollusk for me. All right. We're ready to hit the town."
150797,7,173,789000,Bart Simpson,SOMEWHERE IN WOODS,"But dad, I'm so hungry. Can't we eat something first? I'm starving, man."
150798,7,174,794000,Homer Simpson,SOMEWHERE IN WOODS,"Ah food. Good thinking, son."
150799,7,175,796000,Homer Simpson,SOMEWHERE IN WOODS,This young sapling ought to do the trick.
150800,7,176,801000,Bart Simpson,SOMEWHERE IN WOODS,"What are we going to do, hang ourselves?"
150801,7,177,804000,Homer Simpson,SOMEWHERE IN WOODS,"No. This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy."
150802,7,178,809000,Homer Simpson,SOMEWHERE IN WOODS,Shhhh! Just watch.
150803,7,179,813000,Homer Simpson,SOMEWHERE IN WOODS,"Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!"
150805,7,181,822000,Homer Simpson,Forest,"Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into those bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him."
150806,7,182,832000,Bart Simpson,Forest,"Right, Dad."
150807,7,183,837000,Homer Simpson,Forest,Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Aaah!
150809,7,185,847000,Camper Father,A CAMPGROUND NEAR THE BEAR CAVE,"Great camping trip, honey. We travel eight hundred miles and we haven't seen a squirrel yet."
150810,7,186,852000,Camper Mother,A CAMPGROUND NEAR THE BEAR CAVE,"Well, the Ranger at the gate said we should watch out for bears."
150812,7,187,854000,Camper Father,A CAMPGROUND NEAR THE BEAR CAVE,"Bears. Right. Right. Let me show you how many bears are around here. Um hello, bears. Um come on, have a donut... what the heck, have me? Come and get it?"
150813,7,188,868000,Camper Mother,A CAMPGROUND NEAR THE BEAR CAVE,All right. all right. You made your point.
150814,7,189,870000,Camper Father,A CAMPGROUND NEAR THE BEAR CAVE,Bears.
150817,7,192,904000,Lisa Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,I hope Maggie and the boys are all right.
150818,7,193,907000,Marge Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"Oh, I'm sure they're just fine. After all, we built a fire and we don't know anything about nature. Imagine what your father, an experienced woodsman, has done."
150819,7,194,917000,Lisa Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"Yeah, I suppose so. Night Mom."
150820,7,195,921000,Marge Simpson,Marge and Lisa's Campsite,"Goodnight, dear."
150822,7,197,925000,Bart Simpson,A CLEARING IN THE WOODS,"G-g-good night, D-dad."
150823,7,198,930000,Homer Simpson,A CLEARING IN THE WOODS,"G-g-good night, s-son. S-sleep tight."
150826,7,201,952000,Bart Simpson,THE DEEP WOODS,Are we there yet?
150827,7,202,953000,Homer Simpson,THE DEEP WOODS,No.
150828,7,203,954000,Bart Simpson,THE DEEP WOODS,Are we ever going to be there?
150829,7,204,955000,Homer Simpson,THE DEEP WOODS,How would I know. Quit asking pointless... Bart look!
150830,7,205,961000,Homer Simpson,THE DEEP WOODS,Honey! Honey! We're saved!
150831,7,206,965000,Bart Simpson,THE DEEP WOODS,Uh Homer. Bees!
