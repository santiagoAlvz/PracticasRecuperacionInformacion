46141,199,9,60000,Krusty the Clown,TV STATION,"Man, you'd think the quality would dip after fifty-five hundred shows, but..."
46142,199,10,66000,Executive,TV STATION,"Well, the FCC isn't laughing. They don't believe kids are learning anything from Itchy and Scratchy."
46143,199,11,71000,Krusty the Clown,TV STATION,"Oh, please. What don't they learn? Don't trust mice... Cats are made of glass..."
46144,199,12,77000,Executive,TV STATION,Our license renewal is on the bubble. We need educational programming fast.
46145,199,13,82000,Krusty the Clown,TV STATION,What about that Mattel and Mars Bar Quick Energy Chocobot Hour?
46146,199,14,86000,Executive,TV STATION,"That's barely legal as it is. Here's what I was thinking. A newscast for kids, by kids."
46147,199,15,91000,Krusty the Clown,TV STATION,"Well, you're not taking any time out of my show. It's jammed up as it is. There's the monologue, those idiot puppets, Krusty's nap time, the second monologue, Paul Harvey, Senor Papino. I tell ya, it's the tightest three hours and ten minutes on TV."
46148,199,16,106000,Executive,TV STATION,We're cutting ten minutes from your show.
46149,199,17,108000,Krusty the Clown,TV STATION,"Well, I guess we could trim the hobo parade to a lean twenty."

46167,199,35,184000,Bart Simpson,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,I really didn't want it to come to this...

46171,199,39,199000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, I've selected you to be that child anchor."
46172,199,40,207000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I know. I already jumped to that conclusion.
46173,199,41,209000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Hmf. All right, if you're so smart, tell me who I selected to be lunch room monitor."
46174,199,42,214000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Me?
46175,199,43,215000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Take your sash and go.
46177,199,45,221000,Groundskeeper Willie,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,This isn't right! This isn't right at all!

46184,199,52,256000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,The man knows quality work.
46185,199,53,257000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,"This time you're in for it, Bart."
46186,199,54,260000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What's he gonna do?
46187,199,55,261000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,I'll kill ya!
46189,199,57,265000,Nurse,Springfield Elementary School,All right. Back on the stretcher.
46191,199,59,268000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,...And I'll be able to tackle all the hard-hitting children's news the grown-up controlled media won't touch. Plus I get to be on TV!
46192,199,60,275000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you. All your hard work and grade grubbing have finally paid off!"
46193,199,61,282000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So who's on your news team? Nerd, nerd... Nelson?!"
46194,199,62,286000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we used to date. Plus, he threatened me."
46195,199,63,288000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, don't worry about sports. I got that covered."
46196,199,64,290000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Back off, Bart. This may be the only chance I get as a second grader to produce my own TV show, and I'm not gonna let you screw it up."
46197,199,65,297000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Mo-om...
46198,199,66,298000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, let your brother do sports."
46199,199,67,300000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mo-om...
46200,199,68,301000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That ""Mom"" stuff doesn't work on me."
46202,199,70,306000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oooh, the gum with the cracker center. Mmm."
46203,199,71,311000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"That'll do it, Apu. So just--"
46205,199,73,317000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Do not be alarmed. That is just my helper monkey, sir. I got him after a robber shot me six times and left me for dead."
46206,199,74,325000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Helper monkey, eh?"
46208,199,76,331000,Nelson Muntz,TV STATION,"Hey, I'm on TV! Fart!"

46213,199,81,345000,Lisa Simpson,TV STATION,"Come on, this isn't a joke. All over town, kids are just waking up from their naps, cranky and hungry for the news."
46214,199,82,351000,Milhouse Van Houten,TV STATION,"Wow, Kent Brockman."
46215,199,83,354000,Kent Brockman,TV STATION,"Good luck, kids. Where the hell's my grilled cheese?"
46218,199,86,361000,Homer Simpson,Animal Assistants,"I'd like a monkey, please. And maybe one of those dogs. What do they do?"
46219,199,87,365000,Agency Clerk,Animal Assistants,"Ah, they serve as seeing eyes for the blind, sir."
46220,199,88,368000,Homer Simpson,Animal Assistants,Do they do any other tricks?
46221,199,89,370000,Agency Clerk,Animal Assistants,No.
46222,199,90,371000,Homer Simpson,Animal Assistants,Just the monkey then.
46223,199,91,372000,Agency Clerk,Animal Assistants,"Ahh, may I inquire as to how you are ""differently abled""?"
46224,199,92,376000,Homer Simpson,Animal Assistants,"Oh-ho-ho, I'm not handicapped. I'm just lazy."
46225,199,93,381000,Agency Clerk,Animal Assistants,"Uh, sir, helper monkeys are only for the physically challenged or enfeebled."
46226,199,94,385000,Homer Simpson,Animal Assistants,"Enfeebled?! Oo, I know just the guy! Be right back."
46227,199,95,392000,Grampa Simpson,Animal Assistants,"Oh, son, this monkey's gonna change my life."
46228,199,96,397000,Homer Simpson,Animal Assistants,Mind if I take him for a ride?
46229,199,97,398000,Grampa Simpson,Animal Assistants,"Sure, I'll just stand here."
46230,199,98,403000,Grampa Simpson,Animal Assistants,"Mmm, I can't wait to eat that monkey."
46233,199,100,409000,Nelson Muntz,TV Studio,"And now, Kids News... ... with Kids News anchor, Lisa..."
46234,199,101,416000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"Thank you. Our top story today: in a move that could affect children townwide, the library book-purchase committee slashed its budget by three percent. First on the chopping block, periodicals."
46235,199,102,428000,Krusty the Clown,TV Studio,Bo-ring...
46236,199,103,430000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"And now, sports."
46237,199,104,431000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,Bart Simpson telling you to lock the doggy in the barn 'cause here comes dodgeball action!
46238,199,105,436000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"The shirts continued their domination over the skins today. And in schoolyard fights...the highly anticipated match between Kearney and Mr. Largo ended in a disqualification, for use of dog doo on a stick. Lisa?"
46239,199,106,449000,Nelson Muntz,TV Studio,Aaannnd we are... out.
46240,199,107,452000,Executive,TV Studio,"All right, kids, we learned a lot today. Now, this is what makes my job difficult. Bart, you're off the sports beat."
46241,199,108,459000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,What?!
46242,199,109,460000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"Sorry, Bart, but you've got to take some things seriously."
46243,199,110,463000,Executive,TV Studio,"From now on, you're Lisa's co-anchor."
46244,199,111,465000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,What?!
46245,199,112,466000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"Oooh, that's gotta hurt!"
46248,199,115,472000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"Anchorman, huh? Well, if I'm gonna be an anchorman, I'd better go bleach the crud off my teeth. I'll be in makeup."
46249,199,116,480000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"I don't need a co-anchor. I'm a straight ""A"" student."
46250,199,117,483000,Executive,TV Studio,"Lisa, Bart's got something you can't learn in school: zazz."
46251,199,118,486000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"What is ""zazz""?"
46252,199,119,488000,Executive,TV Studio,"Zing, zork, kapowza. Call it what you want. In any language, it spells mazuma in the bank."
46253,199,120,493000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"""Zork?"" What is ""zork""?"
46254,199,121,495000,Executive,TV Studio,"I didn't say zork. The point is, the camera loves him."
46255,199,122,498000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"But that trivializes the whole idea of kids news. I mean, let's be honest. Bart's not exactly the brightest penny in the fountain."
46256,199,123,505000,Executive,TV Studio,"In English, Lisa."
46257,199,124,507000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,Damn blueberry stains.
46258,199,125,510000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"Look, I love Bart... But he's never even read a newspaper."
46259,199,126,514000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"Between you and me, he's well... kinda dumb."
46261,199,129,527000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"There a problem, honey?"
46262,199,130,528000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Monkey! There's a monkey in the house!
46263,199,131,532000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Relax. It's only Mojo. Mojo, Marge. Marge, Mojo. He can do anything you show him. Watch."
46264,199,132,539000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Simpson residence.
46266,199,134,545000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why didn't you tell me you were bringing home a filthy monkey?
46267,199,135,550000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"This ""filthy monkey"" made the orange juice you're drinking."
46268,199,136,556000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll show Lisa who's dumb. ""Supreme Court reverses..."" I won't turn to the comics, I won't turn to the comics."
46269,199,137,566000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, I'll read one comic just to get me rollin'. ""Archie."" ""Hey, Jughead, didja hear, the Supreme Court reversed..."""
46270,199,138,573000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, am I dumb?"
46271,199,139,579000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, I'd love to reassure you, but right now Mommy needs a tetanus shot."
46273,199,141,588000,Bart Simpson,Kent Brockman's House,"Mr. Brockman, I need your help. I've got to become a great anchor so I can show up my sister."
46274,199,142,592000,Kent Brockman,Kent Brockman's House,"Sister, eh? Well, I've got a sister. Miss big-shot-CNN-Washington-correspondent. Well, she's not the boss of me. Come in."
46276,199,144,603000,Kent Brockman,BROCKMAN'S HOUSE,Let's take the trophy route to the den.
46277,199,145,606000,Kent Brockman,BROCKMAN'S HOUSE,"Twelve Newsies, seven Iron Mics, four Golden Coifs... This is the most prestigious award that Del Monte gives..."
46278,199,146,614000,Kent Brockman,BROCKMAN'S HOUSE,Do you wanna hear my award-winning secret? Human interest stories. They tug at the heart and fog the mind. Observe.
46279,199,147,623000,Kent Brockman,BROCKMAN'S HOUSE,"Hear that? It's the sound of children's laughter. Silenced. That's because tomorrow, this old carousel, which has delighted young Americans for lo these past six years, will be torn down to make way for the future: a store that sells designer mouse pads."
46280,199,148,643000,Kent Brockman,BROCKMAN'S HOUSE,"Well, I guess there's no room in this modern world for old Blackie here. But, if you don't mind, this reporter is going for one last ride."
46281,199,149,655000,Kent Brockman,BROCKMAN'S HOUSE,This is Kent Brockman... ...reporting.
46283,199,151,670000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"And now... ""Kids News."""
46284,199,152,673000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge! The kids are on!
46285,199,153,676000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmf. The monkey's on my part of the sofa.
46286,199,154,679000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, he's clearly marked his territory."
46289,199,157,683000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"We'll bring you more on this chalk shortage as it continues. And now, Bart's been looking into that alleged ham salad from yesterday's school lunch."
46290,199,158,692000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"No, I haven't, Lisa. Because I went out with a camera and did a different kind of story."
46291,199,159,697000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"Bart, I really think we should stick--"
46292,199,160,699000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"It's about a man. A simple man. He's one of... ""Bart's People."""
46293,199,161,703000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"Joe Banks, 82 years young, has come to this pond every day for the past 17 years to feed the ducks. But last month, Joe made a discovery. The ducks were gone."
46294,199,162,720000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,Some say the ducks went to Canada. Others say Toronto. And some people think that Joe used to sit down there... near those ducks. But it could be that there's just no room in this modern world for an old man and his ducks.
46295,199,163,745000,C. Montgomery Burns,TV Studio,"Smithers, do you think maybe my power plant killed those ducks?"
46296,199,164,750000,Waylon Smithers,TV Studio,"There's no maybe about it, sir."
46297,199,165,754000,C. Montgomery Burns,TV Studio,Excellent.
46298,199,166,755000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,"Marge, can I get a duck?"
46299,199,167,757000,Marge Simpson,TV Studio,You already have a monkey.
46300,199,168,760000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,Can he get a duck?
46301,199,169,761000,Marge Simpson,TV Studio,No!
46302,199,170,766000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,One man. No ducks. Lisa?
46303,199,171,769000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,That's Kids News. Good night.
46304,199,172,773000,Nelson Muntz,TV Studio,"Way to go, Bart."
46305,199,173,777000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,That wasn't news. That was sappy manipulative drivel.
46306,199,174,781000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"Well, I'm sorry you couldn't feel for old Joe."
46307,199,175,784000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"You didn't feel for him either, you big fat phony."
46308,199,176,787000,Executive,TV Studio,"Bart, look up here. This is where the tears would be if I could cry. But I can't. Botched facelift. You could learn a lot from him, Maryann."
46309,199,177,795000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,It's Lisa.
46310,199,178,796000,Executive,TV Studio,Maryann's better.
46312,199,180,799000,Lisa Simpson,RAMSHACKLE HOUSE,They want cheap sentiment? I'll pump 'em so full of sap they'll be blowing their nose with a pancake.
46313,199,181,804000,Lisa Simpson,RAMSHACKLE HOUSE,"They call her the Cat Lady. People say she's crazy, just because she has a few dozen cats. But can anyone who loves animals that much really be crazy?"
46316,199,184,820000,Lisa Simpson,Railroad Tracks,The old Union Pacific doesn't come by here much anymore...
46320,199,188,844000,Homer Simpson,DONUT SHOP,Come on. Come to Poppa.
46321,199,189,849000,Homer Simpson,DONUT SHOP,"Good boy, Mojo. Now, bring 'em down and I'll give you one."
46323,199,191,857000,Homer Simpson,DONUT SHOP,Would you... Stop that! You're a helper monkey. This isn't helping!
46324,199,192,863000,Homer Simpson,DONUT SHOP,"Oh, I don't need your pity."
46325,199,193,874000,Bart Simpson,DONUT SHOP,"Our forgotten veterans. Their guns are quiet now. Their helmets lost, or pawned. And yet here they are, making flags out of old clothes. Sure, they may not have the right number of stripes, and the colors are all wrong, and some purists will tell you the American flag doesn't contain the word, ""Jordache."" But you know, if they run this up the flagpole, I'll salute. I'm Bart Simpson."
46326,199,194,900000,Lisa Simpson,DONUT SHOP,"Hmm, thank you, Bart, for yet another touching ""Bart's People."" Now, turning to--"
46327,199,195,906000,Bart Simpson,DONUT SHOP,I just think our veterans deserve a little recognition.
46328,199,196,908000,Lisa Simpson,DONUT SHOP,"That's what Veterans Day is for, Bart."
46329,199,197,911000,Bart Simpson,DONUT SHOP,But is that really enough to honor our brave soldiers?
46330,199,198,915000,Lisa Simpson,DONUT SHOP,They also have Memorial Day.
46331,199,199,918000,Bart Simpson,DONUT SHOP,"Oh, Lisa, maybe you're right. Maybe you're wrong. The important thing is Veterans deserve a day to honor them."
46332,199,200,924000,Lisa Simpson,DONUT SHOP,They have two.
46333,199,201,925000,Bart Simpson,DONUT SHOP,"Well, maybe they should have three. I'm Bart Simpson."
46335,199,203,931000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my, look at all these letters from people who want to be Bart's People, Bart."
46336,199,204,935000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I wish they could all be Bart's People, Mom. I truly do."
46337,199,205,940000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm proud of you, honey. You're finally giving something back to the community, after taking so, so much."
46338,199,206,948000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmm. It really makes you think.
46340,199,207,951000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"What does that even mean? Mom might not see through you, but I do. You don't care about any of these people."
46341,199,208,957000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if I'm guilty of anything, maybe it's caring too much. I'm Bart Simpson."
46342,199,209,962000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Stop talking like that! Stop it!
46343,199,210,964000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, please. You have absolutely no reason to be jealous. You're still a very important part of Bart's show."
46345,199,212,977000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Bart's show."" If everybody knew what a phony Bart was, he'd be off that show so fast... I've got it!"
46347,199,214,997000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"Hey Lis, be a doll and hand me that sealant."
46348,199,215,1003000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"Hey, here's another letter for Bart's People."
46349,199,216,1003000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"Oh, so many souls, so little air time."

46393,199,262,1216000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,"Well, not literally. But in a way, isn't he everyone's son? For you see, that little ""hell-raiser"" is the spawn of every shrieking commercial, every brain-rotting soda pop, every teacher who cares less about young minds than about cashing their big, fat paychecks. No, Bart's not to blame. You can't create a monster and then whine when he stomps on a few buildings. I'm Lisa Simpson."
