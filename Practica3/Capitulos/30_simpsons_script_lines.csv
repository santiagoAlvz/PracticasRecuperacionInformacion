157686,30,215,905000,KENT,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Is Grampa Simpson a modern day saint, a rich nut, or both? Only time will tell."
157687,30,216,911000,KENT,Springfield Retirement Castle,This is Kent Brockman on line for an old man's money.
157691,30,217,914000,Otto Mann,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Now you see, Gramps, I want to customize the bus. Y'know, chop the top, jack it up, put mag wheels on it, psychedelic paint job, from hell, man. Jam the kids to school at 150 miles an hour. Here's an artist's rendering. Note the cobra wrapped around the naked chick..."
157692,30,218,932000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Next!
157693,30,219,935000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Grampa -- I can call you Grampa, can't I?"
157694,30,220,938000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yeah, yeah... go ahead."
157695,30,221,939000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,"I need that money. Please, please..."
157696,30,222,942000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Wait... wait a minute... wait. You're the guy who owns the nuclear power plant.
157697,30,223,947000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well, the ownership is divided."
157698,30,224,948000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,What the hell do you think you're doing?
157699,30,225,949000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Mr. Simpson, I dread the day when a hundred thousand dollars isn't worth groveling for."
157700,30,226,954000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Get outta here.
157701,30,227,956000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,"You just made yourself a very powerful enemy, old man."
157702,30,228,960000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Here's the deal, Grampa. A guy, I think was an explorer, left this in the bar one night. It may be a map to ancient treasure, or directions to some guy's house, but to find out, we'll need money, we'll need provisions, and a two man diving bell."
157703,30,229,976000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"It's pretty stupid, but so far you're the front runner."
157705,30,231,980000,MONROE,Springfield Retirement Castle,It's a special isolation chamber. The subject pulls levers to receive food and warmth. The floor can become electrified and showers of icy water randomly fall on the subject. I call it the Monroe Box.
157706,30,232,991000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Huh, uh. Well, it sounds interesting."
157707,30,233,991000,MONROE,Springfield Retirement Castle,Huh uh.
157708,30,234,996000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,How much will it cost to build?
157709,30,235,998000,MONROE,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, that's the beauty part, it's already built. I need the money to buy a baby to raise in the box until the age of thirty."
157710,30,236,1004000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,What are you trying to prove?
157711,30,237,1005000,MONROE,Springfield Retirement Castle,Well my theory is that the subject will be socially maladjusted and will harbor a deep resentment towards me.
157712,30,238,1011000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Hm, interesting."
157713,30,239,1013000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Let's see, I want a teargas can, a blue gun with paralyzer darts..."
157532,30,240,1017000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Oh no.
157660,30,241,1018000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Nunchucks.
157661,30,242,1019000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Nunchucks?
157688,30,243,1019000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Yeah.
157689,30,244,1020000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,I don't know.
157714,30,245,1021000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,A copy of Radioactive Man number 27. That's the first time he fights Dr. Crab. Then I wanna buy that baseball card where the guy is flippin' the bird.
157715,30,246,1029000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh yeah, I've seen that one."
157716,30,247,1030000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Oh and the
157717,30,248,1031000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,What the hell is that?
157718,30,249,1034000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Why, it's a death ray, my good man. Behold!"
157719,30,250,1037000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Hey, feels warm. Kinda nice."
157720,30,251,1041000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well, it's just the prototype. With proper funding, I'm confident this little baby could destroy an area the size of New York City."
157721,30,252,1047000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"But I want to help people, not kill 'em."
157722,30,253,1050000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh. To be honest, the ray only has evil applications."
157723,30,254,1054000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Retirement Castle,"You know, my wife will be happy. She's hated this whole death ray thing from day one."
157724,30,255,1059000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Oh Lisa. What makes you think you deserve all that money?
157725,30,256,1065000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"I don't deserve it, Grampa. No one here does. The people who deserve it are on the streets and they're in the slums. They're little children who need more library books and families who can't make ends meet. Of course, if you really wanted to, you could buy me a pony."
157726,30,257,1080000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,You're right.
157727,30,258,1081000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,I'll name her Princess and I'll ride her every day.
157728,30,259,1085000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"No, you're right about all the poor souls who need a helping hand. I need to take a walk to clear my head."
157729,30,260,1094000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, I'm exhausted."
157730,30,261,1105000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, poor baby. Been lifting your wallet?"
157731,30,262,1108000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"No, I'll have you know, I've decided to give my money away to truly needy causes. But a hundred thousand dollars just isn't enough. I need more."
157732,30,263,1119000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well, why don't you go on the seniors gambling junket? I bet you could double your money or even triple it."
157733,30,264,1125000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well, it's tempting."
157734,30,265,1126000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Plus, they've got a ninety-nine cent shrimp cocktail."
157735,30,266,1128000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,You've sold me.
157737,30,268,1131000,Old Man Daly,Bus,Slow down. Are you trying to get us killed?
157738,30,269,1135000,Old Man McGrath,Bus,"It's too hot, you maniac. Turn on the air, already."
157739,30,270,1137000,Otto Mann,Bus,"Hey, mellow out old dudes, or I'll jam this baby into a river."
157741,30,272,1146000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Miss, I'm looking for Abe Simpson."
157742,30,273,1148000,Receptionist,Springfield Retirement Castle,Huh uh.
157743,30,274,1148000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,It's important I get a hold of him. I have to tell him I don't care about his money and I love him.
157744,30,275,1153000,Receptionist,Springfield Retirement Castle,We get that a lot.
157745,30,276,1155000,Receptionist,Springfield Retirement Castle,He left this morning with the senior casino junket.
157746,30,277,1157000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Casino?
157748,30,279,1163000,Otto Mann,Highway,"C'mon, everybody."
157750,30,281,1173000,Plato,Casino,"Hello, I am Plato. Please partake of Keno, craps and the loosest slots in town. My philosophy is ""Enjoy."""
157751,30,282,1180000,Grampa Simpson,Casino,"Change, please."
157753,30,284,1192000,Homer Simpson,Highway,"A double cheese burger, onion rings, large strawberry shake, and for God's sakes, hurry!"
157755,30,286,1197000,Grampa Simpson,Casino,"Five thousand dollars on, hmmmm, hmmm, let's see...a... what century is this?"
157756,30,287,1201000,Croupier,Casino,The twentieth.
157757,30,288,1202000,Grampa Simpson,Casino,Great! Put it on number twenty.
157758,30,289,1203000,Homer Simpson,Casino,"Excuse me. Excuse me, have you seen an old man with a lot of money? He looks like me, but he's wrinkled? Hello, have you seen a..."
157759,30,290,1208000,Homer Simpson,Casino,Dad! Noooooooooo!
157760,30,291,1214000,Croupier,Casino,"Twenty, black."
157761,30,292,1214000,Homer Simpson,Casino,Holy Moly! You're winning!
157762,30,293,1217000,Grampa Simpson,Casino,"Beat it, boy, you're crampin' my style."
157763,30,294,1220000,Homer Simpson,Casino,"Dad! Please, you gotta quit while you're ahead. You understand that, take all your money and leave now."
157764,30,295,1223000,Grampa Simpson,Casino,"Sorry, boy, I have to get enough to help everybody."
157765,30,296,1226000,Homer Simpson,Casino,But you could lose everything. Come on.
157766,30,297,1228000,Grampa Simpson,Casino,"Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: ""If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss and lose, and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss... Yours is the earth and everything that's in it. And -- which is more -- you'll be a man, my son."""
157767,30,298,1253000,Homer Simpson,Casino,You'll be a bonehead. Come on.
157769,30,299,1258000,Grampa Simpson,Casino,Put it all on forty-one. I've got a feeling about that number.
157770,30,300,1262000,Croupier,Casino,"The wheel only goes to thirty-six, sir."
157771,30,301,1263000,Grampa Simpson,Casino,"Okay, put it all on thirty-six. I've got a feeling about that number."
157772,30,302,1267000,Homer Simpson,Casino,"Dad, no! Gimme that."
157773,30,303,1267000,Grampa Simpson,Casino,Get your clammy paws off my money.
157774,30,304,1270000,Homer Simpson,Casino,Gimme me that money. Ow! You're hurting me.
157775,30,305,1273000,Grampa Simpson,Casino,"Thirty-six, no!"
157776,30,306,1274000,Croupier,Casino,No more bets.
157777,30,307,1276000,Grampa Simpson,Casino,"Son, if this lands on thirty-six, I'll..."
157778,30,308,1280000,Croupier,Casino,Double zero.
157779,30,309,1281000,Grampa Simpson,Casino,"Son, you saved me from losing all my money. For the first time in my life I'm glad I had children."
157781,30,311,1288000,Homer Simpson,PLATO'S REPUBLIC,"So, have you figured out who gets the money?"
157782,30,312,1300000,Grampa Simpson,PLATO'S REPUBLIC,"Yes, Homer, I have."
