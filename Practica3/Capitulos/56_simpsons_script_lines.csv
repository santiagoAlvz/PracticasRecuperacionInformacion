7194,56,12,121000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"You see, Aunt Selma has this crazy obsession about not dying alone, so in desperation, she joined this prison pen-pal program. Her new sweetie's a jailbird."

7196,56,14,135000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, now, he's an ex-convict. He's paid his debt to society."

7203,56,21,159000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Selma dear, I'm afraid the children's reaction is quite understandable."
7204,56,22,161000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"You see, Bart here is the Shamus in short pants who sent me to prison."
7205,56,23,164000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's right, Aunt Selma. Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown for armed robbery."
7206,56,24,171000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton."

7211,56,29,190000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Yes, you are. One: existence is suffering. Two: the cause of suffering is desire. In this case, my desire to do high-quality children's programming."
7213,56,31,202000,Sideshow Bob,Country Road,"When prison put an end to that dream, I became a seething cauldron of rage and recrimination..."
7217,56,33,223000,Sideshow Bob,AWARDS SHOW SET,"When I was nominated for best supporting performer in a children's program at the Daytime Emmy Awards, my bitterness ruined what should have been the greatest night of my life."

7229,56,45,274000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,"Do you know what prison is like for a life-long conservative Republican? In our over-crowded cell, we became little more than beasts."
7230,56,46,285000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,Who used my chapstick?
7231,56,47,286000,Cellmate #1,Springfield Prison,"Oh, I did. Here you go."
7232,56,48,288000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,I don't want it.
7233,56,49,289000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,My only joy came with plotting a horrible revenge against the boy who put me there...
7235,56,51,302000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Aye-Carumba!
7236,56,52,303000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Bart, if I wanted to kill you, I'd have choked you like a chicken as soon as I walked in that door."
7238,56,54,308000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,But then what kind of a guest would I have been?
7239,56,55,314000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Now where was I... Ah yes, my lowest ebb."
7241,56,57,318000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,You can't take my Emmy!
7242,56,58,322000,Guard,Springfield Prison,"Hey, you know the rules. Awards for excellence in entertainment are contraband. No Emmys, no Oscars, not even a Golden Globe."
7243,56,59,329000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,But kismet can be kind as well as cruel. I received an answer to my letter from the prison pen pal program.
7246,56,60,335000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield Prison,"Dear Number 24601, I need a man and I cannot find one among the law-abiding. I have a steady job, and a lucrative hobby filing nuisance law suits.

7248,56,62,352000,Sideshow Bob,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Dear Selma, your latest letter set off a riot in the maximum security wing of my heart."
7251,56,65,366000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,"Like the lone crocus that pokes through the prison yard, our love bloomed despite all obstacles."
7252,56,66,373000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,"Selma, may I?"
7253,56,67,375000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield Prison,Uh-uh-uh. On the cheek.
7254,56,68,382000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,"Inspired by the love of a good woman, I resolved to be the best darned inmate Number 24601 I could be."
7256,56,70,391000,Sideshow Bob,Prison Gate,I bade farewell to my cellmates and left with the woman I loved.
7257,56,71,395000,Sideshow Bob,Prison Gate,"Cutter... Ice pick... Snake, I'm going to miss you most of all."
7259,56,73,405000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"What a beautiful story, Sideshow Bob. You're living proof that our revolving door prison system works."
7260,56,74,411000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Selma, I've never seen you so happy. Giggling like a schoolgirl."
7262,56,76,418000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"I've got to admit it, Selma. He's a once in a lifetime catch."
7263,56,77,422000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Yes, I hope the police are saying that as well."
7264,56,78,428000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe you guys. This man framed Krusty the Clown.
7265,56,79,432000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart!
7266,56,80,433000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Indeed, I did. And I'd like to thank you for catching me, Bart. You seized the wheel of my slow boat to hell and pointed it straight towards the sunny shores of Selma."
7267,56,81,443000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hear hear!.
7268,56,82,444000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Selma, would you mind if I did something bold and shocking in front of your family?"
7269,56,83,449000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"All right, but no tongues."
7270,56,84,451000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Although kissing you would be like kissing some divine ashtray, that's not what I had in mind."
7271,56,85,455000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Selma, will you marry me?"
7215,56,87,459000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't be a fool, Aunt Selma. That man is scum."
7216,56,88,462000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,Then call me Mrs. Scum!
7274,56,89,462000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,I KNOW I STAND IN LINE UNTIL I THINK YOU HAVE THE TIME TO SPEND AN EVENING WITH ME.
7275,56,90,481000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,AND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE TO DANCE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A CHANCE YOU WON'T BE LEAVIN' WITH ME.
7276,56,91,490000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,THEN AFTERWARDS WE DROP INTO A QUIET LITTLE PLACE AND HAVE A DRINK OR TWO.
7277,56,92,499000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"AND THEN I GO AND SPOIL IT ALL BY SAYIN' SOMETHIN' STUPID LIKE ""I LOVE YOU""."
7278,56,93,511000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,Ahhh... ahhh... Hmmmm... Could you pumice my corns for me?
7279,56,94,515000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,Avec plaisir.
7280,56,95,517000,Kindly Old Gent,Simpson Home,A... G... Q... Seven...
7281,56,96,523000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,Close enough. May you drive safely and find true love.
7282,56,97,528000,Announcer,Simpson Home,We now return to the Twenty-seventh Annual Krusty the Clown Telethon for Motion Sickness.
7283,56,98,533000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Tiffany! Woo hoo! I love you people! I love my kids! Poor little guys.
7284,56,99,543000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"So tragic. So nauseous. You should see the bus they came to the studio in What's next? Oh yeah. And now, a man who needs no introduction -- the chairman of the company... you know who I'm talking about. Get out here, you goombah!"
7285,56,100,569000,Crooner,Simpson Home,"Krusteleh, there's an old friend backstage who wants to say hello."
7286,56,101,574000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Huh? Whuh?

7290,56,105,584000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,This guy is a national treasure.
7291,56,106,586000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"That jerk I got to replace you, he isn't fit to hold your slide whistle."
7293,56,108,590000,Sideshow Mel,Sideshow Mel's Apartment,All I can be is myself.
7295,56,110,592000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Krusty, can you ever forgive me for framing you and putting you in jail?"
7296,56,111,596000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Hey, if they ever open the books on this telethon, I'm right back in there."
7297,56,112,600000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That Sideshow Bob is a no-good showbiz phony.
7298,56,113,603000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Bart. If Krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him, surely you can too."
7299,56,114,609000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Oh Krusty, I can't tell you how much I missed this."
7300,56,115,614000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, about your wedding dress. I'm not sure how to put this..."
7244,56,116,618000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,White.

7303,56,119,624000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Well Homer, you seem to be a trencherman. What should we serve?"
7304,56,120,627000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup!"
7305,56,121,640000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Well, Selma, he makes a good case."
7306,56,122,642000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,Get whatever you want. It all tastes like styrofoam to me.
7307,56,123,645000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Selma, dear -- I'm confused."
7308,56,124,648000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Well, when I was a kid we were playing with bottle rockets, and one shot straight up my nose. I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell."
7309,56,125,657000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, we've got cocktail wienies and Swedish meatballs."
7310,56,126,661000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Selma, this wedding is spinning out of control. Can we really afford it? I've already run through eight of the ten dollars they gave me when I left prison."
7311,56,127,668000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Hey relax, I told ya I got money. I bought stock in a mace company just before society crumbled."
7312,56,128,674000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Selma, that's wonderful. I just hope people don't think I'm marrying you for your money, instead of your... less tangible qualities."
7314,56,130,685000,Sideshow Bob,Park,Tomorrow we'll be Mr. and Mrs. Bob Terwilliger. Isn't it grand?
7315,56,131,689000,Selma Bouvier,Park,"Hey, Bob. Give some of that honey this way."
7316,56,132,696000,Selma Bouvier,Park,"Holy frijoles! We've got ten minutes till MacGyver! Driver, here's a fin. Get me home and don't spare the whip."

7319,56,135,705000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,What did I miss?
7320,56,136,706000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,MacGyver was wearing a tank top.
7321,56,137,709000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Dang.
7322,56,138,710000,Sideshow Bob,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Why Selma, I thought I was the only man in your life."
7323,56,139,712000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Sit down and shut up.
7324,56,140,714000,Man,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Thank you, Señor MacGyver. You saved our village."
7325,56,141,717000,MacGyver,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Don't thank me. Thank the moon's gravitational pull.
7326,56,142,724000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,That MacGyver's a genius.
7328,56,143,727000,Sideshow Bob,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"First of all he's not a genius, he's an actor. And second, he's not much of an actor."
7329,56,144,732000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,You're lying! You're lying!
7330,56,145,734000,Sideshow Bob,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"No Selma, this is lying: that was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never made me want to retch."
7332,56,147,746000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"He was so cruel... The things he said, they're just not true."
7333,56,148,753000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"There, there..."
7334,56,149,755000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh well, I guess the wedding's off. Fiddle dee dee, tomorrow's another day."
7335,56,150,758000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! Stop that.
7336,56,151,759000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"No, he's right. We're a package. Love me, love MacGyver. I guess the wedding's off."
7337,56,152,769000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Selma, I don't know what to say."
7338,56,153,771000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,Just tell me you like MacGyver.
7339,56,154,773000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,Very well. I... I... I can't do it! Even that car chase seemed tacked on.
7340,56,155,782000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?"
7341,56,156,791000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love."
7342,56,157,801000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Very well, Selma, whenever you watch MacGyver, I'll take a vigorous constitutional and return more in love with you than ever."
7343,56,158,808000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,Oh Bob.
7344,56,159,810000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart no like. Bad medicine.
7346,56,161,816000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I could've been the flower girl. And I wouldn't keep falling down either.
7347,56,162,820000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Hey, they chose Maggie, okay?"
7348,56,163,822000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Yeah, well if they want to go for cutesiness instead of competence, fine."
7349,56,164,826000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Do you Bob, take Selma, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, 'til death do you part?"
7350,56,165,835000,Sideshow Bob,First Church of Springfield,I do.
7353,56,168,845000,Homer Simpson,RECEPTION HALL,"Hey, Wiener Boy... Where do you think you're going?"
7354,56,169,855000,Patty Bouvier,RECEPTION HALL,I'm the only single girl left in the family.
7355,56,170,862000,Patty Bouvier,RECEPTION HALL,"Well, I guess it could be worse."
7357,56,171,864000,Marge Simpson,RECEPTION HALL,"Oooh, there's Krusty the Clown! Krusty, Krusty, say something funny."
7358,56,172,869000,Krusty the Clown,RECEPTION HALL,"Uh... gee, a joke. hmmm, yeah, funny... Okay, this guy walks into a bar and takes out a tiny piano and a twelve inch pianist -- Oh, no wait, I can't tell that one... Oh, oh."
7359,56,173,882000,Sideshow Bob,RECEPTION HALL,"Dear friends, forty one years ago, God took one hundred and sixty-eight pounds of clay and he made me a woman. And for this, I thank Him."
7360,56,174,892000,Selma Bouvier,RECEPTION HALL,"I just wanted to say, on the advice of my new husband, I've decided to give up smoking."
7361,56,175,900000,Selma Bouvier,RECEPTION HALL,... Except for after meals and after MacGyver.
7362,56,176,903000,Sideshow Bob,RECEPTION HALL,"Why Selma dear, you'll bury us all."
7363,56,177,907000,Bart Simpson,RECEPTION HALL,"Chief Wiggum, you've been around. You don't trust Sideshow Bob, do you?"
7364,56,178,911000,Chief Wiggum,RECEPTION HALL,"Ahh, lighten up, son. If he was going to commit a crime, would he have invited the No. 1 cop in town? Now, where did I put my gun? Oh, yeah. I set it down when I got a piece of cake..."
7365,56,179,927000,Patty Bouvier,RECEPTION HALL,I don't know what to say.
7366,56,180,928000,Selma Bouvier,RECEPTION HALL,Just tell me what you know I want to hear.
7367,56,181,931000,Patty Bouvier,RECEPTION HALL,I'm dying of jealousy.
7368,56,182,934000,Selma Bouvier,RECEPTION HALL,Thank you.
7370,56,184,939000,Sideshow Bob,Car,"That's right dear, enjoy your rest. The wedding was very tough on you, and the honeymoon is going to be... murder."
7372,56,186,966000,Selma Bouvier,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,Welcome to our video honeymoon. We're using the video camera Cousin Dot gave us and the video cassette Homer gave us.
7374,56,188,975000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it."
7375,56,189,978000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,There's Shelbyville Falls... Rolling Rock... And here's another breathtaking sight -- my brand new hubby.
7376,56,190,988000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,I wanted a room with a fireplace you brainless luggage monkey! Like the one in your brochure!
7377,56,191,994000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Oh, Selma dear, I was just chatting with my good friend, Dennis. Now, smile for the camera. That's a good lad."
7378,56,192,1004000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Ah, fire: scourge of Prometheus, toaster of marshmallows, eradicator of deadwood... Oh Selma dear, you and your little camera. What do you say we shut it off for a while?"

7273,56,194,1020000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,I suppose so.
7327,56,195,1021000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, that's sweet."
7380,56,196,1024000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace?
7381,56,197,1027000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic.
7382,56,198,1031000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Romantic? With Aunt Selma?
7383,56,199,1033000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess you're just too young to understand.
7385,56,201,1041000,Selma Bouvier,Shelbyville Hotel Suite,One of my fillings fell out.
7386,56,202,1045000,Sideshow Bob,Shelbyville Hotel Suite,Even murder has its ugly side.
7387,56,203,1048000,Selma Bouvier,Shelbyville Hotel Suite,"Bob, would you mind rubbing my feet?"
7388,56,204,1053000,Sideshow Bob,Shelbyville Hotel Suite,"Darling, you make it sound like a chore."
7389,56,205,1058000,Selma Bouvier,Shelbyville Hotel Suite,"Hmm, uh, good..."

7401,56,217,1085000,Selma Bouvier,Shelbyville Hotel Suite,"Oh, hey, you're right."
7403,56,219,1098000,Sideshow Bob,Shelbyville Hotel Suite,"Well, time for my walk."
7405,56,221,1101000,Sideshow Bob,Shelbyville Hotel Suite,Don't forget to die.
7407,56,223,1103000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,Ding dong. I was feeling kind of lonely without Selma. Mind if I watch TV with you?
7408,56,224,1110000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Go ahead, Patty."
7409,56,225,1113000,Announcer,Simpson Home,Tonight on MacGyver...
7410,56,226,1118000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Aunt Selma has one hour to live!
7411,56,227,1121000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, down in front."
7413,56,229,1126000,Sideshow Bob,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,Good bye.
7414,56,230,1135000,Sideshow Bob,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,Front desk? There's been a terrible accident in my room.
7415,56,231,1142000,Sideshow Bob,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,"Poor Selma, you were having such a lovely evening AND THEN I WENT AND SPOILED IT ALL BY DOING SOMETHING STUPID LIKE EXPLODE YOU."
7416,56,232,1153000,Bart Simpson,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,"Sideshow Bob, I'm afraid the only victims here are the good people at Best Western Hotels."
7417,56,233,1158000,Sideshow Bob,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,Bart!
7418,56,234,1160000,Sideshow Bob,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,Selma!
7419,56,235,1161000,Sideshow Bob,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,Ughhh.
7420,56,236,1162000,Selma Bouvier,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,You tried to kill me. I want a separation.
7421,56,237,1167000,Sideshow Bob,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,My best laid plans have gang aglay!
7422,56,238,1170000,Bart Simpson,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,"Chief Wiggum, think you have room in your jail for a two-time loser?"
7423,56,239,1173000,Chief Wiggum,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,"Well no, frankly, but that never stopped us before."
7424,56,240,1177000,Sideshow Bob,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,"Bart, I must know. How did you untangle my web?"
7425,56,241,1180000,Chief Wiggum,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,"Yeah, Bart. Fill us in."
7426,56,242,1182000,Bart Simpson,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,"Well, I'd hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do his job."
7427,56,243,1186000,Chief Wiggum,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,"No, no, please. It's the only way I'll learn."
7428,56,244,1188000,Bart Simpson,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,All right. Sideshow Bob seemed so desperate to get that fireplace. But why? Then it hit me -- the gas.
7429,56,245,1196000,Bart Simpson,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,Surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak -- except Aunt Selma.
7430,56,246,1202000,Selma Bouvier,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell.
7431,56,247,1205000,Bart Simpson,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,"She happily watched her MacGyver, unaware that her room was silently filling with natural gas. All it needed to explode was a single spark... say, from a cigarette..."
7432,56,248,1216000,Selma Bouvier,Shelbyville Falls Hotel,"I decided to give up smoking... except for after meals, and after MacGyver."
7434,56,250,1220000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.
7435,56,251,1224000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, when Aunt Selma lights up her cigarette at the end of MacGyver, she'll be blown to kingdom come!"
7436,56,252,1229000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Come again?
7437,56,253,1232000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"After trying four times to explain it to Homer, I explained it to Mom and we were on our way."
7438,56,254,1237000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,To the Simpson mobile!
7440,56,256,1256000,Bart Simpson,Hotel Room,Noooo!
7441,56,257,1261000,Sideshow Bob,Hotel Room,"But wait! If you saved Selma, why did the room explode?"
7442,56,258,1264000,Chief Wiggum,Hotel Room,I'll field that one. Me and the boys were all celebrating a job well done when I threw my match in the vicinity of the crime scene.
7444,56,260,1274000,Chief Wiggum,Hall,"Oh, right, the gas."
7445,56,261,1276000,Sideshow Bob,Hall,"I'll be back! You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever! And when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies!"
7446,56,262,1290000,Selma Bouvier,Hall,I feel like such a fool.
7447,56,263,1293000,Marge Simpson,Hall,"Well, he fooled almost everyone. But there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust."
7448,56,264,1299000,Bart Simpson,Hall,"Thanks, Mom. Now. Let's get out of this gas-filled hallway before we all suffocate."
