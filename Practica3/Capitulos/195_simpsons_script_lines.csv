44980,195,60,245000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,I have frozen myself so I may live to see the wonders of the future. Thaw me out when robot wives are cheap and effective. P.S. Please alter my pants as fashion dictates.
44982,195,62,253000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now you're swingin', honey!"
44983,195,63,274000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Darn it!!

44985,195,65,285000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mm, if you'd just apologize to Louie, you could get your hair cut the way you want."
44986,195,66,289000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,No apology. Not until he admits he's a jerk!
44987,195,67,293000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I think something's wrong with me. I can't do anything right lately."
44989,195,68,297000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Um, you're just having a bad day. I had one last week. I burned the roast, my cake fell, and I ran out of butter so I had to spray the English muffins with PAM."
44990,195,69,307000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe you're just a lousy cook. OW!
44991,195,70,309000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll go get the Bactine.
44992,195,71,311000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It can't just be a bad day. I feel like I'm getting dumber by the minute.
44993,195,72,315000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, ain't no big deal. All Simpsons start to lose their smarts around your age."
44994,195,73,320000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you talkin' about?
44995,195,74,322000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'll show ya. Follow me."

44998,195,77,330000,Grampa Simpson,ATTIC,"Oh, your dad used to be smart as a monkey, but then his mind started gettin' lazy, and now he's dumb as a chimp."
44999,195,78,337000,Lisa Simpson,ATTIC,Grampa!
45000,195,79,338000,Grampa Simpson,ATTIC,"Hey, I am, too! And your brother's comin' along nicely."
45001,195,80,342000,Grampa Simpson,ATTIC,"Look at Bart's homework. Back when he was your age, he was smart as a chimp."
45002,195,81,347000,Lisa Simpson,ATTIC,This is just two years ago!
45003,195,82,349000,Grampa Simpson,ATTIC,"That's right, then the Simpson genes kicked in."
45004,195,83,357000,Lisa Simpson,ATTIC,This is crazy! Just because you and Dad and Bart went downhill doesn't mean it's gonna happen to me... does it?
45005,195,84,363000,Grampa Simpson,ATTIC,Sure! But it doesn't mean you can't live a long and pointless life!
45007,195,86,374000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Dear Log: Can it be true? Do all Simpsons go through a process of dumbening?
45008,195,87,380000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Wait, that's not how you spell ""dumbening."" Wait, ""dumbening"" isn't even a word!"
45009,195,88,389000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Oh... I've got to find out more...
45011,195,90,397000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,That makes 22 to 16.
45012,195,91,400000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Time is running out.
45014,195,93,402000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"So you're worried about your genes, uh? Well, does it hurt when you go like this?"
45015,195,94,410000,Lisa Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,No.
45016,195,95,411000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Then will you turn this projector on for me? I think the film should answer all your questions.
45017,195,96,420000,Troy McClure,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Have you ever wondered why fat parents have fat children?
44988,195,97,420000,Troy McClure,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Or why Chinese parents have Chinese children?
45019,195,99,427000,Troy McClure,Laboratory,"It's no coincidence. It's because of... D - N - A. Hi, I'm Troy McClure."
45020,195,100,442000,Troy McClure,Laboratory,"You may remember me from such medical films as ""Alice Doesn't Live Anymore"" and ""Mommy, What's Wrong With That Man's Face?"""
45021,195,101,449000,Billy,Laboratory,"But Mr. McClure, what is DNA?"
45022,195,102,452000,Troy McClure,Laboratory,"What the...? Oh, hi, Billy! Let's find out together."
45023,195,103,456000,Troy McClure,Laboratory,DNA is God's recipe for making you.
45024,195,104,464000,Troy McClure,Laboratory,"You take a dash of Dad, a pinch of Mom... Then we bake for nine months and..."
45025,195,105,470000,Troy McClure,Laboratory,"Mmmm, that's good, Billy!"
45026,195,106,473000,Billy,Laboratory,"Mr. McClure, what does DNA stand for?"
45027,195,107,482000,Lisa Simpson,Laboratory,That didn't answer anything. I need more information.
45028,195,108,486000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Laboratory,Would you like to see it again?
45029,195,109,487000,Lisa Simpson,Laboratory,"Isn't there any way I can change my DNA, like sitting on the microwave?"
45030,195,110,491000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Laboratory,"Mmmm, not according to any movie I've ever seen. I'm afraid you're stuck with your genes, Lisa."
45032,195,112,503000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hi, frozen body!"
45033,195,113,510000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hm, he's got a ""lub"", but I don't hear a ""dub"". Oh. Ha, there it is!"
45034,195,114,516000,Chief Wiggum,Kwik-E-Mart,You're lucky he's still alive! This freezer is an attractive nuisance. Just look at all that ice cream. It's damn near irresistible!
45035,195,115,524000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, we better leave him in there. Moving him now could kill him and tire us out."
45036,195,116,528000,Nelson Muntz,Kwik-E-Mart,Check it out! A freezer geezer!
45037,195,117,531000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Please, young customers! Ignore the frozen gentlemen and return to your impulse buying."
45038,195,118,536000,Nelson Muntz,Kwik-E-Mart,"Ah, but we want to stare at the ice dude."
45039,195,119,539000,Jimbo Jones,Kwik-E-Mart,We'll give you a buck.
45040,195,120,541000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"No! This is a convenience store, not a freak show!"
45041,195,121,545000,Jimbo Jones,Kwik-E-Mart,A dollar twenty?
45042,195,122,549000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Come one, come all! See the amazing frozen man! Also, gaze at the Frito found in a bag of Doritos! Marvel at the floor that just won't come clean!"
45044,195,124,561000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dear Log: My worst fears have been confirmed. I've hit my mental and creative peak at the tender age of eight. What will my life be like after I descend into mediocrity?
45048,195,128,580000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Ralph seems happy enough... Maybe I should just give up now and settle into a mindless, happy stupor..."
45049,195,129,587000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"We now return to ""When Buildings Collapse!"" on Non-Stop Fox!!"
45051,195,131,607000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Lis. Wanna join us?"

45059,195,139,647000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The best part was when the buildings fell down!
45060,195,140,650000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah... Huh, huh, huh, maybe people got hurt!"

45067,195,147,673000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Behold the ""Can Of Mystery."" The label vanished many years ago. What strange wonders lie inside? Treasure? Dog food?"

45069,195,149,694000,Todd Flanders,Kwik-E-Mart,Show - me - your t...

45071,195,151,698000,Ned Flanders,Kwik-E-Mart,"It says ""Show me your tie."" It's cute. C'mon, let's go."
45072,195,152,701000,Grampa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Me and Frostillicus go back a long way. I used to share a bathroom with Frostillicus. In fact, I got a real funny story about that. Actually, it's not so much funny as it is long. It seems that there was this..."
45073,195,153,718000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oooh, what a gold mine!"
45074,195,154,724000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, my goodness!"

45108,195,187,868000,Lisa Simpson,Art Gallery,"Oh, Kenny, look at the interplay of light and shadow. It's so luminous and vibrant."
45110,195,188,874000,Security Guard,Art Gallery,"Ha! Ha! Thanks, Lisa. I painted that one. The real one's in my garage."
45112,195,190,886000,Square Guy,The Jazz Hole,Hmm... It sounds like she's hitting a baby with a cat.
45113,195,191,890000,Lisa Simpson,The Jazz Hole,You have to listen to the notes she's not playing!

45116,195,194,897000,BIG TEXAN,Kwik-E-Mart,"Son, I represent a group a oil tycoons who make foolish purchases. We already bought us a stained-glass bathrobe and the world's fattest race horse, and now we need your Ice Man."
