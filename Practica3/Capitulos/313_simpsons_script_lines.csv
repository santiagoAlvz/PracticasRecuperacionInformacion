80288,313,1,32000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Botanical Gardens,Does anyone else want to know why that sign is so funny?
80289,313,2,36000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Botanical Gardens,No.
80291,313,4,37000,Lisa Simpson,Botanical Gardens,"C'mon, we're gonna be late to the blooming of the Sumatran Century Flower."
80292,313,5,42000,Homer Simpson,Botanical Gardens,How come Lisa always gets to pick the family activities?
80293,313,6,45000,Lisa Simpson,Botanical Gardens,"Because I know every time you say ""pick a number from one to ten,"" it's always seven."
80294,313,7,50000,Homer Simpson,Botanical Gardens,That's because there were seven apostles.
80295,313,8,53000,Marge Simpson,Botanical Gardens,"No, there were twelve."
80296,313,9,54000,Homer Simpson,Botanical Gardens,"Boy, that's a big staff. And still he wasn't that funny."
80297,313,10,60000,Lisa Simpson,Botanical Gardens,The Venus Flytrap is a carnivorous plant which uses bait to lure unsuspecting prey into its digestive tract...
80298,313,11,60000,Homer Simpson,Botanical Gardens,Stupid prey. They never suspect anything.
80299,313,12,74000,Homer Simpson,Botanical Gardens,"Ooo, a hotdog!"
80302,313,15,84000,Homer Simpson,Botanical Gardens,Flower power my ass.
80304,313,17,89000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,That's odd. It's eleven fifteen in the morning and the bar is empty.
80305,313,18,93000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,"I'm live at Springfield Botanical Gardens, where we're minutes away from the blossoming of the Sumatran Century Flower, which only occurs once every hundred years."
80306,313,19,102000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, those are my customers-slash-only friends! Where are they getting their beer?"
80307,313,20,111000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,A cooler! I've been replaced by a cooler!
80308,313,21,114000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,And who could blame 'em?
80310,313,22,117000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Eh, no point in mopin' around. I might as well join 'em and have a jolly old time."
80311,313,23,123000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Better set the alarm.
80313,313,25,130000,Moe Szyslak,Botanical Gardens,"Here I am, one of the crowd. I'm comfortable I'm calm. If anybody looks at me I got a hypodermic full of bleach."
80314,313,26,140000,Chief Wiggum,Botanical Gardens,"Um, people, we are officially over capacity. We've got to kick one person out. Someone who's alone, already bitter, someone whose feelings have been trampled on so many times one more won't make any... Oh, Moe!"
80315,313,27,153000,Moe Szyslak,Botanical Gardens,"Yeah, that's me all right."
80316,313,28,156000,Chief Wiggum,Botanical Gardens,"Sorry, Moe. You can either walk out with dignity, or I can push you down this muddy hill."
80317,313,29,160000,Moe Szyslak,Botanical Gardens,I'd prefer that you push me. Seein' how I'm desperate for any human contact.
80318,313,30,165000,Chief Wiggum,Botanical Gardens,All right.
80319,313,31,165000,Moe Szyslak,Botanical Gardens,Thanks a lot.
80320,313,32,173000,Lisa Simpson,Botanical Gardens,The flower's starting to open!
80321,313,33,180000,Sideshow Mel,Botanical Gardens,"Everyone, flare your nostrils in olfactory anticipation!"
80323,313,35,192000,Bart Simpson,Botanical Gardens,"Man, the plant cut one!"
80324,313,36,194000,Marge Simpson,Botanical Gardens,"Bart, plants don't-- wheww!"
80325,313,37,199000,Bumblebee Man,Botanical Gardens,¡Ay yai yai! ¡Que flora malodorosa!
80326,313,38,205000,Krusty the Clown,Botanical Gardens,"Argh, that smells worse than James Coco's ski boots!"
80327,313,39,211000,Krusty the Clown,Botanical Gardens,Oh yeah. That's mildly better.
80329,313,41,220000,Moe Szyslak,Sidewalk,"Listen to those lucky people, enjoying that pretty flower. I got nothin' -- just this can."
80330,313,42,229000,Moe Szyslak,Sidewalk,At least there's someone worse off than me.
80336,313,48,250000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,"So long, suckers!"
80339,313,51,256000,Carl Carlson,Highway,"Well, at least we're outside instead of sittin' home watchin' TV."
80340,313,52,260000,Lenny Leonard,Highway,"I hear that. Hey, that car has a TV in it!"
80342,313,54,266000,Announcer,Mini Van,"We now return to ""The Beverly Hillbillies Down Under""."
80344,313,55,270000,Jethro,Mini Van,"Hey, Granny! I'm gonna be a professional didgeridoo player."
80345,313,56,276000,Granny,Mini Van,"Well, now it's a didgeri-don't!"
80346,313,57,278000,Jethro,Mini Van,"Oh, Granny..."
80348,313,59,280000,Carl Carlson,Mini-van,Can you put on the baseball game?
80349,313,60,282000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Mini-van,My kids are watching a movie!
80350,313,61,284000,Carl Carlson,Mini-van,"C'mon, help a brother out."
80351,313,62,286000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Mini-van,"Why don't you call my secretary and make an appointment, ""brother""?"
80352,313,63,290000,Carl Carlson,Mini-van,A dream deferred is a dream denied!
80353,313,64,292000,Lisa Simpson,Mini-van,"Dad, the traffic's moving."
80354,313,65,295000,Homer Simpson,Mini-van,Woo-hoo! Pedal to the metal!
80356,313,67,308000,Marge Simpson,Mini-van,My baby!
80357,313,68,309000,Homer Simpson,Mini-van,Your baby!
80360,313,71,317000,Homer Simpson,Bridge,NOOOOOOOOOO!
80362,313,73,319000,Moe Szyslak,LOWER LEVEL,"Well, this is it. The last call for Moe. God. God, God..."

80364,313,75,330000,Homer Simpson,LOWER LEVEL,Moe! Thank God you saved my baby...
80365,313,76,333000,Sideshow Mel,LOWER LEVEL,That hideous man is a hero!
80366,313,77,347000,Moe Szyslak,LOWER LEVEL,Heh. Life don't seem so hard no more.
80368,313,79,354000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, Maggie's in the paper with Moe. How cute."
80369,313,80,360000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Look at those pants. They're standing up with no one in them.
80370,313,81,367000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Hey, I was in the neighborhood and uh, thought I'd, y'know, check in on Maggie."
80371,313,82,372000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Moe, I'm glad you're here! I wanted to thank you so much for saving my baby, so I knitted you a nice warm sweater."
80372,313,83,380000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Aw, look at that. That's so soft and thoughtful and what's the gag? Is it full of chiggers?"
80373,313,84,387000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no all that's in there is love and gratitude."
80374,313,85,390000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Aw jeez, there's somethin' in my eye. Ah, it's just glass."
80375,313,86,397000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"So, how's the little tyke doin'?"
80377,313,88,403000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Ain't she adorable.
80378,313,89,406000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my God, I'm late for work."
80279,313,91,409000,C. Montgomery Burns,Car,How you got in my carpool I'll never know.
80381,313,93,412000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,The Swedish are coming! The Swedish are coming!
80382,313,94,417000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Lord. Why do they keep changing his medication?"
80383,313,95,421000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look at me, I'm Speedy Alka Seltzer! Whoa!"
80384,313,96,424000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Moe, I gotta handle this. Can you keep an eye on Maggie?"
80385,313,97,428000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Me? Yeah, uh... yeah, sure, i-i-if you don't think I'd spook her or nothin'."
80386,313,98,432000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, you'll be fine. I'll be right back."
80387,313,99,435000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I got lindenberries!
80388,313,100,438000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"So, how's it goin'? Huh."
80389,313,101,442000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Hey, you-you wanna see me uh, dislocate my arm? Take a look at this."
80391,313,103,448000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,It was years before I could do this without faintin'. Still hurts.
80392,313,104,454000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Grampa, stop!"
80393,313,105,456000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sayonara, Tojo!"

80397,313,109,473000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmp, I finally caught up with Grampa. I found him crying in the cemetery. Thanks for taking care of Maggie."
80398,313,110,480000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Oh, no problem. You know, it-it gave me kind of a good warm feelin'. Like when you get drunk and fall asleep in the snow."
80399,313,111,489000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Yeah, well I better go."
80401,313,113,491000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Aw, there, there Mags. I'll be back sometime."
80403,313,115,495000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, she really likes you. Maybe the next time I need a sitter, and you're not busy..."
80404,313,116,501000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"I-I'd love to. Uh, uh let me check my schedule."
80405,313,117,505000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Well, I was gonna erase those two apostrophes and replace 'em with 'g's, but that's about it. So, you know, call anytime."
80407,313,119,514000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Why is she crying? Oh, that's right. I still got her nose."
80408,313,120,519000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Here ya go, ya little idiot."
80410,313,122,524000,Moe Szyslak,Krusty Burger,"Ball pit, that's nice. One, two, three colors -- you got 'em all."
80412,313,123,529000,Hot Woman,Krusty Burger,Aw! What a face! She looks just like you!
80413,313,124,534000,Moe Szyslak,Krusty Burger,You calling her repellant?
80414,313,125,536000,Hot Woman,Krusty Burger,"No, I was just..."
80415,313,126,537000,Moe Szyslak,Krusty Burger,"'Cause you ain't exactly Karen Allen yourself, you know."
80416,313,127,539000,Hot Woman,Krusty Burger,"You idiot, I was trying to pick you up."
80417,313,128,542000,Moe Szyslak,Krusty Burger,"Oh, great. Uh, well why don't you play with the baby while I go rent a room?"
80418,313,129,548000,Moe Szyslak,Krusty Burger,"Boy, that's one for the Christmas letter. What a nut."
80420,313,131,569000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Way to go, Mom. Homemade dim sum, with eight kinds of dipping sauce!"
80421,313,132,575000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,This is the best Year of the Rat ever!
80422,313,133,578000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I have so much free time now that Moe's our babysitter."
80423,313,134,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. She--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!"
80424,313,135,589000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You could be my father figure.
80425,313,136,590000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No way! I'm not gettin' my fingerprints on that train wreck. But if I lose Maggie, I'm oh-for-three. I've gotta get her back."
80426,313,137,597000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I can help you.
80427,313,138,598000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I said, pipe down, Amtrak."
80428,313,139,600000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Maggie, look what's in your ear, a penny."
80429,313,140,606000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Okay, we won't tell no one about that. Now let's see, what else can we do? We can't tickle Elmo no more."
80430,313,141,614000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Coochie, coochie coo."
80431,313,142,615000,Elmo,Simpson Home,No means no for Elmo!
80432,313,143,617000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Ow.
80433,313,144,618000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,And this Slinky... these things are fun for about two seconds.
80434,313,145,626000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Yeah, that's it, slink away."
80435,313,146,630000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Hm. ""Alice in Wonderland,"" huh? This must be a take-off on that ""Alice in Underpants"" movie I saw."
80436,313,147,638000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,It's so nice to be with someone who can't understand the horrible things I say.
80437,313,148,643000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"White rabbit... chicks poppin' mushrooms... this is like the Playboy Mansion. Maybe I can think of a story uh, more suitable for a baby."
80438,313,149,655000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Ooh, I got one: it starts out with a beautiful wedding."
80439,313,150,657000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,But the father of the bride was nowhere to be seen.
80442,313,152,666000,Moe Szyslak,GODFATHER'S HOUSE,He was granting favors to all of his bestest buddies.
80443,313,153,670000,Mobster,GODFATHER'S HOUSE,I think we could scare that movie producer by puttin' a horse's blanket in his bed. Imagine waking up and seeing you got the wrong kinda blanket.
80444,313,154,677000,Godfather,GODFATHER'S HOUSE,How about a horse's head?
80445,313,155,680000,Mobster,GODFATHER'S HOUSE,"Oh, you see here. That's why you're the Godfather."
80447,313,157,684000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,"And the Godfather's playing with his grandson, see. So he sticks an orange in his mouth, like this."
80449,313,159,696000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,"Okay. And now, it's intermission."
80450,313,160,701000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,"Gimme a break, will ya? It's a friggin' saga."
80452,313,162,704000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,"Don Bardzini gets whacked. Tessio, Ohh... you won't see him no more. Moe Greene: Bam! He gets it right in the eye. And Michael is now the new Godfather. And he shuts the door on Annie Hall."
80453,313,163,722000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,"Oh, no, no baby. No, no... Okay, Part Two. Little Anthony's having his first communion at Lake Tahoe. Meanwhile Michael can't get a gaming license. But Senator Geary's got one weakness: call girls..."
80454,313,164,739000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,That's right.
80456,313,166,744000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,This party's boring. Everything here is for babies.
80457,313,167,747000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,I'm helping Daddy!
80458,313,168,749000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Lisa, it says one year and up."
80459,313,169,752000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Backyard,"Oh, there she is, the birthday girl. Oh, your mommy tied a bow for you, huh. I'd better retie it -- the way you like it."
80461,313,171,763000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Backyard,"I know it don't seem like it matters, but you know, she hates lookin' like crap."
80463,313,173,768000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Backyard,"Hey, hey, hey, Osh Kosh B'Gosh. She don't want what you're shovelin'."
80464,313,174,772000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Backyard,Mr. Moe. My son was only playing next to this girl who is not your daughter.
80465,313,175,777000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Backyard,"Yeah, sure he was, Nahasapasa-Imraisin'apervert."
80466,313,176,781000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Back off, Moe. Maggie wants to be with me."
80467,313,177,786000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,This is how we play. THE SQUIRMY WORMY SPIDER / SQUIRTS OUT OF DADDY'S HANDS...
80469,313,178,794000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,... DADDY FEELS REJECTED / HE'S GONNA EAT SOME CAKE.
80470,313,179,799000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Oh, a rattle!"
80471,313,180,803000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Thank you, Selma."
80472,313,181,804000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Backyard,"Yeah, great present, Selma. Nice of you to break a five."
80473,313,182,807000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Backyard,"Eh, get a neck, Frankenstein."
80474,313,183,810000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Backyard,"Hey, open my present! Open my present!"
80475,313,184,814000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Backyard,"It's Uncle Moe's Play Tavern, with classic drunk Barney. Look, even the little toilet is broken."
80476,313,185,820000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,I don't know if toy drunkards are an appropriate gift for a baby.
80477,313,186,824000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Backyard,Sure they are. They even talk. Look!
80478,313,187,826000,Homer Doll,Simpson Backyard,I peed my pants.
80479,313,188,829000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,I recorded that for private use!
80482,313,191,835000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Your turn.
80483,313,192,836000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"No, it's your turn."
80484,313,193,839000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Master Bedroom,I got it. It's okay!
80486,313,195,845000,Homer Simpson,Maggie's Bedroom,Moe?! What are you doing here?
80487,313,196,846000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,"Well, Maggie was crying. I heard her on my baby monitor."
80488,313,197,849000,Marge Simpson,Maggie's Bedroom,You have your own baby monitor in our child's room?
80489,313,198,853000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,I had to. It's so weird watching the video and not getting any sound.
80490,313,199,858000,Homer Simpson,Maggie's Bedroom,"That's it, Moe. This is just too weird. You are not allowed to see Maggie anymore."
80491,313,200,863000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,"Well, can I at least give her this Moe-bile?"
80492,313,201,866000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,Eh? Eh?
80493,313,202,868000,Homer Simpson,Maggie's Bedroom,"Get your own family, Moe."
80494,313,203,870000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,"Hey, you never cared about Maggie 'til I started paying attention to her. Last night at the bar you called her ""Raquel."""
80495,313,204,874000,Homer Simpson,Maggie's Bedroom,Get out!
80496,313,205,877000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,"Is that uh, ""get out"" like leave, or ""get out"" as in: ""Get out. You banged Bridget Fonda?"""
80497,313,206,877000,Homer Simpson,Maggie's Bedroom,Get out!
80498,313,207,886000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,"Get out, that's-- okay."
80499,313,208,890000,Moe Szyslak,Maggie's Bedroom,"Maybe I can catch a late show of ""Alice In Underpants."" Or maybe ""Put 'em on the Looking Glass."""
80501,313,210,900000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Boy, I'm like a mess here. I feel so lonely without that kid."
80343,313,211,904000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"You still got us, Moe."
80468,313,212,908000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,You guys mind if I uh... kiss your tummies?
80502,313,215,916000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Apartment,Here comes the airplane.
80503,313,216,919000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Apartment,All gone.
80505,313,218,922000,Elves,Moe's Tavern,TOYS AND CAKES AND PETS AND BROTHERHOOD...
80506,313,219,928000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,It's our song.
80508,313,221,931000,Marge Simpson,Maggie's Bedroom,"Now, there'll be no more trouble from that meddlesome bartender."
80509,313,222,934000,Homer Simpson,Maggie's Bedroom,"Yeah. You know, looking at this sweet precious child makes me want to have one of our own."

80522,313,235,989000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you screaming about? Did you discover my snake farm? 'Cause I can explain. I'm going to farm and sell snakes.
80523,313,236,996000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maggie's gone!
80524,313,237,997000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It must have been Moe!

80528,313,241,1008000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Apartment,"Scum, Freezebag! I mean, freeze, scumbag! You can't write stuff like that. See that's why sitcoms are dying."

80531,313,244,1022000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Apartment,Thank goodness.

80540,313,253,1053000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it looks like Maggie crawled through these bushes, spit up over here, and crashed her tricycle into the wall."
80541,313,254,1059000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, no, that was me."
80542,313,255,1062000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Here's a clue: a discarded orange wedge!
80543,313,256,1066000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Orange wedge?

80545,313,258,1074000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,All the time. Sometimes I bring them lemonade.
80546,313,259,1077000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Listen, I think we might have to make a trip to Little Italy."
80547,313,260,1080000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll get our little passports.

80552,313,265,1108000,Don Castellaneta,Luigi's,Those fellows should really consider sippy cups.
80553,313,266,1112000,Younger Mobster,Luigi's,"Look, Boss. It's a baby!"

80562,313,275,1160000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,No. You've got a family. I'm the guy with nothin' and no one.
80563,313,276,1164000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"No, no, don't try to stop me."
80564,313,277,1166000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's,"We're not. Your sleeve got caught on that tree. Here, let me unhook ya."
80565,313,278,1169000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's,Off you go.
80566,313,279,1170000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"Yeah, thanks."
80567,313,280,1177000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"Gee, uh, this is the second-most guns ever pointed at me."
80568,313,281,1181000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"You know, a couple weeks ago I wouldn't have minded if you shot me. But all that's changed, because of this little girl here. Look at her. Ain't she a doll?"
80570,313,283,1200000,Fat Tony,Luigi's,I ain't cried like this since I paid to see Godfather Three.
80571,313,284,1206000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,Here's your baby back.
80572,313,285,1208000,Marge Simpson,Luigi's,"Thanks, Moe. I'm sorry we thought you were a baby-napper."
80573,313,286,1211000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's,"Or worse, am I right?"
80574,313,287,1214000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"Hey, hey, hey, the important thing is, little Maggie is safe."
80575,313,288,1220000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"Well, I gotta get home. There might be a telemarketer calling or something. I'll see you when you're old enough to drink, okay, Magpie."
80576,313,289,1230000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"Oh great, I'm caught on another tree. Lousy shirt-grabbin', sap-drippin'..."
80577,313,290,1235000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,Whaaa?!
80578,313,291,1237000,Marge Simpson,Luigi's,"I don't think Maggie wants you out of her life, Moe."
80579,313,292,1240000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's,"Moe, I was just thinking, if Maggie and I were in the neighborhood, maybe we could drop by and have a playdate with you... and your ham."
80580,313,293,1249000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"We'd like that, Homer."
