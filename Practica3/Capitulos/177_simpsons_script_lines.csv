40028,177,1,9000,Troy McClure,Museum,"""Spin-off!""... Is there any word more thrilling to the human soul? Hi, I'm Troy McClure! You may remember me from such TV spin-offs as ""Son of Sanford and Son"" and ""AfterMANNIX."""
40029,177,2,21000,Troy McClure,Museum,"I'm here at the Museum of TV and Television with a real treat for ""Simpsons"" fans, if any, because tonight we present... ""The Simpsons Spin-off Showcase!"""
40030,177,3,42000,Troy McClure,Museum,"Not long ago, the FOX network approached the producers of ""The Simpsons"" with a simple request: thirty-five new shows to fill a few holes in their programming line-up."
40031,177,4,50000,Troy McClure,Museum,"That's a pretty daunting task! And the producers weren't up to it. Instead, they churned out three ""Simpsons"" spin-offs, transplanting already popular characters into new locales and situations. First up: a gritty crime drama starring Springfield's beloved Police Chief Wiggum. Keep at least one eye open, 'cause his best friends the Simpsons just might pop in to wish him luck. Let's us wish him luck, too! Good luck, Wiggum!"
40033,177,6,111000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Office,"Ahhh, New Orleans. The Big Easy. Sweet Lady Gumbo. Old Swampy..."
40034,177,7,119000,Seymour Skinner,Chief Wiggum's Office,"I still don't understand, Clancy. Why give up your job as a small town police chief to set up a detective shop in New Orleans?"
40035,177,8,126000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Office,"Oh, lotsa reasons, I s'pose. Got kicked off the force, for one thing."
40036,177,9,130000,Seymour Skinner,Chief Wiggum's Office,For massive corruption.
40037,177,10,132000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Office,For massive corr... Exactly.
40038,177,11,134000,Seymour Skinner,Chief Wiggum's Office,"Yeah. As for me, I was born and bred here in the mean streets of ""N'Awlins."" Oh, sure, I left briefly to take that principal's job in Springfield, but in my heart I... I've always been a small-time hustler."
40039,177,12,145000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Office,"I know. That's precisely why I hired you as my leg man, Skinny Boy. I want you to put the word out: Chief Wiggum is here to clean up this crime dump!"
40040,177,13,155000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Office,Bleh.
40041,177,14,156000,Seymour Skinner,Chief Wiggum's Office,"Hmm. Looks like you've already got an enemy, Chief. Y'know, folks 'round here don't much care for law and order types."
40042,177,15,163000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Office,Is that right? Well maybe they'll change their minds once I arrest them for throwing skulls all over my floor.
40043,177,18,174000,Chief Wiggum,Houseboat,"Aw, man, what a day. It's no cakewalk being a single parent, juggling a career and a family like so many juggling balls -- two, I s'pose."
40044,177,19,184000,Ralph Wiggum,Houseboat,"Daddy, these rubber pants are hot."
40045,177,20,187000,Chief Wiggum,Houseboat,"You wear 'em until you learn, son."
40047,177,22,196000,Portly Chef,CAJUN RESTAURANT,I gar-ohn-tee!
40048,177,23,198000,Seymour Skinner,CAJUN RESTAURANT,Will you stop saying that.
40049,177,24,199000,Chief Wiggum,CAJUN RESTAURANT,"So, Skinner, who do you figure threw that skull through my window? What's the word on the street?"
40050,177,25,204000,Seymour Skinner,CAJUN RESTAURANT,"Well, to be honest, Chief, I haven't lived in New Orleans for 42 years. Although... according to an article I read in Parade Magazine, a criminal by the name of ""Big Daddy"" runs this town."
40051,177,26,216000,Chief Wiggum,CAJUN RESTAURANT,"Big Daddy, eh? Well, he won't feel so big if he messes with Chief Wiggum, P.I., again. Which I sincerely doubt he will."
40054,177,29,243000,Chief Wiggum,Houseboat,"Hey... Oh, God!"
40055,177,30,259000,Seymour Skinner,Houseboat,"Lucky for you, this was just a warning gator. The next one won't be corked."
40056,177,31,263000,Chief Wiggum,Houseboat,"Listen up, Big Daddy! You don't scare me! I'm three steps ahead of you--"
40057,177,32,269000,Seymour Skinner,Houseboat,"Oh, Chief? Your boy's been kidnapped."
40058,177,33,271000,Chief Wiggum,Houseboat,"Oh, God!"
40059,177,34,276000,Seymour Skinner,Houseboat,"Big Daddy's trademark calling card. See, it's right here inside the skull."
40060,177,35,284000,Chief Wiggum,Houseboat,"Looks like we've got our first case ever, Skinny Boy. And this time, it's personal!"
40061,177,36,291000,Announcer,Houseboat,"""Chief Wiggum, P.I."" will return... right now."
40063,177,38,297000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Office,Who is this?
40064,177,39,299000,Seymour Skinner,Chief Wiggum's Office,"It's me, Chief. I'm on the other extension."
40065,177,40,301000,Big Daddy,Chief Wiggum's Office,"Now you listen up, mon ami, and you listen good, heah? De name's Daddy. Charles Daddy."
40066,177,41,306000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Office,"Big Daddy! What've you done with my boy, Daddy?"
40067,177,42,309000,Big Daddy,Chief Wiggum's Office,"Ah, de boy's fine, so far. I taught him to play de spoons."
40068,177,43,314000,Big Daddy,Chief Wiggum's Office,"...If y'evah want to see dat boy again, I suggest y' leave town today, heah?"
40069,177,44,320000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Office,"Heh... Sounded like some sort of party going on in the background. Are there any parties today, Skinner?"
40071,177,45,326000,Seymour Skinner,Chief Wiggum's Office,"Eh, it's not really a party town. Though if I remember correctly, they occasionally hold a function called Mardi... something."
40075,177,49,355000,Chief Wiggum,Bourbon Street,"Well, if it isn't my old friends from Springfield, the Simpsons! What brings you folks to New Orleans?"
40076,177,50,361000,Bart Simpson,Bourbon Street,"Mardi Gras, man! When the Big Easy calls, ya gotta accept the charges!"
40077,177,51,365000,Lisa Simpson,Bourbon Street,"Chief Wiggum, I can't wait to hear about all the exciting, sexy adventures you're sure to have against this colorful backdrop!"
40078,177,52,371000,Chief Wiggum,Bourbon Street,"Well, golly, I'd love to chat, but my son's been kidnapped. You haven't seen him, have you? Caucasian male, between the ages of six and ten, thinning hair?"
40079,177,53,380000,Homer Simpson,Bourbon Street,Over there.
40080,177,54,382000,Ralph Wiggum,Bourbon Street,"Look, Big Daddy! It's regular daddy!"

40089,177,63,437000,Chief Wiggum,ANOTHER PART OF THE BAYOU,Whaddya suppose the rent is on a hideout like that?
40090,177,64,440000,Seymour Skinner,ANOTHER PART OF THE BAYOU,"Ah, it's not rented, Chief -- it's stolen. That's the Louisiana Governor's mansion. It's been missing for eight months."
40092,177,66,457000,Chief Wiggum,Mansion,You!!
40093,177,67,458000,Big Daddy,Mansion,"Welcome to ma maison, Chief. Ah've been expecting you."
40094,177,68,462000,Chief Wiggum,Mansion,"Is that so, Big Daddy? Well expect this: the arrest of you by me."
40095,177,69,468000,Big Daddy,Mansion,"Mais cher, New Orleans is ma town! Won't nobody gonna mess with me. I got interests, and I ain't talking 'bout stamp collecting. Though I do find that extremely interesting."

40097,177,71,481000,Big Daddy,Mansion,"Y'know, boys, dere's an old sayin' down on de bayou dat, um -- BLAH!"
40098,177,72,490000,Seymour Skinner,Mansion,"He's gradually getting away, Chief."
40100,177,73,493000,Chief Wiggum,Mansion,"Ah, let him go. I have a feeling we'll meet again, each and every week. Always in more sexy and exciting ways."
40101,177,74,502000,Ralph Wiggum,Mansion,"Daddy, when I grow up, I wanna be just like you."
40102,177,75,505000,Seymour Skinner,Mansion,"Better start eating, kid."
40103,177,76,507000,Chief Wiggum,Mansion,"""Start eating""?!"
40105,177,78,509000,Ralph Wiggum,Mansion,I didn't mean it that way...
40108,177,81,521000,Troy McClure,Museum of TV and Television,"Oh, hi! Welcome back to our Spin-off Showcase. Could ""The Simpsons"" ever have maintained its popularity without Moe the Bartender? Let's hope so, because Moe's leaving to do his own sitcom. But don't panic: he's taking a familiar sidekick with him, and his best friend Homer might just pop in to wish him luck. Let's take a peek..."
40110,177,83,546000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Well, ah, I better go. I've got a date with that lady in front of the drug store who's always yelling things."
40111,177,84,554000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,She told me she was washin' her hair tonight. I'm so desperately lonely.

40125,177,98,639000,Grampa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,See? That's your problem. You're a crab. Ladies like sweet talkers.
40126,177,99,644000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, I'm sweet. I'm sweeter than Jewish wine."
40128,177,100,647000,Grampa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Then prove it. I want you to charm the next pretty young thing that walks through that door.
40129,177,101,653000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, grrrreetings!"
40130,177,102,659000,Grampa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Son, it's me! I floated up toward heaven, but got lost along the way!"

40132,177,104,668000,Grampa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Darn tootin', ya lousy fink! You buried me naked and sold my suit to buy a ping-pong table! What kind of a son--"

40134,177,106,682000,Grampa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,That's the second time he pulled the plug on me.
40135,177,107,686000,Betty,Moe's Tavern,I was just in a car accident. Can I use your phone?
40136,177,108,688000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, usin' the phone's a four-drink minimum."
40138,177,110,692000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,What's the matter? I'm making as nice as I can.
40139,177,111,694000,Grampa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Test- lady. Test-lady.
40140,177,112,697000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,G'ahead. Give it a try.
40141,177,113,698000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,It goes by how clammy your hands are.
40142,177,114,701000,Betty,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I suppose I could use a laugh after that accident."
40143,177,115,709000,Grampa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Lovelorn. You-need-man. Moe-near-now. Go-near- Moe.
40144,177,116,715000,Betty,Moe's Tavern,What?
40145,177,117,716000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"""Go near Moe."" I'd say that's a pretty strong endorsement. So, how about you and me go out sometime? You know, out back."
40147,177,119,723000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"I mean, uh, out to dinner at a fancy French restaurant?"
40149,177,121,728000,Betty,Moe's Tavern,"Sounds great. And if this Love Tester's as accurate as it looks, maybe we'll be having breakfast, too."
40150,177,122,736000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"You did it, Grampa! You really are a love expert."
40151,177,123,740000,Grampa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Dang right! Fact is, I invented kissing. It was during World War One, and they were looking for a new way to spread germs..."
40153,177,125,758000,Moe Szyslak,FRENCH RESTAURANT,"Sorry, Grampa, but I gotta stash you in the bathroom so Betty won't get wise to us."
40154,177,126,765000,Grampa Simpson,FRENCH RESTAURANT,This is not the evening I envisioned.

40160,177,132,785000,Moe Szyslak,Restaurant,"You know what's great about you, Betty, is you're letting your looks go gracefully. You're not all hung up on looking ""attractive"" and ""desirable"". It's just so rare and refreshing."
40161,177,133,795000,Betty,Restaurant,"So, Moe, tell me a little about yourself."
40162,177,134,798000,Moe Szyslak,Restaurant,"Myself? Oh, geez. Um, I gotta go to the can again. I got the runs."

40173,177,145,852000,Moe Szyslak,Men's Room,"Um, ah, oh, g... I might as well come clean with ya. I ain't too good at talking to women, and... and I really wanted to do ya, so I brought along the love tester to help me. As you may have guessed, it's inhabited by the ghost of my friend's dead father."
40174,177,146,869000,Betty,Men's Room,"Why you conniving, devious, monstrous, despicable, sweet little angel."
40175,177,147,877000,Moe Szyslak,Men's Room,"Look, Betty, if you just give me a chance... Whh-aaaattt??!!"
