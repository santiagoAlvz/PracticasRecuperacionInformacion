2357,40,37,199000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, a bit overly familiar, but I'll allow it. I took in a movie. An appalling little piece of filth. Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird."
2358,40,38,209000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time."

2381,40,64,316000,Calm Woman,Homer's Workstation,Sector 7-G is now being isolated.
2383,40,66,320000,Bart Simpson,Stop 'n Go Gas Station,"My best friend shafted me. I'll never get over this, Otto-man."
2384,40,67,324000,Otto Mann,Stop 'n Go Gas Station,"Aw, sure you will. You know, once my old lady ran off and married my brother. Well, it hurt, but here it is a month later and I'm sleeping on their couch."

2408,40,90,393000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Oh, meltdown is one of those annoying buzzwords. I prefer to call it an unrequested fission surplus."

2411,40,93,402000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Workstation,"Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT."

2465,40,146,602000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Yes, we've isolated the problem and wouldn't you know? False alarm. It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system."
2466,40,147,611000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Very good. Well sir, your point about nuclear hysteria is well taken. This reporter promises to be more trusting and less vigilant in the future."
2468,40,149,623000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Excellent. Well, ""ta"". Hmmm, Smithers, I can still sell 'em snake oil. Now bring me a wine spritzer -- and don't be stingy with the vino."

2504,40,184,797000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Nah. I'm just depressed. Milhouse's mom won't let me play with him any more.
2505,40,185,805000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham? And what's all this?"

2512,40,192,849000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe you ate a clove.
2513,40,193,851000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What's your problem, boy?"

2520,40,200,878000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Milhouse to Bart, Milhouse to Bart... Please don't hate me. Please?"
2522,40,202,892000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he'll never know who did it."

2526,40,206,919000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,It seems Ari's been having terrible worker problems at Shelbyville.
2527,40,207,921000,Aristotle,Burns's Office,They've lost their zest for work. You must help them find their Eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve!

2531,40,211,934000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"But I really can't tell them anything, sir."

2534,40,213,945000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Well! Smithers, how kind of you to pay us a visit."
2535,40,214,948000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Couldn't help it, sir. The parking here is terrible."
2536,40,215,952000,Aristotle,Burns's Office,This man has no love for his power plant.
2537,40,216,954000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Begone from my sight.
2538,40,217,958000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,That one's always been a problem.
2540,40,219,961000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,One... two... three... Community chest.
2541,40,220,965000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Nah.
2542,40,221,966000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Nah.
2543,40,222,967000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ah. I've won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect ten bucks.
2544,40,223,972000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ha ha! You're losing.
2545,40,224,976000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, don't feed your sister hotels!"
2546,40,225,979000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry mom, there's tons of these things."
2547,40,226,981000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I think that game is too old for her. Why don't you go play with Milhouse?
2548,40,227,985000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't wanna play with Milhouse.
2549,40,228,986000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean you still haven't made up with him?
2550,40,229,988000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's his mom. She says I'm a bad influence. C'mon Maggie, let's go throw rocks at that hornet's nest."
2552,40,231,997000,Marge Simpson,Van Houten Home,"Mrs. Van Houten, I'm Bart's mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint."
2553,40,232,1003000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"I remember. Please, come in."
2555,40,234,1004000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Marge, I'm sorry, but I think it would be better if Milhouse didn't see your son."
2556,40,235,1010000,Marge Simpson,Van Houten Home,"Look, I know Bart can be a handful but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things..."
2557,40,236,1022000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Well, Marge, the other day, Milhouse told me my meatloaf sucks. He must have gotten that from your little boy, because they certainly don't say that word on TV!"
2558,40,237,1032000,Marge Simpson,Van Houten Home,"Well, I can't defend everything he does. But let's face it, all Bart and Milhouse have is each other. They're too young for girls. And they're a popular target for bullies. And in the Christmas pageant, they're always sheep. Please, please, let them be friends!"
2503,40,238,1054000,Luann Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"I'll think about it, Marge."
2559,40,240,1058000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"So the next time somebody tells you county folk are good, honest people, you can spit in their faces for me!"
2560,40,241,1065000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick."
2561,40,242,1074000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, that's sweet. I used to follow my dad to a lot of bars too."
2562,40,243,1079000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Here you go. One beer, one chocolate milk."
2563,40,244,1081000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk."
2564,40,245,1083000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Oh.
2565,40,246,1086000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"What's the matter, Homer? The depressin' effects of alcohol usually don't kick in 'til closing time."
2566,40,247,1091000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"He's just a little nervous. He has to give a speech tomorrow on ""How To Keep Cool In A Crisis."""
2567,40,248,1096000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
2568,40,249,1097000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody."
2569,40,250,1108000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Did it work?
2570,40,251,1108000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"I'm a free man, ain't I?"
2572,40,253,1110000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Milhouse to Bart, do you want to come over and play?"
2573,40,254,1114000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Really? We can be friends again? Did your mom die?
2574,40,255,1118000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Uh, I don't think so."
2575,40,256,1119000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Who cares?! Milhouse, I'll be right there! Sorry Maggie, game's over."
2576,40,257,1125000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Mom, I'm friends with Milhouse again."
2577,40,258,1128000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I knew his mother would come to her senses.."
2578,40,259,1131000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Thanks for sticking up for me.
2579,40,260,1134000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What makes you think I did it?

2581,40,262,1140000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You be good.
2582,40,263,1141000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I will.
2584,40,265,1149000,Aristotle,Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant,"As I look out into this sea of smiling faces, I am filled with a sense of loathing and revulsion. You are not workers, you are a pack of mangy cud-chewing ugly goats! Well, you're in for a treat. We have with us today a real man. Behold the glory that is Homer Simpson!"
2586,40,266,1172000,Homer Simpson,Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant,Uh... ladies and... gentlemen...
2587,40,267,1175000,Thought Bubble Barney,Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant,Just picture them in their underwear.

2600,40,280,1241000,SCOTT,Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant,"Thanks, Kent. There was more dumb luck in the news today when our own Police Chief Wiggum foiled a bank hold-up without even trying. It seems the chief had come to the bank to cash in his penny jar."
2601,40,281,1259000,Chief Wiggum,Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant,"...48, 49, 50."
2602,40,282,1263000,Security Guard,Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant,"Good work, Chief."
2603,40,283,1264000,Chief Wiggum,Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant,Just doing my job.
