122697,473,114,565000,Fbi Supervisor,Springfield Prison,"Here's how it goes down: I rough up Louie. Then you stand up to me, earning his trust."
122698,473,115,569000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,But I haven't earned his trust if it's based on a lie.

122723,473,141,658000,Female Agent,SURVEILLANCE ROOM,He's in.
122724,473,142,659000,Whiny Agent,SURVEILLANCE ROOM,I was gonna say that.
122727,473,145,662000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,What's going on? I called the prison and they won't tell me where Homer is!
122728,473,146,667000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Sorry, Marge, I can't tell ya."
122729,473,147,667000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"If it makes you feel better, I can tell you about someone else. Ooo, how 'bout Krusty in the drunk tank?"

122738,473,156,702000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's,"Oregano, basil, rosemary..."
122739,473,157,705000,Louie,Luigi's,"I think I got a ketchup packet for ya, boss!"
122740,473,158,707000,Fat Tony,Luigi's,Did you order French fries and not use it?

122750,473,167,757000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,Yeah. Those guys are probably FBI informants.
122751,473,168,762000,Fat Tony,Cemetery,You think an informant could get that close to me?
122752,473,169,764000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,Oh yeah. I got in your gang and you barely know who I am.
122753,473,170,768000,Fat Tony,Cemetery,"That is good counsel, indeed. You have earned my complete, unquestioning trust. But first, one little thing... you must make your bones."

122814,473,231,1003000,Fbi Supervisor,DOCKS,"Homer, I just want to say that of all the rat bastards we've had working for us, you were the snitchiest."
122815,473,232,1009000,Homer Simpson,DOCKS,"So that's it! You used me to kill a man, and all I get is a handshake and a blanket?"
122816,473,233,1013000,Female Agent,DOCKS,We didn't say you could use the blanket.
122817,473,234,1015000,Fbi Supervisor,DOCKS,And I'm not gonna shake your hand.
122818,473,235,1018000,Homer Simpson,DOCKS,Poor Tony. He didn't deserve this. He was just a soldier in a war he started.
122820,473,237,1028000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I know you had a terrible experience, but it's over."
122821,473,238,1033000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's not over, Marge. It'll never be over. When I shut my eyes, all I see is Fat Tony and me having drinks at that bar on the beach."
122822,473,239,1042000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You never took me to that bar on the beach.
122823,473,240,1044000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh. Well, uh... you wouldn't like it. It's not very good."
122824,473,241,1049000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Sounds pretty good.
122825,473,242,1051000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no, I oversold it."
122827,473,244,1062000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,I'd give anything to bring you back.
122828,473,245,1066000,Fit Tony,Springfield Cemetery,"Wake up, Homer."
122829,473,246,1068000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,Fat Tony?
122830,473,247,1072000,Fit Tony,Springfield Cemetery,"No -- I'm his cousin from San Diego, Fit Tony."
122831,473,248,1078000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"Wow, I've never seen a mobster use a tracksuit for exercising."
122832,473,249,1082000,Fit Tony,Springfield Cemetery,"And there's no better exercise than killing and disemboweling a big, fat snitch."
122833,473,250,1089000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,I understand. I loved him too.
122834,473,251,1096000,Fit Tony,Springfield Cemetery,Your tears seem in no way crocodilian.
122835,473,252,1100000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"Do what you gotta do. The quicker you kill me up here, the quicker he can kill me down there."
122836,473,253,1107000,Fit Tony,Springfield Cemetery,Join me on the elliptical machines.
122837,473,254,1110000,Fit Tony,Springfield Cemetery,I will let you live for... twenty minutes.
122839,473,256,1120000,Homer Simpson,Gym,I worked for Fat Tony. And he was the best boss I ever had.
122840,473,257,1124000,C. Montgomery Burns,Gym,Well. This is awkward.
122841,473,258,1126000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"Wha-- oh, oh, uh, Mr. Burns? Uh, you were cool too."
122842,473,259,1130000,C. Montgomery Burns,Gym,"Oh, I so believe that."
122844,473,260,1135000,Homer Simpson,Gym,He took me to a fight that he fixed. But he never let on. Not even when I bet five hundred dollars on the wrong guy. Then he said he would dope a horse for me.
122845,473,261,1146000,Fit Tony,Gym,"Homer, it is time... to switch your elliptical machine to cool-down mode."
122846,473,262,1153000,Homer Simpson,Gym,Are you gonna kill me now? 'Cause I'm super ready.
122847,473,263,1156000,Fit Tony,Gym,"No. Because my cousin lives on in your memories. And to extinguish you, would be to whack what still remains of him."
122848,473,264,1164000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"Wow, the killers have been kind to me... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt! What kind of a world is this?"
122849,473,265,1173000,Fit Tony,Gym,It's pretty screwed-up. That's why I keep my friends close.
122850,473,266,1177000,Homer Simpson,Gym,And your enemies closer?
122851,473,267,1178000,Fit Tony,Gym,"No! Why would I do that? If they were close, they would kill me!"
122852,473,268,1182000,Homer Simpson,Gym,Fit Tony took his cousin's place running the Springfield mob.
122853,473,269,1187000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"The pressures got to him so he started to eat. Soon, he was known as ""Fit Fat Tony,"" then just ""Fat Tony"" for short."
122854,473,270,1202000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"And me? Now, I'm just an average shnook like everyone else."
122855,473,271,1203000,Homer Simpson,Gym,Stuck in this backwater burg where all you can count on is your family. And the only one who ever shot anyone is the baby.
122856,473,272,1213000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"And I have to admit, it's a pretty good life."
