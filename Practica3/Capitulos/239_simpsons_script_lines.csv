58436,239,2,93000,LARGO,Springfield Elementary School,"You'll have to do a lot better than that, especially since we've just been accepted in the school band competition at the county fair!"
58437,239,3,103000,LARGO,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm sorry, I mean the state fair!"
58440,239,5,107000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I hate to be a killjoy, but do you really think we can win playing ""Stars and Stripes Forever""? It's so beginner band, and we're advanced beginner band."
58441,239,6,115000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,This is band?
58442,239,7,116000,LARGO,Springfield Elementary School,"Very well, Lisa. What rousing Sousa march would you have us play?"
58443,239,8,120000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I thought maybe, for once, we could play a song that wasn't written by Sousa."
58444,239,9,125000,LARGO,Springfield Elementary School,You mean something just arranged by Sousa?
58445,239,10,128000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No, something fresh and bold."
58446,239,11,131000,LARGO,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, darling, you have lost me."
58447,239,12,132000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"How about something cool, like ""Camptown Races."""
58448,239,13,136000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, grandpa, the Civil War's over. How about ""Little Brown Jug""? YA-HA-HA, HEE-HEE-HEE, LITTLE BROWN JUG, HOW I LOVE THEE..."
58449,239,14,144000,LARGO,Springfield Elementary School,"Stop with your devil music. Lisa, this is all your fault."
58450,239,15,148000,Rat-pack Kid,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, the blond broad's got a point. We need something with a little ring-a-ding-ding!"
58451,239,16,153000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Take your arm off me.
58452,239,17,154000,Rat-pack Kid,Springfield Elementary School,"Ooo, this kitten's got claws."
58453,239,18,157000,LARGO,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, we'll do a different song. Who cares? They all end up sounding the same anyway."
58454,239,19,163000,Rat-pack Kid,Springfield Elementary School,What a fruit fly.
58456,239,21,168000,Homer Simpson,STATE FAIR,Vietnam Veteran.
58457,239,22,170000,Ticket Taker,STATE FAIR,Do you have a military I.D.?
58458,239,23,172000,Homer Simpson,STATE FAIR,"I.D.? Man, Charlie didn't ask for I.D. when I fought at La Choy and Chun King. I saw my best friend's head explode at Margaret Cho."
58459,239,24,183000,Marge Simpson,STATE FAIR,"Homer, give him the fifty cents."
58460,239,25,185000,Homer Simpson,STATE FAIR,"Why should I? Did my country give me a parade? No, man! They spat at me and..."
58461,239,26,191000,Ticket Taker,STATE FAIR,Just go.
58462,239,27,192000,Homer Simpson,STATE FAIR,Thanks. This closes the saddest chapter in American history.
58464,239,29,198000,Marge Simpson,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,I can't wait to do some shopping -- Look at all these innovative products. Miracle Shears...
58465,239,30,207000,Marge Simpson,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,"Ooh, the Drain Bugger!"
58468,239,31,220000,SALESGUY,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,"Folks, how often have you opened your morning paper, only to have the rubber band fly off and hit you right in the eye?"
58469,239,32,226000,Marge Simpson,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,"Never, but it's my number one concern!"
58470,239,33,229000,SALESGUY,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,"Well, with the OmniGogs system, those worries are a thing of the past."
58471,239,34,235000,SALESGUY,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,"I'm all right, folks! Thanks to my OmniGogs!"
58472,239,35,240000,Lenny Leonard,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,A little late for Lenny.
58473,239,36,245000,Bart Simpson,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,Who are those pleasant old men?
58474,239,37,247000,Homer Simpson,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,"It's B.T.O.! They're Canada's answer to E.L.P. Their big hit was ""T.C.B."" That's how we talked in the '70s. We didn't have a moment to spare."
58475,239,38,255000,Randy Bachman,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,"Hello, Springfield."
58476,239,39,260000,Randy Bachman,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,We're going to play all your old favorites
58478,239,41,262000,Randy Bachman,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,But first we'd like to dip into our new CD...
58479,239,42,266000,Homer Simpson,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,Takin' Care of Business!
58480,239,43,267000,Fred Turner,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,"Don't worry, sir. We'll get to that one..."
58481,239,44,269000,Homer Simpson,STATE FAIRGROUNDS,"No talking! No new crap! ""Takin' Care of Business!"" Now!"

58491,239,54,304000,Homer Simpson,BANDSHELL,What-everrr!
58492,239,55,306000,Fred Turner,BANDSHELL,Be sure to stick around for the battle of the elementary school bands.
58494,239,57,311000,Marge Simpson,BANDSHELL,"Homer, Lisa's in that."
58495,239,58,313000,Homer Simpson,BANDSHELL,I stand by my disappointed groan.
58496,239,59,329000,Bart Simpson,BANDSHELL,"Check out Lisa. She's a sax machine! Makes me think I should've done something with my life. Oh, well."
58497,239,60,340000,State Comptroller Atkins,BANDSHELL,Just beautiful. This is what comptrolling is all about.
58498,239,61,345000,Lisa Simpson,BANDSHELL,Anybody got a building permit? 'Cause we nailed it!
58499,239,62,349000,Bart Simpson,BANDSHELL,"Way to blow, Lis!"
58466,239,63,350000,Marge Simpson,BANDSHELL,"That is the best version of ""Living in America"" I've ever heard."
58381,239,64,354000,Homer Simpson,BANDSHELL,Third best for me.
58500,239,65,356000,State Comptroller Atkins,BANDSHELL,"Well, unless there's another band, I think we have a winner. Oh wait, there is another band. From Ogdenville. Uh, please welcome... The Ogdenville Band!"
58501,239,66,369000,Lisa Simpson,BANDSHELL,"""Stars and Stripes Forever""? Oh, man. They're toast!"
58502,239,67,385000,Crowd,BANDSHELL,Ooo!
58503,239,68,385000,Lisa Simpson,BANDSHELL,Glow sticks? But visual aids are against the rules!
58504,239,69,389000,State Comptroller Atkins,BANDSHELL,"Whooo, baby! Well, it's not going to be easy to pick a winner, but..."
58505,239,70,394000,Crowd,BANDSHELL,Og-den-ville! Og-den-ville!
58506,239,71,396000,State Comptroller Atkins,BANDSHELL,"...but I think one school red, white, and blue us all away!"
58507,239,72,403000,COMPTROLLER ATKINS,BANDSHELL,And the winner is Ogdenville!
58509,239,74,410000,Lisa Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,"I hope you enjoy your plaque, cheater."
58510,239,75,414000,COMPTROLLER ATKINS,FAIRGROUNDS,"Well, I was going to give you the Good Sportsmanship Award, but now I'm just going to be sick."
58511,239,76,419000,Lisa Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,I can't believe those idiot judges were impressed by glowing plastic tubes.
58512,239,77,423000,Homer Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,"Look, Lisa. It glows. Oooo."
58513,239,78,428000,Marge Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,Let's forget about the band contest and just have fun at the State Fair.
58514,239,79,433000,Lisa Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,You mean State Un-fair.
58515,239,80,435000,Marge Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,"Yeah, right, that's what I meant, Lisa. State Un-fair."
58516,239,81,439000,Bart Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,Zing!
58517,239,82,442000,Homer Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,"See, Marge? I told you they could deep-fry my shirt."
58518,239,83,446000,Marge Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,I didn't say they couldn't. I said you shouldn't.
58519,239,84,449000,Barker,FAIRGROUNDS,"Step right up and see Duncan, the Incredible Diving Horse!"
58520,239,85,455000,Marge Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,I wish people would stop telling me to step right up.
58521,239,86,461000,Barker,FAIRGROUNDS,"Looks like he's ready to dive, folks!"
58522,239,87,472000,Barker,FAIRGROUNDS,Another incredible performance by this water-loving wonderhorse!
58523,239,88,478000,Barker,FAIRGROUNDS,"What's that, Duncan? You say you want to dive again? Well..."
58524,239,89,487000,Chief Wiggum,FAIRGROUNDS,"Ah, this is clearly a case of animal cruelty. Ah, do you have a permit for that?"
58525,239,90,492000,Barker,FAIRGROUNDS,"No problem, sir. It's in my car."
58526,239,91,497000,Lou,FAIRGROUNDS,"You gotta stop bein' so trusting, Chief."
58527,239,92,500000,Chief Wiggum,FAIRGROUNDS,"I'd rather let a thousand guilty men go free, than chase after them. All right, show's over, folks. I'm afraid this horse is going to the dog food factory."
58439,239,93,509000,Homer Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,Good luck gettin' a horse to eat dog food.
58528,239,94,512000,Bart Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,You can't do that to Duncan. It's not his fault that his owner was a sleaze.
58529,239,95,516000,Chief Wiggum,FAIRGROUNDS,"Look, I just want the horse to have a good home, or be food. You want to take him, fine with me."
58530,239,96,528000,Marge Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,Hmm. Should the Simpsons get a horse?
58531,239,97,531000,Comic Book Guy,FAIRGROUNDS,"Excuse me. But I believe this family already had a horse, and the expense forced Homer to work at the Kwik-E-Mart with hilarious consequences."
58532,239,98,540000,Homer Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,Anybody care what this guy thinks?
58533,239,99,543000,Crowd,FAIRGROUNDS,No!
58535,239,101,546000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Tunnel!
58537,239,103,557000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my. Ooh-hoo. It's going to cost us $500 a week to keep Duncan!"
58538,239,104,563000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But he'll bring us joy, Marge. Unlike all your silly gewgaws."
58539,239,105,567000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"At least you don't have to feed any of the stuff I bought at the fair. Well, except the mop."
58540,239,106,576000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, your pro-mop, anti-horse agenda has been clear for some time. But don't worry, I have a way for Duncan to earn his keep."
58542,239,108,587000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Mmm, that's terrific, Duncan. You're ten for ten. Now, let's look in the rulebook and see if horses can play in the NFL."
58543,239,109,596000,Bart Simpson,Football Field,He's a diving horse. Maybe he could dive for pearls.
58544,239,110,599000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Pearls, eh?"
58545,239,111,605000,Giant Pearl,Football Field,Breakfast is served.
58547,239,113,621000,Bart Simpson,Football Field,"Hey, Dad."
58548,239,114,622000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,Huh?
58549,239,115,622000,Bart Simpson,Football Field,This horse is pretty fast. Maybe we can race him.
58550,239,116,625000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Racehorse, eh?"
58552,239,118,631000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dear Mr. President
58554,239,120,632000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"What are you doing, Lisa?"
58555,239,121,634000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm writing a letter to President Clinton about that travesty of a band contest. As a fellow sax player, I'm sure he'll be outraged."
58556,239,122,642000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, don't get obsessed with that. Focus on the good things. Like this fire extinguisher I got at the fair."
58557,239,123,648000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Really -- Hey, what are you doing?"
58559,239,124,652000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's the only fire extinguisher endorsed by both Lynda Carter and George Foreman.
58560,239,125,658000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I wonder what would happen if they had a baby?
58561,239,126,665000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, if we're gonna race Duncan, shouldn't we hire a professional trainer?"
58562,239,127,669000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son, I learned everything I needed to know from ""The Horse Whisperer"". Step One: Seduce a lonely housewife."
58563,239,128,677000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ma'am.
58564,239,129,678000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now for the actual horse whispering.
58565,239,130,680000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"When the race starts, run really fast!"
58568,239,133,689000,Moe Szyslak,GRANDSTAND,"Aw, c'mon, c'mon. There's got to be a winner on this floor somewhere. Bingo!"
58569,239,134,693000,Moe Szyslak,GRANDSTAND,"Hey, leggo, you lousy, stinkin'..."
58570,239,135,696000,Moe Szyslak,GRANDSTAND,Whaaa?!
58571,239,136,701000,Moe Szyslak,GRANDSTAND,You're beau-tee-ful.
58572,239,137,705000,Moe Szyslak,GRANDSTAND,Uh-oh. This is a serious medical problem. I gotta go.
58574,239,139,710000,Jockey #1,Race Track,"Just once, I'd like to ride clockwise."
58575,239,140,712000,Jockey #2,Race Track,Really? I thought I was the only one.
58576,239,141,717000,Homer Simpson,Race Track,"Champion horse, coming through!"
58577,239,142,720000,Jockey #1,Race Track,What the...
58578,239,143,721000,Homer Simpson,Race Track,Good horse. Here's one taco and you'll get another when you win.
58579,239,144,726000,Homer Simpson,Race Track,"Hey, where do you get those metal dealies for his feet?"
58580,239,145,730000,Jockey #2,Race Track,You mean horseshoes?
58581,239,146,731000,Homer Simpson,Race Track,"Hey, what's with the attitude? I just want some dealies."
58582,239,147,734000,Jockey #1,Race Track,You really think that horse can run a mile and a half?
58583,239,148,737000,Homer Simpson,Race Track,He ran all the way here.
58585,239,150,746000,Homer Simpson,STARTING GATE,"You can do it, Duncan. I don't care if your odds are... Five million to one!?"
58586,239,151,752000,Bart Simpson,STARTING GATE,"Don't worry, boy. I'll love you even if you don't win."
58588,239,153,759000,Homer Simpson,GRANDSTAND,"That horse better win, or we're taking a trip to the glue factory and he won't get to come."
58589,239,154,766000,Lenny Leonard,GRANDSTAND,"Yeah, that's a great tour, but you can't see it all in one day."
58590,239,155,770000,Carl Carlson,GRANDSTAND,"Hey, be quiet."
58591,239,156,772000,Track Announcer,GRANDSTAND,And away they go!
58592,239,157,773000,Lenny Leonard,GRANDSTAND,"Go, Duncan! / Go, Number ""5""! Let's go, Number ""5""! / Do it for Lenny!"
58594,239,159,776000,Track Announcer,Announcer's Booth,"It's Chock Full O' Drugs, followed closely by Stalker, with Old Levis fading fast."
58595,239,160,781000,Track Announcer,Announcer's Booth,"What's this? Number ""5"", Duncan, the horse no one expected to do anything, isn't doing anything. He hasn't even left the starting gate!"
58596,239,161,790000,Bart Simpson,Announcer's Booth,"C'mon, boy. I know you're scared, but you can do this. I believe in you!"
58597,239,162,797000,Track Announcer,Announcer's Booth,"Would you look at this? The straggler, Duncan, has exploded out of the gate and is making a big move! He's showing more heart than any horse I've ever seen. What a shame the race is already over."
58600,239,165,818000,Homer Simpson,Race Track,"Cheer up, son. I thought you looked damn good out there. Oh, wait. You were number ""5""? Eew! You stin... Damn good."
58601,239,166,833000,Bart Simpson,Race Track,"Duncan's really fast, Dad. He was just intimidated by those other horses."
58602,239,167,837000,Homer Simpson,Race Track,"Well, he's not gonna be intimidated anymore. We're gonna toughen him up -- give him a new badass attitude. All those other horses will be shaking in their horse dealies."
58604,239,169,849000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, I'd like to speak to President Clinton, please. I wrote to him and he never wrote back... No, I don't want Al Gore!"
58605,239,170,856000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, you've got to learn that life isn't always fair. Try to channel your disappointment into something creative, like a sampler."
58607,239,172,867000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Is that Duncan?
58608,239,173,869000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not anymore. Ladies, say hello to..."
58609,239,174,872000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Furious D""?"
58610,239,175,874000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"He's the bad boy of racing. He's got attitude and bad-itude, so show him some latitude and you'll win his gratitude. Only in America!"
58611,239,176,880000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ew, you used my bracelet for a nose ring!"
58612,239,177,884000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Possessions are fleeting.
58614,239,179,889000,Mrs. Vanderbilt,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"Why, look at that disgraceful beast."
58615,239,180,892000,Mr. Vanderbilt,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,Good Lord! What has become of the Sport of Kings?
58616,239,181,895000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,Get bent.
58618,239,182,898000,Mr. Vanderbilt,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,That's my third monocle this week. I simply must stop being so horrified.
58620,239,184,903000,Marge Simpson,BETTING LINE,So many horses. I don't know who to vote for. Can't I just bet that all the horses will have a fun time?
58621,239,185,911000,Wiseguy,BETTING LINE,"Yeah, I think you want that line."
58623,239,187,917000,Jockey #1,RACETRACK,"Ooo, he looks scary."
58624,239,188,918000,Jockey #2,RACETRACK,"Yeah, I'm shakin' in my silks. Ooo, ooo, ooo."
58625,239,189,923000,Bart Simpson,RACETRACK,"Don't listen to 'em, D. Just remember, you've got a new persona. A new per-so-na."
58626,239,190,932000,Track Announcer,RACETRACK,And away they go!
58627,239,191,935000,Marge Simpson,RACETRACK,"Okay, Lisa. I've got Furious D across the board, boxed with the three and the eight, and wheeled up and down."
58628,239,192,942000,Lisa Simpson,RACETRACK,"Mom, I think you might be developing a gambling problem."
58629,239,193,945000,Comic Book Guy,RACETRACK,"Hey, I'm watching you..."
58630,239,194,947000,Track Announcer,RACETRACK,They're tightly bunched as they round the far turn.
58631,239,195,949000,Track Announcer,RACETRACK,"Wait a minute... Hang onto your monocles, 'cause Furious D is closing like a horse possessed!"
58632,239,196,960000,Bart Simpson,RACETRACK,"That's it, D. Don't let anyone push you around. Be as bad as you wanna be."
58633,239,197,965000,Track Announcer,RACETRACK,"And the winner, Furious D!"
58634,239,198,971000,Nelson Muntz,RACETRACK,"Oh man, that horse don't take no guff from nobody."
58635,239,199,974000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,RACETRACK,Guff?
58636,239,200,975000,Nelson Muntz,RACETRACK,I mean shi...
58638,239,202,978000,Homer Simpson,Race Track,Woo hoo! In your little faces!
58640,239,204,1005000,Homer Simpson,RACETRACK,"Man, I got more trophies than Wayne Gretzky and the Pope combined."

58678,239,242,1123000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You want me to lose the Springfield Derby? But you always taught me that winning was everything.

58680,239,244,1134000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe. But if Duncan wins the Derby, he can spend the rest of his days as a stud."

58693,239,257,1169000,Track Announcer,RACETRACK,"What a shameful display by these tiny hotheads. Let's try to remember the good little people, like James Madison, or Oscar winner Linda Hunt."
58695,239,259,1184000,Track Announcer,RACETRACK,"Could it be? In a bizarre twist, a horse is abusing a jockey."

58720,239,285,1288000,Bill Clinton,Simpson Home,"No, thank you, Lisa, for teaching kids everywhere a valuable lesson: If things don't go your way, just keep complaining until your dreams come true."
58721,239,286,1297000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's a pretty lousy lesson.
58722,239,287,1298000,Bill Clinton,Simpson Home,"Hey, I'm a pretty lousy President."
