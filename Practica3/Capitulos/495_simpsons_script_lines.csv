128462,495,16,92000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not me, man. This cycle of jerks has to end."
128463,495,17,96000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Are we done yet? ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is about to start. I wonder what my life would've been like if I'd never seen that movie..."

148387,495,30,205000,Adult Bart,Springfield Elementary School,"You know, I can hear everything you say during ""cross phase."" What are you doin' here?"
128467,495,31,211000,Jiff,Springfield Elementary School,Mom says you have to watch us over the holidays.
128468,495,32,214000,Skippy,Springfield Elementary School,She says you're our Dad and you need to act like it.
128469,495,33,216000,Jiff,Springfield Elementary School,Christmas with you is gonna suck.

128477,495,45,254000,Zia,Lisa's House,"Gee, I'm fine, Mom, thanks for asking. I'm going online."
148499,495,46,261000,Adult Lisa,Lisa's House,How did my daughter turn into my brother?
128478,495,47,264000,Adult Milhouse,Lisa's House,"Don't blame me. When we had her, they used only the best genetic material, which meant none of mine."
148500,495,48,270000,Adult Lisa,Lisa's House,You parked the car. That helped.
128479,495,49,272000,Adult Milhouse,Lisa's House,I guess.
148501,495,50,274000,Adult Lisa,Lisa's House,Maybe my Mom would have some ideas...
128480,495,51,275000,Adult Milhouse,Lisa's House,"Why don't you take Zia to your parents for Christmas, while I nurse my allergies in one of the non-Christmas-celebrating states."
148502,495,52,282000,Adult Lisa,Lisa's House,You could go back to Michigan -- it's still under Sharia law.
128481,495,53,286000,Adult Milhouse,Lisa's House,"Yeah, but they always make me wear a veil."
128484,495,56,301000,Robot Doctor,Maggie's Suite,"Everything looks great, Maggie. But until this baby comes, I don't want you to make a sound."

128486,495,58,307000,Robot Doctor,Maggie's Suite,"I'm sorry, but recent research has shown that the umbilical cord is also a vocal cord. Now, can you tell me who the father is?"

128489,495,61,325000,Holo-book,Simpson Home,I see you are reading a children's book. Yet your profile indicates you are a mature adult. Is there an error?

128491,495,63,332000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Marge, how would you like some ""future sex""?"
128492,495,64,339000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why do you say ""future?"" This is now."
128493,495,65,342000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I meant a week from tomorrow. That's when the new penis gets here.
128494,495,66,347000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I just got a message from Maggie in my brain.

128498,495,70,363000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't open it, Homie! It's a virus!"
128499,495,71,369000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Too late!
128500,495,72,383000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, after I stopped drinking, this was a way to stay close to my bottles."
128501,495,73,392000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'd smash 'em all for one lousy beer.
148393,495,74,395000,Adult Bart,Simpson Home,Oh man. I can't believe they still haven't figured out a way to detangle Christmas lights.
128502,495,75,400000,Skippy,Simpson Home,Mom's boyfriend is good at detangling them.
148394,495,76,402000,Adult Bart,Simpson Home,"Well, maybe Mom should marry him."
128503,495,77,405000,Skippy,Simpson Home,She did.
128504,495,78,405000,Jiff,Simpson Home,We weren't supposed to tell you.

128505,495,80,411000,Skippy,Simpson Home,Hey Grampa. Are you gonna build a snowman?
128506,495,81,414000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke."
148396,495,82,421000,Adult Bart,Simpson Home,"Dad, can you take the boys out for a while? I don't feel so good."
128507,495,83,425000,Skippy,Simpson Home,"Thanks for spending so much time with us, Dad."
128508,495,84,428000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who wants to go to the park and ride the merry-go-nowhere?
128509,495,85,430000,Jiff,Simpson Home,I do! I do! / Me! Me!
148397,495,86,433000,Adult Bart,Simpson Home,I can't believe she got married and I have no one. It's so hard to find somebody new.
128510,495,87,438000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Sure is! That's why after Homer accidentally killed Edna, I married Maude's ghost!"
128511,495,88,443000,Maude's Ghost,Simpson Home,"There is no God, Neddy. It's just an empty meaningless void."
128512,495,89,447000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Isn't she pretty?
128514,495,91,454000,Ticket Agent,Heathrow Teleport,"Oh, ma'am, you really shouldn't teleport when you're pregnant. I'm afraid your only choice is... air travel!"

128521,495,96,489000,Adult Lisa,Simpson Home,Wanna go to a concert tonight? Sixty-eight percent of the original Cher is playing.
128519,495,97,494000,Zia,Simpson Home,"Sure, I'd love to -- only not with you, and not that."
128523,495,99,500000,Adult Lisa,Simpson Home,Sometimes I wish strangling your kid was still legal.
128520,495,100,502000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not since they passed ""Homer's Law."" Oh honey, why don't you just relax and bake something?"
128549,495,101,508000,Adult Lisa,Simpson Home,"I am trying to deal with my disrespectful daughter, but you are too clueless to understand what that's like."
128527,495,104,517000,Australian Man,Sky,Oi! Can I get a pillow for my head?
128530,495,107,525000,Stewardess,Plane,"Suicide pills, Mohawk gel, twenty-year-old Business Week, turkey and brie wrap..."

128550,495,112,549000,Adult Lisa,Simpson Home,"My daughter thinks I'm a ruthless tyrant, like Hitler or Prince Harry."
128535,495,113,554000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Bloody Harry"" -- he brought back beheading in a big way! Now, I'm gonna show these boys downtown Springfield."
148504,495,114,560000,Adult Lisa,Simpson Home,"Oh, isn't that a little dangerous?"
128536,495,115,562000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, don't worry, I have my invisibility cloak. Now where did I put it?"
128537,495,116,577000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Help me, my children!"
128538,495,117,580000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,What are you after? We're a cashless society!

148506,495,131,648000,Adult Lisa,Bart's Treehouse,Should I have married Nelson? 'Cause we still talk on the phone.
148400,495,132,652000,Adult Bart,Bart's Treehouse,Nelson calls you?
148507,495,133,654000,Adult Lisa,Bart's Treehouse,Well... someone calls someone.
148401,495,134,657000,Adult Bart,Bart's Treehouse,The boys think I'm a lousy father.
148508,495,135,659000,Adult Lisa,Bart's Treehouse,"Oh, poor Bart. My daughter thinks I'm a lousy mother."

148405,495,143,683000,Adult Bart,Bart's Treehouse,You think so?
148406,495,144,689000,Adult Bart,Bart's Treehouse,Maybe it's the court-mandated sincerity chip I've got in my brain. But Lis... you're the person I always wanted to be.
148407,495,146,713000,Adult Bart,Bart's Treehouse,I gotta reconnect with those boys.
128568,495,147,715000,Adult Lisa,Bart's Treehouse,"Godspeed, Bart. I'm gonna go apologize to Mom!"
128569,495,148,721000,Adult Lisa,Bart's Treehouse,How do I get down?
128551,495,149,723000,Tree,Bart's Treehouse,Our consciousness was a secret for thousands of years. Then one pine tree had to open his sappy mouth.

128558,495,160,757000,Aged Krusty,Bart's Old Bedroom,I've never let go of my fax machine. Don't ask me why. I like the sound of a fax coming through. Especially if it's a nice deli menu. I miss eating.
128560,495,162,773000,Nurse,Springfield General Hospital,"I'm sorry, but there's no room at the in... patient facility."
128561,495,163,777000,Adult Kearney,Springfield General Hospital,"Lady, this is Maggie Simpson! She just played a sold-out show in Beijing!"
128562,495,164,781000,Nurse,Springfield General Hospital,"Hm, a star in the east... let me see."

128584,495,184,853000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,APU AND MANJULA'S HOUSE,Careful how you shut the door. It upsets the children.

148416,495,217,996000,Adult Bart,Moe's Tavern,"Wow, this place hasn't changed a bit."

128605,495,223,1011000,Carl,Moe's Tavern,Don't you remember? You came to the brain-switching ceremony.
148420,495,224,1013000,Adult Bart,Moe's Tavern,Right. What was the point again?
128606,495,225,1016000,Carl,Moe's Tavern,"Because I wanted to get back together with my wife, who was sleeping with Carl at the time."
128607,495,226,1020000,Lenny,Moe's Tavern,Turns out she had switched brains with a monkey on a Japanese game show. And it just got weirder from there.
128608,495,227,1026000,Carl,Moe's Tavern,"I found it quite normal. Anyway, if you're looking for your Dad. He took the kids to see his Dad."

128610,495,229,1032000,Lenny,Moe's Tavern,"Hey Moe, get me another beer!"
128611,495,230,1033000,Carl,Moe's Tavern,Quit makin' me fat!
128613,495,232,1036000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"I'm glad you're here, Marge. They're two minutes apart."
128614,495,233,1040000,Marge Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,The contractions?
128615,495,234,1041000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"No, my bills."
128618,495,238,1058000,Zia,THE ULTRANET,Mom? Why are you here?
128624,495,239,1064000,Adult Lisa,THE ULTRANET,I was worried! I thought I would find...
128594,495,240,1066000,Zia,THE ULTRANET,What? Me flashing my boobs on unripe melons dot com?
128650,495,241,1068000,Adult Lisa,THE ULTRANET,What? No! It doesn't matter what I thought. I'm sorry I spied on you. But what I found is my daughter looks up to me!

128626,495,243,1079000,Adult Milhouse,THE ULTRANET,Could somebody Fed-Ex me a prayer mat? And quick!
128627,495,244,1084000,Zia,THE ULTRANET,But I especially look up to you.
128629,495,246,1091000,Homer Simpson,CEMETERY,This is where my father is.
128631,495,248,1097000,Homer Simpson,Cryogenic Facility,"He froze himself because he was sick, and there was no cure."
128632,495,249,1101000,Jiff,Cryogenic Facility,Are they working on one?
128633,495,250,1102000,Homer Simpson,Cryogenic Facility,"Oh, they found it. But don't tell him. This is way cheaper than a nursing home."
128635,495,252,1107000,Homer Simpson,Cryogenic Facility,"Dad, these are your great-grandsons."
128636,495,253,1111000,Grampa Simpson,Cryogenic Facility,"Ah, I don't see what's great about 'em! And Homer, you're still a big disappointment. Because..."
128637,495,254,1117000,Homer Simpson,Cryogenic Facility,See you next Christmas!
128639,495,256,1121000,Skippy,Cryogenic Facility,"Why did you bring us here, Homer?"
128640,495,257,1123000,Homer Simpson,Cryogenic Facility,"To prove a point. Everyone thinks their Dad's a jerk and everyone's right. But when you get older, you realize how much you love 'em."
128641,495,258,1132000,Homer Simpson,Cryogenic Facility,"Your Dad may be a little immature, but I know he loves you, so you ought to give him a chance."
148421,495,259,1138000,Adult Bart,Cryogenic Facility,"Boys, I have acted like a ten-year-old for the last thirty years, and I swear to you: I will grow up and act like a twenty-year-old, the way a divorced forty-year-old should."
128642,495,260,1149000,Jiff,Cryogenic Facility,You're gonna have to do better than that.
148422,495,261,1154000,Adult Bart,Cryogenic Facility,"Boys, I'm a deadbeat Dad, I live in a school, it's Christmas... the only thing worth anything in my life is you."
128643,495,262,1165000,Skippy,Cryogenic Facility,Oh Dad!
128644,495,263,1167000,Jiff,Cryogenic Facility,"You've taught us the meaning of Christmas, which schools are forbidden to tell us any more."
128645,495,264,1174000,Homer Simpson,Cryogenic Facility,Is it snowing down here?
128646,495,265,1177000,Attendant,Cryogenic Facility,"No, one of the freezers is busted."
128647,495,266,1179000,Homer Simpson,Cryogenic Facility,"If those kids can forgive that train wreck of a father, then maybe I can forgive..."
128648,495,267,1185000,Grampa Simpson,Cryogenic Facility,"You quit drinkin', like a coward! The one thing you were good at!"
128651,495,269,1189000,Grampa Simpson,Cryogenic Facility,Lawn chair-breakin'-- Hair-losin'-- Marge-lovin' barometer-dropping-- Father-freezin'-- But you'd always come and get me when I wandered out on the freeway -- 'cause deep down you couldn't bear to see me smooshed.
128652,495,270,1212000,Homer Simpson,Cryogenic Facility,"I love you, Dad."
128654,495,272,1217000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Everyone, it's a girl!"
128655,495,273,1222000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, who's the father?"
128656,495,274,1225000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Eh, it doesn't matter. If there's one day a year to give unwed mothers a break, it's Christmas."
128657,495,275,1232000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, everyone. Smile while the pets take our picture."
148423,495,276,1236000,Adult Bart,Simpson Home,"Hmm, funny how they evolved and we didn't."
