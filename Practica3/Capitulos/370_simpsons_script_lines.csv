95943,370,1,33000,Bart Simpson,Riverbank Park,Why does God always need money?
95944,370,2,35000,Homer Simpson,Riverbank Park,It's a lot of little stuff. God has to pay all the elves in his workshop... plus he's got all those planets to support -- you see that ring he gave Saturn?
95945,370,3,49000,Lenny Leonard,Riverbank Park,Who knew saints had such fat heads?
95946,370,4,51000,Carl Carlson,Riverbank Park,"Eh, it's all a big scam."
95947,370,5,53000,Lenny Leonard,Riverbank Park,This booth?
95948,370,6,54000,Carl Carlson,Riverbank Park,"No, religion in general."
95950,370,8,68000,C. Montgomery Burns,Riverbank Park,Not bad.
95951,370,9,69000,Waylon Smithers,Riverbank Park,"Here's your candy apple, sir."
95952,370,10,72000,C. Montgomery Burns,Riverbank Park,Excellent.
95956,370,12,74000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,RIVERSIDE PARK,This fundraiser is close to achieving the Lord's goal -- building a taller steeple than the one on that snooty Episcopal church across the street.
95957,370,13,84000,Marge Simpson,RIVERSIDE PARK,"Reverend, why do we really need this?"
95958,370,14,87000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,RIVERSIDE PARK,To compensate for my own sense of smallness! And now for our main event -- the rubber duck race. The first duck to cross the finish line wins this home computer.

95962,370,18,114000,Homer Simpson,RIVERSIDE PARK,"Don't worry, Marge. Me and ""Terrible Two"" here are gonna win that computer for you."
95963,370,19,118000,Marge Simpson,RIVERSIDE PARK,How can you be sure?
95964,370,20,120000,Homer Simpson,RIVERSIDE PARK,'Cause he wants it.
95966,370,22,123000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,"On your marks, get set Wait, someone's not on their mark. That's better... Go!"

95970,370,26,155000,Homer Simpson,River,"He's headed for the old mill. No, Cheatie, no!"
95972,370,28,164000,Homer Simpson,River,So many paddles.
95974,370,30,183000,Homer Simpson,OLD WOODEN MILL,Protect the duck! Protect the duck! Produck the tect!
95977,370,33,205000,Homer Simpson,River,"Hey, this race is for rubber ducks, not meat ducks!"

95985,370,41,243000,Marge Simpson,River,"There, there... the fact that you tried means everything."
95986,370,42,246000,Homer Simpson,River,Hey... that's the same thing you said to Bart after he choked in that soccer game. And we both know he sucked.
95954,370,43,254000,Marge Simpson,River,And how. But this is different.
95987,370,45,261000,Ned Flanders,Parking Lot,"Hey Marge, I don't I don't really want a computer. You know all those complete strangers Googling each other. Makes my flesh crawl."
95988,370,46,269000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,Just put it in the trunk and leave.
95989,370,47,275000,Marge Simpson,Parking Lot,"Ned, that's so generous. But there must be something I could do in return."
95990,370,48,279000,Ned Flanders,Parking Lot,"Well sir, we could do a little Quid Pro for the Kay-Pro. The left-handed convention is in town, and as the owner of Springfield's largest southpaw shop, I just gotta be there. Could you uh, nanny-goat my kid-diddly-ids?"
95991,370,49,292000,Marge Simpson,Parking Lot,"...Uh, hmm, let's see, uh just a second uhh... Oh, yeah sure, I'd be happy to baby-sit for Rod and Todd."
95992,370,50,300000,Ned Flanders,Parking Lot,Woo hoo!
95994,370,52,304000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"I'm so glad you're watchin' the boys, Marge. Our last babysitter let 'em watch ""Comedy Central"", now Rod makes me check the closet every night for Rita Rudner."
95995,370,53,310000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,No Rudner.
95996,370,54,316000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Here are the numbers for the police, fire, ambulance, poison control, burn clinic, and people nearby with Rod and Todd's blood type."
95997,370,55,322000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Ooh, Carl."
95999,370,57,322000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"So, you're gonna be ""chillin'"" with me tonight. Do you want to play a game?"
96000,370,58,329000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,How about a sitting still contest?
96001,370,59,331000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,Hands folded!
96002,370,60,340000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Okay, game over -- it's a tie!"
96003,370,61,342000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,That means we both come in second!
96004,370,62,344000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,We're number two! We're number two!
96005,370,63,347000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"What do you think, Maggie?"
96007,370,65,357000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Convention Center,"Ooh, wow, it's the Big Unit himself, Randy Johnson! You've fanned more men than Salome!"
96008,370,66,364000,Randy Johnson,Springfield Convention Center,"Yeah, I get that a lot. I'm here promoting my new line of left-hand Teddy Bears: ""Randy Johnson's Southpawz."""
96009,370,67,370000,Randy Johnson,Springfield Convention Center,This one's a doctor. You can give it to your doctor. Huh? Huh?
96010,370,68,374000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Convention Center,Do you have one for a mailman?
96011,370,69,375000,Randy Johnson,Springfield Convention Center,A bear can't be a mailman! Now how many doctor bears you want? They come in boxes of a thousand.
96012,370,70,381000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Convention Center,"Um, one box?"
96013,370,71,384000,Randy Johnson,Springfield Convention Center,You and me got a problem.
96015,370,73,388000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,Here's my mask!
96016,370,74,391000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"I'm a ""Star Wars."" Now let's see who you've drawn!"
96017,370,75,397000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,I'm my brother Todd!
96018,370,76,399000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,I'm my brother Rod!
96019,370,77,400000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,This is too scary! Change back!
96020,370,78,405000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,I'll help you.
96021,370,79,409000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,I'm a chipmunk! I eat nuts without saying grace!
96022,370,80,413000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,I'm a permission slip!
96024,370,82,416000,Rod Flanders,Hallway,...and thank you God for letting Mrs. Simpson come over. It was the most fun we've had since Mommy was here.
96026,370,84,425000,Todd Flanders,Hallway,"And could you ask Mommy to come to Daddy in a dream, and tell him how to cut our sandwiches?"
96028,370,86,432000,Rod Flanders,Hallway,And please tell Mrs. Simpson it's rude to eavesdrop on our prayers.
96030,370,88,436000,Rod Flanders,Hallway,But we forgive her.
96033,370,91,440000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Hiya Marge. Rod and Todd in the land of nod?
96034,370,92,444000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,We had a lot of fun. They're terrific kids.
96035,370,93,447000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Hey, you're welcome to see the dynamic duo any time."
96036,370,94,450000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Hmm, well, then maybe I will come by more often. And Homer can spend more time with our kids... he's watching them now!"
96038,370,96,460000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ready?
96039,370,97,460000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ready!
96040,370,98,461000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And... joust!
96041,370,99,473000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That was awesome!
96042,370,100,476000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Let's do it again!
96043,370,101,477000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A canoe made of country ham? You know I'll eat it.
96046,370,104,488000,Marge Simpson,FLANDERS BACK YARD,What's wrong with your teeter-totter?
96047,370,105,490000,Rod Flanders,FLANDERS BACK YARD,Daddy says up and down see-saws are dangerous.
96048,370,106,493000,Marge Simpson,FLANDERS BACK YARD,Chocks?! Why don't we try it... freestyle.
96050,370,110,536000,Bumblebee Man,Flanders Home,¿Como pueden repetir otras provincias el exito que usted ha tenido en la corrupcion luchadora en Oaxaca?
96051,370,111,536000,Hispanic Man,Flanders Home,Todo empieza en la comunidad.
96052,370,112,536000,Bumblebee Man,Flanders Home,"¡Ay, el Mundo es loco!"
96053,370,113,541000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,I heard in study hall you were babysitting tonight.
96054,370,114,545000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,Homer! We're not in high school.
96055,370,115,548000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"So Marge, in tomorrow's game I'm gonna recover a fumble just for you."
96056,370,116,554000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,Maybe you'll run it in for a touchdown.
96057,370,117,559000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,Don't pressure me. I get enough of that from my Dad.
96058,370,118,562000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Well, maybe we can take your mind off things by studying for the S.A.T.: ""Snuggles And Tickles."""
96059,370,119,562000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,Old Man Flanders!
96060,370,120,583000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Hey Homer! Sneakin' kisses from the Missus?

96062,370,122,589000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"No one turn on the sprinklers, okay?"
96064,370,124,593000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, Mom's over at the Flanders', babysitting Nimrod and Nimtodd. We wanna do something."
96065,370,125,598000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. As soon as I finish watching my show.
96066,370,126,604000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I wanna go to the showbiz animal retirement home.
96067,370,127,607000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,They take in animals from the movies and TV that aren't cute anymore.
96069,370,129,620000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Old showbiz animals, eh? Do you think any of the gremlins from the ""Gremlins"" movie are there?"
96070,370,130,625000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... sure.
96071,370,131,628000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I am gonna get them so wet.
96073,370,133,635000,Lisa Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,This is much sadder than I expected.
96074,370,134,640000,Homer Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,Sad? You're crazy. I feel like I'm at the Oscars for the animals I forgot existed.
96075,370,135,649000,Duck,Animal Retirement Home,AFLAC!
96076,370,136,655000,Antonio Fargas,Animal Retirement Home,I'm not a real bear! That was just the name of my character. Now let me out!
96077,370,137,660000,Bart Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,"Hey, you know where the bathroom is?"
96078,370,138,662000,Antonio Fargas,Animal Retirement Home,Maybe I do and maybe I don't.
96080,370,139,666000,Antonio Fargas,Animal Retirement Home,"You didn't hear it from me, but it's next to the rhino cage. Word on the street is: cover the toilet seat with tissue. Sweet, sweet tissue."
96081,370,140,680000,Female Animal Caretaker,Animal Retirement Home,"This is Toot-Toot. She played ""Tum-Tum"" in ""Teen Tarzan's Eco-Adventures""."
96082,370,141,685000,Lisa Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,She looks like she's crying.
96083,370,142,689000,Female Animal Caretaker,Animal Retirement Home,"Oh, she probably misses her children. They're all in show business. One of them played the out-of-control judiciary in a Republican party commercial."
96084,370,143,697000,Bart Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,"Cheer up, Toot-Toot. Have some of my ice cream."
96085,370,144,714000,Homer Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,My son's been ape-napped!
96086,370,145,716000,Lisa Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,"No, no, it's still ""kid-napped."" The prefix applies to the victim."
96087,370,146,720000,Bart Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,Help! She's grooming me! She's grooming me!
96088,370,147,723000,Homer Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,Aren't you gonna do something?
96089,370,148,725000,Female Animal Caretaker,Animal Retirement Home,I'm afraid there's nothing we can do now. A chimp that size could tear your son's head right off.
96090,370,149,730000,Homer Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,But she'll leave the rest of him alone?
96091,370,150,732000,Female Animal Caretaker,Animal Retirement Home,"Uh, uh... would you like to meet Flipper?"
96092,370,151,734000,Female Animal Caretaker,Animal Retirement Home,May I remind you they're old when they come here.
96094,370,153,739000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Well, well. Look at my dull-eyed angels."
96095,370,154,742000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,What's this?
96096,370,155,748000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"It's the ripcord from a Band-Aid wrapper! Call me Ned Zeppelin, but is one of my boys abrased and contused?"
96097,370,156,755000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,"I cut myself on the knife, playing Christian Clue."
96098,370,157,759000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,The secular humanist did it in the schoolhouse with misinformation!
96099,370,158,763000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Well, I think it's about time you boys get to bed."
96100,370,159,766000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,"Yes, Daddy."
96101,370,160,768000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"And so we don't have another disaster, you crawl up those steps!"
96103,370,162,777000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Ned, I know you like to worry, but these boys are never going to get self-confidence unless you let them try things for themselves."
96104,370,163,784000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,I just can't. They're all I've got since that sad day when Maude found eternal happiness.
96105,370,164,789000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,I thought they might enjoy it if I took them here.
96106,370,165,792000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Everything's covered in foam. And it's owned by a corporation, so you know it's safe."
96107,370,166,798000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Well, their mascot is a kneepad wearing a helmet... why not?"
96109,370,168,802000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Where's Bart? I haven't seen him since you came home.
96110,370,169,804000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, you haven't seen Bart for a few hours, so you automatically assume I let something terrible happen."
96111,370,170,811000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't say that.
96112,370,171,813000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know what you think: when stupid Homer wasn't looking, Bart got kidnapped by a monkey."
96113,370,172,820000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I could never think something that horrible.
96114,370,173,822000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And now I'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing, so later I can say that I already told you."
96115,370,174,829000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Sorry I asked.
96116,370,175,831000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you can't keep this up for long."
96117,370,176,834000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, you're so right. I guess I should be more concerned with Bart's safety than covering my own butt. And maybe I'm talking like this because I can't stop. Help me, Lisa! I have serious mental problems!"
96119,370,178,852000,Bart Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,"Look, it's been fun and all, but I miss indoor plumbing."
96120,370,179,860000,Bart Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,"Sorry, lady. I've never eaten fresh fruit and I reckon I never will."
96122,370,181,869000,Bart Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,Whoa! This Oreo is rank.
96123,370,182,873000,Homer Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,Bart! Bart!
96124,370,183,877000,Homer Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,"When the monkey falls asleep, I'll sneak you out in this trash bag. Then I'll come back and feed the monkey a peach full of antifreeze."
96126,370,185,900000,Bart Simpson,CHIMP HABITAT,Whee. Whee.
96127,370,186,912000,Homer Simpson,CHIMP HABITAT,I fell asleep before the monkey.
96128,370,187,916000,Homer Simpson,CHIMP HABITAT,Uh-oh.
96130,370,189,924000,Marge Simpson,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,"Lookin' good, Rod!"
96131,370,190,936000,Marge Simpson,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,"Ned, are you checking up on me?"
96132,370,191,939000,Ned Flanders,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,"I'm not Ned, I'm a friendly dog. Oh, I'm not a good liar. I did come here to check on the... where's Rod?"
96133,370,192,948000,Todd Flanders,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,"He's up there, Daddy."
96134,370,193,950000,Rod Flanders,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,Daddy! Look how high I am!
96079,370,194,952000,Ned Flanders,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,What are you doing?! You're gonna get hurt!
95893,370,195,955000,Rod Flanders,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,I am?
96136,370,197,966000,Ned Flanders,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,He chipped a tooth! How will he bite Wheat Thins? How?
96137,370,198,970000,Marge Simpson,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,"I'm sorry, Ned. I never thought this would happen."
96138,370,199,974000,Ned Flanders,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,I don't want you watching my boys ever again!
96139,370,200,979000,Springfielders,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,"She must be an unfit mother, etc."
96140,370,201,981000,Marge Simpson,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,I am not an unfit mother!
96141,370,202,983000,Kent Brockman,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,We interrupt this skateboarding footage for a breaking story: local boy Bart Simpson is being held hostage by an angry chimpanzee who has improved both his hygiene and posture.
96142,370,203,994000,Kent Brockman,Ruffintumble's Fun Zone,His so-called real mother could not be found for comment.
96145,370,206,999000,Homer Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,"Hey Monkey, eat tranquilizer dart!"
96146,370,207,1008000,Kent Brockman,Animal Retirement Home,Mr. Simpson was later revived by a police stun gun.
96148,370,209,1022000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Backyard,"WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE GYM / I'LL MAKE IT SAFE AGAIN / WHEN PLAYTIME IS A SAFE TIME, EVERYBODY WINS..."
96149,370,210,1030000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Backyard,NOW I'LL LAY DOWN SOME ASTRO TURF / SO THEY DON'T SCRAPE THEIR N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-KNEES...
96151,370,212,1035000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Kitchen,"Daddy, what are we gonna do today?"
96152,370,213,1038000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Kitchen,"Well, we're gonna do what every kid your age likes to do: look at bread."
96153,370,214,1042000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Kitchen,No.
96154,370,215,1043000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Kitchen,The 'N' word!
96155,370,216,1045000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Kitchen,We want Mrs. Simpson back.
96156,370,217,1047000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Kitchen,She let us run barefoot in the grass and play Uno.
96157,370,218,1050000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Kitchen,"Uno?! That's a gateway game to pinochle. All diddily aside, boys, what is it about her you miss so much?"
96158,370,219,1056000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Kitchen,She made us feel happy.
96159,370,220,1058000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Kitchen,And not church happy... for real happy.
96161,370,222,1062000,Lisa Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,Maybe there's another way to solve this. Bart is clearly fulfilling an emotional need for Toot-Toot.
96162,370,223,1069000,Homer Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,"Lisa, monkeys don't have feelings. If they did, then my experiments could be called cruel."

96169,370,230,1120000,Homer Simpson,Animal Retirement Home,"Marge, Toot-Toot and her son escaped!"
96171,370,232,1124000,Kent Brockman,Animal Retirement Home,"The Hamburglar was survived by his long-time companion, Mayor McCheese."

96181,370,242,1166000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Nelson, Funny Town doesn't exist."
