109864,423,33,192000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, I gotta check with Lenny on that. Uh, is that all right, Lenny?"
109865,423,34,195000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Nope, Lucky Lenny's buying all the drinks tonight."
109866,423,35,198000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Sorry Homer, but here's a compromise: why don't you both pay for the drink?"
109867,423,36,203000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,And tip.
109868,423,37,205000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"I just wanna tell you all that even before I won this money, I was the luckiest guy in the world 'cause I got friends like you."

109875,423,44,232000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't waste your shot, Bart. You've got just enough cat pee to soak two dorks."
109876,423,45,240000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart Simpson! Did you just spray water on me?!
109877,423,46,244000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... it was water this morning.
109879,423,48,248000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Dang that Bart! Thanks to him, I have to wear my backup dress which makes my arms look fat."

109881,423,50,255000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Car,Haw haw! You feel self-conscious!
109882,423,51,260000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Why can't our son just behave?
109883,423,52,262000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Well Marge, you did have that one sip of alcohol while you were pregnant..."
109885,423,54,268000,Mayor Joe Quimby,SPRINGFIELD DOCKS,I now christen this ship the U.S.S. Float 'N' Shoot!
109886,423,55,285000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOCKS,That was unforgivable. But I'm beginning to think that Bart's bad behavior is more than just a phase.
109887,423,56,293000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOCKS,Mom! Bart's flicking boogers on me!
109888,423,57,295000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOCKS,They're not boogers! They're clumps of rubber cement. That I stored in my nose.
109889,423,58,304000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOCKS,"Stop it, both of you! Don't make me drive into that tree! You know I will!"

109895,423,64,330000,Announcer,REGENCY BALLROOM,"In the beginning, there was darkness... so God created man."
109896,423,65,334000,Announcer,REGENCY BALLROOM,But man was alone.

109906,423,75,384000,Lenny Leonard,REGENCY BALLROOM,It was worth it so everyone could have a wonderful evening and go home with a gift bag.
109907,423,76,392000,Bart Simpson,REGENCY BALLROOM,A vacuuming robot!
109909,423,78,399000,Lenny Leonard,REGENCY BALLROOM,"Now before you all leave, I know everyone hates vacuuming, and loves robots..."
109912,423,81,432000,Chief Wiggum,REGENCY BALLROOM,These innocent robots couldn't have done this on their own. Someone would've had to turn them all on at once... and then imbue them with some kind of malevolent sentience.
109913,423,82,444000,Chief Wiggum,REGENCY BALLROOM,Yep. There it is.
109914,423,83,445000,Lou,REGENCY BALLROOM,"Well, whoever did this must be long gone by now, Chief. I don't know how we'll ever catch him."

109920,423,89,470000,Marge Simpson,REGENCY BALLROOM,"Bart, I've had it with you! I'm taking away all your TV privileges."

109928,423,97,484000,Bart Simpson,Hotel Bathroom,I don't mean to be bad. I don't know why I do the things I do.
109929,423,98,495000,Bart Simpson,Hotel Bathroom,No one understands me. I wish I had a different family.
109930,423,99,498000,BART-LIKE VOICE,Hotel Bathroom,I feel exactly the same way.
109931,423,100,500000,Bart Simpson,Hotel Bathroom,Oh my God! You look like a dorky version of me!

109935,423,106,527000,Bart Simpson,Hotel Bathroom,"""Woosterfield""? Your family owns this place! And Woosterfield Arena! Bonnie Raitt played there! You guys must be loaded!"
109936,423,107,534000,Simon,Hotel Bathroom,Yes. But the funny thing about being rich is sometimes you wake up feeling--

109938,423,109,542000,Krusty the Clown,Hotel Bathroom,"Oh yeah, I'm livin' the dream."
109939,423,110,548000,Simon,Hotel Bathroom,Wouldn't it be hilarious if we switched places and lived each other's lives for a while?
109940,423,111,553000,Bart Simpson,Hotel Bathroom,"Hm, I don't know. I'm pretty attached to my family, and..."
109941,423,112,557000,Homer Simpson,Hotel Bathroom,"Get out here, boy! I wanna punish you before I get drunk and merciful!"

109976,423,148,685000,Bart Simpson,SIMON'S ROOM,Just sit tight -- I'm sending a car.
109978,423,150,693000,Simon,Simpson Home,Why are these noodles orange?
109979,423,151,696000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I made it with Cheetos, just like you like it. If the sauce is too thick, I can add more root beer."
109980,423,152,702000,Simon,Simpson Home,Maybe I'm just not hungry.
109981,423,153,703000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Human garbage can to the rescue!
109982,423,154,706000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So at work today, we got a memo saying everyone's getting new chairs."

109984,423,156,713000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Talk louder? You bet. Naturally, I threw my old chair in the dumpster right away. But then Lenny said ""No, that was the new chair. That memo was two months old!"" So now I'm sitting on an orange crate. I never felt so--"

109988,423,160,733000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's it, boy! You're going to bed without supper!"
109989,423,161,738000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That was an odd thing for Bart to say.
109990,423,162,741000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe he's going through... certain changes.
109991,423,163,745000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If that boy thinks I'm paying to put him through four years of puberty, forget it! Stupid kids... think I'm made of hormones..."

110002,423,173,791000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,Ow! The ol' hot spoon. But why?
110003,423,174,795000,Quenly,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,"Because you're our half brother, you're blocking our full inheritance and we hate you."
110004,423,175,800000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,"Oh, now I get it."
110005,423,176,804000,Milhouse Van Houten,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,"Bart, I have a crush on your new sister."
110006,423,177,807000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,You had a crush on my old sister.
110007,423,178,808000,Milhouse Van Houten,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,"Yeah, but that was never gonna happen."
110009,423,180,813000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Give me back my newspaper!
110010,423,181,816000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, it's not a real paper -- it's a rubber chew toy!"
110011,423,182,820000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"For your information, the ""Daily Growl"" is the only newspaper that's not afraid to say how great this country is!"
110012,423,183,828000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"How's the war going? We're winning, that's great! And our standing abroad? Fantastic!"
110013,423,184,839000,Simon,Simpson Home,"This place is insane! Tonight, I got sent to bed without dinner!"
110014,423,185,843000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah? Well what's up with your brother and sister?
110015,423,186,846000,Simon,Simpson Home,"They're jealous because my father, left their mother, to be with my mother, to--"
110016,423,187,851000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Eh, you lost me. Well, gotta go -- enjoy the upper-lower middle class!"
110017,423,188,857000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, honey, I saw you didn't like your dinner, so I thought you might like pepperoni pizza with the crust cut off."
110018,423,189,864000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now let me tuck you in, fluff your pillow and sprinkle a little fairy dust to keep the monsters away. It's cinnamon! Nightie-night, sweetheart."
110019,423,190,878000,Simon,Simpson Home,I could get used to this.
110022,423,192,881000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,Fancy party! This is like a rap video before the rappers show up.
110023,423,193,890000,Devon,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,Simon. Have you ever seen the family mausoleum?
110024,423,194,893000,Quenly,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,"All the Woosterfields will be buried here. Do you know that after a hundred years, dead bodies turn to red licorice?"
110025,423,195,899000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,Whoa! Let me at it!
110026,423,196,904000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,Help! Let me out! I have my doubts about this licorice!
110027,423,197,910000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,"Oh, Mr. Burns! I'm really sorry!"
110028,423,198,913000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,"Nonsense, young Woosterfield! Your fortune is greater than mine. It is-it is I who am at your service. Smithers! Fetch us some lemonade!"

110030,423,200,927000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,"Premix?! I beg your forgiveness, lad. Smithers! Pour it down your pants."
110031,423,201,932000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,"Now squish about in those pants, rewetting every hour!"
110032,423,202,940000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,Come with me.
110034,423,204,944000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,"You know, Master Simon, I too was once the youngest in a wealthy family."
110035,423,205,948000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,You were once the youngest of something?
110036,423,206,950000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,But fortune ended up smiling on me while snuffing the life from my siblings.
110037,423,207,955000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,"My older brother was trampled by a horse, my sister died of a poisoned potato, my twin was shot, that girl was stabbed, he ate another poisoned potato, spontaneous combustion, fell down a well, potato, potato, and impaled on the Chrysler Building."
110038,423,208,967000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,"Wow, only you survived which means the entire fortune went to you."
110039,423,209,972000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,Yes. Funny that.
110040,423,210,975000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,"A word of caution, young Woosterfield: watch out for those closest to you."
110041,423,211,980000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,Devon and Quenly?
110042,423,212,981000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,"You don't know when they'll strike -- a boating accident, a mishap during a ""ski trip."" But rest assured one way or another they will do you in."
110043,423,213,989000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,Oh my God. Simon set me up. And all this time I thought he wanted the life of a stranger he met in the bathroom.
110044,423,214,997000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,"Now, would you care to continue this conversation on the teeter-totter?"
110046,423,215,1002000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,Why won't you come down?!
110047,423,216,1004000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD ESTATE,"I told you, I only weigh as much as my clothes and keys!"
110049,423,218,1013000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So I looked down the barrel of my Winchester rifle, I pulled the trigger, and I shot that buffalo."
110050,423,219,1025000,Simon,Simpson Home,You shot a buffalo?
110051,423,220,1027000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,You were listening? That means I've gotta come up with an ending for this nonsense.
110052,423,221,1034000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, what are you doing?"
110053,423,222,1035000,Simon,Simpson Home,Politely listening to our grandfather.
110054,423,223,1038000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh.
110055,423,224,1039000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,It was the war to end all wars... but Pepsi would not give up. They continued to challenge Coke.
110056,423,225,1047000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, listen, you. I don't know who you are or what you've done with the real Bart. But... God help me, I want him back."
110057,423,226,1055000,Simon,Simpson Home,I don't know what you're talking about.
110058,423,227,1058000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The real Bart would've thrown me out the window.
110059,423,228,1061000,Simon,Simpson Home,He would've defenestrated you?
110060,423,229,1063000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You're just digging yourself even deeper.
110062,423,231,1068000,Bart Simpson,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,"Come on, Bart, you've gotta get outta here. Pack like you've never packed before. You know, I have never packed before."

110064,423,233,1077000,Quenly,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,"So, you're packing. You must've already heard."

110069,423,238,1085000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,You won't know how they'll strike -- a boating accident...
110071,423,240,1089000,C. Montgomery Burns,WOOSTERFIELD MANOR,"...a ""ski trip""."
110074,423,243,1091000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,SCRUBBING YOU / IS EASY 'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN PRE-RINSED / AND WHEN YOU'RE COVERED WITH GOO / THAT'S WHEN I'M SCRUBBING YOU! / SCRUB-BUB-BUB-BUB-BUB / SCRUB-BUB-BUB-BUB-BUB...
110075,423,244,1109000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, ""Bart"" has something to tell you."
110076,423,245,1112000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't like the look of those air quotes.
110078,423,246,1115000,Simon,Simpson Home,"So now Bart is on his way to Aspen, where they're going to try to kill him!"

110085,423,253,1140000,Bart Simpson,MOUNTAINSIDE,Uh... this trail is for experienced skiers.
110086,423,254,1145000,Quenly,MOUNTAINSIDE,Which is what you'll be if you make it to the bottom.
110087,423,255,1147000,Quenly,MOUNTAINSIDE,Which you won't.
110089,423,257,1151000,Quenly,MOUNTAINSIDE,Soon he'll be dead.
110090,423,258,1153000,Devon,MOUNTAINSIDE,And we'll split the inheritance.
