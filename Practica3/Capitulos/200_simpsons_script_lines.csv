46491,200,82,333000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Uh, it's like the measles. Good to get it out of the way."
46492,200,83,335000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Homer, this has gone far enough. Will you please just apologize to the garbage men?"
46493,200,84,341000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Yeah Dad, you're always telling me and Bart to apologize."
46494,200,85,345000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Yeah, but I'm always secretly disappointed when you do. Anyway, I think those garbage men are starting to crack."
46495,200,86,351000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,I think you're startin' to crack.
46496,200,87,352000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,Apologize for that remark.

46502,200,93,365000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is a very, very proud day for us, especially me. Your father, me, beat City Hall. It's just like David and Goliath, only this time David won."
148691,200,94,377000,Lisa's Thoughts,Simpson Home,"Oh, I know. I heard it too. Here's some music."
46503,200,95,379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And to think you wanted me to crawl, Marge! Well, this man doesn't crawl. He stands tall. That rhymes, Marge, and you know it rhymes. Admit it!"
46504,200,96,392000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Homer, you didn't beat City Hall! They picked up our trash because I wrote a letter of apology to the Sanitation Commissioner and signed your name. Period."
46505,200,97,401000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You signed my name? I feel so violated.
46506,200,98,406000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You've signed my name lots of times.
46507,200,99,408000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. And I'm going to get it back. Lisa, do I have my pants on?"
46508,200,100,418000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes.
46509,200,101,418000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Perfect.

46514,200,106,431000,Ray Magini,SANITATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,"I'm not tryin' to scare you. I'm just tryin' to get my work done, here."
46515,200,107,434000,Homer Simpson,SANITATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,"Oh, oh, oh, I get it. Put on a big show for the cameras."
46516,200,108,438000,Ray Magini,SANITATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,What cameras? Why are you still here?
46517,200,109,440000,Homer Simpson,SANITATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,"I came to fight City Hall. I wanna shake things up, Patterson. Stir up some controversy. Rattle a few cages."
46518,200,110,448000,Ray Magini,SANITATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,"Hey, stop that!"
46519,200,111,449000,Homer Simpson,SANITATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,"You'll never silence me! I'm the last angry man, Patterson! A crusader for the little guy!"
46520,200,112,455000,Ray Magini,SANITATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,Leave the bird alone!
46521,200,113,456000,Homer Simpson,SANITATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,Never!

46524,200,116,466000,Ray Magini,SANITATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,No! Nobody wants to hear the nonsensical ravings of a loud-mouthed malcontent!
46525,200,117,472000,Homer Simpson,SANITATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,"Well, we'll see about that."
46526,200,118,475000,Ray Magini,SANITATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,Hey!

46538,200,130,524000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hmf, I don't know Ray Patterson, but he's no Ray Patterson."
46539,200,131,529000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, Homer's a great Nuclear Safety Inspector, but I don't know if I'd trust him with my garbage."
46540,200,132,534000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yea, I know. It's a peace of mind issue you know?"

46571,200,163,690000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, gee, you're kinda all over the place there, Homer. You need to focus here. You gotta think hard and come up with a slogan that appeals to all the lazy slobs out there."
46572,200,164,701000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Can't someone else do it?
46573,200,165,703000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"""Can't someone else do it?"" That's perfect!"

46584,200,176,729000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Uh, okay, it's excellent. But aren't you tired of waking up early and dragging the garbage to the curb?"

46593,200,185,760000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Well, Ray Patterson thinks you should do it! Animals are crapping in our houses, and we're picking it up. Did we lose a war? That's not America. That's not even Mexico."

46601,200,193,804000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Well, then you shoulda been early."
46602,200,194,807000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Hall,"Ha. He - he gotcha there, Ray."
46605,200,195,809000,Ray Magini,Springfield Town Hall,"Oh, c'mon, people. This man has promised round the clock trash pick-up. That's impossible!"
46606,200,196,815000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Not if we hire more men. And my men will do all your messy jobs. They'll wash your car, scrub your shower, air out your stinkables..."

46610,200,200,835000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Do we want old man Patterson here with his finger on the button?
46611,200,201,840000,Ray Magini,Springfield Town Hall,What button? What the hell are you talkin' about?!
46612,200,202,843000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,What-what-what. What button? Where am I? Who took my false teeth?
46613,200,203,849000,Ray Magini,Springfield Town Hall,"All right, fine. If you want an experienced public servant, vote for me. But if you wanna believe a bunch of crazy promises about garbage men cleaning your gutters and waxing your car -- then by all means, vote for this sleazy lunatic."
