118247,457,1,35000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Thank you all for coming.
118248,457,2,36000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Now let's start with the words everyone loves to hear: ""Welcome to Bible study!"""
118249,457,3,36000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Today, my readin' ribbon's smack dab in the middle of Matthew twenty-three."
118250,457,4,45000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Now let us ""download"" the holy ""tweet"" of the Lord."
118251,457,5,48000,Agnes Skinner,Flanders Home,Stop making this relatable!
118252,457,6,50000,Jimbo Jones,Flanders Home,"Hey, as a youth, if I don't hear a computer word every couple sentences, I am outta here."
118253,457,7,56000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Duly noted. But we will make sure not to dilute the sacred gospel.
118254,457,8,61000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Mouse pad! Double click! Skyyype! Uh, Skyyype! Matthew twenty-three: ""Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, saying--"""
118255,457,9,66000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Hey, my bathing suit came off!"
118257,457,11,79000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Hey, it floats!"
118258,457,12,81000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,I'll handle this.
118260,457,14,86000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Schnell! Schnell!
118262,457,16,93000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Homer Simpson! You are the most infuriating, Netflix-D.V.D.-burgling, barbecue-not-putting-out..."
118264,457,18,102000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,...man I ever met!
118265,457,19,103000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hold that thought.
118269,457,23,107000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,That man is beyond redemption!
118270,457,24,110000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Flanders Home,That might seem to be true...
118271,457,25,112000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"I sense a ""but"" coming, Reverend..."
118272,457,26,113000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,Here comes the butt!
118273,457,27,116000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Flanders Home,"But I think you're up to the challenge, Ned."
118274,457,28,120000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh Reverend, I've been workin' my bible to the bone tryin' to save that man."
118241,457,29,124000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Flanders Home,"You know, Ned, God has never given up on anyone."
118211,457,30,126000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,What about Sodom and Gomorrah?
118275,457,31,128000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Flanders Home,"He lovingly destroyed them. Instead of pushing Homer away, can't you find a way to reach out and bring him in?"
118278,457,34,154000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Backyard,Homer? Homer?
118279,457,35,158000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Backyard,"Y'know, our bible study group is going to the Holy Land next month. I'd like you and your family to come as my guests."
118280,457,36,165000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Hmm, let me think... take my family to a war zone... on a bus filled with religious lame-os... in a country with no pork... in a desert with no casinos... ooh, where do I sign up?"
118281,457,37,183000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Homer, I can hear your sarcasm from inside the house -- and the dishwasher's on! What's going on here?"
118282,457,38,189000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Mr. Flanders invited us to Israel. I think he wants to get Dad into Heaven.
118283,457,39,193000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Great -- more hell for me!
118285,457,41,193000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Ned Flanders, you would take our family to the Holy Land just to try to make my husband a better man?"
118286,457,42,203000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Backyard,"Yep. I also want to try something called ""pita bread."""
118287,457,43,203000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Well, we will take you up on your offer."
118289,457,45,209000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,But we insist on paying our own way.
118291,457,47,213000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"And Homer, put on some pants."
118293,457,49,217000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,The man hates pants.
118295,457,51,231000,Airport Workers,Jerusalem,L'chaim!
118297,457,53,233000,Marge Simpson,Airport,"Homie, just tell them what they wanna hear!"
118298,457,54,236000,Homer Simpson,Airport,I can't! Latkes aren't as good as American pancakes.
118299,457,55,240000,Homer Simpson,Airport,They're okay with applesauce.
118300,457,56,242000,Israeli Airline Guard,Airport,True enough.
118301,457,57,247000,Homer Simpson,Airport,A truckload of applesauce!
118303,457,59,255000,Lisa Simpson,Ben Gurion Airport,"Krusty, I've been meaning to ask, what are you doing on this tour?"
118304,457,60,259000,Krusty the Clown,Ben Gurion Airport,I believe that every Jew should make a pilgrimage to Israel before he dies.
118305,457,61,264000,Lisa Simpson,Ben Gurion Airport,"Yes, it is fitting."
118307,457,62,266000,Krusty the Clown,Ben Gurion Airport,Don't wanna end up in Hell.
118308,457,63,268000,Lisa Simpson,Ben Gurion Airport,Jews don't believe in Hell.
118309,457,64,269000,Krusty the Clown,Ben Gurion Airport,"No Hell? Thank you, kid, you made my day!"
118311,457,66,285000,Manager,Jerusalem,You're being paid to clean the gutters!
118313,457,68,291000,Marge Simpson,Hotel Lobby,"This country's so historic -- for all we know, Jesus could have given a talk in Conference Room C."
118314,457,69,299000,Jakob,Hotel Lobby,"Welcome, welcome!"
118315,457,70,301000,Jakob,Hotel Lobby,"My name is Jacob. You may notice I speak the English with a slight accent. This is because as you have probably guessed, I used to live in London, and that is why I sound like Hugh Grant."
118316,457,71,314000,Jakob,Hotel Lobby,"Come on, let's go. We've got a lot of holy sites to see, yallah! We finish early, we go to jewelry store owned by my cousins."
118318,457,73,322000,Jakob,Hotel Lobby,"No joke, is true, great prices, you got to haggle otherwise they don't respect you! Come on, let's go!"
118319,457,74,328000,Marge Simpson,Hotel Lobby,Do you have any safety tips?
118320,457,75,329000,Jakob,Hotel Lobby,"What are you talking about? Israel is the safest country in the world. The only danger here is dehydration. Drink water. Don't die, looks bad on me. Come on, shut your face. Let's go."
118321,457,76,339000,Marge Simpson,Hotel Lobby,But it says here in the brochure...
118322,457,77,341000,Jakob,Hotel Lobby,"Brochure? Brochure? Brochure? Who wrote your brochure? The same schmuck who wrote The New Testament? I can't talk to you. You talk to my niece, Doreet."
118323,457,78,350000,Jakob,Hotel Lobby,"Doreet, talk to the stupids."
118324,457,79,352000,DOREET,Hotel Lobby,"Shalom, goyem!"
118325,457,80,353000,Marge Simpson,Hotel Lobby,"Shalom to you! Shalom is the ""aloha"" of this place."
118326,457,81,358000,Jakob,Hotel Lobby,"Okay, okay, lady. You done talking now. Who is licensed tour guide here, you or me? Now, everybody, we have no time to see Masada. Everybody died there for nothing. Okay, first stop: Old City. Come on, let's go, please shut your face!"
118327,457,82,371000,Ned Flanders,Hotel Lobby,The Old City. Where B.C. turned into A.D.! Let's go!
118328,457,83,375000,Homer Simpson,Hotel Lobby,"Flanders, that stuff's been here for thousands of years. But the breakfast buffet at this hotel, which is included in our package, closes in ten minutes!"
118329,457,84,384000,Ned Flanders,Hotel Lobby,"Homer, that's not why we're here. We can see the stations of the cross!"
118330,457,85,388000,Homer Simpson,Hotel Lobby,After we see the stations of the omelet bar.
118331,457,86,392000,Ned Flanders,Hotel Lobby,"Okay, let's just put it to a vote."
118333,457,88,397000,Ned Flanders,Hotel,"I can't believe we lost, Reverend."
118334,457,89,398000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Hotel,Mm-hmmm.
118335,457,90,400000,Helen Lovejoy,Hotel,These blueberry muffins are bigger than the ones we had at Pechanga!
118336,457,91,403000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Hotel,"Finally, something you like better than Pechanga."
118339,457,94,410000,Jakob,First Church of Springfield,"Okay, everybody. Please shut your face. Here we go. This sacred spot on Mount Zion is King David's tomb. Also, where your Jesus, who was a native born Israeli, by the way, sandals, circumcised, perfect English accent, the whole deal... this is where he had his last supper before they took him away and hammered him up on that cross ha-ha-ha. Hey, you, you're not part of the group. No listening!"
118340,457,95,433000,Israeli Bystander,First Church of Springfield,What? Is Israel. Is free country!
118342,457,97,453000,Jakob,First Church of Springfield,"Okay, that's it. Because of him, no Armenian quarter. Forget it, it's gone. All thanks to Mister Listen-For-Free."
118343,457,98,461000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Lord, please help Homer experience the redemptive power of this sacred land."
118344,457,99,467000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,He's going for the record! He's going for the record!
118345,457,100,473000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Flanders, you're not supposed to help him."
118346,457,101,475000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Yeah, thanks a lot, Flanders."
118347,457,102,479000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Homer, do you think you could show just the slightest bit of reverence?"
118348,457,103,484000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Ned, I'm an American tourist. I'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my Carolina Panthers credit card."
118349,457,104,493000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Pan-thers!
118350,457,105,494000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Homer, could you at least turn the camera off?"
118351,457,106,497000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,If you say it like Dracula I will.
118352,457,107,500000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,Homer...
118353,457,108,500000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Please, please, please..."
118354,457,109,503000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,Bleh.
118355,457,110,506000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,That is going right on stupidflanders.org.
118356,457,111,508000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Y'know, Homer, you might really benefit from opening your heart to the spirituality of this place. Please, neighbor?"
118358,457,112,516000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"This really means a lot to you, huh?"
118359,457,113,518000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Yes, but it means more to you."
118360,457,114,520000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Boy, are you lousy at reading minds."
118361,457,115,523000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Okay, okay. For you, I'll try."
118362,457,116,532000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Lord, I think I may have finally reached him..."
118363,457,117,532000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!
118364,457,118,535000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Homer, quit playing that back."
118365,457,119,537000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"I'm not, it's my ringtone."
118366,457,120,539000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Y'ello. This is he. Yeah I wanted to know: do you deliver falafels to the top of Mount Zion? Great. I'd like a large falafel with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese. Yes, I know what a falafel is."
118369,457,123,557000,Jakob,Near the Western Wall,"This is-- everybody, look at my face. This is the Western, or as you say, Wailing Wall. It is believed that the Lord will grant the prayers that are stuck into the cracks. Please, no graffiti, no making the pishen, yallah."
118370,457,124,569000,Krusty the Clown,Near the Western Wall,"""Dear Lord: please fix the following parking tickets: A647253, SP90325, Shelbyville 932871..."

118372,457,126,586000,Bart Simpson,Near the Western Wall,Sad.
118373,457,127,588000,Bart Simpson,Near the Western Wall,Never gonna happen.
118374,457,128,589000,Bart Simpson,Near the Western Wall,"Sad. Maybe, if you were Brad Pitt."
118375,457,129,593000,Homer Simpson,Near the Western Wall,"Hey boy, we're supposed to be acting religiousy. What are you up to?"
118376,457,130,596000,Bart Simpson,Near the Western Wall,"Reading prayers and ignoring them, just like God."
118377,457,131,599000,Bart Simpson,Near the Western Wall,"Hey, this one's from you."
118378,457,132,601000,Bart Simpson,Near the Western Wall,"""Dear Lord, don't let Marge find out the hotel leaves chocolates on the pillows at night."""
118379,457,133,601000,Homer Simpson,Near the Western Wall,Why you little...
118380,457,134,610000,Homer Simpson,Near the Western Wall,Give my Dad another heart attack?!
118382,457,136,610000,Jakob,Western Wall,"Smite him! Like the firstborn of Egypt. Dead baby, dead baby, Passover, dead baby, dead baby..."
118384,457,138,652000,Bart Simpson,Jerusalem,"Hey, why am I running from a girl?"
118385,457,139,654000,Bart Simpson,Jerusalem,Call me when you're old enough for your bat mitzvah. I'll bring you an envelope full of nothin'.
118386,457,140,659000,Bart Simpson,Jerusalem,Ka-ra-té!
118387,457,141,661000,DOREET,Jerusalem,Krav maga!

118389,457,144,673000,Bart Simpson,Jerusalem,You don't fight like a girl! Or even a Milhouse!
118390,457,145,676000,DOREET,Jerusalem,"I don't know what is Milhouse. I work security for the tour. Dealing with American punks like you counts as my military service, and we know all about you."
118391,457,146,687000,Bart Simpson,Jerusalem,"Ay carumba. Hey, is that the Ark of the Covenant?"
118392,457,147,693000,Bart Simpson,Jerusalem,Ka-ra-té!

118397,457,152,708000,Jakob,Church of the Holy Sepulchre,"Come on, come on. Everybody finish lemon ice. Not allowed inside."
118398,457,153,714000,Jakob,Church of the Holy Sepulchre,"Before us stands the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, believed to be the home of the tomb of your Lord. Or as he's known here, the man in the underpants. Beautiful tachtoonim . Oh, and what abs. He was a real good-looking one. Nice hair. Conditioner? I think so."
118400,457,155,729000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"And Lord, thank you for letting me see this wonderful place where the end of the world will soon begin. And thank you, again, for the challenge of Homer Simpson... we've all got our crosses to bear. Me Homer, you the cross. And now, let me gaze with reverence upon the holy resting place of..."
118402,457,157,747000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Whuh?
118403,457,158,749000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Homer, this is the most sacred spot in Christendom, not your backyard hammock."
118404,457,159,754000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"I'm sorry. It's just that these tours are so exhausting. You're jetlagged, you're walking around all day... it's so hard to sleep knowing Marge and the kids are all stuck in one small room.... and it's so nice and cool in the tomb of the unknown savior..."
118405,457,160,766000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,Unknown? This is the tomb of the most famous man who ever lived!
118406,457,161,774000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Porky Pig?
118407,457,162,775000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Porky Pig's not a man, he's a pig! And he's not even a real pig!"
118409,457,164,779000,Homer Simpson,Church of the Holy Sepulchre,"But he is buried here, right?"
118410,457,165,782000,Ned Flanders,Church of the Holy Sepulchre,That's it. I'm losin' it. I'm losin' it!
118412,457,167,785000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,You come all the way to Jerusalem -- the happiest place on earth -- and all the photos in your camera are of funny soda pops?!
118413,457,168,797000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Chickpea Fizz.
118414,457,169,799000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,Delete! Delete! Delete!
118415,457,170,801000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Whatever. It's your camera.
118418,457,173,811000,Ned Flanders,Church of the Holy Sepulchre,"Please, you've gotta let me back in. I sold six thousand rolls of wrapping paper to get here!"
118419,457,174,815000,Chief Security Officer,Church of the Holy Sepulchre,"That's your problem! You, my friend, are banned from ever entering this church again."
118420,457,175,821000,Ned Flanders,Church of the Holy Sepulchre,Banned for life?
118421,457,176,823000,Ned Flanders,Church of the Holy Sepulchre,"Homer, do you know why I'm a Christian?"
118422,457,177,825000,Homer Simpson,Church of the Holy Sepulchre,Your parents made you?
118423,457,178,827000,Ned Flanders,Church of the Holy Sepulchre,"It's because I believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. At least I thought so till now. Homer Simpson, you are not worth saving."
118424,457,179,838000,Homer Simpson,Church of the Holy Sepulchre,What? But I thought we'd be neighbors in Heaven. Goofing on all the new dead people...
118425,457,180,841000,Ned Flanders,Church of the Holy Sepulchre,Not. Worth. Saving.
118427,457,182,846000,Homer Simpson,STREETS OF OLD JERUSALEM,"Ned! Ned, wait up!"
118428,457,183,851000,Homer Simpson,STREETS OF OLD JERUSALEM,Ned!

118436,457,191,894000,Robot #2,Theater,Not so fast -- we can't transform on the Sabbath!

118440,457,195,912000,Homer Simpson,Desert,Flanders! Stupid Flanders!
118441,457,196,922000,Homer Simpson,Desert,There's sand in my shoe!
118443,457,198,932000,Homer Simpson,Desert,Good luck surviving without me!
118445,457,199,935000,Homer Simpson,Desert,THIR-STY / I AM SO THIR-STY / AND HUNGRY AND HORNY / BUT MOSTLY JUST THIR-STY / I AM SO THIR-STY...

118462,457,216,1045000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Hotel Room,I already do that.
118463,457,217,1047000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Hotel Room,Uh... Messiah... do you mind if I have a word with your wife?
118464,457,218,1049000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Hotel Room,"As you wish, but look not upon her with lust. And do not send her friendly emails. That's how it begins."
118465,457,219,1060000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Hotel Room,"Homer is suffering from what's called ""Jerusalem Syndrome."""
118466,457,220,1060000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Hotel Room,"Ah yes, ""Jerusalem Syndrome."" The name given to religious delusions or psychoses that occur when people visit Jerusalem."
118467,457,221,1070000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Hotel Room,Have you ever noticed that Dad always gets the disease they write about in the in-flight magazine?
118468,457,222,1075000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Hotel Room,"Oh my God, Homer's gone!"
118469,457,223,1080000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Hotel Room,What's he gonna do now?
118470,457,224,1082000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Hotel Room,"Hmm... Dad said he was going to ""unite all faiths."" And only one site is sacred to Muslims, Christians and Jews -- The Dome of the Rock!"
118471,457,225,1091000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Hotel Room,"The Dome of the Rock? Messiah, away!"
118472,457,226,1096000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Hotel Room,"This one says ""Carolina Panthers!"""
118473,457,227,1099000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Hotel Room,Messiah says !
118474,457,229,1099000,Jakob,DOME OF THE ROCK,"Okay, okay, everybody come on. This shrine contains the rock on which Abraham was going to sacrifice his son. And Muslims believe something too. To find out, hire a Muslim tour guide. That's a barrel of laughs. Anyway, shut your face."
118475,457,230,1116000,Marge Simpson,DOME OF THE ROCK,"Thanks, but you can stop giving the tour now."
118476,457,231,1119000,Jakob,DOME OF THE ROCK,You don't want to do a photo with me? You can hold my gun.
118477,457,232,1122000,Jakob,DOME OF THE ROCK,I used it in Entebbe. I killed three Ugandans.
118478,457,233,1122000,Marge Simpson,DOME OF THE ROCK,No thanks.
118479,457,234,1126000,Jakob,DOME OF THE ROCK,"Before you go in, you fill out comment card."
118480,457,235,1129000,Marge Simpson,DOME OF THE ROCK,Okay.
118481,457,236,1133000,Jakob,DOME OF THE ROCK,"Eh, eh, don't forget the back."
118482,457,237,1135000,Marge Simpson,DOME OF THE ROCK,You people are so pushy.
118483,457,238,1136000,Jakob,DOME OF THE ROCK,"What? Israeli people are pushy? How about you experience a couple of genocides and see how laid-back you are? We were purged from Spain. Throw out of there. They allow everybody in Spain, but for us, Jews, no flamenco, get out."
118484,457,239,1150000,Jakob,DOME OF THE ROCK,"I'm pushy?! Please. You stay there surrounded by your great enemy, Canada. Try Syria for two months, then we'll see who's pushy."
118485,457,240,1161000,Homer Simpson,DOME OF THE ROCK,"Attention Christians, Muslims, and Jews. I have come to gather you into a new faith. From now on you shall be called Chrismujews."
118487,457,242,1173000,Homer Simpson,DOME OF THE ROCK,"Because when you get down to it, aren't all religions the same? They tell you what to eat, when to pray... how this imperfect clay that we call man can mold itself to resemble the divine. But we can never attain that ultimate grace while there is hatred in our hearts for each other."
118488,457,243,1191000,Ned Flanders,DOME OF THE ROCK,I did it! I reached him!
118489,457,244,1193000,Homer Simpson,DOME OF THE ROCK,Celebrate your commonality. Some of us don't eat pork. Some of us don't eat shellfish. But all of us love chicken!
118491,457,246,1204000,Muslim Man,DOME OF THE ROCK,You can simmer it in a tagine.
118492,457,247,1206000,Jewish Man,DOME OF THE ROCK,In a soup you can boil it!
118493,457,248,1207000,Homer Simpson,DOME OF THE ROCK,Spread the word! Peace and chicken!
118494,457,249,1211000,Crowd,DOME OF THE ROCK,Peace and chicken!
118495,457,250,1213000,Agnes Skinner,DOME OF THE ROCK,Don't listen to this fat idiot.
118496,457,251,1215000,Agnes Skinner,DOME OF THE ROCK,I am your messiah! Avert your eyes from my wrinkly arms!
118497,457,252,1220000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,DOME OF THE ROCK,Uh-oh. We've got another case of Jerusalem Syndrome.
118444,457,253,1223000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,DOME OF THE ROCK,This looks like a job for... the messiah!
118499,457,257,1232000,Bart Simpson,Airplane,I want the window seat.
118500,457,258,1233000,Lisa Simpson,Airplane,Krav maga!
118501,457,259,1235000,Bart Simpson,Airplane,You can't hurt what's already dead.
118502,457,260,1236000,Bart Simpson,Airplane,I guess you can.
118503,457,261,1238000,Ned Flanders,Airplane,"Homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, I think you came closest to the truth."
118504,457,262,1243000,Homer Simpson,Airplane,"Well, if I made any sense today, it's because all the stuff you've told me all these years has finally seeped in."
118505,457,263,1249000,Homer Simpson,Airplane,Can I buy you a twelve dollar turkey sandwich?
118506,457,264,1252000,Ned Flanders,Airplane,I'd like that.
118507,457,265,1253000,Homer Simpson,Airplane,How 'bout a Greg Norman Executive Putter from the Sky Mall?
118508,457,266,1253000,Ned Flanders,Airplane,You'd probably get a better deal at a mall back home.
118509,457,267,1259000,Homer Simpson,Airplane,They have malls on land?
118511,457,269,1265000,Jakob,Plane,"One at a time! Having your people being thrown out of Spain! Spain! No tapas! I love eating tapas! I love the tiny portions! You don't get too full, but you have a whole variety of flavors! Not for me! Every day who wants a pickle?! Occasionally once a week a little bit of falafel!"
