152549,13,79,338000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"See? You're a pig. Barney's a pig. Larry's a pig. We're all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off, and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards."
152550,13,80,359000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she's too smart to fall for that."
152551,13,81,363000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"I'm not done. After dinner, the two of you are going to check into the fanciest motel in town, and not check out until the next morning. If you get my drift."

152568,13,98,441000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Simpson Home,The pig has made you into his mother... made you into his mother... into his mother...
152569,13,99,444000,Dr. Marvin Monroe,Simpson Home,You are not the hot love object you deserve you deserve to be... you deserve to be... you deserve to be...

152587,13,117,530000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, oh, Homer. I feel giddy. Wait, what about a babysitter?"

152638,13,167,709000,Lucille Botzcowski,FOYER,I said we're gonna watch the tape.
152639,13,168,711000,Bart Simpson,FOYER,"Awww, that's merely suggested viewing matter, lady. Mom lets us watch whatever the hell we want."
152640,13,169,716000,Lucille Botzcowski,FOYER,"I said, you're gonna watch this tape. And you're gonna do what I say, or I'm gonna to do something to you. And I don't know what that is, because everybody has always done what I say."
152642,13,171,733000,Homer Simpson,Chez Pierre Restaurant,They all look so tasty. But I think I'll eat this one right there.

152645,13,174,743000,Maitre D',Chez Pierre Restaurant,"Well, when you choose one that's floating upside down, it somewhat defeats the purpose of selecting a live lobster."
152646,13,175,749000,Homer Simpson,Chez Pierre Restaurant,"Oh, okay. Then I'll take that one there with the beady eyes."
152647,13,176,754000,Maitre D',Chez Pierre Restaurant,"Excellent choice, sir. May I lead you to your table?"

152657,13,184,775000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know what happens. They find Captain Kook's treasure, all the elves dance around like little green idiots, I puke, the end."
152658,13,185,782000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, you're just like Chilly, the elf who cannot love."

152667,13,194,812000,Marge Simpson,Restaurant,No. Because you're wearing a bib.

152669,13,196,821000,Homer Simpson,Restaurant,Ooops. Time for a fill-up. Garçon! Another bottle of your second-least-expensive champagne.

152673,13,200,856000,Homer Simpson,Restaurant,"You know, Marge, this is just like when we were dating."
152674,13,201,860000,Marge Simpson,Restaurant,Except for one thing... no chaperone.

152693,13,222,973000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Go ahead. Take 'em all.
152694,13,223,977000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The thing is no one was hurt. I think it would be really silly to dwell on this.

152710,13,239,1017000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"We know who you are, Ms. Botz. Or should I say, Ms. Botzucowski. You're the Babysitter Bandit."
152711,13,240,1023000,Lucille Botzcowski,Simpson Home,"You're a smart young man, Bart. I hope you're smart enough to keep your mouth shut."

152720,13,248,1045000,Marge Simpson,Ye Olde Off-Ramp Inn,Maybe I'll go slip into something a little more comfortable.
152721,13,249,1050000,Homer Simpson,Ye Olde Off-Ramp Inn,"Ooh, your blue thing with the things?"
152722,13,250,1054000,Marge Simpson,Ye Olde Off-Ramp Inn,You'll see.
152723,13,251,1056000,Homer Simpson,Ye Olde Off-Ramp Inn,"Well, shake a leg, Mama."
152725,13,253,1070000,Lucille Botzcowski,Simpson Home,Kids stuff... Hardly worth it... Lotta junk... Soiled... Stupid Sampsons...

152738,13,266,1141000,Lucille Botzcowski,Simpson Home,Maggie... Maggie...
152740,13,268,1144000,Homer Simpson,Ye Olde Off-Ramp Inn Motel Room,Mmmm.
152741,13,269,1163000,Marge Simpson,Ye Olde Off-Ramp Inn Motel Room,"Homer, would it spoil the mood if I called home? You know, just to check on the kids?"
152744,13,272,1180000,Marge Simpson,Ye Olde Off-Ramp Inn Motel Room,"Homer, wake up. There's no answer at home."
152745,13,273,1183000,Homer Simpson,Ye Olde Off-Ramp Inn Motel Room,So?
152746,13,274,1184000,Marge Simpson,Ye Olde Off-Ramp Inn Motel Room,"So, I'm worried. I think we should go home."

152750,13,278,1194000,Lisa Simpson,PUBLIC PAY PHONE,We caught her! We caught the Babysitter Bandit! She's tied up at our house right now!

152752,13,280,1200000,Lisa Simpson,PUBLIC PAY PHONE,"Is there a reward? If she's convicted, we get T-shirts."

152757,13,285,1209000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ms. Botz? Ms. Botz?
152759,13,287,1212000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Good Lord! What have those little hellions done now?

152762,13,290,1222000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't tell you how chagrinned we are about all of this.
152763,13,291,1226000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, these things are heavy."
152764,13,292,1230000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just so there's no hard feelings, here's double your pay. No, no, triple."
152765,13,293,1234000,Lucille Botzcowski,Simpson Home,Thank you.

152767,13,295,1237000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sure.
152768,13,296,1239000,Lucille Botzcowski,Simpson Home,Don't turn your back on that boy for a second.
152769,13,297,1241000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ain't that the truth. You know, one time he --"
152770,13,298,1247000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"This way to the scene of the crime, men. I've got her tied up in the den."
152771,13,299,1253000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just a minute, young man. I don't know what kind of shenanigans you've been pulling this time, but I just had to untie your babysitter and pay her off so that --"
152772,13,300,1261000,Tv Reporter,Simpson Home,"Excuse me, sir, are you saying to the world that you just aided and abetted the escape of the notorious Babysitter Bandit?"
152773,13,301,1268000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The what?
152774,13,302,1269000,Tv Reporter,Simpson Home,The Babysitter Bandit.
152775,13,303,1271000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh... uh... no. Are you sure this microphone works? Uh, well, I wouldn't say I aided her. This is on, right? Because, actually, it was quite a struggle."
152776,13,304,1281000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Awww, Homer."
152777,13,305,1283000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Have you ever seen a Kung Fu movie? It was just like that. But now I know her moves. So, if you're listening to me, lady, you better think long and hard before trying something like this on Homer Simpson again."
152778,13,306,1294000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lord help me, I'm just not that bright."
152779,13,307,1298000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer, don't say that. The way I see it, if you raise three children who can knock out and hog-tie a perfect stranger, you must be doing something right."
152780,13,308,1310000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah. Yeah!
152781,13,309,1318000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, can we make up again?"
