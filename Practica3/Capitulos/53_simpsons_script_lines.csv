6464,53,133,567000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, I know you're down on homemaking, but it can really let you be creative. See, this morning I turned bacon, eggs and toast into a nice smiley face for Bart and Homer."
6465,53,134,577000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What's the point? They'll never notice.
6466,53,135,579000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh well, you'd be surprised."

6476,53,145,626000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, honey, right now you're discouraged. But deep down, you know you love the saxophone. I think you should stay in the band."
6477,53,146,633000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you think it's so great, why don't you join the band?"
6478,53,147,636000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, there are a lot of people in the world who like to tell you what you can't do. But they don't always know what they're talking about."

148220,53,153,656000,Young Marge,Bouvier House,Why not?
6482,53,154,657000,Young Patty,Bouvier House,They'd distract the men astronauts so they wouldn't keep their minds on the road.
148221,53,155,661000,Young Marge,Bouvier House,There will too be women astronauts!
148222,53,156,665000,Young Marge,Bouvier House,It's true! And we'll all live in cities on the moon.
6484,53,158,669000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So you see, my sisters were wrong. Except about the cities on the moon. I was wrong about that. So... well, you can see how anyone can be wrong."

6498,53,172,717000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, but if you really want to honk Skinner off, I suggest you attack the one thing he truly believes in."
6500,53,173,726000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I saw some awful things in 'Nam, but you really have to wonder at the mentality that would desecrate a helpless puma. I never thought I'd say this, but the no-goodniks rule this school!"
6501,53,174,738000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"God, I could really use a half-day."

6506,53,179,753000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, it's quite simple, really. I observed our friend Groundskeeper Willie burning leaves with a blatant disregard for our clean air laws."
6507,53,180,761000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Bart Simpson on the side of law and order? Has the world gone topsy-turvy?
6508,53,181,766000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"That's right, man. I got my first taste of authority... And I liked it."
6509,53,182,771000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Hm.
6510,53,183,773000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, there are a lot of troublemakers in this school... and Lord knows I can't be everywhere at once."

6512,53,185,780000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Look, let's can the euphemisms, huh? No more bullspit. How would you like to be a hall monitor?"
6513,53,186,785000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Wouldn't that mean squealing on other kids?
6514,53,187,787000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"That's the meat of it, yes."
6515,53,188,788000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Hmm.
6517,53,190,791000,Prosecutor,Courtroom,"Now, Witness X, will you please tell the court what you saw?"
6518,53,191,795000,Steve Allen,Courtroom,I'd be more than happy to. I saw Mr. Montone there seal the late Mr. Palacio in an oil drum and roll him off the pier.
6519,53,192,803000,Mr. Montone,Courtroom,I keel you!!
6520,53,193,804000,Steve Allen,Courtroom,Aye carumba!

6536,53,208,851000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We always have one good kid and one lousy kid. Why can't both our kids be good?
6537,53,209,857000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"We have three kids, Homer."
6538,53,210,860000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Maaarge... The dog doesn't count as a kid.

6544,53,216,875000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Good. Now, sprinkle your sparkles on your paste. Lisa, you're not sprinkling your sparkles."
6545,53,217,882000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Shove it.
6547,53,219,883000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I have never seen a good student take such a slide. Lisa, what are you rebelling against?"
6548,53,220,890000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Whattaya got?
6550,53,222,897000,Donna,Girls Bathroom,"And she goes, ""Lisa told Hoover to shove it"" and I'm like, ""No way!"" And she's like, ""Fraid so,"" and I'm all, ""Whooah!"", and she's like..."
6551,53,223,903000,Tammy,Girls Bathroom,"Hey, Lisa, man. I'm like, so impressed. When I was in second grade, I was all ""Hi, there, I'm so good."" Want a smoke?"
6552,53,224,913000,Lisa Simpson,Girls Bathroom,"Uh, I'll smoke it in class."
6553,53,225,916000,Donna,Girls Bathroom,Whoa.
6555,53,227,918000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Bart, you're doing a bang-up job. You know, before there were some corridors of this school you'd just never go down. Now I feel safe anywhere."
6556,53,228,925000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Every day is a new fight, sir."
6558,53,229,927000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Bart, the school is a police state. Students are afraid to sneeze. And I have you to thank. Come with me."
6560,53,231,935000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Madre de Dios! The legends were true!
6561,53,232,940000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes Bart, whenever a teacher confiscates something it ends up here. Salacious halter-tops, complete collections of Mad, Cracked and the occasional issue of Crazy, and this fake plastic derriere."

6567,53,238,977000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Seymour, this is an absent slip signed by Nelson's mother. And this is Nelson's English homework. Notice the identical elongated loops on the d's."
6568,53,239,986000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Forgery. So he didn't have leprosy.
6570,53,241,994000,Former Teacher,Skinner's Office,This is a great day for me. I thought I could never teach again.
6571,53,242,997000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Oh, Things have changed. There will be no mockery of your name, Mr. Glasscock."

6582,53,253,1053000,Lisa Simpson,Miss Hoover's Classroom,Stupid Hoover... thinks she's so smart.
6583,53,254,1056000,Lisa Simpson,Miss Hoover's Classroom,She wouldn't be so smart without her Teacher's edition.
6587,53,257,1084000,Seymour Skinner,Teachers' Lounge,"Ladies and gentlemen, the unthinkable has happened. Some sick, twisted individual has stolen every teacher's edition in this school."
6588,53,258,1093000,Teacher #1,Teachers' Lounge,What'll we do?
6589,53,259,1094000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Teachers' Lounge,Declare a snowday!

6608,53,278,1151000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Seymour, I'll bet you a steak dinner those books are still here. All we have to do is search every locker."
6609,53,279,1157000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield,"Oh, Bart, I'm not sure random locker searches are permitted by the Supreme Court..."
6610,53,280,1160000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Pfft, Supreme Court. What have they done for us lately?"

6557,53,290,1217000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Come on, Bart. In your pre-Fascist days, you knew the giddy thrill of futile rebellion."
6620,53,291,1222000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Yeah, but even I had my limits. You're looking at expulsion for this."
6621,53,292,1228000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,I know. I know.

6627,53,298,1251000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"I've been so blind. In retrospect, the signs all pointed to a rogue hall monitor."
6628,53,299,1256000,Bart Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Sorry if I betrayed your trust, Principal Sucker."
6629,53,300,1259000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"D'oh. Now Bart, in light of your recent service to the school, I've decided to be lenient. Four hundred days detention."

6638,53,309,1281000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"'Cause I didn't want you to wreck your life. You got the brains and the talent to go as far as you want. And when you do, I'll be right there to borrow money."
