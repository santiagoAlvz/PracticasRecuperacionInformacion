8688,61,119,640000,Llewellyn Sinclair,Springfield Community Center,"All right, let ham-ateur night in Dixie commence."
8689,61,120,646000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Community Center,"I'm sorry, Llewellyn. I just... I just don't see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley's face. Couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle, good humor?"
8690,61,121,657000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Community Center,"Marge, your ride's here."
8691,61,122,659000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Community Center,"Homer, it'll just be a few minutes more!"
8692,61,123,662000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Community Center,You're a dame and I'm a fella.

8698,61,129,682000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Community Center,I just don't see what's so bad about Stanley.
8699,61,130,687000,Llewellyn Sinclair,Springfield Community Center,"Stanley is thoughtless, violent and loud."
8700,61,131,691000,Llewellyn Sinclair,Springfield Community Center,"Marge, every second you spend with this man, he is crushing your fragile spirit. You can't let that happen."
8701,61,132,700000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Community Center,"Woo-hoo! Come to papa! Marge, I'll be out in the car."
8702,61,133,705000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Community Center,All I want is one embrace.

8734,61,165,804000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sure you won't enjoy it. There's nothing about bowling in the play... Oh wait, there is."
8735,61,166,809000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Probably not much of it.
8736,61,167,811000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why can't you be a little more supportive?
8737,61,168,813000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Because I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this, and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects."
