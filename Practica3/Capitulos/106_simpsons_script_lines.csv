21207,106,1,39000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"This romance is so full of heartfelt passion. I can really identify with this corn-fed heroine. Homer. Are you awake? This is important, give me some sign you're awake."
21209,106,3,51000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Wake up!
21210,106,4,53000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh? Wuzz wrong? House run away? Dog's on fire?
21211,106,5,57000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, do you think that the romance has gone out of our lives?"
21213,106,7,62000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Wake up!
21214,106,8,63000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, it's three a.m. and I worked all day!"
21215,106,9,66000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's nine thirty p.m. and you spent your whole Saturday drinking beer in Maggie's kiddy pool.
21216,106,10,71000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"There you are. Thought you could get away, huh?"
21219,106,11,76000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, young people learn about love from adults, and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general. I want us to deal with the issues raised by this book."
21220,106,12,86000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmmm.
21221,106,13,90000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I knew I shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom.
21223,106,15,125000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?
21224,106,16,130000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's a new episode.
21225,106,17,131000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not exactly. They pieced it together from old shows, and it seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth."
21226,106,18,137000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Really?
21227,106,19,138000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ren and Stimpy do it all the time.
21228,106,20,140000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, they do, and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about Ren and Stimpy? Children, your father and I have fed you and clothed you, but we've neglected something more important. It's time to learn about love."
21229,106,21,153000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No need, Mom. We already learned in school."
147810,106,23,155000,TROY,CLASSROOM,"This is Fuzzy Bunny. About a year ago, he noticed his voice was changing."
147811,106,24,161000,TROY,CLASSROOM,He had terrible acne. And had fur where there was no fur before. He also noticed Fluffy Bunny.
21231,106,25,168000,Bart Simpson,CLASSROOM,Bo-ring.
147812,106,26,170000,TROY,CLASSROOM,"Fuzzy went to the park, the ice cream social, the boat show and various other wholesome activities. And they never ruined their fun by giving in to their throbbing biological urges. Then came the big day. Fluffy and Fuzzy got married. That night came the honeymoon."
21232,106,27,190000,Kids,CLASSROOM,Ew!
21233,106,28,192000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CLASSROOM,She's faking it.
21235,106,30,193000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I mean romance not love.
21236,106,31,196000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, romance is dead. It was acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney. Homogenized, then sold off piece by piece."
21237,106,32,204000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's not true. Romance is all around us. In our neighborhoods...
21238,106,33,207000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Even on our jobs...
21239,106,34,221000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,All you have to do is think about your most cherished memories.
21240,106,35,226000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmmm.
21241,106,36,228000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, is Al there?"
21242,106,37,229000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Al?
21243,106,38,230000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, Al. Last name Caholic."
21244,106,40,233000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Lemme check. Phone call for Al, Al Caholic. / Uh, Jacques Strap! / Is I Pee Freely here? / Hey, is there a Butts here? Seymour Butts? Uh, Homer Sexual / My Crotch / A Amanda Huggenkiss? / A Huge Ass / ""Ivanna Tinkle"" / I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt, and my butt smells, and I like to kiss my own butt."
21245,106,41,260000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"No, no, no. No, ask your heart what its fondest desire is."
21246,106,42,266000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Hm...
21247,106,43,268000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Mmmm, Chocolate... / Mmmm, invisible cola. / Mmmm, Forbidden donut. / Mmmm sacrilicious. Mmmm, / Mmmm, free goo. Mmmm, something."
21248,106,44,287000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"No, think about people. About moments in your life that have been very romantic."
21249,106,45,294000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, okay."
21250,106,46,298000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"That's not the idea at all. Okay, well this story isn't ideal, I've never told it to you before."
21251,106,47,309000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I got a very thoughtless birthday present from someone who shall remain nameless.
21252,106,48,316000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"So I actually went to the bowling alley to spite him, or her..."
21253,106,49,328000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Oh!
21254,106,50,331000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I'm awfully sorry.
21255,106,51,333000,Jacques,Moe's Tavern,Entirely my fault. It is nice to meet you... ... Homer.
21256,106,52,339000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, no, no. Homer is my... ball's name. I'm Marge."
21258,106,54,349000,Jacques,Moe's Tavern,"Your fingers are so slender, so feminine. They are far too tapered for the ball you are using. You need something lighter, more delicate. Here, use my ball."
21259,106,55,360000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"No... no, thank you, Mr... uh... ... Brunswick."
21260,106,56,363000,Jacques,Moe's Tavern,Call me Jacques.
21261,106,57,365000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Jacques.
21262,106,58,366000,Jacques,Moe's Tavern,Marge.
21263,106,59,367000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Hmmm.
21264,106,60,368000,Jacques,Moe's Tavern,May I ask you a bold question?
21265,106,61,371000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Sure.
21266,106,62,372000,Jacques,Moe's Tavern,You've never bowled before?
21267,106,63,373000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Never.
21268,106,64,375000,Jacques,Moe's Tavern,No?
21269,106,65,375000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,No.
21270,106,66,375000,Jacques,Moe's Tavern,Then I will teach you.
21271,106,67,376000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, I don't want to trouble you."
21272,106,68,378000,Jacques,Moe's Tavern,"Not at all. I am a professional. Roll the ball for me, Marge. Let me see your form."
21273,106,69,382000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,All right. But I'm not very good.
21217,106,70,388000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I can hit that one pin all right. But the rest of them don't even wobble.
21274,106,71,393000,Jacques,Moe's Tavern,"I can help you, Marge. Pick up the ball. Pick up Homer. Pick him up."
21275,106,72,396000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Oh!
21276,106,73,399000,Jacques,Moe's Tavern,"Now, throw!"
21277,106,74,400000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,But...
21278,106,75,401000,Jacques,Moe's Tavern,"Throw, damn you!"
21279,106,76,406000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,You're a very good teacher!
21281,106,78,410000,Jacques,Simpson Home,Here we are.
21282,106,79,412000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You didn't have to drop me off.
21283,106,80,414000,Jacques,Simpson Home,But I wanted to. Marge... Do you know how beautiful you look in the moonlight?
21284,106,81,419000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Jacques, I'm a married woman."
21285,106,82,422000,Jacques,Simpson Home,"I know, I know. My mind says stop, but my heart and my hips cry proceed."
21287,106,84,424000,Jacques,Simpson Home,"Marge, darling, I-I want to see you tomorrow. Meet me tomorrow for brunch."
21288,106,85,433000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's brunch?
21289,106,86,434000,Jacques,Simpson Home,"You'd love it. It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but it comes with a slice of cantaloupe at the end. You don't get completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal."
21290,106,87,445000,Jacques,Simpson Home,Here we are.
21291,106,88,445000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You didn't have to drop me off.
21292,106,89,445000,Jacques,Simpson Home,But I wanted to. Marge... Do you know how beautiful you look in the moonlight?
21294,106,91,445000,Marge Simpson,SHORTY'S,He seemed to know a lot about brunch. But it turned out he wasn't interested in brunch at all.
21296,106,93,451000,Jacques,SHORTY'S,"Your laughter is like music to me. But if you laugh at what I say next I will die, for I am about to say something very serious... perhaps shocking. Marge, my darling, I want you to meet with me again."
21297,106,94,463000,Marge Simpson,SHORTY'S,That doesn't shock me.
21298,106,95,465000,Jacques,SHORTY'S,"Away from prying eyes. At my apartment, the Fiesta Terrace."
21299,106,96,472000,Jacques,SHORTY'S,"Marge, speak to me."
21300,106,97,475000,Marge Simpson,SHORTY'S,Is Thursday okay?
21301,106,98,475000,Jacques,SHORTY'S,It's okay indeed.
21303,106,100,490000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Thank goodness I drove down an ironic street.
21304,106,101,495000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"I made the right decision to stay with my Homie, and there was no harm done. So if you kind of mentally snip out the part where I already had a husband, that's my idea of romance."
21306,106,102,507000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Marge, I want you to stop seeing this Jacque. You can let him down gently. But over the next couple of months, I want you to break it off."
21307,106,103,515000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Okay, Homer."
21308,106,104,518000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Ooh, that was a close one, kids."
21309,106,105,523000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Okay, Marge. As long as we're traumatizing the kids, I have a scandalous story of my own."
21310,106,106,530000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Car,"Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet your new co-worker, Mindy Simmons. I think she has a degree in engineering or something."
21311,106,107,536000,Mindy,Simpson Car,Hi. How's it goin'?
21312,106,108,538000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Car,Pleased to meet ya.
21313,106,109,539000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Car,"Yeah, ditto."
21314,106,110,540000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Hi.
21315,106,111,545000,Cherub Lenny,Simpson Car,"Homer, what's the matter?"
21316,106,112,547000,Cherub Carl,Simpson Car,Ain't you ever seen a naked chick ridin' a clam before?
21317,106,113,552000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Gotta go.
21319,106,115,558000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I made it the whole day without seeing her again.
21321,106,117,564000,Homer Simpson,Elevator,I mean hello!
21322,106,118,565000,Mindy,Elevator,I guess we'll be goin' down together. I mean getting off togeth-- I mean...
21323,106,119,570000,Homer Simpson,Elevator,"That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator."
148561,106,120,575000,Homer's Brain,Elevator,Think unsexy thoughts. Think unsexy thoughts! Think unsexy thoughts!
21324,106,121,581000,Homer Simpson,Elevator,That's unsexy.
21325,106,122,581000,Homer Simpson,Elevator,Ew.
21326,106,123,587000,Homer Simpson,Elevator,"Well, this is my floor."
21327,106,124,591000,Homer Simpson,Elevator,See you tomorrow....
21328,106,125,593000,Homer Simpson,Elevator,"I tried to avoid her, but we were sent to a nuclear convention in Capital City together..."
21330,106,127,603000,Bellhop,Homer's Room,TV's there; bathroom's there; and there's your king sized bed for...
21331,106,128,615000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Room,"Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it."
21332,106,129,622000,Mindy,Homer's Room,"Homer, I got a really wicked idea that could get us into a lot of trouble."
21333,106,130,628000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Room,"Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation."
21334,106,131,630000,Mindy,Homer's Room,"No, Homer. Let's do it. Let's call room service!"
21335,106,132,636000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Room,Oh!
21337,106,134,637000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Someone is charging room service to the company, sir."
21338,106,135,641000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Well we'll just see about that.
21339,106,136,645000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Fly my pretties! Fly!
21340,106,137,655000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Continue the research.
21343,106,140,659000,Passerby #1,Homer's Booth,"Thanks for poisoning the planet, bastard!"
21344,106,141,662000,Mindy,Homer's Booth,Get bent!
21345,106,142,663000,Passerby #2,Homer's Booth,No more Chernobyls!
21346,106,143,664000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Booth,Go to hell!
21347,106,144,667000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Booth,I was doing my best to resist her...
21348,106,145,667000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Booth,"But at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom."
148562,106,147,678000,Homer's Brain,Restaurant,You will find happiness with a new love.
21351,106,149,678000,Mindy,Homer's Hotel Room,"This was a really nice night, Homer."
21352,106,150,681000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,"Yeah, yeah."
21353,106,151,685000,Mindy,Homer's Hotel Room,What's wrong?
21354,106,152,686000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have sex.
21355,106,153,691000,Mindy,Homer's Hotel Room,"Oh... well, we don't have to."
21356,106,154,695000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,Yes we do. The cookie told me so.
21357,106,155,698000,Mindy,Homer's Hotel Room,"Well, desserts aren't always right."
21358,106,156,702000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,But they're so sweet.
21359,106,157,703000,Mindy,Homer's Hotel Room,"Homer, you know how I feel. So it-it's up to you. Look in your heart. I think you'll see what you want."
21360,106,158,730000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,"Oh, baby."
21361,106,159,733000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,"This was a wonderful idea, Homie."
21362,106,160,738000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,What happened to Mindy?
21363,106,161,739000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,"Yes, what did happen to her?"
21364,106,162,741000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,She hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
21365,106,163,743000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,Good. Does anyone else have a love story?
21366,106,164,747000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,"Yes, I do. And just like your love stories, it's tragic and filled with hurt feelings and scars that will never heal."
21367,106,165,755000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,It started appropriately enough with an innocent boy being embarrassed on Valentine's Day...
21369,106,167,765000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,Poor Ralph.
21370,106,168,768000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,"Here you go, Ralph."
21371,106,169,772000,Ralph Wiggum,Homer's Hotel Room,You choo choo choose me?
21305,106,170,774000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,Happy Valentine's.
21372,106,171,780000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Hotel Room,"It was an unusually warm February 14th, so the children walked home without jackets."
21374,106,173,786000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Can I walk you home... valentine?
21375,106,174,789000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Sure, I guess."
21376,106,175,791000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,That valentine sure was funny.
21377,106,176,794000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Glad you liked it.
21378,106,177,796000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"It says, ""choo choo choooose me,"" and there's a picture of a train."
21379,106,178,803000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Yeah. Nice gag.
21380,106,179,804000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Uh. So... Do you like... stuff?
21382,106,181,815000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,The doctor said I wouldn't have so many nosebleeds if I kept my finger out of there.
21383,106,182,821000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, here's my house."
21384,106,183,830000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, no. It's a package from Ralph."
21385,106,184,835000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, a Malibu Stacy Convertible! ""Look in the tunk."" He must mean trunk."
21386,106,185,845000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Tickets to the Krusty Anniversary Show!
21388,106,187,848000,Announcer,TV Studio,It's the Krusty the Clown 29th Anniversary Show!

21396,106,195,869000,Krusty the Clown,TV Studio,"Now, for my favorite part of the show: Whazzat say? Talk to the audience!? Oh, God, this is always death. All right."
21397,106,196,879000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,Oh no. Please don't show me with Ralph.
21398,106,197,882000,Krusty the Clown,TV Studio,"What's your name, son?"
21399,106,198,884000,Ralph Wiggum,TV Studio,Ralph.
21401,106,200,886000,Krusty the Clown,TV Studio,"And is this your girlfriend, Ralph?"
21402,106,201,888000,Ralph Wiggum,TV Studio,Yes! I love Lisa Simpson and when I grow up I'm going to marry her.
21403,106,202,893000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,Noooo!!
21404,106,203,894000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"Now you listen to me -- I don't like you. I never liked you, and the only reason I gave you that stupid valentine is 'cause nobody else would!"
21407,106,204,903000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"Watch this, Lis. You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half."
21408,106,205,908000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"A-a-a-a-and, now."
21410,106,207,915000,Marge Simpson,TV Studio,"Lisa, not all romances turn out that way. Bart, do you have a love story that doesn't end in heartbreak?"
21412,106,209,923000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Yes, I do. The only girl I ever loved invited me up to the treehouse. She had something very important to tell me."
21413,106,210,932000,Laura Powers,Bart's Treehouse,"I'm so happy, I just had to tell someone. I have a boyfriend."
