62179,251,148,653000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fine, I'll just discuss heavenly matters. So, how's Maude Flanders doin' up there? She playin' the field? Ooh... yeah, really? All those guys? Amen."

62183,251,152,683000,Krusty the Clown,Beach,"Listen, kid. I'm not the kind of dad who you know, does things, or says stuff, or looks at you. But the love is there."
62184,251,153,690000,Krusty the Clown,Beach,Where are you? Give Daddy a clue...
62185,251,154,693000,Krusty the Clown,Beach,"Oh, that's my girl."

62187,251,156,700000,Krusty the Clown,Beach,"I gotta sit up now? What am I, Baryshnikov?"
62188,251,157,707000,Krusty the Clown,Beach,"Hey, you beat me. What a great day we've had, huh?"
62189,251,158,711000,Sophie,Beach,"You know, for a clown, you're not really a lot of fun."
62190,251,159,718000,Krusty the Clown,Beach,"Boy, fatherhood is one tough gig. I don't get how other guys do it."

62199,251,168,746000,Krusty the Clown,Beach,"Mm, I think I've found my mentor."
62200,251,169,751000,Krusty the Clown,Beach,"You know, Homer, I've spent my whole life entertaining kids, and I just realized I don't know the first thing about 'em."
62201,251,170,758000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"Well, I won't lie. Fatherhood isn't easy like motherhood. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. Except for some mag wheels. Oh, man, that would be sweet."
62202,251,171,769000,Lisa Simpson,Beach,Dad! Dad!
62203,251,172,770000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"Just a second, honey. Daddy's on his high horse."

62205,251,174,775000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"Yeah, I'm watching, honey. Nice cannonball. Anyhoo, the key to fathering is don't over-think. 'Cause over-thinking is... What were we talking about? Ooh, a clown."
62206,251,175,791000,Krusty the Clown,Beach,"Kid, I gotta admit, you're startin' to grow on me."
62207,251,176,820000,Sophie,Beach,"Same here, Dad. It's nice that you don't always have to be ""on."""
62208,251,177,824000,Krusty the Clown,Beach,"I thought I was on. When was I off? That bit about the tide pool? I tell ya, it killed at Jacque Cousteau's funeral.."
62209,251,178,831000,Sophie,Beach,"Dad, relax. Just enjoy the sunset."
62210,251,179,837000,Krusty the Clown,Beach,"Hey, I know that song. My dad used to play that when I was a boy. It's beautiful."
62211,251,180,845000,Sophie,Beach,Do you play?
62212,251,181,846000,Krusty the Clown,Beach,"Nah. I guess musical talent skips a generation... like diabetes. You might want to watch out for that, too."
62214,251,183,852000,Sophie,Apartment Building,"Mom, I had the best time. Can Dad come in for milk and cookies?"
62215,251,184,857000,Krusty the Clown,Apartment Building,Why I'd love to...
