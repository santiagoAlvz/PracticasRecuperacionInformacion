85624,332,3,33000,Host,Poolside Patio,"Last week, on ""P.I.I.,"" our billionaire bachelor gave five lovely ladies a rose of continuation. And he hurled a rock of rejection at anyone displaying intelligence, character or ethnicity."

85628,332,6,48000,Host,Villa,"Ladies, when you were selected, you were told that you'd be dating a billionaire on his private island. Well, I'm afraid we misled you..."

85630,332,8,59000,Host,Villa,...this isn't an island at all. It's a peninsula!
85631,332,9,65000,Contestant #1,Villa,This was supposed to be about trust!
85632,332,10,68000,Contestant #2,Villa,I just want to get on that boat and go home.
85633,332,11,71000,Host,Villa,"Well, you don't need a boat, 'cause you can walk!"
85635,332,13,76000,Host,Villa,Yeah.

85640,332,18,94000,Farmer Billy,Villa,Would you like to see how a pig goes from loving life to your fork and knife?

85645,332,23,119000,Farmer Billy,Villa,"If you like bacon, you're gonna love it. And if you don't like bacon, well then the hell with you."
85646,332,24,125000,Homer Simpson,Villa,I'm going to find that golden ticket and win that tour! The only thing that can make bacon more delicious is seeing how it's made!
85648,332,26,135000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Okay, Farmer Billy's slow-killed bacon, Farmer Billy's bacon-fed bacon, Farmer Billy's travel bacon... Mr. Simpson, if you really want to kill yourself, I also sell handguns."

85654,332,31,163000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"""This silver ticket entitles you to judge the pig competition, at the Springfield County Fair."""
85655,332,32,163000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Judge a pig competition?... But I'm no super-genius! Or are I?
85657,332,34,181000,Lisa Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,These giant vegetables are amazing.
85658,332,35,188000,Marge Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,How about a bite of the world's biggest Brussels sprout?
85659,332,36,191000,Bart Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,Eww.
85660,332,37,200000,Country Singer,COUNTY FAIR,This song is about a country I love -- you may have heard of it. It's called America.

85668,332,45,266000,Marge Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,Let's see how your sister's doing in the place-setting competition.
85669,332,46,270000,Bart Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,Place-setting? How is someone so lame related to a hot tamale like me?
85670,332,47,279000,Krusty the Clown,COUNTY FAIR,"Check it out -- dribble glass, rubber knife, whoopee salad..."
85672,332,49,287000,Krusty the Clown,COUNTY FAIR,"And finally, the breakaway wine bottle..."
85673,332,50,290000,Krusty the Clown,COUNTY FAIR,... did not arrive.
85674,332,51,294000,Lisa Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,"My theme is ""If Music Be The Food of Love."" The setting features tuning forks, champagne flutes and of course, chopsticks. And for dessert, Ella Fitz Jell-O."
85675,332,52,306000,The Rich Texan,COUNTY FAIR,"Lordy girl, your entry stinks like the south end of a north-bound mule!"
85676,332,53,310000,Lisa Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,What's wrong with it?
85677,332,54,312000,The Rich Texan,COUNTY FAIR,"Well, your place-setting thinks it's better than it is -- like a yard dog that sneaks into the house!"
85678,332,55,318000,Cletus Spuckler,COUNTY FAIR,Zing!
85679,332,56,319000,Lisa Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,Did I do anything right?
85680,332,57,320000,The Rich Texan,COUNTY FAIR,"Well, you did put it on a table."
85681,332,58,325000,The Rich Texan,COUNTY FAIR,"Looky here, it wobbles! Wobble, wobble, wobble! Wobble, wobble, wobble! Wobble, wobble, wobble!"
85653,332,59,333000,The Rich Texan,COUNTY FAIR,This table's about as solid as your underlying concept.
85627,332,60,339000,Homer Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,No one does that to my daughter!
85683,332,61,343000,Chief Wiggum,COUNTY FAIR,"One more felony assault, Simpson, and you're goin' down. I didn't know I could fit in a bubble. I must be losin' weight."
85684,332,62,354000,Homer Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,But I've gotta do something! I'll need a disguise.
85685,332,63,366000,The Rich Texan,COUNTY FAIR,"Aw, there, there, li'l darlin'. Dry those tears... with this."
85688,332,66,376000,Homer Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,Hold it right there!

85693,332,71,391000,Drederick Tatum,COUNTY FAIR,"We all know pi R squared. But today, pie are justice. And I welcome it."
85694,332,72,396000,Lisa Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,Thank you mysterious stranger... where did he go?
85695,332,73,402000,Marge Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,"Where were you, Homie? You missed all the excitement."
85696,332,74,403000,Sideshow Mel,COUNTY FAIR,Shall we ever see Springfield's costumed protector again?
85697,332,75,407000,Homer Simpson,COUNTY FAIR,"Oh, I have a funny feeling we will. Wherever people are mistreated, the Pie Man will strike!"
85699,332,77,425000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whatcha doin', sweetie?"
85700,332,78,425000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm drawing a picture of my newest hero, the Pie Man."

85704,332,83,441000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What's wrong, son?"
85705,332,84,443000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Comic Book Guy made me pay for these comics he said I smudged. But I didn't even touch 'em!
85706,332,85,448000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Richie Rich Incorporates In Delaware,"" ""Easy to Believe Tales,"" ""Supergirl vs. the Glass Ceiling,"" ""The Green Listener""..."
85707,332,86,455000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,He was just trying to unload these crappy comics on a helpless kid.
85708,332,87,458000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Somebody ought to take him down a peg. Or, should I say, down a pie."
85709,332,88,463000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I think the expression is ""peg."""
85710,332,89,463000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe you're right, Lisa. Maybe you're pie. Pie-be you're pie."
85713,332,91,501000,Milhouse Van Houten,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"This magazine you sold me isn't ""Fantastic Four."" It's ""Fantastic Floor""!"
85714,332,92,507000,Milhouse Van Houten,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,My family can't put in floors -- we rent!
85715,332,93,510000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Sorry, no refunds."
85716,332,94,515000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Oh brother. Why do we get all the weirdos here at the comic book store?
85717,332,95,519000,Homer Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Comic Book Guy! Don't do the crime if you can't do the key lime!
85718,332,96,525000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,How could this be any more humiliating?
85719,332,97,529000,Nichelle Nichols,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Hello, I'm Nichelle Nichols of Star Trek."
85720,332,98,531000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Oh, you've finally accepted my invitation for tea and chit-chat!"
85721,332,99,537000,Nichelle Nichols,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Listen, I said it to Shatner and I'm saying it to you: there is no way I'm going to be dating a man with pie on his face."
85723,332,101,546000,Bart Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"There's a note! ""Evildoers beware! Signed, Simple Simon, your friendly neighborhood Pie Man."""

85729,332,107,567000,Marge Simpson,Krusty Burger,You can tell by the way the pie tin sits on his face that he's very good looking.
85730,332,108,572000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,"Oh, I think you'd find his filling extremely hot."
85731,332,109,576000,Marge Simpson,Krusty Burger,"Ooh, I'll bet he's Ned Flanders."
85732,332,110,579000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,Flanders!? He's not man enough to trim my crust. I mean Pie Man's crust. I'm not Pie Man.
85733,332,111,585000,Kent Brockman,Krusty Burger,"Pie -- popular pastry, tricky math thing, and now, sword of righteousness. A masked avenger has been giving Springfield's scoundrels their just desserts."
85734,332,112,594000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,This is for your show's slight decline in quality over the years!
85735,332,113,597000,Kent Brockman,Krusty Burger,"In an attempt to curb copycat pieings, the police have organized a pie-for-guns exchange."
85736,332,114,602000,Kent Brockman,Krusty Burger,The pies were immediately detonated by the bomb squad.
85738,332,115,607000,Chief Wiggum,Krusty Burger,"Oh, those poor innocent pies. Some days you just don't want to be a cop, you know? I'm gonna go turn the siren on, that always cheers me up."
85739,332,116,619000,Kent Brockman,Krusty Burger,"That's good footage. Where will the Pie Man strike next? Perhaps at the Springfield Children's Hospital, which is tossing out all its sick youngsters to make way for a new cosmetic surgery clinic."
85740,332,117,629000,Poor Violet,Krusty Burger,Who will treat my whooping cough?
85741,332,118,634000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Krusty Burger,Search me. Come back when you want a giant rack.
85742,332,119,642000,Chief Wiggum,Krusty Burger,"Okay, Lou, the minute Pie Man shows up, we spring our trap."
85743,332,120,645000,Lou,Krusty Burger,Whaddya got against this pie guy anyway? He's givin' jerks their comeuppance.
85744,332,121,650000,Chief Wiggum,Krusty Burger,"Yeah, but he's skippin' the hardest part of bein' a cop: bike safety lectures."
85745,332,122,654000,Lou,Krusty Burger,"Oh, come on, Chief."
85746,332,123,654000,Chief Wiggum,Krusty Burger,"No, no one ever wants to hear about the importance of pants clips, do they?"
85747,332,124,659000,Lou,Krusty Burger,"Yeah, but..."
85748,332,125,660000,Chief Wiggum,Krusty Burger,That's why Pie Man is goin' down.He spins the barrel of his gun.
85749,332,126,662000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Krusty Burger,"Thanks to this clinic, we will no longer be terrorized by the spectacle of women aging naturally."
85751,332,128,670000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,"Not so fast, old-time liberal."
85752,332,129,674000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Krusty Burger,Get him!
85753,332,130,676000,Lenny Leonard,Krusty Burger,"Pie Man, no! It's a trap!"
85754,332,131,678000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,"No trap can hold Homer Simpson! But I'm not Homer Simpson. I'm the Pie Man. Homer Simpson away! I mean, the Pie Man!"
85755,332,132,689000,Chief Wiggum,Krusty Burger,Shoot to kill!
85756,332,133,695000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,Dammit!
85757,332,134,697000,Chief Wiggum,Krusty Burger,"Oh, way to go, Lou. You hit him!"
85758,332,135,699000,Lou,Krusty Burger,You sound like you're surprised.
85759,332,136,701000,Chief Wiggum,Krusty Burger,"I'm trying to give you positive reinforcement, jerk."
85760,332,137,704000,Lou,Krusty Burger,That's positive? Callin' me a jerk?
85761,332,138,706000,Chief Wiggum,Krusty Burger,You are a jerk.
85762,332,139,714000,Marge Simpson,Krusty Burger,I'm not being trampled. What gives?
85763,332,140,722000,Marge Simpson,Krusty Burger,Listen... I'm married.
85764,332,141,731000,Marge Simpson,Krusty Burger,"I'm looking up your nose, but I feel like I'm staring into your soul."
85766,332,143,742000,Marge Simpson,Krusty Burger,"That was so exciting, yet familiar. Like Coke with lemon."
85767,332,147,759000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Let's see...cartilage, cartilage, muscle, nerve!... artery...bullet."
85768,332,148,767000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Dad?
85769,332,149,769000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Pie Man is not your father, little girl. I... murdered your father."
85770,332,150,776000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Dad, please. It's obvious you're Pie Man. We've been getting his mail for weeks."
85771,332,151,783000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,We shall continue this conversation in the pie cave.
85773,332,153,789000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Basement,"Watch it, one more step. Welcome to my secret lair."
85774,332,154,793000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Basement,"Dad, this is the basement. Here's the iced tea I left down here this afternoon."
85775,332,155,798000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Basement,"So it would seem. Anyhoo, I'll bet this is all a pretty big surprise, huh? Mild-mannered Homer Simpson..."
85776,332,156,803000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Basement,You're not mild-mannered. You're often liquored-up and rude.
85777,332,157,807000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Basement,Honorable men can differ. Now what brings you down here?
85778,332,158,810000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Basement,"I want you to stop this, Dad. Before you get killed."
85779,332,159,817000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Basement,"All right, I'll stop. But what'll I do with these pies?"
85780,332,160,820000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Basement,"Well, I know one thing you could do..."
85781,332,161,823000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Basement,"I was in so deep, I forgot pies were food."
85784,332,164,832000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Simpson, you're late, bald and stupid! I'm docking you a day's pay."
85785,332,165,839000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'll show him.
85786,332,166,842000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, I shouldn't."
85787,332,167,844000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Or should I?
85788,332,168,848000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I'll keep my promise, honey."
85789,332,169,849000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No looking at pictures of loved ones!
85791,332,171,852000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No angry grumbling under your breath!

85794,332,174,865000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Won't someone help us?
85795,332,175,866000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Who will stand up for Carl and Lenny?
85796,332,176,870000,Pie #1,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey Homer, throw me at Mr. Burns!"
85797,332,177,873000,Pie #2,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, throw me! I'm old and stale... I might just kill him!"
85798,332,178,881000,Cake,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Don't do it, Homer! You made a promise to Lisa!"
85799,332,179,885000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Since when do I listen to cakes?
85800,332,180,886000,Pie #3,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Tell you what, Homer -- you make one last hit, then you're out of the business forever. Lisa would understand."
85801,332,181,892000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You're all so wise... I wish I could eat each and every one of you.
85802,332,182,895000,Pies,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"/ Aw, we wish you could eat us, too."
85804,332,184,901000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hey!
85805,332,185,902000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Attention: while you've been showering here, I sold all your clothes."
85807,332,187,908000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Again?
85808,332,188,909000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I've run out of pie-related puns!
85811,332,191,915000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"He won't escape, sir."
85812,332,192,931000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Behold, Smithers, your so-called Messiah."
85813,332,193,934000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Sir, I never..."
85815,332,195,940000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,To the employee prison!
85817,332,197,948000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Now, let's see what we have here..."
85820,332,200,958000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Simpson! You'll rue the day you took that pie tin, poked holes for eyes, and attached a rubber band around the back!"
85821,332,201,964000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"It's not a rubber band, it's a scrunchie!"
85822,332,202,966000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Silence! Or I'll chop you into suet for my murderous gerbils and hamsters.
85823,332,203,973000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Wait, I have a better idea. You'll work for me now."
85824,332,204,976000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I already work for you.
85825,332,205,978000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"In addition to working in your normal capacity at the plant, you will also serve as my personal hit man."
85826,332,206,983000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Do I get two paychecks?
85827,332,207,985000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No.

85831,332,210,990000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,But I promised my daughter--
85832,332,211,992000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Do as I say or I'll tell the police. You'll do so much community service.
85833,332,212,996000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Nooo! Not community service -- I can't stand helping others! I just can't!
85834,332,213,1003000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Now open the folder. It contains your next victim.
85835,332,214,1010000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, not him! Anyone but him! I've had my problems with him. Everyone has. But like every monster, he just wants to be loved."

85839,332,218,1029000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't sleep. I keep thinking about the Pie Man.
85840,332,219,1032000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, me too..."
85841,332,220,1034000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What if he started pieing good people? Not because he wanted to, but because he was being blackmailed by his boss?"
85842,332,221,1040000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie... are you the Pie Man?
85843,332,222,1043000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I'm not. And here's a picture that proves it."

85847,332,226,1056000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You know I'm not Pie Man.
85848,332,227,1058000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't care.

85860,332,239,1094000,C. Montgomery Burns,Park,"That's right. All his talk of peace and love is really honking off my red Chinese masters. Now Smithers, walk me around the park until I fall asleep. I'm feeling fussy."
85862,332,241,1112000,Lisa Simpson,Auditorium,"As Springfield's youngest Buddhist, I am deeply honored to introduce the Dalai Lama."
85863,332,242,1118000,Homer Simpson,Auditorium,I can't do this in front of Lisa. Why does she have to believe in things?
85864,332,243,1124000,C. Montgomery Burns,Auditorium,You have no choice. Pie him or I'll reveal your secret to the world!
85865,332,244,1128000,Lisa Simpson,Auditorium,"And now please welcome the Elvis of Enlightenment... the lean, serene, chanting machine: the Dalai Lama!"

85873,332,252,1172000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Auditorium,Homer Simpson is the Pie Man? Impossible. He's never thrown away a pastry in his life.
85875,332,254,1178000,Sideshow Mel,Auditorium,His brain isn't large enough to juggle two contrasting personae!
85876,332,255,1183000,Moe Szyslak,Auditorium,"Yeah, and Homer's a dumbass! No offense, Homer. Ya dumbass."
85877,332,256,1187000,Homer Simpson,Auditorium,"I'm telling you, I'm the Pie Man!"
85878,332,257,1190000,Carl Carlson,Auditorium,No you're not. The Pie Man could fly.
85879,332,258,1192000,Lenny Leonard,Auditorium,And spit acid!

85886,332,265,1202000,Chief Wiggum,Auditorium,It's gonna be you if you don't shut up.
85887,332,266,1204000,Lisa Simpson,Auditorium,"Dad, I think you created a hero that even you couldn't live up to."
85888,332,267,1208000,Homer Simpson,Auditorium,"Yeah. Let's go home, honey."

85893,332,272,1229000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, it was clearly you in that suit. You'd have to be an idiot not to see it from the start."
85894,332,273,1237000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So... Pie Man, why don't you show me your superpowers? Pie Man?"
85895,332,275,1245000,Homer Simpson,CITY,"Wherever injustice shows its ugly face, I will be there! For I am the Pie Man!"
85896,332,276,1251000,Bart Simpson,CITY,"And wherever Pie Man is, the Cupcake Kid will not be far behind."
85897,332,277,1256000,Marge Simpson,CITY,"While you two are up on the roof, why don't you take the leaves out of the gutter!"
