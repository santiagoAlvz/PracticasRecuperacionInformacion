19407,99,6,58000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, this isn't such a great prize. Oh, well, this may be a dirty job, but the big guys at the top work even harder."
19409,99,8,75000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Private Bathroom,Will five o'clock never come?
19410,99,9,83000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Private Bathroom,"Careful, Smithers, that sponge has corners you know."
19412,99,10,86000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Private Bathroom,I'll go find a spherical one.
19413,99,11,86000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Private Bathroom,"Help, Smithers! I'm sinking! I'm sinking! Life... flashing... before...eyes."

19417,99,15,119000,Greenpeace Hippie #1,Burns's Private Bathroom,"All right, we're finally gonna stop those corporate pigs from dumping that nuclear waste."
19418,99,16,129000,Greenpeace Hippie #2,Burns's Private Bathroom,"Oh no, our boat is sinking."
19419,99,17,132000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Private Bathroom,"It was I, you fools! The man you trusted isn't Wavy Gravy at all!"
19420,99,18,134000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Private Bathroom,And all this time I've been smoking harmless tobacco.
19421,99,19,142000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Private Bathroom,"I got a mink shammy, sir. I hope that... Oh my god, Mr. Burns is dead! Why do the good always die so young?!"
19422,99,20,160000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Private Bathroom,You almost killed me!
19423,99,21,164000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Private Bathroom,Please... sir! You'll catch cold.
19425,99,23,172000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Smithers, do you realize, if I had died there would be no one to carry on my legacy? Due to my hectic schedule and lethargic sperm, I never fathered an heir. Now I have no one to leave my enormous fortune to. No one."
19427,99,25,188000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"You, Smithers? Oh no, my dear friend, I've planned a far greater reward for you. When I pass on, you shall be buried alive with me."

19434,99,32,228000,C. Montgomery Burns,Theater,"Now then, I'm looking for a suitable young, male heir to leave my fortune to when I pass away. My vast, vast, vast fortune. Vast."
19435,99,33,242000,C. Montgomery Burns,Theater,"Auditions will be tomorrow at my estate. And now, our feature presentation."
19436,99,34,251000,C. Montgomery Burns,Theater,"Oh for... Oh, very well."
19437,99,35,255000,C. Montgomery Burns,Theater,"LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY, LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY, LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY, GET OURSELVES SOME SNACKS...."
19439,99,37,268000,Chief Wiggum,Burns Manor,Now what are the two things? Enunciate and energate.
19441,99,38,275000,Milhouse Van Houten,Burns Manor,I have nothing to offer you but my love.
19442,99,39,279000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"I specifically said ""No geeks!"""
19443,99,40,279000,Milhouse Van Houten,Burns Manor,But my mom says I'm cool.
19444,99,41,284000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Next.
19445,99,42,287000,Nelson Muntz,Burns Manor,Gimme your fortune or I'll pound your withered old face in.
19446,99,43,290000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Oh, I like his energy. Put him on the call back list."
19447,99,44,293000,Martin Prince,Burns Manor,"CLANG, CLANG, CLANG WENT THE TROLLEY / RING, RING, RING WENT THE BELL / ZING, ZING, ZING WENT MY HEARTSTRINGS..."
19448,99,45,302000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Thank you. Give the bully an extra point.
19449,99,46,307000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,I propose to you that your heir need not be a boy. In this phallocentric society of ours...
19450,99,47,314000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"I don't know what ""phallocentric"" means, but no girls."
19451,99,48,318000,Milhouse Van Houten,Burns Manor,So much for Plan B.
19452,99,49,318000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"That's it, boy. You're our last hope."
19453,99,50,323000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,"I just don't want to be here, Dad. Besides, I started a fire this morning that I really should keep an eye on."
19454,99,51,329000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Bart, this isn't the kind of thing I normally would think was a good idea, but you wouldn't have to live with Mr. Burns, you'd just get all of his money someday. This could provide for your entire future."
19455,99,52,339000,Professor,Burns Manor,"Congratulations, you've just graduated from the most expensive and therefore best school there is."
19456,99,53,348000,Lee Majors,Burns Manor,"Hello, Marge, I'm Lee Majors. Will you come away with me?"
19457,99,54,352000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Uh, sure."
19458,99,55,356000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"I've gotta stop fantasizing about Lee Majors. Ah, one more."
19459,99,56,364000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Okay, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say. Just read it and you're a shoo-in."
19460,99,57,376000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,"Hello, Mr... Kurns? I bad want... money now. Me sick."
19461,99,58,379000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Oooh. He card reads good.
19462,99,59,386000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,"So pick, please, me... Mr. Burns."
19463,99,60,386000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"It's KURNS, stupid!"
19464,99,61,386000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,No it's not.
19465,99,62,391000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Disregard.
19466,99,63,391000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Oh, he's the worst yet! That's it! Everyone out! Except you! One step to the left."
19467,99,64,400000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,Ow!
19468,99,65,400000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Excellent.
19469,99,66,411000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,The boot kicked Bart. It kicked him right in the butt.
19471,99,68,419000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,I think Bart and Lisa are feeling a little upset right now. Isn't there something you'd like to say?
19472,99,69,425000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"There sure is. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Right in the butt. That was great."
19475,99,72,438000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"It's no use. I guess I'll have to leave all my money to the Egg Advisory Council. Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap lately, you know, Smithers."
19476,99,73,451000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Ooh look, a bird has become petrified and lost its sense of direction."
19477,99,74,455000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"I think it's a rock, sir."
19478,99,75,455000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Well, we'll see what the lab has to say about that."
19479,99,76,460000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Why that rapscallion is breaking all my windows.
19482,99,79,469000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"Look Smithers, a creature of pure malevolence. He's the perfect one to suckle at my proverbial teat."
19483,99,80,493000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"You there, boy! What day is this?"
19484,99,81,495000,Street Urchin,Mansion,"Today? Sir, why it's Christmas day."
19485,99,82,498000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"I was talking to him. You, what day is this?"
19486,99,83,498000,Bart Simpson,Mansion,Huh?
19487,99,84,501000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,I'll tell you what day it is. Today is the day you become my heir!
19488,99,85,507000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"Ooh, I like him a lot."
19490,99,87,517000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Just sign here and your son will stand to inherit my entire estate.
19491,99,88,522000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Woo hoo! We're rich! Bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows. We want to get the old people smell out before we move in."
19492,99,89,530000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, Mr. Burns hasn't passed away yet."
19493,99,90,530000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Huh? Oh, right. So I guess you're in okay shape, huh? No heart problems or anything..."
19494,99,91,537000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Well, I --"
19495,99,92,539000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Boo!
19496,99,93,539000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm okay.
19499,99,94,547000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Now that you've all agreed to reap the windfall of my death, I must return to my large empty mansion to rattle around and await the inevitable... alone."
19500,99,95,560000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
19501,99,96,560000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, let's push him down the steps."
19502,99,97,563000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No. You know, Bart, since he is giving you all of his money, maybe it would be nice if you spend some time with him."
19503,99,98,572000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Well...
19504,99,99,572000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, honey."
19505,99,100,575000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,All right.
19506,99,101,577000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How come Bart gets to do that and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house?
19508,99,103,589000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of ""booger man,"" but I'm really not such a bad ""dude."" Oh, your milk's gone cold. I'll ring for the maid."
19509,99,104,600000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,Whoa.
19510,99,105,600000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Sorry. Wrong button.
19511,99,106,605000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,"Um, uh, I think I'd like to go home."
19512,99,107,609000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Aw, if you stay you can have anything you want to eat, even some sort of gelatin dish. It's made from hooves, you know."
19513,99,108,616000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,"Anything, huh? Okay... I want pizza, and I want it delivered by Krusty the Clown."
19514,99,109,625000,Krusty the Clown,Burns Manor,"Hey, it's Krusty the pizza man! -- All right, where's my four hundred bucks?"
19515,99,110,633000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,"Hey, wait! How can you be here when your show's on live?"
19516,99,111,636000,Krusty the Clown,Burns Manor,"Ah, I just threw on an old rerun. No one will know the difference."
19517,99,112,644000,Krusty the Clown,Burns Manor,"Children, remain calm. The Falkland Islands have just been invaded! I repeat, the Falklands have just been invaded."
19518,99,113,651000,Krusty the Clown,Burns Manor,"The disputed islands lie here, off the coast of Argentina."
19521,99,116,655000,C. Montgomery Burns,ANOTHER BASEMENT ROOM,"This is my pride and joy. I've had hidden cameras planted in every home in Springfield. I got the idea from that movie ""Sliver."" What a delightful romp!"
19522,99,117,666000,Moe Szyslak,ANOTHER BASEMENT ROOM,Are you talkin' to me? There's no one else here. You must be talkin' to me.
19523,99,118,675000,Moe Szyslak,ANOTHER BASEMENT ROOM,Well that was an antique. Crap.
19497,99,119,685000,Homer Simpson,ANOTHER BASEMENT ROOM,"Oh, yeah. So good..."
19498,99,120,689000,Bart Simpson,ANOTHER BASEMENT ROOM,That explains his mysterious trip to Holland.
19525,99,122,694000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"...And I had the greatest time. Mr. Burns' house has everything - a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors, and a bottomless pit."
19526,99,123,703000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It couldn't possibly be bottomless.
19527,99,124,703000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, for all intents and purposes."
19529,99,126,708000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Hey Mom, Bart's throwing peas."
19530,99,127,711000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Bart, don't throw peas at your sister."
19531,99,128,714000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,Mr. Burns throws peas at Smithers.
19532,99,129,716000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,Ow! That was a big one.
19533,99,130,719000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Homer, say something."
19534,99,131,719000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,Okay. Lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas.
19536,99,133,725000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Oh yuck, meatloaf! My most hated of all loafs."
19537,99,134,731000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,That was the end piece. That's it! Being abusive to your family is one thing but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. Go to your room!
19538,99,135,741000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,No! This family stinks. Mr. Burns nurtures my destructive side. I'm suffocating here.
19539,99,136,748000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Bart, you listen."
19540,99,137,748000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Oh, go eat some flowers."
19541,99,138,751000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,My secret shame.
19543,99,140,758000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Smithers, my plan worked perfectly. Bart Simpson will live here as my son, and I will mold him in my own graven image. Who knows, I may even grow to love him. Bartholomew!"
19544,99,141,772000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Ugh! Smithers get it off me.
19545,99,142,777000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Bart, you're coming home."
19546,99,143,777000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,I want to stay here with Mr. Burns.
19547,99,144,781000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,I suggest you leave immediately.
19548,99,145,783000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst."
19549,99,146,794000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,He locked the door! I'll show him.
19551,99,148,799000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,I'm very concerned. Mr. Burns has stolen our son and he won't give him back.
19552,99,149,807000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Oh for gosh, can't you people solve these problems yourselves? I mean we can't be uh ""Policing"" the whole city."
19553,99,151,814000,Lionel Hutz,Springfield Mall,Damn clogs. Well you good folks can rest easy now because you've come to the very best in legal representation.
19554,99,152,826000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Mall,"Uh, excuse me, is there an Orange Julius stand on this floor?"
19555,99,153,830000,Lionel Hutz,Springfield Mall,I'll sell you this one. It's almost full.
19556,99,154,832000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Mall,Well why don't I drink out of a toilet bowl?
19557,99,155,834000,Lionel Hutz,Springfield Mall,He'll be back. And as for your case - don't you worry. I've argued in front of every judge in the state. Often as a lawyer.
19559,99,157,841000,Judge Snyder,MUNICIPAL COURTROOM,This court rules in favor of Montgomery Burns. I find that he is clearly the boy's biological father.
19560,99,158,849000,Lionel Hutz,MUNICIPAL COURTROOM,"Uh, judge, these won't be ready until Thursday."
19561,99,159,855000,Marge Simpson,MUNICIPAL COURTROOM,You know we should really stop hiring him.
19563,99,161,864000,Milhouse Van Houten,Burns Manor,Cool train. Where's it go?
19564,99,162,864000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,Beats me. But it won't be back for three hours and forty minutes. Once it had snow on it.
19565,99,163,871000,Milhouse Van Houten,Burns Manor,"Wow, Bart! Mr. Burns gives you everything you could ever want. My parents use that old love excuse to screw me out of toys. Well, I'm sure you'd like to be alone with your possessions."
19566,99,164,883000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,"Uh, Milhouse, if you stay a little while longer, you can have this blazer. It's a Bob Mackie original."
19567,99,165,890000,Milhouse Van Houten,Burns Manor,"Wow, a Bob Mackie! ...Sorry, Bart."
19568,99,166,900000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Bartholomew, you don't need him. I can be your schoolyard chum!"
19570,99,168,906000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Five, twenty-three skidoo! Hut! Hut!"
19571,99,169,914000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,For me? But I don't know how to drive.
19572,99,170,917000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Oh, pish posh. There's a jaws of life in the trunk."
19574,99,172,932000,Bart Simpson,Sports Car,That was some ride.
19575,99,173,932000,Elf,Sports Car,You're telling me.
19577,99,175,940000,Deprogrammer,Office,"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, your son has clearly been brainwashed by the evil and charismatic Mr. Burns."
19578,99,176,947000,Marge Simpson,Office,Are you sure you can get him back for us?
19579,99,177,949000,Deprogrammer,Office,"Absolutely. I'm the one who successfully deprogrammed Jane Fonda, you know."
19580,99,178,954000,Marge Simpson,Office,What about Peter Fonda?
19581,99,179,954000,Deprogrammer,Office,"That was a heartbreaker. But I did get Paul McCartney out of ""Wings."""
19582,99,180,960000,Homer Simpson,Office,You idiot! He was the most talented one!
19584,99,182,967000,Deprogrammer,Cheap Motel,You do not love Mr. Burns. You love Homer and Marge! You are their son!
19585,99,183,976000,Deprogrammer,Cheap Motel,What you are doing is wrong... wrong... wrong!
19586,99,184,980000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Cheap Motel,Do you mind? You're killing the romance in here.
19587,99,185,986000,Deprogrammer,Cheap Motel,"Well, it was a grueling two weeks but you have your son back."
19588,99,186,993000,Hans Moleman,Cheap Motel,"Mom, Dad, I missed you."
19589,99,187,996000,Marge Simpson,Cheap Motel,"Homer, that's Hans Moleman."
19590,99,188,996000,Homer Simpson,Cheap Motel,"Can I keep him anyway? Huh, huh?"
19592,99,190,1044000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,That was delightful! Did you see that? That mouse butchered that cat like a hog! Is all TV this wonderful?
19593,99,191,1053000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,"Um, I'd kind of like to go home now."
19594,99,192,1057000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Like a hog! Heh? What? What was that?
19595,99,193,1061000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,"Mr. Burns, I don't want to seem ungrateful. But, I want to go home to my family."
19596,99,194,1067000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you this, but... I'm afraid your family doesn't want you back."
19598,99,196,1076000,Homer,BASEMENT ROOM,I do not miss Bart at all.
19599,99,197,1079000,Marge,BASEMENT ROOM,I am glad he's gone.
19600,99,198,1081000,Lisa,BASEMENT ROOM,As am I.
19601,99,199,1081000,Homer,BASEMENT ROOM,B'oh!
19602,99,200,1084000,Bart Simpson,BASEMENT ROOM,It's probably my imagination but something about them didn't seem quite right.
19603,99,201,1089000,C. Montgomery Burns,BASEMENT ROOM,Really? Excuse me for just a moment.
19605,99,203,1095000,C. Montgomery Burns,NEXT ROOM,"People, that was all wrong. Homer Simpson doesn't say ""B'oh!"" he says... ""D'oh!"""
19606,99,204,1101000,Homer Actor,NEXT ROOM,"Sorry, M.B., but I'm having trouble with this character. Is he supposed to have some kind of neurological impairment like ""Rainman,"" or ""Awakenings""? I mean, what the Hell am I doing here?"
19607,99,205,1116000,Marge Actress,NEXT ROOM,"And this dialogue has none of the wit and sparkle of ""Murphy Brown."""
19608,99,206,1119000,Lisa Actress,NEXT ROOM,"Hey, ya know, we're getting into golden-time here."
