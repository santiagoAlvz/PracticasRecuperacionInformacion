73096,288,1,38000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Manjula, why did you bring the octuplets to work? This is supposed to be our special time together."
73097,288,2,43000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Some special time. I get to stand around, watching you sell fatty poisons to overfed Americans."
73098,288,3,51000,Comic Book Guy,Kwik-E-Mart,"You'd think that would deter me, but no."
73099,288,4,56000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Look, please, can you just take the children home? The porno magazine buyers are too embarrassed to make their move. Look."
73100,288,5,65000,Moe Szyslak,Kwik-E-Mart,Come on.
73101,288,6,66000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"All right. Let's go, children."
73102,288,7,70000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Clean up in all the aisles.
73103,288,8,76000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Welcome, steady customer. I see you are ready for the Civil War reenactment."
73104,288,9,80000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"I need some supplies: a keg of beer, and a six-pack to hold me till I tap the keg."
73105,288,10,85000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Here you go.
73106,288,11,87000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Thanks. Are you sure you don't want to come? In a Civil War reenactment we need lots of Indians to shoot.
73107,288,12,94000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"I don't know which part of that sentence to correct first. But I cannot come. I work 22 hours a day, and then I go home to a wife who will not touch me. The Indian rope trick has become the Indian ""nope"" trick."
73108,288,13,105000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Hi-Yo!
73109,288,14,110000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,The Squishee Lady!

73115,288,20,124000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Take a penny, leave a penny."
73116,288,21,128000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey, she called me handsome!"
73117,288,22,128000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,She likes you! Put in a good word for grape.
73118,288,23,132000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Come on, guys. We're gonna be late."
73119,288,24,136000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Okay, okay, don't go Mary Todd on us."
73121,288,26,149000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Park,"C'mon Barney, if you're gonna be General Grant, you have to have a drink."
73122,288,27,154000,Barney Gumble,Springfield Park,"Yeah, but I'm a recovering alcoholic, so..."
73123,288,28,157000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Park,One drink won't hurt.
73124,288,29,162000,Barney Gumble,Springfield Park,"Hey, you're right. I was afraid it would start me drinking again, but it didn't."
73125,288,30,167000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Park,Mm-hmm!
73126,288,31,169000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Park,"The 2nd Battle of Springfield was fought by the North...the South...and the East...to keep Springfield in, out of, and next to the Union, respectively. Now, the actual battle was fought over there, where that man is standing. But he won't move, so we'll do it here."
73127,288,32,190000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Park,Very good. And now... let the battle be joined.
73128,288,33,199000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Park,Bang! Bang!
73129,288,34,200000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Park,Pow! Pow!

73134,288,39,211000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Battlefield,For me the war is over!
73136,288,41,213000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Park,This battlefield is rife with inaccuracy. You dead people stop playing cards. And Stonewall Jackson... stop roller blading.
73137,288,42,229000,Disco Stu,Springfield Park,The south will boogie again!
73138,288,43,235000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Park,This was supposed to be a mock battle! Mock!
73139,288,44,238000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Park,Don't worry. I'm just gonna drain the area around your wound. So cold... so cold...
73141,288,46,249000,Tom Brokaw,Another Part Of Springfield Park,"We are gathered here, this Memorial Day, to once again honor you World War II veterans. Truly, you are the greatest generation."
73142,288,47,259000,Grampa Simpson,Another Part Of Springfield Park,"Keep it comin', Brokaw!"
73143,288,48,262000,Tom Brokaw,Another Part Of Springfield Park,Lauding your legacy is a labor of love.
73144,288,49,265000,Old Jewish Man,Another Part Of Springfield Park,You're damn right it is! You can't thank us enough!
73145,288,50,268000,Grampa Simpson,Another Part Of Springfield Park,Every generation stinks but ours!
73147,288,51,274000,Jasper Beardly,Another Part Of Springfield Park,Uh-oh. Sounds like America's enemies are at it again!
73148,288,52,279000,Grampa Simpson,Another Part Of Springfield Park,Greatest generation to the rescue!
73149,288,53,286000,Grampa Simpson,Another Part Of Springfield Park,"And when I come back, I want a foot rub."
73150,288,54,288000,Tom Brokaw,Another Part Of Springfield Park,"Yes, master."
73152,288,56,292000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Park,"General, I hereby surrender..."
73153,288,57,294000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Park,"Ow! Not the pointed end, you dumbass."

73155,288,59,306000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Park,"Tanks? Oh, this is just too inaccurate."
73156,288,60,310000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Park,"Ah, well, then, you're definitely not going to like my steam-powered super spider!"
73157,288,61,315000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Park,With the stepping and the squishing and the webs made of ny-lon!
73158,288,62,326000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Park,Oh the ny-lon has been released.
73159,288,63,332000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Park,"Now, you just take the kids home. I've got to return this keg."
73160,288,64,335000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Park,Are you sure you can get your deposit back? It's in pretty bad shape.
73161,288,65,339000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Park,Why do you always take the side of local merchants?
73163,288,67,343000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Now Apu, when you gave me this keg it had dents. And here's proof."
73164,288,68,350000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Apu?
73165,288,69,355000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,That giggle is none of my business. Or is it?
73166,288,70,366000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Ooh, Squishee lady! You've had less than eight kids, haven't you? Haven't you?"
73171,288,75,425000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,INDIAN PALACE,Please do the Hindu that you do so well.
73172,288,76,429000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,INDIAN PALACE,"Avert your eyes, eunuch!"
73174,288,78,433000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Bedroom,What's a eunuch?
73175,288,79,435000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Bedroom,"""Unique, unite..."""
73176,288,80,435000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Bedroom,"Homie, what's wrong?"
73177,288,81,440000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Bedroom,"Nothing, nothing. There's nothing eating me up inside."
73178,288,82,445000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Bedroom,"Oh, it must be something big. Hm. Something you did?... no, something you saw."
73179,288,83,456000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Bedroom,Apu is having an affair?!
73181,288,84,458000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Bedroom,"I know, can you believe it? Oh, Manjula's just gonna die!"
73182,288,85,463000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Bedroom,How did you find out?
73183,288,86,464000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Bedroom,"In my role as customer, I saw the whole thing."
73184,288,87,468000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Bedroom,"Oh, this is so awkward. Today's the day we play badminton with them. Oh, I hope no one makes any double entendres."
73186,288,89,478000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oh Apu, you keep scoring while my back is turned."
73188,288,91,483000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Are you sure you're not cheating?
73190,288,93,487000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Now Manjula, do you want me to find another partner?"
73191,288,94,489000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no, no, let's just keep playing. What's the score?"
73192,288,95,494000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dirty love. I mean, thirty love. I mean, anyone for penis? I'll just get the shuttlecock."
73194,288,97,508000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here, guys."
73195,288,98,509000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you play this?
73198,288,101,529000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Marge, why are you crying? You're not in any physical pain. The only kind of pain a man can understand."
73199,288,102,537000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,We have to do something to save that marriage. Maybe I should just tell Manjula. Or you could talk to Apu...
73200,288,103,545000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,He already knows. Let's tell Krusty.
73201,288,104,549000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,What would that accomplish?
73202,288,105,550000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,That guy's hilarious. His reaction would be priceless.
73204,288,107,554000,Homer Simpson,Krusty's Dressing Room,Apu is cheating!
73205,288,108,556000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Dressing Room,That's sad. All those kids.
73206,288,109,560000,Homer Simpson,Krusty's Dressing Room,I think he's building to something.
73208,288,111,564000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"...So anyway, if you take that bottle down, and pass it around--"
73209,288,112,569000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,"I know, I know, there will be forty-seven bottles of beer on the wall. Yes. Homer, you did not bring me here for this. What is it that you want to tell me?"
73210,288,113,576000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, this isn't easy, so I'm just gonna come out and say it."
73212,288,114,579000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Let's say this pepper got married to this salt shaker, and along comes sexy Mrs. Dash..."
73213,288,115,586000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Homie, it's eleven at night. Have you told him yet?"
73214,288,116,589000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,A girl in the bar! What do we do?
73215,288,117,591000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Watch and learn, ya dinks."
73216,288,118,595000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Ma'am.
73217,288,119,596000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,Is there something you want to tell me?
73218,288,120,599000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I saw you and that Squishee Lady -- canoodling like junkyard rabbits!
73219,288,121,604000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,"It's true. It only happened once, but I am so ashamed. I am scum."
73220,288,122,612000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Yes. You are scum.
73221,288,123,616000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,What do you think I should do?
73222,288,124,619000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Tell that woman it's over between you and her.
73223,288,125,622000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,Yes. First thing in the morning. I promise.
73224,288,126,625000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey Marge, uh, you care for a tropical drink?"
73225,288,127,627000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Sure.
73226,288,128,630000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Is that Windex?
73227,288,129,631000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,It's Windelle. I can't afford Windex.
73229,288,131,637000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Okay Apu, be strong."
73230,288,132,640000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Before you measure my syrup levels, I must talk to you."
73231,288,133,644000,Squishee Lady,Kwik-E-Mart,"While you talk, I'm just gonna help myself to some licorice rope."
73232,288,134,648000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"As much as I enjoy your company, and I truly do. I must insist that from this point forward we not-- oh my goodness, what are you doing?!"
73233,288,135,660000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Ah, mahatma- hatma-hatma-hatma-hatma-hatma-hatma..."
73235,288,137,666000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Not tonight. I said not tonight. Wait, something's wrong. Why aren't you pressuring me for sex?"
73236,288,138,676000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Oh, I'm just happy to lie here, appreciating and respecting you."
73237,288,139,680000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Okay buster, what is going on?"
73238,288,140,682000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Nothing! How can you even accuse me of repeated infidelity? I'm so angry, I could just, I could fall asleep. Completely innocent."
73239,288,141,698000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Apu, come here a moment."
73241,288,142,700000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"This better be good because you are interrupting my faithfulness, and-- Oh, boy."
73242,288,143,705000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,I took the tape out of the store's surveillance camera. Look.
73243,288,144,709000,Squishee Lady,Apu's Apartment,"Oh Apu, scratch and win!"
73244,288,145,713000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,Mmm... that's good adultery!
73245,288,146,718000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Oh, I am so sorry, Manjula! I--"
73246,288,147,720000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Get out of my home, Apu."
73248,288,149,732000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apartment Building,"Oh, I always thought karma was baloney, but not anymore."
73249,288,150,737000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,"Mmm, caramel baloney."
73251,288,152,742000,Kirk Van Houten,Apu's Apartment,"Hey, Kirk Van Houten. I live across the way. If you don't like losing at cribbage, stay outta my place."
73252,288,153,749000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,Okay.
73253,288,154,751000,Kirk Van Houten,Apu's Apartment,"No, no! I'll let you win! I'll let you win! God, I... I'm really lonely."
73255,288,156,756000,James Lipton,Simpson Home,"Welcome back to ""Inside the Actor's Studio."""
73256,288,157,759000,James Lipton,Simpson Home,"We've met Rainier Wolfcastle -- actor, novelist, barbecue sauce spokesman. Now can we meet... McBain?"
73257,288,158,766000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Simpson Home,Let me get into character.
73258,288,159,770000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Simpson Home,"Okay, I'm McBain."

73262,288,163,791000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, we want to talk to you about something."
73263,288,164,794000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You might hear from your friends or co-workers that Apu isn't living at home anymore.
73264,288,165,800000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I just wish there was something we could do... Oh. Oh, Homer, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
73265,288,166,808000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You bet I am!
73266,288,167,813000,Dream Homer,Simpson Home,"You can run, but you can't glide!"
73267,288,168,818000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
73268,288,169,821000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tonight, we invite both Manjula and Apu for dinner, but we don't tell them the other one's coming."
73269,288,170,829000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And Krusty. We gotta invite Krusty.
73272,288,171,832000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I keep telling you. Off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man. But if we remind Apu and Manjula of why they fell in love, maybe they can work out their problems."
73273,288,172,843000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah! 'Cause if they don't...
73274,288,173,852000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Manjula, we've got a special guest for you."
73275,288,174,855000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Is it my husband's whore?
73276,288,175,857000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Even better.
73277,288,176,859000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This is going great.
73278,288,177,862000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Look who's here. It's this thing!

73281,288,180,873000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I order you to get back together... or I'll suck your blood. Blah, blah!"
73282,288,181,879000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, stick to the script. Don't be a jerk."

73284,288,183,883000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You're the jerk.
73285,288,184,890000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,I know you have all gone to a lot of trouble to meddle in my affairs. But you cannot change my mind with one night of blasphemy and store-bought tandoori -- or should I say bland-oori!
73287,288,186,903000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Manjula, please. I have known we were meant to be together, ever since my mother forced me to marry you. If you give me another chance, I'll do anything to make it up to you."
73288,288,187,911000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Mm... Come here, you."

73294,288,193,939000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,DIVORCE LAWYER'S OFFICE,I have to warn you. Apu does not have very much money.
73295,288,194,942000,Divorce Lawyer,DIVORCE LAWYER'S OFFICE,"Are you absolutely sure? Because legally, I am allowed to shake him by the ankles and see what falls out. It's established in the case of ""Lawyers versus Justice."" That was a wonderful day for us."
73296,288,195,957000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,DIVORCE LAWYER'S OFFICE,"Now, we have eight children. Will that affect the settlement?"
73297,288,196,965000,Divorce Lawyer,DIVORCE LAWYER'S OFFICE,Perhaps.
