18909,97,112,563000,Homer Simpson,FLANDERS' REC ROOM,"Watch this, Ned. They don't call me Springfield Fats just because I'm morbidly obese."
18910,97,113,569000,Homer Simpson,FLANDERS' REC ROOM,Now you got a law suit on your hands. Just kidding.
18911,97,114,576000,Father,FLANDERS' REC ROOM,"What's wrong, Jeremiah?"
18912,97,115,576000,Jeremiah,FLANDERS' REC ROOM,It's not fair. My brother Joseph has a sin to confess. I wish I had one too.

18931,97,134,649000,Moe Szyslak,Hospital Room,... And truly she was my friend Flicka.
18932,97,135,649000,Moe Szyslak,Hospital Room,"If this gets out, the next words you say will be muffled by your own butt."
18934,97,138,659000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, I'm so glad you're home--"

18940,97,144,682000,Ned Flanders,Flanders' Dining Room,"Homer, I-I'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night I do my charity work."

18946,97,150,717000,Homer Simpson,SHELTER,C'mon! We've been here for fifteen minutes. Can't you see they're sucking the life out of us?
18947,97,151,724000,Ned Flanders,SHELTER,"Homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at Moe's tonight."
18948,97,152,728000,Homer Simpson,SHELTER,"Ah, for some reason, Moe's is always closed on Wednesdays."
18949,97,153,732000,Moe Szyslak,SHELTER,"...And then they realized they were no longer little girls, they were little women."
18950,97,154,737000,Homer Simpson,SHELTER,"Come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. Oh, I can do it faster that that."

18953,97,157,760000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Homey, I'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending too much time with Ned? Your family needs you too."
18954,97,158,767000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh of course you'd say something like that, Marge. You've hated Ned for years. In fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe."
18955,97,159,774000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,That was you!
18956,97,160,774000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Love, Marge. Don't hate. Love."
18957,97,161,778000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"The Flanders are a buncha geeks, man."
18959,97,162,780000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"The Flanderses are not geeks! Okay, Rod and Todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. But we've got to give this thing a chance. I want the two families to take a trip together this weekend."
18960,97,163,794000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"No way, José !"
18961,97,164,794000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Yes way.
18962,97,165,796000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Don't worry, Bart. It seems like every week something odd happens to the Simpsons. My advice is to ride it out, make an occasional smart-alec quip and by next week we'll be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure."
18963,97,166,807000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Ay caramba!
18964,97,167,807000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,That's the spirit.

18981,97,184,856000,Maude Flanders,Campsite,"Oh gosh, I'm sorry, our boys don't eat sugar."
18982,97,185,858000,Marge Simpson,Campsite,"But, why would the Advisory Board give us bad advice?"
18983,97,186,862000,Maude Flanders,Campsite,No sugar!
18985,97,188,862000,Rod Flanders,Campsite,"Thank you, but we're not allowed."

18992,97,194,878000,Homer Simpson,Campsite,"I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the Simpsons and the Flanders. If this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the Flimpsons."

18994,97,196,900000,Ned Flanders,Campsite,"Eh, well sir. My entire family is very touched and--"

19001,97,203,926000,Ned Flanders,Parking Lot,"Oh, I don't know..."

18958,97,228,1024000,Ned Flanders,FLANDERS' DRIVEWAY,"Sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, we have to say things that aren't exactly..."
18991,97,229,1029000,Todd Flanders,FLANDERS' DRIVEWAY,Lies made baby Jesus cry.
19028,97,231,1029000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Neddie, Neddie... Let's get in a quick nine down at the pitch and putt."
19029,97,232,1043000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,Neddie? NEDDDDIEEE!
19031,97,234,1049000,Rod Flanders,Springfield Street,He's gaining on us!

19038,97,241,1072000,Ned Flanders,Roadside,"I told you, officer. I'm not ""hepped up"" on ""goof balls."""
19039,97,242,1081000,Chief Wiggum,Roadside,Yeah right.
19040,97,243,1083000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Roadside,"Ned Flanders, I never would have imagined."
19041,97,244,1092000,Chief Wiggum,Roadside,"High as a kite, everybody! Goofballs--"
19042,97,245,1098000,Chief Wiggum,Roadside,"Where's your messiah now, Flanders?"
19044,97,247,1101000,Ned Flanders,FIRST CHURCH,"I can't do it, Maude. I can't face their accusing eyes."
19045,97,248,1111000,Maude Flanders,FIRST CHURCH,"Oh don't worry, Ned, this is a house of love and forgiveness."
19046,97,249,1117000,Voice #1,FIRST CHURCH,"There he is, Ned Flanders."
19047,97,250,1117000,Voice #2,FIRST CHURCH,The fallen one.
19048,97,251,1120000,Voice #3,FIRST CHURCH,The evil one.
19049,97,252,1120000,Voice #4,FIRST CHURCH,"I'll bet he's the one who wrote ""Homer"" all over the bathroom."
19050,97,253,1123000,Ned Flanders,FIRST CHURCH,I think we should leave.
19051,97,254,1125000,Homer Simpson,FIRST CHURCH,"Hey Flanders, over here. I got us some kick-ass seats."
19052,97,255,1129000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,FIRST CHURCH,"Before I get started on today's sermon entitled , ""What Ned Did,"" I'd like to publicly congratulate Homer Simpson on his recent charity work."
19053,97,256,1147000,Homer Simpson,FIRST CHURCH,I live to give.
19054,97,257,1152000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,FIRST CHURCH,"That's beautiful. We appreciate the kisses. Now, let us bow our heads in a silent prayer of thanksgiving."
19055,97,258,1164000,Ned Flanders,FIRST CHURCH,Stop it! Breathe through your damn mouth!
19056,97,259,1179000,Ned Flanders,FIRST CHURCH,"Oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! He's annoying. He's very, very annoying!"
19057,97,260,1187000,Helen Lovejoy,FIRST CHURCH,Well Ned Flanders is just jealous!
19058,97,261,1189000,Moe Szyslak,FIRST CHURCH,"Aw, the guy's hepped up on ""goof balls!"""
19059,97,262,1191000,Grampa Simpson,FIRST CHURCH,"Let's sacrifice him to our god! C'mon, we did it all the time in the thirties."
19061,97,264,1198000,Homer Simpson,FIRST CHURCH,"Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that! He's a wonderful, kind, caring man. Maybe even more so than me. There have been times when I've lost patience with him, even lashed out at him. But this man has turned every cheek on his body. If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for heaven. We'd already be there."
19062,97,265,1234000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,FIRST CHURCH,Um... Well I think we all owe Ned a heartfelt apology. We were wrong to doubt him.
19063,97,266,1246000,Lenny Leonard,FIRST CHURCH,"Hey, that guy's right!"

19069,97,272,1273000,Ned Flanders,FIRST CHURCH,Just try and stop me.
19070,97,273,1275000,Bart Simpson,FIRST CHURCH,"I don't get it, Lis. You said everything would be back to normal, but Homer and Flanders are still friends."
19071,97,274,1281000,Lisa Simpson,FIRST CHURCH,Yeah. Maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.
19073,97,276,1289000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Guess what, everyone?! My great uncle Boris died and left us his old country house. There's only one catch they say - it's haunted. But I'm sure we can prove him wrong by spending the weekend there."
19074,97,277,1300000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Hi-diddly ho, neighbor."
19075,97,278,1300000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Get lost, Flanders."
