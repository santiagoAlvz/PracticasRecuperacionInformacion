146837,565,15,162000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,We've been singing this song like it only belonged to us! When every city in America has had its lips on it! Even Des Moines...
146838,565,16,170000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Wait a minute. This song was supposedly written by... former Mayor Moleman!
146840,565,17,178000,Hans Moleman,Springfield Town Hall,I didn't write it! I bought it from a salesman who was selling it to half the towns in America. I didn't think you'd find out... because I never thought any of us would ever go anywhere.

146864,565,41,254000,Bart Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Well, don't be so surprised, I did write that ""Lisa, It's Your Birthday"" song."
146865,565,42,257000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Yeah, with that mental patient who thought he was Michael Jackson."
146866,565,43,260000,Bart Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Whoa. Thinking back, I'm kinda surprised Mom and Dad let a crazy man spend all night in my bedroom."

146928,565,105,531000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry but I can't. I'm tired of you saying planes have gotten smaller, and two Presidents were fatter than you, and..."

146965,565,141,658000,ALBERT,Meeting Room,No one can make me feel bad about who I am because this is who I am.
146966,565,142,664000,Homer Simpson,Meeting Room,"Ditto. You know I've always wanted to blindly follow somebody, and I think you just might be the guy."
146968,565,144,672000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, kids! Tonight was a turning point in my life."
146969,565,145,676000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well that's great, Homie. Just let me finish uploading this photo."
146970,565,146,680000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Marge! You have to listen! That place you sent me to changed my life!"
146971,565,147,686000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thank you, Lord. And I'll give up online scrapbooking like I promised."
146972,565,148,692000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"They taught me that I don't need to lose weight, I should just be proud of what I am."

146977,565,155,713000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's worse than what I thought!
146978,565,156,715000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you're my wife of ten years and I love you. But I must observe the teachings of this man I just met tonight. Now, the first thing I have to do is make amends... with the bathroom scale."
146979,565,157,728000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm so sorry I threw you across the room and called you a liar. When you told me I was two hundred and sixty pounds, you were just encouraging me. It was a poem you were writing about my potential. I'm gonna start celebrating my size and I need you with me as a partner. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to talk to the broken porch swing."

146994,565,172,833000,ALBERT,Springfield Street,Your store is forcing unattainable body images on our young people. I say end the thinsanity!
146995,565,173,841000,Julio,Springfield Street,"You, my friend, are wrong. Every girl should look like a sexy praying mantis from Milan whose hips are narrower than an Italian parliamentary majority. Whoo!"
146996,565,174,855000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Street,"Okay people, show's over. Nothing to eat here. Now move along... if you can. If not, we're gonna have to take you in."
