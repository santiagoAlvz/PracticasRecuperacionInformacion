56487,232,212,951000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Oh, Lord... you saved me. I guess you had some higher purpose in mind."
56488,232,213,957000,Ron Howard,Street,"Hey, look out!"
56489,232,214,958000,Ron Howard,Street,"Oh, dumbass, trying to get yourself killed?"
56490,232,215,961000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Not anymore, Ron. Now, I'm looking for something to dedicate my life to. Something noble, but easy."
56491,232,216,967000,Boy In Car,Street,"Daddy, stop talking to that bum."
56492,232,217,970000,Ron Howard,Street,"Look, I'd love to help you out, Homer, but I'm taking my kids to the zoo."
56493,232,218,973000,Homer Simpson,Street,That's great. Even big stars take their kids to the zoo.
56494,232,219,978000,Ron Howard,Street,"Well, it's a different zoo, containing animals you've never heard of."
56495,232,220,982000,Girl In Car,Street,"Daddy, we're missing the fantasti-potamus. She only sings twice a day!"
56496,232,221,987000,Homer Simpson,Street,That's it! Kids are the answer! I'll dedicate my life to my children.
56497,232,222,993000,Ron Howard,Street,"Really? You have children? Oh, well look, here's some money."
56498,232,223,997000,Homer Simpson,Street,No. I don't want your pity or your money.
56499,232,224,1002000,Ron Howard,Street,"Usually when you say that, you give the money back."
56500,232,225,1005000,Homer Simpson,Street,I do what now?
56501,232,226,1006000,Ron Howard,Street,Yoink!
56503,232,228,1007000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Listen, boy... I was wondering if you could use a little more fatherly attention."
56504,232,229,1012000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"No need, Dad. Over the years I've learned to find father figures wherever I can... construction workers, the internet... and Nelson, here."
56505,232,230,1019000,Nelson Muntz,Bart's Bedroom,"If you tie a string around your finger real tight, you can make it turn purple."
56506,232,231,1024000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I can see I'm not needed here.
56508,232,233,1028000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Lisa, honey, do you need any help with your homework?"
56509,232,234,1031000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Sure! You can help me find three words where ""y"" is the vowel."
56511,232,236,1039000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've been so blind. I'll lavish my attention on Maggie, the forgotten Simpson."
56512,232,237,1044000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mag-gie. It's me, Dad-dy!"
56513,232,238,1048000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Daddy's gonna spend a lot more time with you. Yes he is. Yes he is.
56515,232,240,1060000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Where's Mag-gie? Where's Mag-gie? Hey, where is she?"
56516,232,241,1065000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,There you are.
56517,232,242,1069000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hi Maggie! I'm Homie-Womie, the Teletubby. And I'm all man, in case you've heard otherwise. Let's see what's on Tummy-vision!"
56518,232,243,1078000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ow! Ow, that hurts! Owww! Ohhh!"
56520,232,245,1082000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Whee! Whee! Don't be scared, Maggie. Daddy won't drop you. Whee!"
56521,232,246,1100000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"You're a tough cookie, Maggie, but I'm gonna win you over. Just like I did with Lisa."
56522,232,247,1105000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Hi, honey!"
56524,232,249,1110000,Instructor,Springfield YMCA,"Okay, Dads. This is where your child's trust in you really pays off."
56527,232,252,1118000,Homer Simpson,Springfield YMCA,"C'mon, Maggie. You can trust me."
56528,232,253,1120000,Homer Simpson,Springfield YMCA,Come to Daddy! Come to Daddy!
56531,232,256,1129000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"I'm sorry, Maggie. I never realized things between us had gotten this bad."
56532,232,257,1137000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,What are you pointing at? The ocean?
56533,232,258,1142000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,That's a great idea. We'll swim in the ocean.
56535,232,260,1147000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"See, Maggie. The ocean is just like a bathtub. Except instead of rubber ducks, it has barracudas and moray eels."
56536,232,261,1160000,Homer Simpson,Beach,Nothing to worry about. Just a little wave.
56537,232,262,1162000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"And this riptide is certainly nothing Daddy can't struggle against. Help! Help! Somebody, help!"
56538,232,263,1170000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"Oh, current... too strong... I know! If I sink to the bottom I can run to the shore."
56539,232,264,1188000,Homer Simpson,Beach,Maggie! Call Aquaman!
56542,232,267,1214000,Homer Simpson,Ocean,"Maggie, you're swimming! You swam out to save me."
56543,232,268,1221000,Homer Simpson,Ocean,"Oh, you do love me!"
56545,232,270,1229000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Beach,"Mr. Simpson, you're going to be fine. Although you do seem to have swallowed a number of shark eggs."
56546,232,271,1234000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"Actually, that was before I went in the ocean."
56547,232,272,1237000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Beach,"Well, I don't want to pry into your personal life..."
56548,232,273,1239000,Homer Simpson,Beach,Then don't.
56549,232,274,1240000,Marge Simpson,Beach,"Doctor, how could a little baby save a full-grown man from drowning?"
56550,232,275,1246000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Beach,"It's quite simple -- When a parent's life is in danger, a child can summon superhuman strength."
56551,232,276,1251000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"Well, all I care about is that my little girl loves me. And we're gonna spend a lot more time together from now on."
56553,232,278,1271000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Good girl, Maggie. You knocked down all the pins. But you stepped over the line just a little bit, so I'll have to give you a five."
56554,232,279,1278000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,And that gives you a final score of... two ninety-five.
56555,232,280,1284000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Looks like Daddy won, but two ninety-five is awfully good for a baby."
56557,232,282,1290000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Yes it is. It's very good and you're a good little baby. Yes you are.
