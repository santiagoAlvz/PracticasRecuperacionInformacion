39059,173,80,552000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"A credit card? Oh, I knew you were up to no good."
39060,173,81,556000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, so I committed a little mail fraud. Haven't I been punished enough?"

39074,173,95,632000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Um, I took him to a kennel... two towns over. Just 'til the new dog gets settled."
39075,173,96,637000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we wrecked the first dog. We've got to treat this one right. Bart, why don't you take Laddie for another walk."

39094,173,114,710000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Dog Park,Santa's Little Helper? I guess I was the only one who loved him.
39095,173,115,714000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Dog Park,"You got that right. Remember the time he ate my goldfish and you lied to me and said I never had any goldfish? But why'd I have the bowl, Bart? Why did I have the bowl?"
39096,173,116,725000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Dog Park,"Yeah, he was a great dog."
39098,173,118,733000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Santa's Little Helper, I was crazy to give you up for another dog. What have I done to you?"
39099,173,119,742000,Heiress,Simpson Home,"Captain, can't we go any faster? I greatly fear we shan't be in Wimbledon by noonfall."
39100,173,120,747000,Captain,Simpson Home,"No worries, madam."
39101,173,121,749000,Captain,Simpson Home,"Lumley, shovel on more dogs, won't you?"

39106,173,126,765000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"But still... you're gone. Oh, where are you, boy?"
39107,173,127,777000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Time for a walk."" Again? We gotta find out where he's keeping these."
39108,173,128,782000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'd take him, but those cards are non-transferable."
39110,173,130,791000,Voice,Springfield,Help! Help!
39111,173,131,797000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Now what?! C'mon, I wanna go home."
39113,173,133,803000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"So Laddie, thank you for your heroic rescue, and Baby Gerald, we can't help but wonder what mischief you'll get into next."
39114,173,134,815000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Now can we go home?
39115,173,135,817000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Hall,"Laddie saved the day, Simpson. Boy, we sure could use a dog like that on the force."
39116,173,136,823000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Why don't you guys take him. I thought he was the right dog for me, but I guess I made a mistake."
39117,173,137,828000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Hall,"Really? No foolin'? Aw, gee, thanks, mister. We'll take real good care of him and we'll play with him every day. Honest!"
39119,173,139,840000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Maggie, you got oatmeal all over. Homer, would you clean her off?"
39120,173,140,844000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Can do.
39121,173,141,847000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Laddie! C'mere, boy! Who want to lick a messy baby?"
39122,173,142,854000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Laddie?
39123,173,143,855000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, Dad? Laddie's not coming. I gave him away."
39124,173,144,860000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"What's the matter, Bart? Weren't you happy with him?"
39125,173,145,862000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No. He just wasn't the right dog for me. I'm sure he'll be happy as a police dog.
39126,173,146,867000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,He better know how to keep his mouth shut.
39127,173,147,869000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if that's what you think is best, let's just go down to the kennel and get Santa's Little Helper back."
39128,173,148,875000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"We can't. He's not in a kennel. I gave him away, too, and I don't know where he is."
39129,173,149,883000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You gave both dogs away?! You know how I feel about giving!
39130,173,150,887000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, I know it's wrong. I messed everything up and now I don't have any dogs at all."
39131,173,151,892000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"There, there, shut up, boy. We'll just get you a new dog."
39132,173,152,897000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't want a new dog. I want Santa's Little Helper.
39133,173,153,901000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!"
39134,173,154,917000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're right. I'll do it.
39136,173,155,921000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Rats. I almost had him eating dog food.
39137,173,156,926000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm going to get the dog back.
39138,173,157,928000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The bad dog or the good dog?

39144,173,163,942000,Tommy,Repo Depot,"Hey, next time pay your bills."
39145,173,164,944000,Moe Szyslak,Repo Depot,But I don't want to!
39146,173,165,946000,Bart Simpson,Repo Depot,"Excuse me, sir. Did you repossess this dog from a guy named Santos L. Halper?"
39147,173,166,950000,Tommy,Repo Depot,"Hmm... yeah, yeah, I remember this mutt. We, uh, sold him to some guy wearing a dress."
39148,173,167,957000,Patty Bouvier,Repo Depot,"No, I didn't buy your dog. Now I gotta go keep an eye on Selma -- she thinks she swallowed a Band-Aid."
39150,173,169,967000,Groundskeeper Willie,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,"Yeah, I bought yer mutt. And I ate him."
39152,173,171,972000,Groundskeeper Willie,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,"Yeah, I ate his little face. I ate his guts. And I ate the way he's always barking... so I gave him to the church."
39153,173,172,982000,Bart Simpson,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,"Oh, I see. You hate him, so you gave him to the church."
39154,173,173,986000,Groundskeeper Willie,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,Aye. I also ate the mess he left on me rug. You heard me.
39157,173,176,993000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Mmm, yes, I remember ""Satan's Little Helper"" -- littering the rectory with his dirt, biting me in the apse..."

39159,173,178,1002000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,That's him all right. I'll be happy to take him off your hands.
39160,173,179,1005000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible, Bart. He's no longer among us."
39161,173,180,1009000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,You didn't crucify him?
39162,173,181,1014000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"No, he's safely with one of our parishioners. I'll give you his address if you like."
39163,173,182,1019000,Agnes Skinner,First Church of Springfield,"And then buy something, or get out. Angel."
39165,173,184,1029000,Bart Simpson,MODEST SPRINGFIELD HOUSE,"Hey, it's him! It's Santa's Little Helper!"
