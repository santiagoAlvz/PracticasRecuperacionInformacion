76669,300,1,95000,Kent Brockman,FANCY LIVING ROOM,"I'm here with actor Rainier Wolfcastle, who, surprisingly, has filed for bankruptcy. Rainier, what went wrong?"
76670,300,2,102000,Rainier Wolfcastle,FANCY LIVING ROOM,"Three divorces in three months. What can I say, Kent? I'm a romantic."
76672,300,4,107000,Kent Brockman,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,But this personal tragedy translates into a good old fashioned bankruptcy sale!
76673,300,5,112000,Rainier Wolfcastle,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,Yeah! Everything must go. Even the painting of my Nana.
76674,300,6,117000,Rainier Wolfcastle,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,"This was done on her wedding day. Or should I say ""deading day."""
76675,300,7,123000,Homer Simpson,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,How the mighty have fallen... into my price range. I wanna go there!
76613,300,8,128000,Lisa Simpson,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,"Dad, we are there."
76676,300,9,129000,Homer Simpson,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,Woo hoo!
76677,300,10,133000,Ned Flanders,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,"Now Rainier, I really don't think it's right to sell these Playdude centerfolds."
76678,300,11,139000,Moe Szyslak,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,"Zip it, Holy Joe."
76679,300,12,141000,Woman,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,Are you taking us to another mansion?
76680,300,13,144000,Moe Szyslak,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,"Uh, yeah. Miss September, I think you're gonna have to get in the trunk."
76682,300,15,150000,Bart Simpson,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,Whoa! A sword-cane!
76683,300,16,153000,Rainier Wolfcastle,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,Everything here is sword.
76684,300,17,155000,Rainier Wolfcastle,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,"Sword baseball bat, sword rifle, sword pineapple, sword sword sharpener, sword pie-- Hey what happened to the sword pie?"
76685,300,18,165000,Homer Simpson,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,What do I do now?
76686,300,19,167000,Lenny Leonard,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,"Hey look, a cyborg hand. This could really come in useful."
76687,300,20,173000,Carl Carlson,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,"Well, well, look who's gone Hollywood."
76689,300,22,178000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Wolfcastle's Bedroom,Do you need some assistance picking over the tattered remains of my life?
76690,300,23,182000,Homer Simpson,Wolfcastle's Bedroom,"No, I'm good."
76691,300,24,184000,Homer Simpson,Wolfcastle's Bedroom,"Hey, your early porno movies! Are any of these hetero?"
76692,300,25,188000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Wolfcastle's Bedroom,What's there is there.
76693,300,26,190000,Homer Simpson,Wolfcastle's Bedroom,Got any junk that will go up in value after you die?
76694,300,27,193000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Wolfcastle's Bedroom,Right this way.
76695,300,28,196000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Wolfcastle's Bedroom,My first weight set.
76696,300,29,199000,Homer Simpson,Wolfcastle's Bedroom,The weights that changed you from a Bavarian creme puff to a mass of twitchy muscles?
76697,300,30,206000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Wolfcastle's Bedroom,They know you are talking about them.
76698,300,31,208000,Homer Simpson,Wolfcastle's Bedroom,I'll take it.
76699,300,32,210000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Wolfcastle's Bedroom,Who's up for coconut oil?
76701,300,34,216000,Bart Simpson,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,There is no way all this junk is gonna fit in that car.
76702,300,35,219000,Homer Simpson,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,"No, no worries. This is what all those hours of playing Tetris were for."
76703,300,36,243000,Homer Simpson,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,Perfect!
76704,300,37,244000,Marge Simpson,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,But there's no room for you.
76706,300,39,248000,Homer Simpson,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,Do you think you could give me a lift home?
76709,300,40,250000,Rainier Wolfcastle,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,"Sure, I'll carry you in this giant Snuggli. I used it to carry Rob Schneider in the movie ""My Baby Is An Ugly Man."""
76710,300,41,261000,Homer Simpson,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,Your heartbeat is so soothing.
76711,300,42,265000,Rainier Wolfcastle,WOLFCASTLE'S MANSION,"Shh. Time for sleep, little fatso."
76713,300,44,272000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Ugh. Ew, Mom, I think Maggie fudged her Huggies."
76714,300,45,277000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Bart, don't say it like that. You'll hurt her feelings-- Jeez Louise! How did you turn cinnamon applesauce into that?"
76715,300,46,289000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Don't try to pin this on me, sister."
76716,300,47,293000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Summary emergency!
76718,300,49,297000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hello, Mrs. Homer!"
76719,300,50,298000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Apu, where's your bathroom?"
76720,300,51,300000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,The bathroom is not for customers. Please use the crack house across the street.
76721,300,52,308000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Ugh, that is the most pungent thing I have ever smelled, and I am from India! All right, all right, but speak of this to no one!"
76722,300,53,319000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Don't worry, that sign is just a ruse -- like all ""High Voltage"" signs."
76723,300,54,328000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,There's a happy baby. Aren't you? Aren't you?
76725,300,56,333000,Scary Voice,Kwik-E-Mart,Gimme your purse!
76726,300,57,335000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!
76727,300,58,337000,SCARY MAN,Kwik-E-Mart,Shut up!
76728,300,59,339000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,That's not a purse. It's a diaper bag.
76729,300,60,341000,SCARY MAN,Kwik-E-Mart,What?
76730,300,61,342000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"It looks like a purse, that's why I bought it, but it's really a--"
76731,300,62,344000,SCARY MAN,Kwik-E-Mart,Shut up!
76733,300,64,347000,SCARY MAN,Kwik-E-Mart,Fine. I'll just take this!
76734,300,65,362000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Come on, Mom, let's go."
76735,300,66,364000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Mom, are you okay?"
76737,300,68,371000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's all my fault my wife got mugged.
76738,300,69,373000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"There you have it, boys. Case closed."
76739,300,70,375000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, this really made me feel vulnerable. I want to know how soon you think you'll catch this guy."
76740,300,71,380000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Marge. I swear to you I'll put my best man on it."
76707,300,73,386000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Oh boy, is this awkward."
76742,300,74,389000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait Marge, I don't want you to leave the house without this."
76743,300,75,393000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Emergency whistle, pepper spray and this map of the most vulnerable parts of a man's body."
76744,300,76,398000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why is it Ned Flanders?
76745,300,77,399000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, like I'm gonna kick Chief Wiggum in the groin."
76747,300,79,405000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Okay Marge, you can do this. You've done it a thousand times before."
76748,300,80,410000,Ralph Wiggum,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hi, Mrs. Simpson!"
76751,300,83,413000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Oh no! I pepper sprayed Ralph!
76752,300,84,415000,Ralph Wiggum,Kwik-E-Mart,Even my boogers are spicy!
76753,300,85,419000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Sorry!
76754,300,86,422000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Let's go home. There's nothing dangerous there except for the electrical wiring.
76756,300,88,430000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, you didn't get the milk."
76757,300,89,432000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And you parked on top of the mailman.
76758,300,90,434000,Mailman,Simpson Home,It's okay. All part of the job. Can you believe I get paid to wear short pants?
76759,300,91,439000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'll come right out and help you."
76760,300,92,449000,Mugger,Simpson Home,I gave your necklace to my cheap girlfriend.
76761,300,93,452000,Cheap Girlfriend,Simpson Home,I just throw it in a drawer at night.
76762,300,94,458000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No! It'll tangle!
76763,300,95,464000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, I can't go outside. I'll call for help."
76764,300,96,468000,Mailman,Simpson Home,"No hurry, I've got plenty to read. Ooh, Twilight Zone Magazine."
76765,300,97,473000,Mailman,Simpson Home,"Oh no, my glasses are broken!"
76766,300,98,481000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"Marge, I'm afraid you've developed agoraphobia -- a fear of leaving the home. I recommend watching this Lifetime Channel movie."
76767,300,99,488000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"It's called ""The Woman Who Died in Her Home."""
76768,300,100,493000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my God. Isn't there anything I can do?"
76769,300,101,497000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"Marge, I suggest you slowly desensitize yourself to the fear of going outside. Create controlled situations where you can leave the house without pain or panic."
76770,300,102,505000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What if I can't feel comfortable outside again?
76771,300,103,508000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,Then I hope you like throwing dinner parties.
76772,300,104,510000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I do!
76773,300,105,512000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,No one wants to eat dinner at a crazy lady's house! Get real!
76774,300,106,515000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Mom. This first time we'll only take a few steps outside."
76775,300,107,519000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, just to the mailbox and back."
76776,300,108,527000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now Dr. Hibbert said to use a number from one to ten to describe how anxious you are.
76777,300,109,533000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Two, three, two..."
76778,300,110,537000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't worry. Everything is fine. What the hell is that?
76779,300,111,539000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Eight...
76780,300,112,540000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, it's just a bug."
76781,300,113,540000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Two...
76782,300,114,543000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's not just a bug, it's the queen of something!"
76783,300,115,545000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ten, ten, ten, ten..."
76784,300,116,548000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, I'll set fire to the hive."
76785,300,117,552000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Twelve... fifteen... seven hundred and three...
76786,300,118,556000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Run!
76787,300,119,561000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my goodness, it looks just like the Kwik-E-Mart!"
76788,300,120,564000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yep, but you're still safe at home. After a few practice trips here, the real Kwik-E-Mart will be a piece of cake. Now, Bart will play Apu..."
76789,300,121,572000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Um hm.
76790,300,122,573000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm a magazine rack.
76791,300,123,575000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, I'm the first to admit it. I don't write good parts for women."
76792,300,124,579000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I'm a robber!
76794,300,126,584000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,All this does is shoot bubbles.
76795,300,127,587000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Aggh! Silly String!
76796,300,128,589000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, I'll go find your mother."
76797,300,129,591000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, we're canceling the rest of the play."
76798,300,130,592000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,What play? What the hell are you talking about?
76800,300,132,598000,Homer Simpson,Hallway,Marge?
76801,300,133,599000,Marge Simpson,Hallway,I'm gonna sleep down here tonight.
76803,300,135,605000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Listen kids, your Mom is going to be living in the basement. But with our love, she'll get better soon."
76804,300,136,611000,Bart Simpson,LIVING ROOM,What if she doesn't?
76805,300,137,612000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,Then we'll have to smoke her out.
76808,300,139,615000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"And may the peace of God be with you, amen."
76809,300,140,620000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Amen. Over.
76810,300,141,622000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Breaker, breaker. Bartman to shut-in. The big guy's asleep. Please advise. Over."
76811,300,142,626000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Whack him with the hymnal. Over.
76812,300,143,628000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I roger that big time.
76814,300,145,630000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why you little... oh, hi Jesus. I was just..."
76815,300,146,638000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow honey, eating dinner downstairs is great! Isn't it, kids?"
76816,300,147,642000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The air hockey table makes passing the carrots a breeze.
76817,300,148,649000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, eat your spinach."
76818,300,149,651000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No way.
76819,300,150,652000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes way!
76820,300,151,656000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Stop it, please! I'm trying to eat."
76821,300,152,659000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,And all those feet going by the window are really creeping me out.
76822,300,153,662000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's like we're at Cheers. I loved that show. Because you always knew it was only a half hour till ""Wings."" Then you could just sleep till Monday."
76823,300,154,671000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"'Bye, Mom!"
76824,300,155,673000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm sending the cat up with your lunches.
76827,300,158,686000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Goodbye kids.
76828,300,159,688000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"What to do now. Too crazy to go outside, not crazy enough to have imaginary friends."
76829,300,160,695000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why did Homer buy those? No one's ever gonna use 'em.
76831,300,162,703000,Tv Host,Simpson Home,Three and four...and five eggs.
76832,300,163,708000,Tv Host,Simpson Home,"Ladies, feel that burn. If you don't, the oven's not on."
76833,300,164,713000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Ten... E-le-ven... TWELVE!
76834,300,165,721000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I can bench twice as much as when I started! And look at my abs!
76835,300,166,728000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom!
76836,300,167,729000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow-wooh-wooh-wooh! I'm married to Joey Heatherton.
76837,300,168,735000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, you know what would zest up this hollandaise? A lemon!"
76838,300,169,740000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, do you plan to get in shape?"
76839,300,170,741000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, actually, I'm going to eat twice as much."
76840,300,171,743000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Excellent.
76807,300,172,744000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, guys? Mom just left the basement!"
76708,300,174,751000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,She's in the back yard!
76842,300,176,755000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,I got all the way out to the tree before I realized I'd left the house.
76843,300,177,762000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,I'm stronger than I've ever been! I don't have to go back inside. I'm not afraid!
76844,300,178,769000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Alright Mom! / Yay, Mom! / Woo hoo!"
76845,300,179,771000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,I'm not afraid!
76847,300,181,774000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Ned, I'm not afraid!"
76848,300,182,777000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Street,"Well, aren't you a super-duper recouper."
76849,300,183,779000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,Grampa! I'm not afraid!
76850,300,184,783000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Street,Then you're not paying close enough attention!
76851,300,185,786000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,You!
76852,300,186,788000,SCARY MAN,Springfield Street,Whatcha been up to? Livin' in fear?
76853,300,187,791000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,Not any more!
76854,300,188,806000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,You've just been Marge-inalized!
76855,300,189,814000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Marge, that was amazing! It's like I'm married to Shaft."
76856,300,190,818000,Lou,Springfield Street,"Hey Chief, I think that's the guy who mugged her."
76857,300,191,821000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Street,"Yep, looks like she caught her own criminal. Unlike the rest of you lazybones."
76858,300,192,826000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Street,"You're not gonna find those criminals looking at your feet, people."
76861,300,195,833000,Female Voice,MUSCLE BEACH,Marge Simpson!
76862,300,196,851000,Female Voice,MUSCLE BEACH,It's Ruth. Ruth Powers.
76863,300,197,854000,Marge Simpson,MUSCLE BEACH,"Ruth Powers, my old neighbor? Oh, my goodness, look at you!"
76864,300,198,859000,Ruth Powers,MUSCLE BEACH,I got this body in prison. I was Miss Mexican Mafia three years in a row.
76865,300,199,863000,Marge Simpson,MUSCLE BEACH,Wow!
76866,300,200,866000,Ruth Powers,MUSCLE BEACH,"You know, another four inches on your neck and you'd look pretty hot. Ever thought of competing?"
76867,300,201,872000,Marge Simpson,MUSCLE BEACH,I don't have those kind of muscles.
76868,300,202,874000,Ruth Powers,MUSCLE BEACH,Well you could. If you used these.
76869,300,203,875000,Marge Simpson,MUSCLE BEACH,Steroids!?
76870,300,204,877000,Marge Simpson,MUSCLE BEACH,I can't take drugs -- I have so many anti-drug bumper stickers. I'd be making a liar out of my tailgate.
76871,300,205,885000,Ruth Powers,MUSCLE BEACH,"Steroids aren't drugs. They occur naturally in the body, like sweat, or tumors."
76872,300,206,891000,Marge Simpson,MUSCLE BEACH,But aren't there side effects?
76873,300,207,892000,Ruth Powers,MUSCLE BEACH,Yes. Their main side-effect is greatness. But if you'd rather be weak and helpless...
76874,300,208,899000,Marge Simpson,MUSCLE BEACH,"No, no!"
76875,300,209,904000,Marge Simpson,MUSCLE BEACH,I feel good... with no repercussions!
76877,300,211,910000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"A little of this and a little of that. Bulkenoids for my lats, mesomax for my delts, and estrogen blockers for that minty taste."
