139411,536,6,180000,Dewey Largo,Springfield Elementary School,I'm being chased by sports!
139413,536,8,182000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"It's called ""precipitation,"" because it never fails to precipitate unruly behavior."
139414,536,9,188000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,...doomed to get only single pneumonia.
139416,536,11,201000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,A spitwad?
139417,536,12,203000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, at least I'm getting some attention."
139418,536,13,207000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,And the best part is I'm bombarding her with her own homework.
139420,536,15,223000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Begone!
139422,536,17,228000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, you're never alone surrounded by ""The Autobiography of Charles Manson."""
139424,536,19,243000,Isabel Gutierrez,Springfield Elementary School,"Hi. New kid, second grade, don't you love the rain?"
139425,536,20,246000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"New kid? Um, have you made any friends?"
139426,536,21,249000,Isabel Gutierrez,Springfield Elementary School,"Just Charlotte, Emily and Anne."
139427,536,22,251000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That's a reference to the Brontë sisters!
139428,536,23,254000,Isabel Gutierrez,Springfield Elementary School,You got my reference to the Brontë sisters!
139429,536,24,256000,Isabel Gutierrez,Springfield Elementary School,"Nice to meet you, Lisa Simpson."
139430,536,25,258000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,How do you know my name?
139431,536,26,260000,Isabel Gutierrez,Springfield Elementary School,I deciphered the anagrams on your notebook.
139432,536,27,262000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Oh.
139433,536,28,263000,Isabel Gutierrez,Springfield Elementary School,Be Lisa?
139434,536,29,268000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Isabel!
139437,536,32,273000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, spaghetti."
139438,536,33,279000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Y'ello! Lisa, you got a call from someone named Isabel."
139440,536,35,285000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"May I ask what this is regarding? Oooh, a budding new friendship? Oooh! Boy, how come you can't get a new friend?"
139441,536,36,292000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What's wrong with the one I got?
139442,536,37,294000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"I finally got that M&M out of my inner ear. I remembered correctly, it was a green one!"
148643,536,38,300000,Homer's Thoughts,Simpson Home,Don't eat it. It's been in his ear. Don't eat it. It's been in his ear.
148644,536,39,307000,Homer's Thoughts,Simpson Home,Don't eat it. It's been in the boy's ear and the dog's mouth. Don't eat it.
139443,536,40,313000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, for God's sake."
139445,536,42,316000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,And don't you hate being the middle child?
139447,536,43,318000,Isabel Gutierrez,Lisa's Bedroom,"Yeah, in the car, I always have to sit on the hump. It makes reading impossible."
139448,536,44,323000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Lisa, your food's getting cold!"
139449,536,45,326000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"It's raw veggies, they're supposed to be cold!"
139450,536,46,328000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Well, someone who loves you put melted butter on them!"
139452,536,48,331000,Marge Simpson,Dining Room,"Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom. I'll tell Lisa you dropped by."
139454,536,50,335000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,I'd better go.
139455,536,51,336000,Isabel Gutierrez,Lisa's Bedroom,"Okay, but one more thing: I noticed we're both doing presentations on Franklin Roosevelt at school."
139456,536,52,336000,Isabel Gutierrez,Lisa's Bedroom,Why don't we do them together?
139457,536,53,342000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Oh my God. Someone wants to be my partner. Can't screw this up.
139459,536,55,348000,Isabel Gutierrez,Isabel's Bedroom,"Downloading, downloading, downloading, downloading, downloading..."
139460,536,56,354000,Isabel Gutierrez,Isabel's Bedroom,Woo-hoo!
139463,536,59,358000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,Franklin Roosevelt bravely instituted a series of reforms called the New Deal...
139464,536,60,363000,Isabel Gutierrez,Lisa's Classroom,...which ran totally counter to America's tradition of limited government. P.S.: It was also unconstitutional.
139466,536,62,371000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,F.D.R.'s steadfast leadership also helped America win World War Two...
139467,536,63,376000,Isabel Gutierrez,Lisa's Classroom,"...until the weak-kneed Democrats sold us out at Yalta. If you haven't guessed, Lisa -- I'm a Republican."
139468,536,64,382000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,A Lincoln Republican?
139469,536,65,383000,Isabel Gutierrez,Lisa's Classroom,Not really.
139470,536,66,384000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,A Reagan Republican?

139472,536,68,386000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,First President Bush?
139473,536,69,387000,Isabel Gutierrez,Lisa's Classroom,Gettin' there.
139474,536,70,387000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,"Oh, dear God."
139477,536,73,393000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,"I must say, Lisa, it was amusing to see you thoroughly de-high-horsed."
139478,536,74,398000,Lisa Simpson,Auditorium,That isn't a word.
139479,536,75,400000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,"Oooh, back on the saddle she climbs."
139480,536,76,402000,Lisa Simpson,Auditorium,"I just can't believe someone like you would be a Republican. I mean, isn't your last name Gutiérrez?"
139481,536,77,408000,Isabel Gutierrez,Auditorium,Just what exactly are you saying?
139482,536,78,410000,Lisa Simpson,Auditorium,"I'm just saying that people of your heritage... which could be any one of many heritages, I'm not pigeonholing... is it a Catholic thing?"
139483,536,79,419000,Isabel Gutierrez,Auditorium,I'm a non-observant Jew from Argentina.
139484,536,80,421000,Bart Simpson,Auditorium,Ay carumba!
139485,536,81,422000,Isabel Gutierrez,Auditorium,Do you even know what that means?
139486,536,82,424000,Bart Simpson,Auditorium,"Um... there's, there's a carumba in my eye?"
139487,536,83,426000,Isabel Gutierrez,Auditorium,"It's the Spanish version of ""hot damn."""
139488,536,84,426000,Bart Simpson,Auditorium,Ay carumba!
139491,536,87,430000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa? Is everything okay?
139492,536,88,433000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, why?"
139493,536,89,435000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Because you're doing your homework and you don't look happy.
139494,536,90,438000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,My new best friend isn't what I thought. She's a... Republican.
139496,536,92,444000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What is so funny? They're destroying the world!
139497,536,93,447000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"They are, huh?"
139498,536,94,448000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I thought I'd show you this when you were older, but..."
139499,536,95,451000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You voted for Reagan?!
139500,536,96,454000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"It was a crazy time, the eighties."
139501,536,97,457000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't hear me listening to the Thompson Twins anymore. Although...
139502,536,98,467000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,So... you were going through a phase?
139503,536,99,474000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, eighties party! Where's the beef? Tear down that wall! Because I think the beef is behind that wall!"
139504,536,100,489000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now get up here, boy! We're gonna do the Super Bowl Shuffle."
139505,536,101,490000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No! You never let me be Mike Singletary!
139506,536,102,494000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. You're Mike Singletary. Enjoy your mediocre coaching career.
139507,536,103,498000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,MY NAME IS HOMER / I'M A REAL FULL BACK / GONNA RUN THAT BALL / DON'T WANT NO FLACK...
139508,536,104,503000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,IF YOU TRY TO RUN / YOU'LL GET A HEART ATTACK...
139509,536,105,505000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little--
139510,536,106,508000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,HEY BIG MAN / DON'T WANT NO TROUBLE / I'M JUST HERE TO DO THE SUPER BOWL... SHUFFLE...
139265,536,107,515000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Excuse me.
139511,536,108,515000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,People's views change. Bobby Kennedy worked for Joe McCarthy. Larry David was on Fridays.
139512,536,109,524000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you trying to say?
139513,536,110,526000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Isabel's only eight. As she grows up, surprising things will happen to her body... of beliefs. But she could always use a friend like you."
139516,536,113,539000,Isabel Gutierrez,Library,Isabel?! / Lisa?!
139517,536,114,541000,Lisa Simpson,Library,"Listen, I'm really sorry about..."
139518,536,115,543000,Isabel Gutierrez,Library,"No, it's okay. My Mom says you're just going through a liberal phase."
139519,536,116,546000,Lisa Simpson,Library,What?! My Mom says you're going through a conservative phase!
139520,536,117,550000,Isabel Gutierrez,Library,"There's no such thing. Conservatives only get more conservative! Because every year they get a little further through ""Atlas Shrugged."""
139521,536,118,556000,Lisa Simpson,Library,"Listen, we're both eight years old. Can't we just play Monopoly or something?"
139522,536,119,560000,Isabel Gutierrez,Library,My father owns a monopoly!
139525,536,122,571000,The Rich Texan,Springfield Republican Party Headquarters,"That young filly is exactly the kind of candidate we need to start recruitin': she's a young, dynamic Latina. Yee-haw! I said that just right!"
139526,536,123,583000,Dracula,Springfield Republican Party Headquarters,"Without the Hispanic vote, even Texas is poised to turn blue. Bluuuue!"
139527,536,124,588000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Springfield Republican Party Headquarters,"Yeah, we must reach her, and groom her, before she fattens up like Chris Christie. He thinks G.O.P. stands for Gravy on Pancakes!"
139529,536,126,593000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Springfield Republican Party Headquarters,"But despite my mirthful remarks, obesity is no laughing matter."
139531,536,128,607000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Just can't resist those words ""signup sheet."" Oh, looks like I'll be running against Isabel. And Ralph?!"
139532,536,129,616000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Just call me Ralph Nader! I don't know why.
139533,536,130,618000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Isabel! I want this campaign to be about the issues: same-sex fieldtrip buddies, providing class pets with a path to citizenship..."
139534,536,131,626000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"And no digging up past relationships. Sure, Lisa and I dated. Sure, she broke my heart. I'm sure your researchers know all about it."
139446,536,132,633000,Isabel Gutierrez,Springfield Elementary School,This is the first I've heard of it.
139535,536,133,635000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Really? But I got this!
139536,536,134,637000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Ew. How long has it been since you washed your stomach?
139537,536,135,641000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,You can't ask that anymore!
139538,536,136,644000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Quit shoving me.
139539,536,137,645000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,"I'd like a word with you, young lady."
139540,536,138,647000,Isabel Gutierrez,Springfield Elementary School,How did you get in there?
139541,536,139,648000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,Slid in through the grates.
139543,536,141,651000,C. Montgomery Burns,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Here's the ""scoop."" You're our future so we can't afford to have you lose. And I love the Spanish, from the Inquisition to the delightful Franco years."
139544,536,142,660000,Isabel Gutierrez,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,What are you talking about?
139545,536,143,662000,Krusty the Clown,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,Move over. I know how to talk to kids. We wanna give you a little present: a tainted victory that will haunt you forever!
139546,536,144,670000,Isabel Gutierrez,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,I'd rather do this myself.
139547,536,145,673000,C. Montgomery Burns,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,But who'd own you then?!
139548,536,146,675000,Isabel Gutierrez,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,You couldn't buy me with a wheelbarrow full of ice cream!
139549,536,147,681000,Dracula,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Whoa, nicely done. You've charmed another one right into the arms of the Libertarian Party."
139550,536,148,687000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,Maybe we can help her without her knowing we're helping her.
139551,536,149,690000,C. Montgomery Burns,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"No one says I can't buy a second grade election. Why, I had enough money to fix People Magazine's ""Sexiest Man Alive."""
139552,536,150,698000,C. Montgomery Burns,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Most of the money went to convincing them that I was ""alive."""
139553,536,151,704000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,Who ordered the Yumboni?
139554,536,152,706000,C. Montgomery Burns,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Right here! Now, Smithers. I want you to eat this for me, describe every taste, and don't forget the brain freeze!"
139555,536,153,712000,Waylon Smithers,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Sir, I am lactose-intolerant."
139556,536,154,714000,C. Montgomery Burns,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,And I'm backtalk-allergic! So start eating!
139559,536,157,719000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Have a great day, kids. And Bart, I'll pick you up after school to take you to karate lessons."
139561,536,158,724000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, after six weeks, I figured out that ""Sensei Weinstein"" is really my psychiatrist."
139562,536,159,729000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Either way for forty-five minutes you're not my problem, sweetie."
139564,536,161,736000,Otto Mann,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Lisa, despite the paid ad, I'm strictly middle of the road."
139566,536,163,741000,Drivers,Street,Idiot! / Pick a lane!
139568,536,165,744000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What are you doing?!
139569,536,166,753000,Isabel Gutierrez,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm as bewildered as you are. I don't know why, but the Springfield Republican Party is grooming me."
139570,536,167,757000,Pigsty,Springfield Elementary School,Grooming? Yuck!
139571,536,168,760000,Isabel Gutierrez,Springfield Elementary School,"Unfortunately, I can't stop it. The Supreme Court says spending money is free speech."
139572,536,169,765000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Well then you could use your free speech to denounce this intrusion of big money into our election.
139573,536,170,769000,Isabel Gutierrez,Springfield Elementary School,I'll think about it while I'm on my listening tour of the cafeteria.
139575,536,172,780000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Pour me another.
139576,536,173,782000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What are ya doing? S'imaginary.
139577,536,174,786000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. I gotta go.
139578,536,175,789000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll see you later.
139581,536,178,806000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Ay carumba.
139582,536,179,808000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Bart, I need you to help me win the election."
139583,536,180,810000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"I can help, but it's gonna get rough."
139584,536,181,812000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I'm fine with rough.
139585,536,182,813000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,You don't know what rough is.
139586,536,183,815000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,That ain't rough. More like a gentle breeze.
139587,536,184,818000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Maggie hits harder.
139588,536,185,819000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Did the goodnight pixie just kiss my cheek?
139589,536,186,822000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Okay. You got my attention.
139590,536,187,825000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"You wanna win this election? Then from now on, you do exactly what I say."
139591,536,188,829000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,You got it.
139592,536,189,830000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,First go make me five pans of brownies.
139593,536,190,832000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,You're just taking advantage of the situation.
139594,536,191,834000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Maybe Isabel likes baking.
139560,536,192,836000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Cakey or gooey?
139595,536,193,838000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I'll make both.
139597,536,195,842000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"First we reel them in, then we scare the hell out of them."
139598,536,196,846000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,By discussing the school's budget crisis?
139599,536,197,849000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No, with balls to the head."
139600,536,198,851000,Coach Krupt,Springfield Elementary School,Bombardment!
139601,536,199,857000,Database,Springfield Elementary School,I associate Isabel with a pain in my tummy.
139602,536,200,862000,Coach Krupt,Springfield Elementary School,Bombardment?
139604,536,202,865000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Garage,"Miss Simpson, your platform calls for the creation of a student-run garden."
139605,536,203,870000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Organic gardening is an essential part of twenty-first century education, teaching both hands-on--"
139606,536,204,876000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Garage,And what programs would you cut to pay for this precious garden of yours? The new whiffle-bats? Pizza Friday?
139607,536,205,881000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Garage,"Not Pizza Friday! Sorry Lisa, you lose again."
139608,536,206,887000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Garage,"You gotta get on your game, sister. You think I'm tough? Wait till Gutierrez sinks her teeth into you."
139609,536,207,893000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Garage,Remember you've got an ace in the hole -- chocolate milk in the water fountains.
139610,536,208,898000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Garage,That's impossible. We've already had the best plumbers in the city look into it.
139611,536,209,902000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Hey, we'll worry about that after you're elected."
139613,536,211,907000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,What are you so happy about?
