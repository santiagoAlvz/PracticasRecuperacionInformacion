108287,417,23,218000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,But Wikipedia said he was passionate about rehearsal.
108288,417,24,218000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Don't you worry about Wikipedia -- we'll change it when we get home. We'll change a lot of things.

108321,417,59,407000,Bart Simpson,Barn,Oh. I thought she was peeing out of her nipple.

108337,417,75,527000,Bart Simpson,CALF JUDGING TENT,But he won! Why don't you kill the loser cows?
108338,417,76,531000,4-h Judge,CALF JUDGING TENT,"Oh, we will. But your cow gets to go first!"
108340,417,78,542000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, they're gonna kill Lou and make him into food and fringe vests for gay cowboys. Can we buy him back? Can we?"
108341,417,79,551000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey... we'd love to, but... a prize-winning bull is thousands of dollars."
108342,417,80,558000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh man.
108343,417,81,559000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son, let this be a lesson: never work hard and don't form emotional attachments. Also, don't be a cow."
108347,417,85,573000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Lou?
108349,417,87,576000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Oh man, now I feel so bad I'm imagining I hear your voice."
108351,417,89,581000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Leave me alone! It's not my fault there's nothing good to eat on this planet except meat!
108353,417,91,588000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I can't help you! I'm just a little boy!
108354,417,92,594000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Bart, are you all right?"
108355,417,93,595000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I hear Lou mooing in my head!
108356,417,94,597000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,What you heard was your conscience telling you to stop eating meat.
108357,417,95,601000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"If I could save Lou, I'd never eat meat again. Not even prosciutto and melon!"
108359,417,97,610000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"""Anguished Animals III?"" That wasn't my conscience mooing -- it was Tress MacNeille!"
108360,417,98,618000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"All right, so I put that there to get you to stop eating meat. But your body is going to miss the protein. So you'll have to take these pills."
108361,417,99,628000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Sorry Lis, I can't be a vegetarian -- I love the taste of death! But please, help me get my cow back."
108362,417,100,635000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Okay. Meet me halfway -- stop stirring your lemonade with a sausage.
108363,417,101,639000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Give me a minute.
108364,417,102,641000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Come on.
108366,417,104,641000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,It's a no-brainer.
108367,417,105,641000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Okay.
108369,417,107,653000,Bart Simpson,FEEDLOT,"Aw, man. I never figured the gate would be locked. It's like they knew we were coming."
108370,417,108,658000,Lisa Simpson,FEEDLOT,Don't worry. I called some animal activists who can help us get in. I'll just give the signal. Milk is murder!
108371,417,109,664000,Voice,FEEDLOT,Cheese is genocide!
108372,417,110,667000,ACTIVIST,FEEDLOT,"Good to see you, Windsong."
108373,417,111,670000,Bart Simpson,FEEDLOT,Windsong?
108374,417,112,670000,Lisa Simpson,FEEDLOT,"Yeah, it's my code name. This is Compost. And this is Solarpanel."
108375,417,113,674000,Bart Simpson,FEEDLOT,What's my code name?
108377,417,115,682000,Lisa Simpson,FEEDLOT,Lisa's Brother.
108379,417,117,686000,COMPOST,FEEDLOT,"Forgive us for this violation, Mother Fence. We honor your chain-link spirit."

108381,417,119,704000,Bart Simpson,FEEDLOT,"Lou! Where are you, little buddy?"
108383,417,121,707000,Bart Simpson,FEEDLOT,Lou? What happened to you? You got fat!
108384,417,122,711000,Lisa Simpson,FEEDLOT,Of course he did. His food is laced with growth hormones.
108385,417,123,719000,Bart Simpson,FEEDLOT,"I don't care how much of a pumped-up freak you are, I still love you. The way Barry Bonds's kids probably still love him."
108386,417,124,729000,Lisa Simpson,FEEDLOT,Come on!
108388,417,125,732000,Bart Simpson,FEEDLOT,How are we gonna get him out of here?
108389,417,126,742000,Lisa Simpson,FEEDLOT,"Wow, you did learn a lot at 4-H."
108390,417,127,744000,Bart Simpson,FEEDLOT,"Hell, yeah!"
108392,417,129,749000,Bart Simpson,FEEDLOT,That was a practice cow.
108395,417,132,762000,Bart Simpson,Country Road,What are we gonna do with him?
108396,417,133,763000,Lisa Simpson,Country Road,"Well, your friend Mary from 4-H lives on a farm -- Lou can stay with her!"
108397,417,134,767000,Bart Simpson,Country Road,"Hmmm, a cow on a farm... With a moo moo here, and a moo moo there... Yes, it works!"
108398,417,135,773000,Bart Simpson,Country Road,"All right, Lou! To freedom! Lou?"
108401,417,138,788000,Cletus Spuckler,RURAL FARM,Howdy. What's yours that mines is Cletus?
108403,417,140,792000,Lisa Simpson,RURAL FARM,He wants to know your name.
108404,417,141,794000,Bart Simpson,RURAL FARM,"Oh, I'm Bart Simpson. Is Mary here?"
108405,417,142,796000,Cletus Spuckler,RURAL FARM,"Hang on. Hey, Mary! There's a boy here askin' on you!"
108406,417,143,801000,Mary,RURAL FARM,"Hey, Bart."
108407,417,144,803000,Bart Simpson,RURAL FARM,I didn't know Cletus was your dad.
108408,417,145,805000,Cletus Spuckler,RURAL FARM,She had a regular city birth in a gas station!
108409,417,146,808000,Bart Simpson,RURAL FARM,The feedlot wants to kill Lou and I can't keep him. Can I give him to you?
108410,417,147,813000,Cletus Spuckler,RURAL FARM,Brandine! A young feller just offered Mary a cow!
108411,417,148,818000,Brandine Del Roy,RURAL FARM,Oh-my-God! Oh-my-God! Oh-my-God!
108412,417,149,820000,Lisa Simpson,RURAL FARM,What's going on?
108413,417,150,821000,Brandine Del Roy,RURAL FARM,"Accordin' to the traditions of the hill folk, by giving our daughter a cow, you've made a formal proposal of marriage!"
108415,417,152,829000,Cletus Spuckler,RURAL FARM,This calls for a hoedown.
108416,417,153,832000,Cletus Spuckler,RURAL FARM,Blow her a song of love!
108417,417,154,838000,Cletus Spuckler,RURAL FARM,"Whoa! I said love, not lust!"
108419,417,156,844000,Bart Simpson,SPUCKLER FARM,I can't get married -- I'm only ten!
108420,417,157,847000,Mary,SPUCKLER FARM,And I have dreams. I got fifteen-eighty on my D.Q.A.T.
108421,417,158,850000,Bart Simpson,SPUCKLER FARM,D.Q.A.T.?
108422,417,159,851000,Mary,SPUCKLER FARM,"Dairy Queen Aptitude Test. Eight hundred ice cream, seven-eighty Brazier."
108425,417,160,855000,Lisa Simpson,SPUCKLER FARM,"Bart, I'll find a way to get you out of this wedding. In the meantime, just say yes, so Lou will be safe -- look how happy he is."
108426,417,161,866000,George W. Bush,SPUCKLER FARM,I wish I had a tail what did swat away flies. Mine just hangs there.
108427,417,162,872000,Bart Simpson,SPUCKLER FARM,"All right, sir, I'll marry your daughter."
108428,417,163,874000,Brandine Del Roy,SPUCKLER FARM,We're gonna have us the fanciest weddin' in the county! Cletus! Open up a wall so Dia-Betty can come!
108429,417,164,880000,Dia-Betty,SPUCKLER FARM,Just bring 'em to a window so I can pinch 'em.
108430,417,165,884000,Cletus Spuckler,SPUCKLER FARM,"We always figured someday Mary would marry -- that's why we called her ""Mary"". We name all our kids after what we think's gonna happen to 'em. Ain't that right, Stabbed-in-jail?"
108431,417,166,895000,Stabbed-in-jail,SPUCKLER FARM,We'll see who stabs who.
108433,417,168,897000,Homer Puppet,Simpson Home,Doot de-doo de-doo do-doo de-doo... Strained spinach?! I'm not going to eat that -- it's yucky!

108435,417,170,912000,Homer Puppet,Simpson Home,Really? I guess I'll try it then.
108436,417,171,918000,Homer Puppet,Simpson Home,Mmm-mm-mm! I wonder if Maggie would like it.
108437,417,172,923000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom! Dad! Bart's marrying one of Cletus' daughters!
108438,417,173,928000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We're putting a stop to this right now!
108439,417,174,930000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait! If you stop the wedding, Bart's cow will die! And he really cares about that cow... and Bart doesn't usually care about stuff, so... help."
108440,417,175,938000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, I've got an idea -- but it'll take a lot of sewing."
108441,417,176,942000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll get your fabrics!
108442,417,177,942000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And I'll make sure Flanders doesn't bother us.
108443,417,178,947000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Ow! What was that for?
108444,417,179,949000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart's in trouble and we don't need your stupid comments!
108445,417,180,952000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Zippin' it up!
108447,417,182,970000,Head Caterer,SPUCKLER FARM,"Okay, let's set up the chitlin bar over here... Uh, start drizzling the crawdad reduction on the possum pouches... And excuse me, why are the spittoons so far from the chaw station? This is a wedding, people! Not a funeral!"
108449,417,184,986000,Brandine Del Roy,SPUCKLER HOUSE,"Here you go, sweetheart. Somethin' old..."
108450,417,185,991000,Brandine Del Roy,SPUCKLER HOUSE,Somethin' new...
108423,417,186,991000,Brandine Del Roy,SPUCKLER HOUSE,Somethin' burrowed...
108424,417,187,991000,Brandine Del Roy,SPUCKLER HOUSE,And somethin' stew.
108451,417,188,997000,Mary,SPUCKLER HOUSE,"Mama, you know I love your Somethin' Stew, but I got no appetite for any of this."
108452,417,189,1001000,Brandine Del Roy,SPUCKLER HOUSE,"Aw, you just got cold feet - 'cause you barefoot and our floor's made of mud."
108453,417,190,1009000,Bart Simpson,SPUCKLER HOUSE,Have you seen my sister?
108454,417,191,1010000,Mary,SPUCKLER HOUSE,"No, and she's cutting it pretty close... we're about ten minutes away from ""You may kiss the bride."""
108455,417,192,1012000,Bart Simpson,SPUCKLER HOUSE,Kiss?! I thought we were just getting married!
108457,417,194,1018000,Country Preacher,SPUCKLER FARM,"Do you, Bart Simpson, take Mary Wrestlemania Spuckler to be your lawful wedded wife, for as long as you both shall reckon?"
108458,417,195,1030000,Bart Simpson,SPUCKLER FARM,I do.
108459,417,196,1032000,Country Preacher,SPUCKLER FARM,"And since we don't need to hear from womenfolk what they think, I now pronounce you--"
108460,417,197,1037000,Marge Simpson,SPUCKLER FARM,Stop the wedding!
108462,417,199,1040000,Marge Simpson,SPUCKLER FARM,Bart is a ten-year-old boy. He still sits in the driveway and pretends to drive the car.
108464,417,201,1048000,Bart Simpson,SPUCKLER FARM,"Mom, I have to do this! I love that big ol' cow!"
108465,417,202,1052000,Mary,SPUCKLER FARM,How could you say that?! I starved myself to get into this dress!
108466,417,203,1055000,Bart Simpson,SPUCKLER FARM,"No, no, no, no, no -- you look great, honey. Mom, if I don't get married, they'll take Lou."
108467,417,204,1059000,Marge Simpson,SPUCKLER FARM,"I'm sorry, Bart. But sometimes your mom knows best."
108468,417,205,1065000,Cletus Spuckler,SPUCKLER FARM,"Son, I'm afraid hillbilly law is clear: if this marriage is off, then that cow is goin' back to the feed lot and Mary must taste the bitter agony of being an old maid of eleven."
108469,417,206,1077000,Brandine Del Roy,SPUCKLER FARM,"Don't feel bad, sweetie. I was thirteen when I married your father."
