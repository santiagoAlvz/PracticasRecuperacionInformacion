63146,254,218,921000,Homer Simpson,Highway,How do I get outta here?
63147,254,219,922000,Citizen #2,Highway,"Oh, no one leaves The Island."
63148,254,220,924000,Homer Simpson,Highway,So I'm a prisoner? How come?
63149,254,221,927000,Citizen #1,Highway,Because you know something.
63150,254,222,929000,Homer Simpson,Highway,But I don't know anything. At least I don't think I do.
63151,254,223,932000,Citizen #1,Highway,See you tomorrow.
63152,254,224,933000,Homer Simpson,Highway,No you won't!
63154,254,226,935000,Homer Simpson,Phone Booth,"Hello, operator? I'd like to report a really weird island. Please send lots of rescue copters to..."
63155,254,227,943000,Homer Simpson,Phone Booth,"All right, whatever."
63158,254,230,956000,Patrick McGoohan,ISLAND COMMUNITY ROOM,Welcome friend. I'm Number 6.
63159,254,231,959000,Blind Man,ISLAND COMMUNITY ROOM,I'm Number 15. What number are you?
63160,254,232,961000,Homer Simpson,ISLAND COMMUNITY ROOM,"I am not a number, I am a man. And don't you ever... Oh, wait, I'm Number 5. Ha ha! In your face, Number 6!"
63161,254,233,969000,Patrick McGoohan,ISLAND COMMUNITY ROOM,"Yes, well done."
63162,254,234,970000,Homer Simpson,ISLAND COMMUNITY ROOM,Who are all these oddballs?
63163,254,235,972000,Patrick McGoohan,ISLAND COMMUNITY ROOM,"Well, they keep us here because we know too much. Number 27 there knows how to turn water into gasoline. Number 12 knows the deadly secret behind Tic-Tacs. And I invented the bottomless peanut bag."
63164,254,236,984000,Homer Simpson,ISLAND COMMUNITY ROOM,Wow.
63165,254,237,986000,Homer Simpson,ISLAND COMMUNITY ROOM,"So, who brought us here?"
63166,254,238,988000,Patrick McGoohan,ISLAND COMMUNITY ROOM,I don't know.
63167,254,239,989000,Homer Simpson,ISLAND COMMUNITY ROOM,Did you bring us here?
63168,254,240,991000,Patrick McGoohan,ISLAND COMMUNITY ROOM,No!
63170,254,242,995000,Chief Wiggum,Wooded Area,"Don't worry. If even half of your husband is out here, Officer Scraps'll find him."
63171,254,243,1000000,Marge Simpson,Wooded Area,"Oh, that's a darling name for a dog."
63173,254,245,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Beach,"Yep, he's on the trail, all right... Uh-oh."
63174,254,246,1018000,Chief Wiggum,Beach,"Better go fish 'im out, Lou."
63175,254,247,1019000,Lou,Beach,"Okay, Chief."
63176,254,248,1022000,Chief Wiggum,Beach,"Uh, the shoes are part of the uniform."
62734,254,249,1024000,Lou,Beach,"Right, Chief."
63177,254,251,1036000,Homer Simpson,STARK ROOM,"Oh, they drugged the tea. They knew my one weakness."
63178,254,252,1045000,Number 2,STARK ROOM,"Hello, Number 5. How's every little thing?"
63179,254,253,1047000,Homer Simpson,STARK ROOM,Who are you and why are you holding me here? I want answers now or I want them eventually.
63180,254,254,1052000,Number 2,STARK ROOM,"Fair enough, I'll level with you."
63181,254,255,1055000,Number 2,STARK ROOM,Ow. Please. Don't do that.
63182,254,256,1058000,Homer Simpson,STARK ROOM,Sorry.
63183,254,257,1059000,Number 2,STARK ROOM,I'll be blunt. Your web page has stumbled upon our secret plan.
63184,254,258,1062000,Homer Simpson,STARK ROOM,That's impossible. All my stories are bull plop. Bull plop!
63185,254,259,1067000,Number 2,STARK ROOM,"Oh don't be cute. I'm referring to the flu shot exposé. You see, we're the ones loading them with mind-controlling additives."
63186,254,260,1074000,Homer Simpson,STARK ROOM,But why?
63187,254,261,1074000,Number 2,STARK ROOM,To drive people into a frenzy of shopping. That's why flu shots are given just before Christmas.
63188,254,262,1082000,Homer Simpson,STARK ROOM,"Of course! It's so simple... Wait, no it's not. It's needlessly complicated."
63189,254,263,1088000,Number 2,STARK ROOM,"Yes it is. And we can't have you out there mucking it up now, can we?"
63190,254,264,1092000,Homer Simpson,STARK ROOM,"No, sir."
63191,254,265,1093000,Number 2,STARK ROOM,There's a good boy. Let's get you some ice cream. There you are.
63192,254,266,1098000,Homer Simpson,STARK ROOM,"Look, you can drug me all you want, but my family won't rest till they find my drug-bloated corpse."
63193,254,267,1105000,Number 2,STARK ROOM,"I wouldn't count on that, Number 5. As far as your family knows, Homer Simpson is walking in the front door right about now."
63194,254,268,1113000,Homer Simpson,STARK ROOM,I'm sorry. What?
63196,254,270,1118000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie!
63197,254,271,1119000,Fake Homer,Simpson Home,"Marge honey fraulein, I'm home."
63198,254,272,1122000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're not my husband.
63199,254,273,1124000,Fake Homer,Simpson Home,"Ya, please forgive my unexplained two-week absence. To make it up to you, we will go out to dinner at a sensibly-priced restaurant, then have a night of efficient German sex."
63200,254,274,1133000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I sure don't feel like cooking."
63204,254,278,1147000,Fake Homer,Simpson Home,Aren't there any evil movies on? Maybe something about an evil island?
63205,254,279,1151000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"There's something really different about you, Dad."
63206,254,280,1153000,Fake Homer,Simpson Home,I am a new tie wearing.
62887,254,281,1156000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah...
63207,254,283,1159000,Homer Simpson,Island,I'm tired of being drugged and gagged. There's gotta be a way to escaped.
63208,254,284,1163000,Patrick McGoohan,Island,Psst.
63209,254,285,1163000,Homer Simpson,Island,Huh?
63210,254,286,1165000,Patrick McGoohan,Island,"I've worked on this for thirty-three years. It's made out of toilet paper rolls, toothpicks and plastic forks. And the sail is made of scabs and dynamite. It's small, and it's smelly, but it should carry both of us to..."
63211,254,287,1185000,Patrick McGoohan,Island,That's the third time that's happened.
63213,254,289,1193000,Homer Simpson,WATERS AROUND ISLAND,"Oh, no! An anti-escape orb!"
63214,254,290,1204000,Homer Simpson,WATERS AROUND ISLAND,"Huh, that was easy."
63216,254,292,1208000,Number 2,NUMBER 2'S LAIR (STARK ROOM),Why did you think a big balloon would stop people?
63217,254,293,1211000,Female Scientist,NUMBER 2'S LAIR (STARK ROOM),Shut up! That's why!
63219,254,295,1212000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What a horrible four months. Now to warn everybody.
63220,254,296,1216000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Attention: some crazy creeps on an island somewhere are secretly running the world...
63221,254,297,1222000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey!
63222,254,298,1223000,Number 2,Simpson Home,"Sorry, old chap. But you're proving quite the caterpillar in our buttermilk."
63223,254,299,1227000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh?
63224,254,300,1228000,Number 2,Simpson Home,We're shutting you down.
63225,254,301,1229000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not a chance. No one can silence me, but me!"
63226,254,302,1232000,Fake Homer,Simpson Home,That arranged can be.
63227,254,303,1235000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Whuh?
63228,254,304,1241000,Number 2,Simpson Home,"Yes, fight and struggle!"
63229,254,305,1245000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If I know me, he won't like being kicked in the crotch."
63230,254,306,1251000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Marge. It's me, the real Homer!"
63231,254,307,1253000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie!"
63232,254,308,1260000,Number 2,Simpson Home,"Bravo, Number 5. But you know what happens to bad little fishies who wriggle through the net..."
63233,254,309,1267000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Can I turn this off?
63234,254,310,1268000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Absolutely.
63235,254,311,1268000,Number 2,Simpson Home,Hey...
63236,254,312,1270000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nice to have you back, Homer."
63237,254,313,1273000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"The dog thinks so, too."
63238,254,314,1276000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The dog thinks so...
63239,254,315,1276000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bad dog.
63241,254,317,1285000,Marge Simpson,Island,"Once you get used to the druggings, this isn't a bad place."
63242,254,318,1289000,Homer Simpson,Island,"Oh, it's wonderful."
63243,254,319,1290000,Homer Simpson,Island,Truly God's country.
