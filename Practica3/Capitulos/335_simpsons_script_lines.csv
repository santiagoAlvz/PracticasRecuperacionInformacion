86483,335,15,92000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,"If that tree gets too big, it'll ruin the beauty of that rock. We'll lose tourists! And then who will buy my roadside corn?"

86498,335,30,175000,Waylon Smithers,PODIUM,Mr. Burns is gone! And tonight was the night I was gonna show him my tattoo.
86502,335,34,186000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,I can't believe that historic rock is gone.
86503,335,35,190000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,My poem has become an elegy. An elegy no one will ever hear.
86504,335,36,194000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Well, at least some good came out of today."
86505,335,37,197000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Bart, you're grounded for a year."
86506,335,38,198000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,I'll just pay the fine.
86507,335,39,199000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Okay, three bucks."
86508,335,40,201000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Why don't you publish your poem?
86510,335,41,203000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Publish it myself? Why not? I could put out a whole newspaper dedicated to the rock. I'd be a publisher, just like Katherine Graham!"
86511,335,42,213000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Or that lady who wheels Larry Flynt around!
86513,335,44,216000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"Mr. Burns, perhaps it's best you were snatched away before time could diminish your beauty."

86517,335,48,231000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"You're alive! But, but how?!"
86518,335,49,235000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Because of my svelte physique, I was able to fit in a narrow air pocket."
86519,335,50,239000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,I survived on whatever sustenance came my way.
86520,335,51,250000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Thankfully, a mother mole nursed me as her own until I was strong enough to continue."
86521,335,52,261000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Now, let's see how the common folk are grieving for their fallen god... me."
86522,335,53,267000,Kent Brockman,Burns Manor,"And so, a day after the tragedy, the town still mourns the loss of its venerable old man."
86523,335,54,273000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Here it comes.
86524,335,55,274000,Kent Brockman,Burns Manor,Beloved by children...

86526,335,57,277000,Kent Brockman,Burns Manor,Thought to be thousands of years old...
86527,335,58,279000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"I have been ""eighty-nine"" for a while now."
86528,335,59,283000,Kent Brockman,Burns Manor,We'll miss you... Geezer Rock.
86529,335,60,291000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Quickly, Smithers. Re-hydrate me."
86530,335,61,295000,Kent Brockman,Burns Manor,"But one old man we certainly don't miss is the late C. Montgomery Burns. As owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, he generated both electricity and contempt."
86531,335,62,305000,Kent Brockman,Burns Manor,"Thank you, Geezer Rock, for doing what none of us had the courage to do -- smoosh Mr. Burns."
86532,335,63,312000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,This town cared more for a soulless piece of granite than for me! I don't have a friend in the world.
86533,335,64,321000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"You have me, sir."
86534,335,65,323000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Don't be so needy.
86535,335,66,326000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Well, I'm going to change this town's accurate impression of me."
86536,335,67,330000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"Sir, you could improve your image with various good deeds."
86509,335,68,334000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Don't I already give out turkey slices to the poor?
86538,335,69,337000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"You eliminated that program in the thirties, sir."
86539,335,70,339000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"They were getting too grabby! All right, I know how to change the way the public thinks of me: I'll buy every media outlet in town. Bring me a checkbook and a mother mole!"
86540,335,71,355000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,I really got hooked on this stuff.
86542,335,73,363000,Lisa Simpson,Car,"Thanks for helping me deliver the first edition of The Red Dress Press, Dad."
86543,335,74,367000,Homer Simpson,Car,"I'm always happy to help you, sweetie."
86544,335,75,369000,Homer Simpson,Car,He TOSSES a paper and yells out the window.
86545,335,76,369000,Homer Simpson,Car,Extree! Extree! Man driving erratically throws papers out window!

86552,335,83,430000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"Well this is one dilly of a daily, Lisa. Can't wait for tomorrow's!"
86553,335,84,434000,Lisa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Tomorrow's? I hadn't thought about publishing more.
86554,335,85,437000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,You better -- I've already sold a bunch of subscriptions. How do you think I got these swell prizes!
86555,335,86,449000,Lisa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"All right, Nelson. What kind of journalism skills do you have?"
86556,335,87,451000,Nelson Muntz,Evergreen Terrace,I'unno. Makin' nerds cry?

86577,335,107,512000,Station Manager,Cemetery,"Look, I assure you, no sack of money is big enough to change my mind, now..."
86578,335,108,518000,Station Manager,Cemetery,"Oh. There's more to life than being rich, you know."

86593,335,123,550000,C. Montgomery Burns,Radio Station,"Well, first of all, I agree with you two: it's sheer humbuggery that pretty girls can flirt their way out of speeding tickets."
86594,335,124,559000,Marty,Radio Station,No support for the naughty hotties!
86596,335,126,563000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Secondly, I want you to pack up and get out. I just bought this station -- and you're fired!"
86599,335,128,568000,C. Montgomery Burns,Radio Station,And play that delightful flush sound on your way out.
86600,335,129,570000,Bill,Radio Station,"Yes, sir."
86602,335,131,574000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Indoor plumbing. The lack of it killed my mother.

86623,335,152,651000,Itchy,Simpson Home,Let me show you why you and all protestors are wrong.
86624,335,153,656000,Scratchy,Simpson Home,All right.
86625,335,154,660000,Itchy,Simpson Home,Nuclear power helps heat that orphanage...and keep that hospital humming.
86626,335,155,667000,Scratchy,Simpson Home,But what about wind power? It's cheap and safe.

86649,335,177,778000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I can't. My Mom's not picking me up for an hour.
86650,335,178,786000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,So... what do you think of today's popular music scene?
86651,335,179,790000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I think it distracts people from more important social issues.

86664,335,192,836000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Lisa. And by the way, that story I filed from Baghdad was all made up. I was actually in Basra."
86665,335,193,846000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Everyone chickened out. Except Ralph. He got poached by the Chicago Tribune.
86666,335,194,853000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess we're down to just me.
86667,335,195,856000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Take the sob sister act somewhere else -- you're standin' in my light!

86671,335,199,873000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,This is an outrage! Since when are public figures fair game for satire?

86673,335,201,880000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,I can't be held responsible for what my goons were ordered to do!
86674,335,202,884000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,Perhaps there's a non-violent way to silence this girl.
86675,335,203,887000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Non-violence never solved anything! Fine, curtsy boy, I'll try it your way."
86676,335,204,900000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What the...?
86677,335,205,902000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad! Mr. Burns cut our power -- now I can't print my paper!

86687,335,215,940000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"This, young lady, is a mimeo machine. A hand-operated duplicating device -- no electricity needed."
86688,335,216,951000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,That smell takes me back.
