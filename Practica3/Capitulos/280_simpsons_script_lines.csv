71104,280,180,744000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, yeah. Maybe I should keep my promise."
71105,280,181,748000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I just hope the audience is kind because my material is weak and, uh, and I have that bladder thing."
71106,280,182,753000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That's it. I'm blowing off the dance. This is the biggest thing that's happened to me since chocolate milk.
71107,280,183,759000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,They've got chocolate milk now?
71109,280,185,765000,Krusty the Clown,Floppy's,"That was the prop comedy of the Sea Captain. More like ""thar he blows""."

71111,280,187,776000,Krusty the Clown,Floppy's,"All right, let's keep this train wreck movin'. Principal Skinner? I know him. He's not funny. Well, enjoy."
71113,280,188,787000,Seymour Skinner,Floppy's,"So, it's, uh, standardized testing time again. Have you ever noticed how the dumb kids fill in the wrong circles?"
71114,280,189,795000,Bart Simpson,Floppy's,Sey-mour...
71115,280,190,796000,Bart Simpson,Floppy's,Sey-mour...
71116,280,191,799000,Seymour Skinner,Floppy's,"Lost my place. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe a little, uh, improv would ""raise the roof,"" here. Would someone name a profession?"
71117,280,192,807000,Bart Simpson,Floppy's,Loser principal!
71118,280,193,808000,Seymour Skinner,Floppy's,"Uh... I think I heard ""California surfer."""

71124,280,199,830000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, I only lied because it was the easiest way to get what I wanted."
71125,280,200,834000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, this girl is in love with you. Think about it."
71126,280,201,857000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I didn't lead her on. I always played it light and breezy."
71127,280,202,862000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if you don't feel the way Greta does, you've got to tell her before she gets hurt."
71128,280,203,866000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, I know what to do. I'll dump her like she's never been dumped before, then we'll go right back to being friends."
71129,280,204,871000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well Bart, you really understand women."
71130,280,205,874000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lis, women are easy. State capitals are hard."
