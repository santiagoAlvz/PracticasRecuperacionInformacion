22780,112,18,106000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,They wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.
22781,112,19,109000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Well, that's the babysitter. No one in town will sit for you two anymore. I had to choose between a grad student at the university and a scary-looking hobo."

22825,112,64,348000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where's my gummy de Milo? Okay, don't panic. She can't have gotten far; she has no arms."
22826,112,65,354000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm sure it'll turn up. Take the baby-sitter home now. She's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes.
22827,112,66,359000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Relax, Marge, there's plenty for her to do in there."
22828,112,67,363000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"See, she's having the time of her life."
22830,112,69,367000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"So, a graduate student, huh? How come you guys can go to the moon but you can't make my shoes smell good?"

22838,112,81,410000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Well why don't we give it to some needy children, then?"
22840,112,83,419000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Oh no! The candy conventioneers tracked us down!
22841,112,84,423000,Ashley,Simpson Living Room,There he is! There's the man that sexually harassed me!
22842,112,85,426000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,For a minute there I thought I was in big trouble. It's just a...
22844,112,87,429000,Protesters,Simpson Home,"Two four six eight / Homer's crime was very great! ""Great"" meaning ""large or immense"" / We used it in the pejorative sense!"
22845,112,88,441000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I swear I didn't touch her. You know how bashful I am. I can't even say the word ""titmouse"" without giggling like a schoolgirl."
22846,112,89,451000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"At any rate, I believe you and I think you should go outside and straighten this out. Some of their chants are very catchy and memorable."
22847,112,90,460000,Ashley,Simpson Home,You grabbed me in the car!
22848,112,91,462000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh that. No. I was just grabbing a gummy Venus de Milo that got stuck to your pants.
22849,112,92,467000,Heavy Woman,Simpson Home,Yeah right! That's the oldest excuse in the book.
22850,112,93,471000,Protesters,Simpson Home,Boo!
22851,112,94,471000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, I'm a decent guy..."
22853,112,96,480000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why would anybody want to touch a girl's butt? That's where cooties come from.
22854,112,97,484000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I don't understand. What is she saying you did?"
22855,112,98,487000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well Lisa, remember that post card Grampa sent us from Florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?"
22856,112,99,492000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, yeah. That was brilliant."
22857,112,100,495000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's right, we all thought it was hilarious. But it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harassing that woman."
22858,112,101,503000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"And the dog in the Coppertone ad? Same deal, Dad?"
22859,112,102,505000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that's kind of a gray area."
22860,112,103,507000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"We know you're innocent, Dad."
22861,112,104,508000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, kids."
22862,112,105,510000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,They seem to be building some sort of a shantytown.
22865,112,107,520000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Do your worst, protesters you can't stop me from living my life!"

22867,112,109,527000,Protesters,Simpson Home,"Just try to push the right buttons now! We aren't crazy about nuclear power, either!"
22868,112,110,531000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,You people aren't allowed in here.
22869,112,111,533000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's okay, they're with me."
22870,112,112,533000,Protesters,Simpson Home,Boo!
22872,112,114,544000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"They're ruining my whole life. Marge, please, this is where I need you the most. I'm counting on you to do something or say something to make it all better. Okay-- go."

22874,112,116,554000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Uh-huh?
22875,112,117,554000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"I already talked to the Indignation Coordinator out on the lawn today. I told her you were a decent man. But she wouldn't listen. Besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't anything more I can do."

22880,112,122,592000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Hmm, I saw that report you did on Sasquatch. It was fair and evenhanded. I'll do it."
22882,112,124,599000,Homer Simpson,Rock Bottom Studio,"...Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed, she was sitting on the gummy Venus so I grabbed it off of her. Oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy. I just wish I had another one right now. But the most important thing is..."
22883,112,125,617000,Godfrey,Rock Bottom Studio,"That was really great, Mr. Simpson, we got everything we need."
22884,112,126,620000,Homer Simpson,Rock Bottom Studio,"Okay. Say, can you introduce me to the Sasquatch? I like his style."

22894,112,137,673000,Godfrey,LIVING ROOM,"So, Mr. Simpson, you admit you grabbed her ""can"". What do you have to say in your defense?"
22895,112,138,678000,Godfrey,LIVING ROOM,"Mr. Simpson, your silence will only incriminate you further."
22896,112,139,683000,Godfrey,LIVING ROOM,"No, Mr. Simpson, don't take your anger out on me! Get back! Get back!"

22927,112,168,879000,Dennis Franz,Simpson Living Room,With a man in the White House? Not likely.
22928,112,169,888000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Living Room,"This is hour fifty-seven of our live, round-the-clock coverage outside the Simpson estate. Remember, by the way, to tune in tonight at eight o'clock for highlights of today's vigil, including when the garbage man came, and when Marge Simpson put the cat out. Possibly because it was harassed, we don't know."
22929,112,170,904000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Living Room,"Of course, there's no way to see into the Simpson home without some kind of infrared heat-sensitive camera. So let's turn it on."
22930,112,171,912000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Living Room,"Now this technology is new to me, but I'm pretty sure that's Homer Simpson in the oven, rotating slowly. His body temperature has risen to over four hundred degrees. He's literally stewing in his own juices. Now here are some results from our phone-in poll: 95 percent of the people believe Homer Simpson is guilty. Of course, this is just a television poll, which is not legally binding. Unless Proposition 304 passes, and we all pray it will."
22931,112,172,937000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I don't have a friend in the world.

22939,112,178,951000,Moe Szyslak,House,"How can you judge this man, without talking to the people who know him best. We got the real dirt on Homer Simpson, and the biddin' starts at ten G's."

22945,112,184,973000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Dad. We do believe in you. We really do."
22946,112,185,976000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's just hard not to listen to TV. It's spent so much more time raising us than you have.
22947,112,186,980000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe TV is right. TV's always right.
22948,112,187,994000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you hugging the TV?

22952,112,191,1024000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me. I know - ""Evening at the Improv."" They never talk about anything beyond the 1980s."
22953,112,192,1032000,Standup,Simpson Home,"See I think about weird stuff. Like what would happen if E.T. and Mr. T. had a baby? Well, you'd get Mr. E.T. wouldn't ya? And you know I think he'd sound a little something like this: I pity the fool who doesn't phone home."
22954,112,193,1049000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I wouldn't want to be Mr. T right now."
22955,112,194,1051000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer! Homie! The kids have a great idea on how you can clear your name!
22956,112,195,1055000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"The media's making a monster out of you because they don't care about the truth. All they care about is entertainment. Well you need a forum where they don't even know the meaning of the word ""entertainment"" -- Public Access Television."
22957,112,196,1066000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But those shows all look so crummy.
22958,112,197,1068000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we can dress it up a bit. We can bring a fern... and a folding chair from the garage... And the most decorative thing of all: the truth."
