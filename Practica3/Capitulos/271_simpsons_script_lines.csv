68283,271,65,269000,Marge Simpson,Court,It's about the only thing we do as a family anymore.

68287,271,69,274000,Kirk Van Houten,Courtroom,"Uh, your Honor, please don't send my son to Juvie. He's basically a good kid. He's just weak. Morally, and in the upper body."
68288,271,70,284000,Milhouse Van Houten,Courtroom,Please let me slip through the cracks.
68289,271,71,287000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Well, you look like a good student, well with those glasses... and I suppose boys will be boys... Case dismissed."
68290,271,72,297000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,Good 'ol Judge Snyder.

68292,271,74,301000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,"Well, it's showtime."
68293,271,75,306000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Why, hello, Bart. Say, are those new shoes?"
68294,271,76,310000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,"Yes they are, Roy."
68295,271,77,312000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Judge Snyder? While we're young?
68296,271,78,314000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Oh, sorry."
68297,271,79,315000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,Oh my! Looks like you were the ringleader in this car theft. And that's a felony.
68298,271,80,321000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,"Yes, sir."
68299,271,81,324000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"On the other hand, I was young once."
68300,271,82,327000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,I'll bring the car around.
68301,271,83,328000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,And I suppose boys will be...
68302,271,84,331000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,Oh. Oops. My vacation just started.
68303,271,85,337000,Bailiff,Courtroom,All rise for the Honorable Judge Constance Harm.
68304,271,86,345000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,Uh-oh.
68305,271,87,347000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,Silence in my courtroom.
68306,271,88,350000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,Grand theft auto?!
68307,271,89,352000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,"It was an accident, ma'am."
68308,271,90,354000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,Don't spit on my cupcake and tell me it's frosting.
68309,271,91,357000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,What'd she say about cupcakes?
68310,271,92,360000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,"According to this, your father was driving you to school? Then where was he when you stole the police car?"
68311,271,93,365000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Uh, your Honor, I was chasing the KBBL Party Penguin Prize Patrol."
68312,271,94,370000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,You abandoned your son to win forty dollars?
68313,271,95,373000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,And a Blue Oyster Cult medallion.
68314,271,96,375000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Coooool.
68315,271,97,378000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,And that was more important than keeping your son out of trouble?
68316,271,98,380000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Your Honor, if I may sing a little bit of ""Don't Fear the Reaper"", I think you'll agree that..."
68317,271,99,385000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,I'm familiar with B.O.C. But you have got a boy here who is crying out for adult supervision.
68318,271,100,391000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,I couldn't agree more. Perhaps some sort of court-appointed baby-sitter or au pair.
68319,271,101,396000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,"Sorry, Bub. That crow won't caw."
68320,271,102,398000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,It won't?
68321,271,103,399000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,I hereby order you to be tethered to your son.
68322,271,104,402000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Tethered?!
68323,271,105,403000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,Tethered. Report to room five.
68324,271,106,405000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Room five?!
68327,271,109,411000,Employee,ROOM FIVE,There we go. How's that?
68328,271,110,413000,Homer Simpson,ROOM FIVE,It's a little tight.
68329,271,111,415000,Employee,ROOM FIVE,"Sir, you are not a size four."
68330,271,112,418000,Homer Simpson,ROOM FIVE,I used to be.
68332,271,114,432000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, this punishment is so cruel."
68333,271,115,435000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And unusual.
68334,271,116,436000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Can that judge do this to us?
68336,271,117,438000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Creative sentencing is common these days. That's why Bill Clinton is our new mailman.
68337,271,118,445000,Bill Clinton,Simpson Home,Dang magazines...
68338,271,119,447000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, maybe it'll be fun. You'll get to spend more time together. Make sure your father takes his mood medication."
68339,271,120,453000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll medicate you...
68340,271,121,456000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"...honey. You know, this could be fun. Race you to the kitchen, my little tether ball."
68341,271,122,461000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're on, Rope-a-dope!"
68342,271,123,461000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ack!
68345,271,126,466000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Today we're going to talk about predicates and predicate nominatives.
68346,271,127,470000,Homer Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Bo-ring.
68347,271,128,471000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Mr. Simpson, I'm trying to teach."
68348,271,129,474000,Homer Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Come on, these kids are never gonna use that stuff."
68349,271,130,476000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Will you please just go back to sleep?
68350,271,131,478000,Homer Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Fine.
68352,271,133,485000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"All right, now who can pick out the predicate in this sentence?"
68354,271,135,491000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"What's wrong with him now, Bart?"
68355,271,136,493000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Night terrors, ma'am."
68356,271,137,495000,Homer Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Cobras!
68358,271,139,498000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, son. Concentrate... Shut out everything but the sound of my criticism."
68359,271,140,505000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Swing!
68360,271,141,505000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Run, Bart! Pump your thighs! Pump them..."
68361,271,142,514000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hurry up, Dad!"
68362,271,143,516000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm with you, son!"
68363,271,144,526000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Safe!
68364,271,145,527000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Wow, my first home run."
68365,271,146,529000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That's my boy...
68367,271,148,532000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"C'mon, hug me..."
68368,271,149,538000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Cobras! Cobras!
68371,271,151,546000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I thought I would hate working nights. But it's so peaceful. And there's no one here to squeal on me for shootin' mice.
68372,271,152,553000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Can I ask you something, Dad?"
68373,271,153,554000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sure, boy."
68374,271,154,555000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,The town keeps getting bigger. Will there always be enough electricity?
68375,271,155,558000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, son. You know that's none of your business. Say, is that our house?"
68376,271,156,566000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, I don't think Lenny's house has a steeple."
68377,271,157,569000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, yeah... I forget things sometimes..."
68379,271,159,576000,Homer Simpson,Street,Really. You like skateboards? We're sure learning a lot about each other.
68380,271,160,581000,Bart Simpson,Street,"Yeah, this tether has some pluses."
68382,271,162,586000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Ow, my head... Oh. I need a beer."
68384,271,164,592000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I hit my head, Moe."
68385,271,165,594000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"One beer, comin' up."
68386,271,166,597000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, hey. No kids in the bar."
68387,271,167,599000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Since when?
68388,271,168,600000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, the heat's been on since them Bush girls were in here."
68389,271,169,603000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"All right, all right. Come on, Bart."
68391,271,171,609000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I'm cold and scared.
68392,271,172,611000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,That's my little slugger.
68393,271,173,613000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"C'mon, Dad. Let's go."
68394,271,174,616000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, knock it off! These pants cost six hundred dollars!"
68395,271,175,620000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Really?
68396,271,176,621000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, they're Italian."
68397,271,177,622000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,All right. Hand 'em over.
68398,271,178,624000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Moe? What the?...
68399,271,179,626000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, I rob now."
68401,271,181,627000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,There's a new judge in town with a hard-nosed approach to juvenile crime: punish the parents.
68402,271,182,634000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's about time. Oh.
68403,271,183,638000,Judge Harm,Simpson Home,"Kids are running wild, Kent. And I blame Mr. and Mrs. Neverspank."
68404,271,184,642000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,Uh-oh. We'll have to bleep their names.
68406,271,185,645000,Judge Harm,Simpson Home,"You'll bleep nothing. Parents, it's time to take control. If you can't cope, you'll wear the rope."
68407,271,186,652000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you can tell she's never had kids. Look how high and firm her breasts are."
68408,271,187,657000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Granted. But you gotta admit, constant supervision has been good for Bart. He might even make the honor roll, if Dad can control his night terrors."
68409,271,188,665000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that's a pretty big ""if,"" honey."
68410,271,189,668000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, Dad. I gotta go to the bathroom."
68411,271,190,670000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I just got comfortable. Use the bottle."
68412,271,191,672000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No! I don't want you going in a bottle. That's what hobos do.
68413,271,192,677000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Homer."
68414,271,193,677000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
68415,271,194,679000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Mo-om!
68416,271,195,681000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, just take him to the bathroom."
68417,271,196,684000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. I don't even know why we have a bottle. Somebody tell me!
68419,271,198,695000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Would you mind? I'm trying to do my homework.
68420,271,199,698000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, son, it's a little chilly. Maybe you should wrap a blanket around your head."
68421,271,200,703000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie, no. We can't."
68422,271,201,705000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What's the big deal? He sees a thousand times worse on that animal channel.
68423,271,202,711000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't want him to see us expressing our love.
68424,271,203,716000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why not? Kids are very visual these days.
68425,271,204,719000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
68426,271,205,719000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But...
68427,271,206,720000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The lady said no.
68428,271,207,721000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, shut up."
68429,271,208,722000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You shut up.
68430,271,209,724000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow! Why you--!
68431,271,210,726000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What'd you do that for?
68432,271,211,728000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because I... Ow! You--!
68433,271,212,729000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ah!
68434,271,213,729000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow!
68436,271,215,730000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow!
68438,271,217,730000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow!
68439,271,218,735000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm sleeping in the bathtub.
68440,271,219,738000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little...
68370,271,220,742000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ah! Ow! Ow! Owww! That really hurt.
68405,271,221,750000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't take it anymore!
68335,271,222,756000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, you cut the tether."
68442,271,223,758000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We're free! Your mother set us free!
68443,271,224,762000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo!
68444,271,225,764000,Judge Harm,Simpson Home,Don't celebrate too much.
68446,271,227,768000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Who said that?
68448,271,229,771000,Judge Harm,Simpson Home,"That's right. It's me, Judge Harm, through the magic of fiber optics."
68449,271,230,775000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Heyyy, how 'bout that? Ha, ha."
68450,271,231,778000,Judge Harm,Simpson Home,"Quiet, Tubsy. You violated my order."
68451,271,232,781000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But, Constance, it only happened because..."
68452,271,233,784000,Judge Harm,Simpson Home,"Hey, hey. If I want a cock 'n' bull story, I'll read Hemingway."
68453,271,234,788000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't be mad at Homer. I was the one who cut the rope.
68454,271,235,792000,Judge Harm,Simpson Home,Are you threatening me with that knife?
68455,271,236,793000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
68456,271,237,794000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait. I'm to blame, Judge. You see, I was pressuring my wife to make love in front of our son... you're gonna laugh when you hear this... when suddenly..."
68459,271,240,806000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,"Well, I thought Dad was the problem, but apparently Mom is no prize pig herself."
68460,271,241,811000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,It's a miracle poor Bartholomew isn't robbing banks and chasing Sweet Lady H.
68461,271,242,815000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,I'm a latchkey kid.
68462,271,243,817000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,You are not.
68463,271,244,818000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,"Quiet, little girl."
68464,271,245,820000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,You two need to wake up and smell the java. And the first step is to admit that you're bad parents.
68465,271,246,826000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,I admit it.
68466,271,247,827000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"Homer, no! We're not bad parents."
68467,271,248,829000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,"Yes, you are. Just say it."
68468,271,249,831000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"No, I won't. And frankly, Judge, I think you're a bully."
68469,271,250,835000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,"You do, huh?"
68470,271,251,838000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"You're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people, you can't see how much I love my kids."
68471,271,252,845000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Your Honor, I'd like to be tried separately."
68472,271,253,847000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"I don't mean to be disrespectful, Judge Harm, but we are not bad parents. And there isn't a tether in this world with enough fiber optics to make me say we are."
68473,271,254,857000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,Hmmm.
68441,271,255,861000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,She's such a butthole.
68477,271,259,870000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,Sorry.
68478,271,260,871000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,"Just, just let me get--"
68480,271,262,882000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,Dammit!
68481,271,263,884000,Lisa Simpson,KITCHEN,"Oh, poor Mom and Dad."
68483,271,265,885000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,"Do you think it's fair that you're always getting into trouble, yet Mom and Dad are being punished?"
68484,271,266,890000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,"No, it's terrible."
68485,271,267,894000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,"Well, why don't you do something about it?"
68486,271,268,895000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,After wrestling.
68487,271,269,897000,Announcer,TV ROOM,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I don't believe what I am seeing. Dr. Hombre just married Rumblina and they're already whaling at each other."
68488,271,270,906000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,When are you gonna start taking responsibility for your actions?
68489,271,271,910000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,'Cuz I felt like it.
68490,271,272,911000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,You're not even listening!
68491,271,273,913000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,"I know you are, but what am I?"
68494,271,276,918000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,Haven't we been humiliated enough?
68495,271,277,921000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,Not yet. No. Today the judge wants you to bend over so people can spank you from their cars.
68496,271,278,925000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Well, that explains the sign."
68497,271,279,927000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Yeah. Oo, here comes a car!"
68498,271,280,931000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Springfield,"Arrr, ya scurvy dogs!"
68500,271,282,933000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield,Worst parents ever.
68502,271,284,935000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,Haw haw.
68504,271,286,937000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Hey, no extension cords!"
68506,271,288,941000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, we could get out of these stupid things if you'd just tell the judge you're a bad mother. And you don't even have to say ""bad."" It could be ""negligent"" or ""unfit"" or ""drugged-up."""
68507,271,289,945000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I just can't do that, Homer. It's a matter of principle. And I need you to support me in this."
68508,271,290,963000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're right. It's time to stand up to that firm-breasted judge.
68509,271,291,967000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But first we gotta break out of these stocks.
68512,271,294,973000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Garage,Easy... easy...
68513,271,295,975000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Garage,"I want goggles, too."
68514,271,296,976000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Garage,"Shhh, you'll wake up Flanders..."
68515,271,297,980000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Garage,What the...?!
68516,271,298,980000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Garage,Ahh!!
68517,271,299,984000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Garage,"Hey, Marge, surf's up!"
68518,271,300,986000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Garage,You're using my table saw to violate a court order?
68519,271,301,989000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Garage,"Well, we tried all those other tools."
68520,271,302,995000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Garage,"Gee, I always like to help you, Homer, but I don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. And it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as..."
68521,271,303,1003000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Garage,Woo hoo!
68524,271,306,1011000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Now, time for ""Operation: Judge-Get-Back-At."""
68525,271,307,1014000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,"If that costume shop knew we were using these burglar outfits for real, they'd be furious."
68526,271,308,1019000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Okay, she lives at one Ocean View Drive. Let's start skulking."
68527,271,309,1034000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"It's only the milkman. Hey, maybe I should be a milkman."
68528,271,310,1040000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,"Concentrate, Homer."
68529,271,311,1048000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,This address must be wrong.
68530,271,312,1049000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,"No. No, there it is!"
68531,271,313,1053000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"She lives in a houseboat? Wow, she is so cool."
68532,271,314,1058000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,"We hate her, Homer."
68533,271,315,1060000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"I know, I know. Fight the power."
68534,271,316,1062000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,Let's do this thing.
68535,271,317,1067000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Cops!
68536,271,318,1073000,Lou,Springfield,"Aw, ain't that sweet, Chief?"
68537,271,319,1075000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Sure is, Lou. Those two longshoremen found love."
68538,271,320,1081000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,Let's go.
68540,271,322,1093000,Homer Simpson,Houseboat,"Look at her in there, washing her body..."
68541,271,323,1096000,Marge Simpson,Houseboat,Get away from that window!
68542,271,324,1096000,Marge Simpson,Houseboat,And help me with this banner.
68543,271,325,1104000,Homer Simpson,Houseboat,"I hate to call a judge dirty names, but there's only one way to describe a nasty super witch like her."
68544,271,326,1109000,Marge Simpson,Houseboat,Let's get out of here.
68546,271,328,1117000,Homer Simpson,Houseboat,"Oh, it's just a friendly seal."
68548,271,330,1121000,Marge Simpson,Houseboat,"Shh. No, we can't play now."
68550,271,332,1127000,Homer Simpson,Houseboat,Shut-uuuup...
68552,271,334,1131000,Judge Harm,Houseboat,"What is it, Pancho? Is someone out there?"
68554,271,336,1139000,Judge Harm,Houseboat,You can't hide from me.
68555,271,337,1141000,Marge Simpson,Houseboat,She's gonna find us!
68556,271,338,1142000,Homer Simpson,Houseboat,"Oh Lord, guide this cinder block..."
68557,271,339,1145000,Marge Simpson,Houseboat,"Homer, no!"
68558,271,340,1145000,Homer Simpson,Houseboat,Uh-oh.
68559,271,341,1150000,Judge Harm,Houseboat,My house!
68560,271,342,1157000,Homer Simpson,Houseboat,"Hey, how ya doin'?"
68561,271,343,1166000,Judge Harm,Houseboat,That quilt was made by my grandmother.
68562,271,344,1170000,Homer Simpson,Houseboat,So... it cost you nothin'.
68563,271,345,1174000,Judge Harm,Houseboat,"Shut up. You two are not only horrible parents, you're violent criminals. And I'm gonna lock you up till frogs do fractions."
68564,271,346,1186000,Bart Simpson,Houseboat,Your Honor! May I say something?
68565,271,347,1188000,Judge Harm,Houseboat,"Well, it is highly unorthodox... so no."
68566,271,348,1192000,Bart Simpson,Houseboat,"Please, your Honor?"
68567,271,349,1194000,Judge Harm,Houseboat,"Oh, I can't resist that look. You remind me of me, when I was a little boy."
68568,271,350,1200000,Bart Simpson,Houseboat,"Your Honor, it's not easy being my parents. I'm always screwing up in school, and getting in trouble with the law. But if I grow up to be a halfway decent person, I know it'll be because of my Mom and Dad."
68569,271,351,1214000,Bart Simpson,Houseboat,"Everyone else might give up on me, but my parents never will."
68570,271,352,1219000,Lisa Simpson,Houseboat,That's my brother.
68571,271,353,1221000,Snake Jailbird,Houseboat,"Um, did she say she used to be a dude?"
68572,271,354,1225000,Bart Simpson,Houseboat,"So, your honor, if you're going to punish anyone in this courtroom today, I ask that you punish me."
68573,271,355,1231000,Judge Harm,Houseboat,Okay I will.
68574,271,356,1235000,Judge Harm,Houseboat,Bartholomew Simpson I hereby sentence you to five years in Juvenile Hall.
68576,271,358,1240000,Judge Snyder,Houseboat,"Well, I'm back from vacation."
68577,271,359,1242000,Judge Harm,Houseboat,"But I was just about to bang my gavel, making the sentence official."
68578,271,360,1245000,Judge Snyder,Houseboat,"Sorry, I've already put my clown down."
68579,271,361,1249000,Judge Harm,Houseboat,But I was just going to...
68580,271,362,1250000,Judge Snyder,Houseboat,The clown is down.
68582,271,364,1255000,Lisa Simpson,Houseboat,"Judge Snyder? Motion to declare a writ of ""boys will be boys."""
68583,271,365,1259000,Judge Snyder,Houseboat,Motion granted. Case dismissed.
68584,271,366,1261000,Lisa Simpson,Houseboat,Woo hoo!
68586,271,368,1265000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"All right, we got lucky that time, but I want everyone in this family to raise your hand and promise not to break the law for one full year."
68587,271,369,1276000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,We promise.
68588,271,370,1280000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,That was close.
68589,271,371,1283000,Hans Moleman,Simpson Car,Please drive off me...
68591,271,373,1286000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,What's that noise?
68592,271,374,1288000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Just the radio, dear."
