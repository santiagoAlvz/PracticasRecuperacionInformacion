85900,333,1,11000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"I don't understand this game, Bart. How come we have to rake your lawn, while you just get to sit there?"
85901,333,2,33000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Because I'm ""it."""
85902,333,3,33000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, whoever finishes first gets a lemonade..."
85903,333,4,38000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Yay!
85904,333,5,38000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,...for me.
85905,333,6,40000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Later, when we wash his bike, I'm not gonna do a good job."
85906,333,7,45000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,I'm telling Mr. Bart!
85907,333,8,46000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Shhh!
85908,333,9,49000,Sherri Mackleberry,Simpson Home,"Hey, guys."
85909,333,10,52000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh. Girls. You guys need your cootie shots.
85910,333,11,57000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Well, I hate this job, but I love the health plan."
85911,333,12,61000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, ladies. Don't you have a poodle to dress up?"
85912,333,13,64000,Terri Mackleberry,Simpson Home,"Fine, we'll go. We'll find some other way to entertain our boy-crazy cousin who thinks you're cute."
85913,333,14,73000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I wouldn't mind pushin' that in the mud.
85916,333,17,81000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer drunk... but how? Hmmm...
85918,333,19,88000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"'Round and 'round the bottle twirls, I hope it stops on one of the girls."
85919,333,20,96000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,I hope you like the taste of ringworm medicine.
85921,333,22,106000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Eww! I kissed that sad, weird kid!"
85922,333,23,109000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,My beer! You never had a chance to become my urine! Why you little...
85923,333,24,122000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,My first kiss...
85925,333,26,128000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,"Stop it, Homer! There's only one way to settle this -- in Simpson family court."
85926,333,27,132000,Bart Simpson,Backyard,What the hell's that?
85927,333,28,134000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,I got the idea from a now-discredited book on raising children.
85928,333,30,140000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now up, the case of Simpson v. Simpson."
85929,333,31,143000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mr. Simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?"
85930,333,32,149000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son's little league team?
85931,333,33,153000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Permission to treat this witness as hostile.
85932,333,34,156000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I'll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers, kissin' girls and tippin' dinosaurs."
85933,333,35,160000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Your father's first kiss was in high school -- with me.
85934,333,36,164000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, Marge... uh... there uh, was someone before you."
85936,333,38,172000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It was years ago, when I was ten. Back in the '60s, or '50s, or maybe it was the early '70s..."
85938,333,40,181000,10-Year-Old Homer,SUMMER CAMP,"""Underprivileged?"" You pretended we were poor just to get me into camp?"
85939,333,41,184000,Grampa Simpson,SUMMER CAMP,"Uh, yeah, pretended."
85941,333,43,191000,10-Year-Old Lenny,Homer's Cabin,"Hey, you must be Homer! I'm Lenny, and this is Carl."
85942,333,44,195000,10-Year-Old Homer,Homer's Cabin,"Wow, a Negro!"
85943,333,45,196000,10-Year-Old Carl,Homer's Cabin,"We prefer the term ""black."""
85944,333,46,196000,10-Year-Old Homer,Homer's Cabin,So cool.
85945,333,47,199000,Moe Szyslak,Homer's Cabin,"Heya, fellas! I'm Moe. I'm your junior counselor."
85946,333,48,204000,T.J.,Homer's Cabin,"Moe's not really a counselor. His parents dropped him off here like, two years ago and they never came back for him."
85947,333,49,209000,Moe Szyslak,Homer's Cabin,I sleep under upside-down canoes.
85949,333,51,239000,T.J.,Motorboat,"That's the girls' camp, right over there."
85952,333,54,246000,10-Year-Old Homer,Motorboat,I can't wait to meet the girls!
85953,333,55,252000,Boys,Motorboat,Whaa?!
85954,333,56,252000,Moe Szyslak,Motorboat,"That's right, you're workin' in the kitchen. That's how our camp pays the bills."
85955,333,57,258000,10-Year-Old Carl,Motorboat,"What bills? We got no water, no heat... we catch our own breakfast..."
85956,333,58,262000,Moe Szyslak,Motorboat,Twelve kids died at our camp. We need the money to pay lawyers.
85959,333,61,273000,Homer Simpson,GIRLS' KITCHEN,I thought we were gonna play fun games at camp.
85960,333,62,276000,Moe Szyslak,GIRLS' KITCHEN,"Oh, here's one."
85961,333,63,278000,Moe Szyslak,GIRLS' KITCHEN,"It's called ""Stay Outta My Way."" Idiot."
85962,333,64,282000,Girl,GIRLS' KITCHEN,"Oh, no! My retainer!"
85963,333,65,287000,10-Year-Old Homer,GIRLS' KITCHEN,I got it!
85964,333,66,288000,10-Year-Old Homer,GIRLS' KITCHEN,"Ooo la la, a girl with teeth. Me like!"
85965,333,67,296000,Girl,GIRLS' KITCHEN,"Oh, thank you! You sound so sweet."
85966,333,68,301000,10-Year-Old Homer,GIRLS' KITCHEN,That's 'cause I've eaten sixteen pieces of pie.
85969,333,71,307000,10-Year-Old Homer,GIRLS' KITCHEN,"You know, doing dishes has been the best part of camp."
85970,333,72,310000,Girl,GIRLS' KITCHEN,Really? Why?
85971,333,73,312000,10-Year-Old Homer,GIRLS' KITCHEN,Because I talked to you.
85974,333,76,316000,10-Year-Old Homer,Cabin,I couldn't see her through the flaps. But she's my kinda girl...
85975,333,77,320000,10-Year-Old Lenny,Cabin,Tell us more about the flaps.
85976,333,78,322000,10-Year-Old Homer,Cabin,"To me they were the rubbery gates of heaven, because behind them was the girl of my dreams."
85977,333,79,327000,10-Year-Old Carl,Cabin,"Oh man, some day love will come slidin' down my chute."
85978,333,80,331000,10-Year-Old Homer,Cabin,"Well, I can ask if she has any friends, 'cause she wants to meet me tonight."
85979,333,81,335000,10-Year-Old Lenny,Cabin,Way to go.
85980,333,82,335000,10-Year-Old Carl,Cabin,Outta sight!
85981,333,83,337000,10-Year-Old Lenny,Cabin,"Now Homer, if you're gonna go, you'd better take some protection."
85982,333,84,340000,10-Year-Old Homer,Cabin,"Ooh, a switchblade. I see the switch, but where's the blade?"
85983,333,85,346000,10-Year-Old Homer,Cabin,Found it.
85985,333,87,348000,10-Year-Old Homer,Camp Infirmary,An eye patch? But I've got a date tonight!
85986,333,88,350000,Moe Szyslak,Camp Infirmary,"Don't worry, chicks love that kind of thing -- patches, scars, stumps... Everything but zits."
85988,333,90,357000,10-Year-Old Homer,LAKESHORE,"All right, how should I get there?"
85989,333,91,361000,10-Year-Old Homer,LAKESHORE,"Hm, I guess it's row versus wade. And it's my right to choose."
85990,333,92,366000,Captain Horatio McCallister,LAKESHORE,Are ye lookin' to cross the lake which separates ye from she?
85991,333,93,370000,10-Year-Old Homer,LAKESHORE,Who are you?
85992,333,94,371000,Captain Horatio McCallister,LAKESHORE,"The sailing instruct-arrr! And on movie night I run the project-arrr! Only P.G., nothin' R. Yarrr."
85994,333,96,388000,Homer Simpson,GIRLS' BEACH,I couldn't believe my eye.
85996,333,98,392000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"She was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. Uh... until I met your mother, who made that girl look like a Godzilla made of garbage."
85997,333,99,402000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, that girl was me!"
85999,333,101,405000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How romantic. You and Dad were drawn to each other as kids and you didn't even realize it.
86000,333,102,411000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes... and then your father broke my heart. And if I'd known he was you, I never would have married you!"
86001,333,103,418000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, this is so confusing. I'd like a brief recess."
86002,333,104,423000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Granted.
86003,333,105,424000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Whee! Recess!
86005,333,107,428000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Let me get this straight. When you were my age, you had the hots for Mom and didn't even know it? That's cool. Or is it lame? I guess I'll go with lame. You're lame."
86006,333,108,443000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why? Because I only kissed one girl in my whole life? That's still one more than you.
86007,333,109,448000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I've kissed three girls.
86008,333,110,451000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm so lame!
86009,333,111,452000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while.
86010,333,112,455000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that stinks. But I still get to kiss you, right?"
86012,333,114,459000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, why are you so mad?"
86013,333,115,461000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll start from the beginning. The girls' camp was focused on teaching etiquette and deportment. Now that I've captured your interest, let me continue..."
86015,333,117,474000,Ms. Killebrew,GIRLS' CAMP,"By summer's end, I promise you will all walk like ladies, talk like ladies, and hold your liquor like ladies. Now, chin up. Head back. Legs together..."
86016,333,118,485000,Ms. Killebrew,GIRLS' CAMP,"Excellent. Girls, see how Marge's legs are slanted? You make Jackie O. look like a splay-legged milk-horse. Now stand and walk."
86018,333,120,497000,Ms. Killebrew,GIRLS' CAMP,Well done! I'd be proud if you grew up to be my husband's mistress.
86019,333,121,502000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,GIRLS' CAMP,Thank you.
86021,333,123,504000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I used to walk like this all the time... until my tendon snapped. They heard it in Shelbyville!
86022,333,124,512000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Anyhoo... one night we had a special dinner.
86024,333,126,515000,Marge Simpson,GIRLS DINING HALL,We were learning to use all thirty-three forks.
86025,333,127,521000,Ms. Killebrew,GIRLS DINING HALL,"Young lady, that is not an olive fork. Here's a simple trick to help you remember."
86027,333,129,530000,Ms. Killebrew,GIRLS DINING HALL,"Knife and fork together, denied yourself dessert... nice work, Marge. Really."
86028,333,130,538000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,GIRLS DINING HALL,"Oh, no! My retainer!"
86029,333,131,540000,10-Year-Old Homer,GIRLS DINING HALL,I got it!
86032,333,134,547000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,GIRLS' DINING HALL,"I'd thank you, but I don't even know your name."
86033,333,135,550000,Young Helen,GIRLS' DINING HALL,I bet it's something low-rent -- like Billy Bob!
86034,333,136,553000,Patty Bouvier,GIRLS' DINING HALL,Or Homer.
86035,333,137,555000,Cookie Kwan,GIRLS' DINING HALL,"Big, ugly Homer!"
86037,333,139,559000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,GIRLS' DINING HALL,"Oh, I'm sure it's a much nicer name than Homer."
86038,333,140,561000,Homer Simpson,GIRLS' DINING HALL,"Think, Homer, think."
86039,333,141,564000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,GIRLS' DINING HALL,What did you say?
86040,333,142,565000,Homer Simpson,GIRLS' DINING HALL,I'm Elvis. Elvis Jagger. Elvis Jagger Abdul-Jabbar.
86043,333,145,573000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I told my friends I had a date...
86045,333,147,575000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,Marge's Cabin,What should I wear? Should I paint my toes? And what should I do with my hair?
86046,333,148,580000,HELEN,Marge's Cabin,You could iron it.
86047,333,149,582000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,Marge's Cabin,Iron my hair? That's what Leslie Uggams does!
86048,333,150,585000,Bart Simpson,Marge's Cabin,Leslie who?
86049,333,151,587000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Cabin,Uggams!
86050,333,152,588000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,Marge's Cabin,"Ooh, it's really straightening out."
86051,333,153,593000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,Marge's Cabin,I guess I'm going to have to be a brunette tonight.
86052,333,154,596000,Cookie Kwan,Marge's Cabin,"Oh, dear me. One day as a straight-haired brunette. I feel so bad for you. Stupid girl."
86054,333,156,605000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,GIRLS' BEACH,"Please don't be a freak, please don't be a freak--"
86055,333,157,608000,Captain Horatio McCallister,GIRLS' BEACH,"I MET HER ON THE MOUNTAIN, THERE I TOOK HER LIFE / MET HER ON THE MOUNTAIN, STABBED HER WITH MY KNIFE..."
86057,333,159,623000,10-Year-Old Homer,GIRLS' BEACH,Hi.
86058,333,160,627000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,GIRLS' BEACH,He's cute. And he's got an eye patch. I've never seen a boy so mysterious.
86059,333,161,633000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,GIRLS' BEACH,You must be Elvis.
86060,333,162,635000,10-Year-Old Homer,GIRLS' BEACH,"Elvis? What the Hell kind of name is... oh yeah, right."
86062,333,164,639000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,We've heard the same story two times now. Whose side are we gonna hear next? The Sea Captain's?
86063,333,165,645000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Simpson Home,"No, no, I'd best be on me way. I'll just take some Teddy Grahams for the road."
86064,333,166,650000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,There goes a good friend.
86065,333,167,653000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, I'm gonna warn you kids: the next part of the story gets a little ""W-B""..."
86067,333,169,660000,Homer's Mind,PROMONTORY,"Oh man, I want to kiss her. Wait -- I just thought of the greatest move ever!"
86068,333,170,673000,Marge's Mind,PROMONTORY,"Oh no, he yawned -- I'm boring him!"
86069,333,171,677000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,PROMONTORY,"Do you like music? I do. I like Bobby Goldsboro, Gilbert O'Sullivan, Terry Jacks, Parliament but not Funkadelic..."
86070,333,172,685000,Homer's Mind,PROMONTORY,How am I supposed to kiss those things? Interrupt her with something witty!
86071,333,173,688000,10-Year-Old Homer,PROMONTORY,Uhhhh... Ummmm...
86072,333,174,691000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,PROMONTORY,Yes?
86073,333,175,693000,Homer's Mind,PROMONTORY,"Kiss her already. What, are you chicken? Bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok!"
86074,333,176,739000,Marge's Mind,PROMONTORY,Is he making chicken noises?
86078,333,180,769000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Way to go, Dad!"
86079,333,181,771000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The perfect kiss!
86080,333,182,772000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It was pretty delicious.
86081,333,183,774000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It was as satisfying as a million Hallmark cards with all the right-sized envelopes.
86083,333,185,781000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It felt like a cluster bomb wiping out a graveyard full of zombies.
86085,333,187,788000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But then your father showed his true colors.
86086,333,188,790000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Whuh-oh.
86088,333,190,793000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,PROMONTORY,Will I see you again tomorrow?
86089,333,191,795000,10-Year-Old Homer,PROMONTORY,Absolutely. Or my name isn't... whatever I told you it was.
86090,333,192,802000,Marge Simpson,PROMONTORY,"So we arranged to meet again at ""Second Date Rock."""
86093,333,195,818000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,SECOND DATE ROCK,I guess he's not coming.
86095,333,197,824000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It was years before I could trust a boy again.
86096,333,198,830000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's horrible. How could you, Dad?"
86097,333,199,833000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Because he's the kind who kisses and leaves you!
86098,333,200,842000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe you stood Mom up.
86099,333,201,844000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Face it, Lis -- men are dogs. The worse we treat you, the more you want us."
86100,333,202,848000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's not what dogs do.
86101,333,203,851000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ha ha! You said ""dog doo""!"
86102,333,204,854000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"She sure did. Now if Lisa is finished with her shenanigans, I'll tell you why I didn't show up..."
86104,333,206,860000,Homer Simpson,PROMONTORY,We had just finished our first smooch. And I felt a feeling I'd never felt before:
86105,333,207,866000,10-Year-Old Homer,PROMONTORY,I found this stone earlier. I was gonna use it as a nerd-smasher... but I want you to have it.
86106,333,208,873000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,PROMONTORY,Oooh! It looks like a heart.
86107,333,209,876000,10-Year-Old Homer,PROMONTORY,"Hey, you're right. Give it back! No, I still want you to have it. But every time you smash a nerd with it, think of me."
86108,333,210,885000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,PROMONTORY,I will.
86109,333,211,889000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,PROMONTORY,"See you tomorrow night, okay?"
86110,333,212,893000,10-Year-Old Homer,PROMONTORY,"What a kiss. If I died now, I'd die happy."
86111,333,213,900000,10-Year-Old Homer,PROMONTORY,"...ooh, what a view..."
86112,333,214,906000,10-Year-Old Homer,PROMONTORY,"Good ol' patch, you saved my life!"
86115,333,217,919000,Security Guard,LAKESHORE,"So, you thought you could make a break for it, didya? Well, no one ever escapes from fat camp."
86116,333,218,926000,Security Guard,LAKESHORE,'Cause the only way out is up a gentle slope.
86117,333,219,932000,10-Year-Old Homer,LAKESHORE,What the? Fat camp?
86118,333,220,941000,10-Year-Old Homer,LAKESHORE,I don't belong here!
86119,333,221,943000,Security Guard,LAKESHORE,Your boy bosoms tell a different tale.
86121,333,223,951000,Security Guard,Fat Camp,"Okay, take a break, ladies."
86122,333,224,957000,Security Guard,Fat Camp,No eating the grass!
86123,333,225,960000,Chief Wiggum,Fat Camp,He didn't say nothin' about this poison oak.
86124,333,226,964000,Chief Wiggum,Fat Camp,"Sweet, sweet poison. Uh-oh."
86126,333,227,973000,10-Year-Old Homer,Fat Camp,"I've gotta go, I've got a date!"
86127,333,228,978000,Security Guard,Fat Camp,"Yeah, you've got a date... with a skinless chicken breast."
86128,333,229,985000,10-Year-Old Homer,Fat Camp,Somewhere out there she's waiting for me.
86130,333,231,992000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,GIRLS' CAMP PAY PHONE,Hello... I'd like to speak to Elvis Jagger Abdul-Jabbar.
86132,333,233,997000,Moe Szyslak,BOYS' CAMP PAYPHONE,"Hey, don't you try and prank me with a fake name -- I'll rip out your intestines and use 'em to make a lanyard... Hello? Hello?"
86133,333,234,1006000,Moe Szyslak,BOYS' CAMP PAYPHONE,And that's the origin of that.
86135,333,236,1011000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,GIRLS' PAYPHONE,That boy I kissed wouldn't even tell me his real name!
86136,333,237,1014000,Patty Bouvier,GIRLS' PAYPHONE,"Typical. All boys want the same thing -- to kiss until they're hot and heavy, then vamoose."
86137,333,238,1021000,Selma Bouvier,GIRLS' PAYPHONE,Trust us. We know everything about boys. Except what they look like below the waist.
86138,333,239,1026000,Patty Bouvier,GIRLS' PAYPHONE,I have some theories based on a G.I. Joe I bought.
86139,333,240,1029000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,GIRLS' PAYPHONE,"Well, I never want to date a boy again!"
86143,333,244,1038000,Cookie Kwan,Marge's Cabin,Are you leaving camp because of that boy? 'Cause that's what I've been telling everybody. You're also pregnant.
86144,333,245,1044000,TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE,Marge's Cabin,I just can't stay here -- everything reminds me of him.
86147,333,248,1058000,Comic Book Guy,Fat Camp,"Oh, the pain. Man was not meant to sit up."
86148,333,249,1064000,Security Guard,Fat Camp,"We've got an emergency here. We need ten CCs, pronto. And by CCs I mean cupcakes."
86149,333,250,1071000,Guard On Walkie-talkie,Fat Camp,"I know what you mean, Bill. I've worked here longer than you."
86150,333,251,1078000,10-Year-Old Homer,Fat Camp,Now's my chance.
86151,333,252,1087000,10-Year-Old Homer,Fat Camp,Love... conquers... all.
86152,333,253,1093000,10-Year-Old Homer,Fat Camp,Snake!
86154,333,255,1101000,Patty Bouvier,GIRLS' CAMP,Bye-bye! Thank God they're gone.
86155,333,256,1105000,Selma Bouvier,GIRLS' CAMP,I can't believe I went five minutes without one of these dream sticks.
86156,333,257,1114000,Homer Simpson,GIRLS' CAMP,"Hey, have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl?"
86158,333,258,1117000,Selma Bouvier,GIRLS' CAMP,"If you are who I think you are, that girl is gone and she never wants to see you again."
86159,333,259,1123000,Homer Simpson,GIRLS' CAMP,She wouldn't do that -- we shared something special.
86160,333,260,1126000,Patty Bouvier,GIRLS' CAMP,"What, just 'cause she smooched you?"
86161,333,261,1133000,Patty Bouvier,GIRLS' CAMP,Was that special?
86162,333,262,1135000,Homer Simpson,GIRLS' CAMP,No.
86163,333,263,1143000,Homer Simpson,GIRLS' CAMP,I just blew my first chance at true love.
86165,333,265,1147000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And now that my special girl has heard the truth, I know she'll forgive me."
86166,333,266,1152000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Earth to special girl? You forgive me, right?"
86167,333,267,1155000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess so.
86168,333,268,1157000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, I think we'll go to bed now."
86169,333,269,1159000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"What are you doing? If they fight in front of us, we might get new bikes!"
86170,333,270,1165000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, when you nurse a hurt for thirty years, it doesn't go away in an instant."
86171,333,271,1171000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What about now?
86173,333,273,1174000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What about now?
86174,333,274,1176000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Homer."
86175,333,275,1179000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What about now?
86176,333,276,1181000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Homer."
86177,333,277,1182000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What about now?
86178,333,278,1183000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Homer."
86179,333,279,1185000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I'm really sorry I hurt you. But I've done way worse stuff since then: there was the gun I hid from you, the time I sued the church, ruining Lisa's wedding in the future... remember that?"
86180,333,280,1198000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I know this shouldn't bother me, but a girl only has one first love. I guess it didn't mean that much to you."
86181,333,281,1206000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's not true! I thought about that girl every day of my life... until I met you.
86182,333,282,1212000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I wish there was some way I could believe that.
86183,333,283,1215000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right. This is my memory box. I haven't opened it in thirty years.
86184,333,284,1221000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, a letter from my old pen pal. Someday I'll write you back, Osama. Ah, here's what I'm lookin' for."
86185,333,285,1230000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie! You did care."
86186,333,286,1233000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I sure did. I kept it right next to my IBM stock... king.
86187,333,287,1240000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I kept my heart too.
86189,333,288,1242000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because somehow you realized I was a good guy after all?
86190,333,289,1246000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, as a reminder of the hurtful things men can do."
86192,333,291,1251000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But now it can have a second meaning.
86193,333,292,1257000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Elvis."
86194,333,293,1259000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, anonymous girl who turned out to be Marge."
