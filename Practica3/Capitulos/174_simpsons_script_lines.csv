39231,174,2,11000,TV Announcer,TV ROOM,"...and now, the thrilling conclusion of ""Colonel Dracula Joins the Navy."""
39233,174,4,42000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,"Lisa, what in the heck are you doing?"
39234,174,5,51000,Lisa Simpson,KITCHEN,"Oh, it's for my Junior Achievers Club. We're trying to earn money by recycling."
39235,174,6,55000,Bart Simpson,KITCHEN,"Aw, recycling is useless, Lis. Once the sun burns out, this planet is doomed. You're just making sure we spend our last days using inferior products."
39236,174,7,62000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,"Well, I think it's a great idea."
39237,174,8,66000,Lisa Simpson,KITCHEN,"Mom, Mom, you're mixing polyethylene with polyurethane!"
39238,174,9,71000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,Marge!
39239,174,10,72000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,"Well, I'm sorry!"
39240,174,11,73000,Lisa Simpson,KITCHEN,And you have to cut these up first. Otherwise animals get caught in them.
39241,174,12,77000,Bart Simpson,KITCHEN,Only the stupid ones.
39242,174,13,78000,Lisa Simpson,KITCHEN,I could still use more paper.
39243,174,14,80000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Hey, I know where there's lots of paper!"
39245,174,16,87000,Lisa Simpson,KITCHEN,Dad! You're not supposed to have fun recycling. This is serious.
39246,174,17,91000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Oh, okay."
39248,174,19,96000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"What a load of garbage! I'm ecstatic. With the money from this, we're within striking distance of our trip to Albany."
39250,174,21,106000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Super. Now, let's give a big Junior Achievers welcome to our guest speaker -- I know he can teach us a lot about business -- Mr. C. Montgomery Burns!"
39251,174,22,120000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,"I'll keep it short and sweet. Family, religion, friendship: these are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. When opportunity knocks, you don't want to be driving to the maternity hospital or sitting in some phony baloney church. Or synagogue. Questions?"
39252,174,23,142000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I'm going to take advantage of this rare opportunity, even if you children aren't interested. Uh... Which do you think is more important: hard work or stick-to-it-iveness?"
39253,174,24,152000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,Are there any real questions?
39254,174,25,153000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes. Um, does your plant have a recycling program?"
39255,174,26,157000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,Ree-cyyy-cling?
39256,174,27,170000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that term, you adorable little ragamuffin."
39257,174,28,174000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Hmm. You've never heard of recycling? It means to reuse things to conserve our natural resources.
39258,174,29,180000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, so Mother Nature needs a favor? Well, maybe she should have thought of that when she was besetting us with droughts and floods and poison monkeys. Nature started the fight for survival and now she wants to quit because she's losing? Well, I say ""hard cheese!"""
39259,174,30,192000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,But nature's not our enemy.
39260,174,31,194000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,Well surely you agree we can do without her.
39261,174,32,195000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,No! I don't agree!
39262,174,33,197000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,No?
39263,174,34,198000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Elementary School,How dare you question Mr. Burns?
39264,174,35,200000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,"I'll handle it, Smithers. Shut up, little girl. If I had spent my life listening to Dismal Dora's like you, I wouldn't be worth two hundred million dollars today."
39265,174,36,209000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"But according to your most recent biography, you only have one hundred million dollars today."
39266,174,37,217000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Elementary School,"Um, actually, sir, it's uh, considerably less than that."
39267,174,38,225000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,"I, um... have to go."
39268,174,39,230000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Monty Burns, everybody!"
39270,174,41,234000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I've called you all here because I need some honest answers. What is my current financial situation?
39271,174,42,239000,Stockbroker,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Great.
39272,174,43,239000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Great.
39273,174,44,241000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I hear great.
39274,174,45,241000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"All right. Well, let's have a look at my stock portfolio."
39275,174,46,246000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hmm... Confederated Slave Holdings. How is that doing?
39276,174,47,250000,Stockbroker,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It's uh... uh... steady.
39277,174,48,253000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I'm sure all your stocks are doing well, sir. After all, you chose them."
39278,174,49,257000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, let's get out the old stock ticker and have a look..."
39280,174,50,263000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Eh, here's where I stopped checking it last time: September nineteen twenty ni-- Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Smithers, why didn't you tell me about this market crash?!"
39281,174,51,276000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Um, well, sir, it happened 25 years before I was born."
39282,174,52,279000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, that's your excuse for everything. I've got to do something to get my money back quickly. This calls for an aggressive trading strategy."
39283,174,53,286000,ADVISORS & SMITHERS,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Good idea, sir."
39284,174,54,288000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Take fifty percent of my money and put it in the blue chips: Trans-Atlantic Zeppelin, Amalgamated Spats, Congreve's Inflammable Powders, U.S. Hay... and sink the rest into that up-and-coming Baltimore Opera Hat Company. That should set things right again, eh, boys?"
39285,174,55,301000,ADVISORS & SMITHERS,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes, sir! / Absolutely! / Genius! / Can't go wrong with Congreve's."
39287,174,57,311000,Seymour Skinner,Uriah's Heap Recycling Center,"A half ton of newspaper and all we get is seventy-five cents? Huh, that won't even cover the gas I used to go to the store to buy the twine to tie up the bundles."
39288,174,58,319000,Hippie,Uriah's Heap Recycling Center,"It sounds like you're working for your car. Simplify, man."
39289,174,59,327000,Seymour Skinner,Uriah's Heap Recycling Center,Oh! Well!
39290,174,60,327000,Seymour Skinner,Uriah's Heap Recycling Center,"Sorry, kids, the trip to Albany is off, and there's to be no more recycling."
39291,174,61,332000,Lisa Simpson,Uriah's Heap Recycling Center,But we didn't do that badly. We collected enough paper to save one whole tree.
39293,174,63,340000,Ralph Wiggum,Uriah's Heap Recycling Center,"Oh, mommy, help!"
39295,174,65,344000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Are you saying my money's all gone?!
39296,174,66,346000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,But... I made all the right moves! Didn't I?
39297,174,67,351000,ADVISORS & SMITHERS,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yes! / Absolutely! / Every move a right one!
39298,174,68,354000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I see it all now! You're just a bunch of yesmen! I was making the wrong moves and you were too gutless to tell me. Isn't that right?
39299,174,69,362000,ADVISORS & SMITHERS,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes. / Absolutely. / Dead on, sir."
39300,174,70,364000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Then I'll fix this myself. Smithers, take out another mortgage on the plant."
39301,174,71,367000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"The bank has already foreclosed on the plant, and your house, sir."
39302,174,72,372000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,But... what will I do?
39303,174,73,375000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, the first thing you'll have to do is move out of the bank's house. I'll help you pack."
39305,174,75,389000,Worker,Burns Manor,Go on! Get outta here!
39306,174,76,397000,Real Estate Agent,Burns Manor,"...and I'm sure a pro wrestler such as yourself will appreciate all the closet space, Hitman."
39307,174,77,404000,"Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart",Burns Manor,Eww. This place has got old man stink.
39309,174,79,409000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"Don't listen to him, sir. You've got an enchanting musk."
39310,174,80,413000,Real Estate Agent,Burns Manor,...and you wouldn't even be the only wrestler in the neighborhood. The Shrieking Sheik lives just three doors away.
39312,174,82,420000,"Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart",Burns Manor,"Hey, hey, I'll take it."
39313,174,83,425000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Uh, would it be all right if I kept this portrait? To remind me of better times?"
39314,174,84,433000,"Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart",Burns Manor,Why would I want a picture of a pitiful pencil-necked geek?
39315,174,85,437000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Why indeed...
39316,174,86,447000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"I'll make sure he forwards your Social Security check, Sir."
39317,174,87,450000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Excellent.
39319,174,89,455000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you didn't tell me Mr. Burns went broke and lost the nuclear power plant."
39320,174,90,459000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now I can't remember every little thing that happens in my day.
39321,174,91,463000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You told me about that candy bar you found three times!
39322,174,92,466000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You found a candy bar?
39323,174,93,467000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, yes! Gather 'round, my son, and I shall tell you a tale..."
39324,174,94,471000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I normally don't laugh at other people's misfortunes, but on behalf of the recycling community: HA! It couldn't happen to anyone more deserving."
39325,174,95,478000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"They're not going to close the plant, are they?"
39326,174,96,481000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, the bank put Lenny in charge."
39328,174,98,486000,Lenny Leonard,Burns's Former Office,"Uhhh, attention everybody. Work harder. Bye!"
39332,174,101,501000,Waylon Smithers,Smithers's Apartment,"Well, sir, I have to get to work. Lenny's a real bear on tardiness."
39333,174,102,505000,C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers's Apartment,Are there any chores I can do?
39334,174,103,514000,Waylon Smithers,Smithers's Apartment,"Uh, no, no. You just stay here and maintain your dignity."
39335,174,104,526000,C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers's Apartment,"Ah, here's a chance to earn my keep. I will go out and get these items from the food jobber."
39337,174,106,536000,C. Montgomery Burns,City Bus,"Grocery store, please!"
39338,174,107,542000,C. Montgomery Burns,City Bus,I am riding on a bus.
39339,174,108,544000,Barney Gumble,City Bus,"Hey, aren't you that guy everybody hates?"
39340,174,109,547000,C. Montgomery Burns,City Bus,"Oh my, no! I'm Monty Burns!"
39342,174,111,554000,C. Montgomery Burns,Supermarket,I'm shopping.
39343,174,112,559000,C. Montgomery Burns,Supermarket,Oh my... I wonder which is the cereal for me...
39344,174,113,564000,C. Montgomery Burns,Supermarket,"Uh, oh, excuse me, can you tell me where I might find the ""Burns-O's""?"
39345,174,114,568000,Krusty the Clown,Supermarket,"Sorry, Pops. They don't put nobodies on cereal boxes."
39346,174,115,572000,C. Montgomery Burns,Supermarket,"Hmm. Well, I suppose this one looks a bit like me..."
39347,174,116,583000,C. Montgomery Burns,Supermarket,"Oh, thank you, Shoppie. I... I ventured in to search for milk when the door snapped shut behind me."
39348,174,117,588000,Clerk,Supermarket,"Yeah, those dairy cases are death traps."
39349,174,118,591000,C. Montgomery Burns,Supermarket,"Ketchup, catsup... ketchup, catsup... ketchup, catsup... Ugh. I'm in way over my head."
39350,174,119,603000,Clerk,Supermarket,He's talking to the ketchup now! Burns is sure acting nutty.
39351,174,120,607000,Manager,Supermarket,Maybe going broke and losing his plant destroyed his brain.
39352,174,121,611000,Manager,Supermarket,"Could you come along with us, sir?"
39353,174,122,613000,C. Montgomery Burns,Supermarket,Are you here to solve my ketchup problem?
39354,174,123,616000,Clerk,Supermarket,Yes. That's right.
39356,174,125,623000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,Wh... where are you taking me? What's happening?
39357,174,126,625000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Relax. You've gone off your nut, so we're stuffing you into an old folks home. Those, uh, store guys signed the commitment papers."
39358,174,127,633000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,But I'm shopping!
39360,174,129,639000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here you go, honey. That's about all the recycling I can handle today."
39361,174,130,644000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, if you just drink one more, I'll have a full bag."
39331,174,131,647000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, but Daddy doesn't feel so good."
39362,174,132,651000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,There's got to be more trash around here somewhere...
39363,174,133,654000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, why don't you try the old folks home? They practically live in their own filth!"
39364,174,134,661000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, Dad!"
39365,174,135,662000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're welcome, honey."
39367,174,137,663000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"That's the activity room. We're not allowed in there. That's the library. Not allowed in there, either. And don't even think about going in the game room..."
39368,174,138,673000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Egad, man, how are we supposed to pass the time?"
39369,174,139,676000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Best bet is to stake yourself out a good spot at the starin' window...
39371,174,141,693000,Activity Coordinator,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Come on, Mr. Burns! Join the fun!"
39372,174,142,697000,Activity Coordinator,Springfield Retirement Castle,That's the spirit!
39373,174,143,701000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,So this is how the Monty Burns saga ends... If I hadn't surrounded myself with those spineless yes men...
39374,174,144,709000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"What do you mean you don't have anything to recycle? You must have some magazines, or newspapers."
39375,174,145,714000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,"That voice! That shrill, disagreeable voice! It's her!"
39376,174,146,718000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Sorry, we're not allowed to read newspapers. They angry up the blood."
39377,174,147,723000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,You! The troublemaking girl!
39378,174,148,725000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"My name is Lisa, Mr. Burns. Lisa Simpson."
39379,174,149,728000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,"It doesn't matter what your name is, you idiot! What I want to know is: will you help me get my money back?"
39380,174,150,732000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Ha! I'd never help you. You're the worst man in the world.
39381,174,151,735000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,Yes! That's the kind of moxie I'm looking for. You're hired!
39382,174,152,739000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"No, I'm not!"
39383,174,153,740000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Sir, I'm so sorry my grocer committed you. We'll never shop there again."
39384,174,154,744000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Not now, Smithers. I've got an empire to rebuild, and the person who's going to help me is... that girl!"
39385,174,155,756000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,Please!
39386,174,156,757000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,No.
39387,174,157,765000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,Please!
39388,174,158,766000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,No.
39389,174,159,770000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,Please!
38971,174,160,770000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,No.
39390,174,162,777000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Sir, we've never met before, but my name is Mr. Burns and I want your daughter to help make me rich again."
39391,174,163,783000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean Maggie?
39392,174,164,786000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Ah, the baby who shot me. No, I was referring to your other daughter."
39393,174,165,791000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa! You have a guest!
39394,174,166,794000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, um, how's life in the gutter?"
39395,174,167,798000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You again.
39396,174,168,801000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"I've realized the error of my ways, Lisa. I need someone with your integrity to help me. Please don't refuse this poor old man."
39397,174,169,812000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh... if I did agree to help you, you could only earn money by doing good, socially responsible things. Nothing evil."
39398,174,170,822000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"""Nothing evil."" That's exactly the kind of radical thinking I need! It's a deal."
39399,174,171,831000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"See that, boy? Why aren't you making any business deals?"
39400,174,172,834000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll do it this afternoon...
39402,174,174,841000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD BAY,You mean there are actually people who will pay good money for garbage?
39403,174,175,845000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BAY,"Not good money, really. Each can'll get you a nickel."
39404,174,176,848000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD BAY,"Oh, don't pooh-pooh a nickel, Lisa. A nickel will buy you a steak and kidney pie, a cup of coffee, a slice of cheesecake, and a newsreel! With enough change leftover to ride the trolley from Battery Park to the Polo Grounds."
39405,174,177,861000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BAY,There's a can.
39406,174,178,866000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BAY,You have to cut these six-pack holders up. Otherwise fish get trapped in them.
39407,174,179,870000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD BAY,I see...
39408,174,180,875000,Nelson Muntz,SPRINGFIELD BAY,Haw haw!
39413,174,185,891000,C. Montgomery Burns,RECYCLING CENTER,"My first dollar! Thanks to you, Lisa, and our hemp-smoking friend. Shine on, you crazy diamond."
39414,174,186,899000,Hippie,RECYCLING CENTER,"Sounds like somebody's living in the past. Contemporize, man!"
39415,174,187,904000,C. Montgomery Burns,RECYCLING CENTER,"Well, Lisa, as my advisor, you're entitled to ten percent."
39418,174,188,908000,Lisa Simpson,RECYCLING CENTER,"Oh, I'm not doing this for the money. I'm just happy knowing that future generations will enjoy unspoiled median strips and pristine highway embankments."
39419,174,189,918000,C. Montgomery Burns,RECYCLING CENTER,There's a can.
39420,174,190,919000,Kent Brockman,RECYCLING CENTER,"And from our ""It's Funny When It Happens To Them"" file... Remember millionaire C. Montgomery Burns? The man who blocked out our sun, ran over a local boy, and stole Christmas from 1981 to 1985? Well, guess who's flat broke and picking up trash for a living?"
39421,174,191,933000,Homer Simpson,RECYCLING CENTER,"Please be Flanders, please be Flanders, please be Flanders..."
39422,174,192,936000,Kent Brockman,RECYCLING CENTER,"Excuse me, Mr. Burns, now that you're completely ruined, how do you feel?"
39423,174,193,940000,C. Montgomery Burns,RECYCLING CENTER,"Excellent. I'm on my way back to the top. I've turned these cans into ""can do!"""
39424,174,194,943000,Kent Brockman,RECYCLING CENTER,"Well, you smell terrible! Good luck to you, sir."
39425,174,195,949000,Marge Simpson,RECYCLING CENTER,"Wow, he went from stinking rich to just plain stinking."
39426,174,196,955000,Homer Simpson,RECYCLING CENTER,"Good one, Mom! / You're so bad, honey."

39433,174,203,987000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Mr. Burns, if you want people to do a good job, you can't bully them. You have to show them they're appreciated."
39434,174,204,993000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, capital idea, partner. People, if we meet this week's quota, I'll take you to the most duck-filled pond you ever sat by."

39443,174,213,1033000,Moe Szyslak,RECYCLING PLANT,"Aw, ain't that cute? Makes Li'l Debbie look like a pile of puke!"

39445,174,215,1046000,Lisa Simpson,RECYCLING PLANT,I'd love to -- Partner!
39447,174,217,1049000,C. Montgomery Burns,Li'l Lisa Recycling Plant,The whole plant is a environmentally-sound. It's powered by old newspapers. The machinery is made entirely of used cans. And the windows are from the old liquor bottles we collected.
39448,174,218,1060000,C. Montgomery Burns,Li'l Lisa Recycling Plant,I thought I told you to stop licking my windows!
39449,174,219,1063000,Barney Gumble,Li'l Lisa Recycling Plant,"I know... You told me. And when I woke up this morning, I said: ""Barney, you're not gonna let that man.... """

39453,174,223,1083000,C. Montgomery Burns,RECYCLING PLANT,I couldn't watch your demonstration of the fish caught in the plastic rings without getting an idea. Look out over the water.
39454,174,224,1094000,C. Montgomery Burns,RECYCLING PLANT,"I figured if one six-pack holder will catch one fish, a million sewn together will catch a million fish. Watch."
39455,174,225,1104000,Lisa Simpson,RECYCLING PLANT,What's going on?
39456,174,226,1105000,C. Montgomery Burns,RECYCLING PLANT,I call it the Burns Omni-Net. It sweeps the sea clean.

39462,174,232,1150000,C. Montgomery Burns,RECYCLING PLANT,"I don't understand. Pigs need food, engines need coolant, dynamiters need dynamite. I'm supplying it to them, at a tidy profit, and not a single sea creature was wasted. You inspired it all, Li'l Lisa."

39472,174,242,1222000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,"Simpson, what are you doing here? Why aren't you at work?"
39473,174,243,1224000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I made a bad mistake and Lenny sent me home to think about what I did. But I don't remember what it was so I'm watching TV.
39474,174,244,1230000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,"Well, Lenny's reign of terror is over. Mr. Burns bought the plant back this morning, and..."
39475,174,245,1234000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Enough chit-chat. I need to see Lisa.

39481,174,251,1259000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow! I've never seen so much money! Oh, but I can't accept that, knowing where it came from. Can I, Mom?"
39482,174,252,1272000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, you do whatever your conscience tells you."
39484,174,254,1284000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You did the right thing, sweetheart."
39486,174,256,1291000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Emergency Room,"Well, that's the first case I've ever seen of a man suffering four simultaneous heart attacks."
39487,174,257,1296000,Lisa Simpson,Emergency Room,"I'm sorry, Dad."
39416,174,258,1298000,Homer Simpson,Emergency Room,It's all right. I understand. But we really could have used that twelve thousand dollars.
