27312,129,1,41000,Waylon Smithers,Smithers's Apartment,Ugh. My mouth tastes like an ashtray.
27313,129,2,50000,C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers's Apartment,"Smithers, wait your turn. There's plenty of hot water for all."
27314,129,3,54000,Waylon Smithers,Smithers's Apartment,"Sir, you weren't shot? It was all a dream."
27315,129,4,60000,C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers's Apartment,"That's right. The year is 1965, and you and I are undercover detectives on the hot-rod circuit. Now let's burn rubber, baby!"
27316,129,5,76000,Announcer,Smithers's Apartment,"""Speedway Squad!"" In color."
27317,129,6,78000,Waylon Smithers,Smithers's Apartment,"Wait, that was all a dream. Hey, then maybe I haven't become a hideous, drunken wreck!"
27318,129,7,85000,Waylon Smithers,Smithers's Apartment,Oh.
27319,129,8,87000,Kent Brockman,Smithers's Apartment,"Dozens of people are gunned down each day in Springfield, but until now, none of them was important. I'm Kent Brockman. At 3 p.m. Friday, local autocrat C. Montgomery Burns was shot following a tense confrontation at Town Hall."
27320,129,9,100000,Kent Brockman,Smithers's Apartment,"Burns was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He was then transferred to a better hospital, where doctors upgraded his condition to ""alive."""
27321,129,10,103000,Kent Brockman,Smithers's Apartment,"Now, let's talk to Police Chief Wiggum."
27322,129,11,110000,Chief Wiggum,Smithers's Apartment,"Oh, hiya, Kent. Ah, right now we are questioning two witnesses who were in the vicinity at the time."
27324,129,13,118000,Lou,Springfield Police Station,Didja see this guy? Was he anywhere near the parking lot when Burns got shot?
27326,129,15,123000,Eddie,Springfield Police Station,"Aw, it's no use. They ain't talkin'."
27328,129,17,127000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Everyone in Springfield had a reason to shoot Mr. Burns. Even us.
27329,129,18,132000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, he broke your dog's legs. Grampa, he destroyed your home. And Dad, well, you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name."
27330,129,19,139000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Berserk is right!! May I have some iced tea, please?"
27331,129,20,143000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aren't we forgetting someone, Sister Suspect?"
27332,129,21,147000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I was just getting to me. Because of Mr. Burns, they canceled my jazz program, and my friend Tito Puente got fired. But I could never shoot someone."
27333,129,22,155000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Could so!
27334,129,23,155000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Could not!
27335,129,24,155000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Could so!
27336,129,25,155000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Could not!
27337,129,26,157000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Could so!
27338,129,27,157000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Could not!
27339,129,28,157000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Could so!
27340,129,29,158000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Could not!
27341,129,30,158000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids! Kids! Kids! As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers."
27342,129,31,163000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The police already have a suspect. It's Mr. Smithers.
27343,129,32,166000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure, Smithers! / He's a good suspect! / Oh, I bet he's the one! / Definitely Smithers!"
27344,129,33,169000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah! Smingers did it! Case closed. Now, where's my hat? I'm going to the outhouse."
27345,129,34,174000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We don't have an outhouse.
27346,129,35,176000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,My tool shed! Oh Dad!
27348,129,37,180000,Waylon Smithers,Downtown Street,"Could I have shot Mr. Burns in a drunken rage? No. No, not me. I know in my heart I..."
27349,129,38,185000,Smithers's Brain,Downtown Street,"My gun! And it's been recently fired! Wait, I remember leaving the town meeting..."
27350,129,39,195000,Waylon Smithers,Downtown Street,"I must've run into Mr. Burns outside, and..."
27352,129,41,200000,Waylon Smithers,Downtown Street,Mr. Burns! What have I done?!
27354,129,43,214000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Hey, Homer, us hotheads here is gonna go tear down Burns' sun blockin' machine. You wanna come with?"
27355,129,44,220000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sure! I've had it up to here with these damn rickets!
27357,129,46,234000,Groundskeeper Willie,Mt. Springfield,"Pull, Duchess, pull!"
27358,129,47,244000,Krusty the Clown,Mt. Springfield,"Um... Uh, what town did we just crush?"
27359,129,48,247000,Seymour Skinner,Mt. Springfield,Shelbyville.
27360,129,49,250000,Townspeople,Mt. Springfield,Yay!!
27362,129,51,251000,Waylon Smithers,Downtown Street,"Oh, this guilt is driving me mad. I've got to tell someone."
27363,129,53,258000,Waylon Smithers,Cathedral,"Father, I'm not a Catholic, but... well, I tried to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade... Anyway, I've got a... rather large sin to confess. I'm the one who... who shot Mr. Burns."
27364,129,54,275000,Chief Wiggum,Cathedral,"That's all I needed to hear. Boy, this thing works great."
27366,129,56,279000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Police Station,The man became consumed by greed. He'd steal from anyone.
27367,129,57,283000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Police Station,This isn't a rival company you're battling with. It's a school. People won't stand for it.
27368,129,58,287000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Police Station,Pish-posh. It will be like taking candy from a baby.
27369,129,59,291000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Police Station,"Say, that sounds like a larf."
27370,129,60,294000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Police Station,"And when he tried to steal our sunlight, he crossed that line between everyday villainy and cartoonish super-villainy."
27371,129,61,302000,SUPER-VILLAIN,Springfield Police Station,Bah! He was a rank amateur compared to Dr. Colossus!
27372,129,62,310000,SUPER-VILLAIN,Springfield Police Station,Ow. When is my lawyer coming?
27373,129,63,317000,Reporters,Springfield Police Station,"Mr. Smithers! / Smithers! / Over here, Waylon! /"
27374,129,64,317000,Dave Shutton,Springfield Police Station,"Dave Shutton, Springfield Daily Shopper. Who are you? Where are you going?"
27375,129,65,322000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Police Station,"Oh, do your research, Shutton! Ah, Kent Brockman, Channel Six News. How does it feel to be accused of the attempted murder of your boss and mentor?"
27376,129,66,329000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Police Station,"Kent, I, I feel about as low as Madonna when she found out she missed Tailhook."
27378,129,68,334000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Police Station,"I'm going to say ""ouch!"" for Madonna."
27380,129,70,337000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Office,Hey! That's my Madonna gag! That guy stole my gag!
27381,129,71,340000,Sideshow Mel,Krusty's Office,"And you stole it from last Friday's episode of ""Pardon My Zinger."""
27382,129,72,344000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Office,"Stole, made-up, what's the difference?"
27383,129,73,347000,Sideshow Mel,Krusty's Office,"Mr. Smithers must have seen that program, too. He never misses it. Hm."
27384,129,74,352000,Sideshow Mel,Krusty's Office,"At the town meeting, he mentioned that he watched Comedy Central. I made sure to note that, as it seemed quite unusual. Ye Gods. To the police station, Krusty!"
27386,129,76,363000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Police Station,"I am Melvin Van Horne, and this is my associate Herschel Krustofsky."
27135,129,77,368000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Police Station,Hey hey.
27387,129,78,369000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Police Station,"Officer, you have arrested an innocent man!"
27388,129,79,372000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Really? Aw, jeez."
27389,129,80,374000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"All right, Colossus, you're free to go. But stay away from Death Mountain."
27390,129,81,377000,SUPER-VILLAIN,Springfield Police Station,All my stuff is there.
27391,129,82,381000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Police Station,"I was referring to Waylon Smithers. Mr. Burns was shot Friday at 3:00 p.m. -- the very time that Smithers was at home watching ""Pardon My Zinger."" So you see, he couldn't have done it."
27392,129,83,392000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Police Station,Yes! You're right! I remember now! I - I watched that entire show! In fact...
27393,129,84,398000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Police Station,I left the town meeting early so I could get home in time.
27394,129,85,402000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Police Station,"Agh. I've gotta run, or I'll miss the opening rank-out."
27396,129,87,409000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Police Station,"Slow down! The sidewalk's fer reg'lar walkin', not fer fancy-walkin'."
27397,129,88,413000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Police Station,Out of my way. I'm in a hurry.
27398,129,89,416000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Police Station,"You simmer down, I'll letcha go."
27399,129,90,419000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Police Station,"So... Instead of wounding an evil old man, I may have killed an innocent old man. That's much worse."
27400,129,91,427000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Police Station,"About fifty-thousand volts worse, if you know what I mean. Eeeeh! Bzzzt! Sizzle..."
27401,129,92,433000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Wait a minute. If a second old geezer got shot, how come nobody reported it?"
27403,129,94,441000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Uh, hi. Um, can we take a look at your leg?"
27404,129,95,447000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yeah, that's real spruce. You like it?"
27405,129,96,451000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Phew. Thank God. Sir, I, I only hope you can forgive me for shooting your wooden leg."
27406,129,97,457000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,You shot who in the what now?
27407,129,98,460000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Okay, Smithers, you're free to go. And you, one question: do you know who shot Mr. Burns, cause we are really up the creek on this one. ."
27409,129,100,471000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"And with the prime suspect cleared and found completely innocent, we must now ask ourselves: ""Who could possibly be as bloodthirsty as Waylon Smithers?"""
27410,129,101,479000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess it's never the most likely suspect.
27412,129,102,482000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, Mom, in 95% of cases, it is. The rest of the time, it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason."
27413,129,103,489000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I had a damn good reason. He could never remember my name..."
27414,129,104,493000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Who the devil are you?
27415,129,105,498000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson!
27417,129,107,502000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted murder."
27418,129,108,506000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Eh, you never know what you're capable of. I never thought I could shoot down a German plane -- but last year, I proved myself wrong."
27419,129,109,515000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Nancy Drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends. And I've got an inquisitive temperament! Maybe I could help solve this!
27420,129,110,525000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I think you're a little young to be investigating an attempted murder. Why don't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer?
27421,129,111,533000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Who wants chocolate ice cream?
27422,129,112,535000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Me! Me! Me, me!"
27424,129,114,538000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Okay boys, we've got a clue - the bullet they took out of Burns. Now, let's discuss the, um..."
27425,129,115,544000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Motive.
27426,129,116,547000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Mr. Burns is the richest man in town. Maybe it was about money.
27427,129,117,552000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"That's some good thinking, Lou."
27428,129,118,553000,Lou,Springfield Police Station,"Thanks, Chief."
27429,129,119,554000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Hey! I said that. My name is Lisa Simpson, and I made a chart of all the suspects in the Burns case. Look."
27430,129,120,559000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Mr. Burns hurt all these people financially: nightclub owner Moe Szyslak. His bar was closed because of Burns' negligence; liquor connoisseur Barney Gumble. When Moe's closed, Barney lost his only means of support -- sucking coins out of the Love Tester machine."
27431,129,121,575000,Eddie,Springfield Police Station,That's a real good way to get sick.
27432,129,122,576000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Dedicated educator Principal Seymour Skinner. His school lost millions when Burns pirated its oil well; and grounds-tender Groundskeeper Willie. He lost his job and his dream of owning a fine crystal slop bucket.
27434,129,123,589000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Hey, what about that jazz teacher that got laid off? You know, um, Mister Samba? Señor Mambo? What was it?"
27435,129,124,593000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Tito Puente?
27436,129,125,594000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Yeah.
27437,129,126,595000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Well, he did vow revenge. But I can't see him doing something illegal -- he's in show business! He's a celebrit--"
27438,129,127,603000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Let's roll, boys."
27441,129,130,608000,Tito Puente,NIGHTCLUB,"Revenge? Of course. But why wound his body with bullets when I can set his soul afire with a slanderous mambo? Listen, if you will, to my revenge. Uno, dos, tres..."
27442,129,131,621000,Crooner,NIGHTCLUB,WOUNDS WON'T LAST LONG / BUT AN INSULTING SONG / BURNS WILL ALWAYS CARRY WITH HIM. / SO I'LL SETTLE MY SCORE / ON THE SALSA FLOOR / WITH THIS VENGEFUL LATIN RHYTHM! / BU-URNS! CON EL CORAZON DE PERRO! / SENOR BU-URNS! EL DIABLO CON DINERO!
27443,129,132,655000,Crooner,NIGHTCLUB,"THIS MAY NOT SURPRISE YOU / BUT ALL OF US DESPISE YOU / PLEASE DIE / AND FRY / IN HELL / YOU ROTTEN, RICH, OLD WRETCH! ADIOS, VIEJO!"
27444,129,133,678000,Chief Wiggum,NIGHTCLUB,"Yeah! Okay, okay, I believe you're innocent. Gee, I hope all the suspects are this much fun."
27446,129,135,685000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Hum-m-m. Now-now let, let... me... let me think."
27448,129,137,697000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, I did - I did go to the town meeting with the intention of ambushing Mr. Burns. When it adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory to apply my camouflage makeup..."
27449,129,138,709000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Blast! I took mother's makeup kit by mistake.
27450,129,139,712000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, uh, excuse me, ma'am."
27451,129,140,714000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Superintendent Chalmers!
27452,129,141,715000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Oh my God!
27453,129,142,719000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,So Superintendent Chalmers can vouch for your whereabouts?
27454,129,143,722000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh yes. But, anything else he tells you is a filthy lie."
27456,129,145,725000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Police Station,"I'm tellin' ya, I could nay have shot Burns!"
27457,129,146,732000,Eddie,Springfield Police Station,This is your last warning about that.
27460,129,147,734000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Police Station,"It's impossible for me to fire a pistol. If you'll check me medical records, you'll see I have a cripplin' arthritis in me index fingers! Look at 'em!"
27461,129,148,744000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Police Station,I got it from Space Invaders in 1977.
27462,129,149,748000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Oh yeah, that was a pretty addictive video game."
27463,129,150,750000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Police Station,Video game?
27464,129,151,751000,Eddie,Springfield Police Station,Did you hold a grudge against Montgomery Burns?
27465,129,152,753000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Police Station,No.
27466,129,153,753000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Police Station,"All right, maybe I did. But I didn't shoot him."
27467,129,154,758000,Eddie,Springfield Police Station,"Checks out. Okay, Sir, you're free to go."
27468,129,155,759000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Police Station,"Good, cause I got a hot date tonight. A date. Dinner with friends. Dinner alone. Watching TV alone. All right. I'm gonna sit at home and ogle the ladies in the Victoria's Secret catalog. Sears catalog."
27469,129,156,773000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Police Station,"Now wouldja unhook this, already please?! I don't deserve this kind of shabby treatment!"
27471,129,158,779000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Grampa, I found your cigar box dug up in the backyard, but the gun wasn't there. Have you seen it?"
27472,129,159,784000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,You accuse me of everything around here. Who put slippers in the dishwasher? Who threw a cane at the TV? Who fell into the china hutch?
27473,129,160,792000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I was just asking if you'd seen it. There's no need to be a prickly pear.
27474,129,161,799000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, you're the bee's knees, baby. I missed you bad."
27475,129,162,804000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Were you talking to me, Grampa?"
27476,129,163,806000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Um... yes?
27479,129,166,810000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"We're still not close. Boy, this is gonna be an all-night brain buster. Better drink some coffee."
27480,129,167,819000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Oh, we're out of coffee. Oh well, I'll just drink this warm cream."
27481,129,168,851000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Chief Wig-gum... Don't eat... the clues.
27482,129,169,852000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Police Station,This suit burns better. Look.
27483,129,170,855000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Huh?
27484,129,171,855000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Better... look... burns... suit.
27485,129,172,857000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,I'm not following you.
27486,129,173,858000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Burns' suit! Burns' suit!
27487,129,174,862000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Huh?
27411,129,175,864000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Look at Burns' suit. Yeesh.
27433,129,176,867000,Eddie,Springfield Police Station,"I had an idea, Chief. Why don't we check out that suit Burns was wearing when he got shot?"
27458,129,177,873000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Did you have that same backwards-talking dream with the flamin' cards?
27459,129,178,876000,Eddie,Springfield Police Station,I'll drive.
27489,129,180,881000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital,Eureka!
27490,129,181,884000,Technician,Hospital,"Ooh, nice eyelash. Yours?"
27491,129,182,886000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital,No. We need to find out who it belonged to. We want a D.N.A. test.
27492,129,183,890000,Technician,Hospital,"Ooh, ooh, ee, ooh, ooh... That takes eight to ten weeks."
27493,129,184,895000,Technician,Hospital,Did I say weeks? 'Cause I meant seconds.
27494,129,185,899000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital,Whaddya got the whole town's D.N.A. on file?
27495,129,186,902000,Technician,Hospital,"Yuh-huh. If you've ever handled a penny, the government's got yer D.N.A. Whyddya think they keep 'em in circulation?"
27496,129,187,908000,Technician,Hospital,Scan's finished. Now it's gonna narrow it down to the family bloodline.
27497,129,188,915000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,Homer Simpson!
27498,129,189,917000,Eddie,Hospital,Bingo. The gunman has a name-o.
27499,129,190,921000,Lou,Hospital,Chief! Chief! Chief!
27501,129,192,928000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Chief Wiggum, what are you doing? What's going on?"
27502,129,193,932000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, kid. We got Simpson D.N.A. on Burn's clothing and your father was identified by the old man himself."
27504,129,195,937000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"D.N.A., positive I.D. -- Those won't hold up in any court -- Run, Dad!"
27505,129,196,942000,Lou,Simpson Home,Hey-ho. Look what I found under Mr. Simpson's car seat.
27506,129,197,947000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I swear, I've never seen that gun before."
27507,129,198,950000,Eddie,Simpson Home,"Then why are your fingerprints all over it, sir?"
27509,129,200,956000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"This bullet matches the one we took out of Burns. Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for attempted murder."
27511,129,202,964000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Yeah, that's what they all say. ...They all say, ""D'oh."""
27513,129,204,966000,Chief Wiggum,PADDY WAGON,"Yeah we need two cups of coffee, and two orders of Bite-Size Breakfast Pancakes. With extra dipping sauce."
27514,129,205,981000,Teenage Employee,PADDY WAGON,"Please pull up to the service window, please."
27515,129,206,984000,Chief Wiggum,PADDY WAGON,"The wagon's too tall. Aw, I don't wanna have to get out. Ah, I'll just drive up on the curb."
27516,129,207,994000,Chief Wiggum,PADDY WAGON,Ergh... Blugh... Almost got it...
27517,129,208,995000,Lou,PADDY WAGON,"Drop the food, Chief!!"
27518,129,209,1000000,Chief Wiggum,PADDY WAGON,Noooooo!
27519,129,210,1000000,Jasper Beardly,PADDY WAGON,Dang fools. Drive-thru's not fer a-parkin'.
27520,129,211,1011000,Teenage Employee,PADDY WAGON,"Dianne, I'm going to take my break now."
27522,129,213,1015000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Hospital,"Hi, everybody!"
27523,129,214,1016000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,"Ho, Mersimp Son!"
27524,129,215,1018000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Hospital,"Okay, that was a little strange. Um tell me, how are you feeling today?"
27525,129,216,1024000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,"Ho-mer... Simpson, Homer. Simpson!"
27526,129,217,1029000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Hospital,"Hmm... That seems to be all you can say. When you were in that coma, did you feel your brain getting damaged?"
27528,129,219,1036000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"The police have such a strong case against Homer. Mr. Burns said he did it, they have Homer's D.N.A..."
27529,129,220,1041000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"They have Simpson D.N.A. It could've come from any of us. Except you, since you're a Bouvier."
27530,129,221,1046000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No. No, no. When I took your father's name, I took everything that came with it, including D.N.A."
27531,129,222,1051000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, Mom. Anyway, my point is, the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems. Like those fingerprints. They could've gotten on the gun some other way."
27532,129,223,1062000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream cones?
27533,129,224,1064000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, right. You chose fruit, you live with fruit."
27535,129,226,1070000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No. No. No. Ewww. Why is this on the floor?
27536,129,227,1077000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,And we don't even know whose gun that was. Maybe somebody planted it there to frame Dad.
27537,129,228,1083000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No. We can't start thinking that way about our own family members. Suspicion could tear us apart.
27538,129,229,1089000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's right. We all gotta stick together if we're gonna have any hope of bringing that awful Homer to justice.
27540,129,231,1098000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Here is a photo of the fugitive from our files.
27541,129,232,1102000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,And now Waylon Smithers -- ah who's been a real good sport about that wrongful arrest thing -- has a statement that he would like to make. Waylon?
27542,129,233,1110000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Police Station,"Thank you. As Montgomery Burns' closest friend, I am certain that there is nothing he would want more than swift, brutal revenge against Homer Simpson. Therefore, I am offering a $50,000 reward for his capture. Dead or alive."
27544,129,235,1125000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Me first! Me first!
27546,129,237,1126000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,Homer Simpson?
27547,129,238,1128000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,"So you finally learned my name, eh?"
27548,129,239,1131000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,Homer Simpson.
27549,129,240,1133000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,I've got no time for your demented parlor games! You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you.
27551,129,242,1144000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,The scene of the crime! There must be something here that can clear Dad.
27552,129,243,1149000,Pigeon,Springfield Town Hall,"Clue, clue."
27553,129,244,1151000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"That's it! Oh, Mr. Pigeon, I'd kiss you if you weren't swimming with disease."
27554,129,245,1167000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"So, the D.N.A. was right. It must've been... Oh, Dad!"
27555,129,246,1172000,Police Dispatcher,Springfield Town Hall,Attention all units. Homer Simpson has been sighted. Proceed at once to Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital.
27557,129,248,1180000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Springfield Town Hall,Be careful when we capture him! We cannot claim the reward unless we have fifty-one per cent of the carcass.
27559,129,250,1193000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,Stop! Don't shoot my Dad! He's innocent. He wouldn't hurt a fly!
27560,129,251,1200000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,Ho-mer Simp... son. Ho... mersimp... son.
27561,129,252,1200000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,Stop telling them it was me. I'll kill you for saying it was me.
27562,129,253,1206000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,"Mersimp... Son... what is the... mer... meaning of this? Smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me?"
27563,129,254,1216000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,Say it Burns. Say I never shot you... Before.
27564,129,255,1221000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,Shot? By you? I'm afraid not my primitive friend. Your kind has neither the cranial capacity nor the opposable digits to operate a firearm. The one who shot me was...
27565,129,256,1236000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,Ma.. Maggie Simpson!
27566,129,257,1239000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,"With the sun blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world..."
27567,129,258,1244000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth.
27568,129,259,1248000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,I feel like celebrating.
27569,129,260,1254000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,"Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about?"
27570,129,261,1257000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,I see.
27572,129,262,1260000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,"Yes... that's the one. Smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulance."
27573,129,263,1272000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,I think you'd better drop it!
27574,129,264,1274000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,But the old exhume was misleading. Taking the candy proved exceedingly difficult.
27575,129,265,1278000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,I said drop it!
27576,129,266,1292000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,Stricken I lurched forth in search of aide.
27577,129,267,1292000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,"But finding only slacked jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial."
27578,129,268,1299000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,Then with your last ounce of strength you pointed to W and S.
27579,129,269,1299000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,"Or from your point of view, M and S... Maggie Simpson."
27580,129,270,1310000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,What? No! With my last ounce of strength I sucked out my gold fillings and swallowed them. Those paramedics have sticky fingers.
27581,129,271,1319000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,"Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and you've recovered and we can all get back to normal. If Maggie could talk I'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you."
27582,129,272,1326000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,"I' afraid that's insufficient. Officer, arrest the baby."
27583,129,273,1331000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital,Yeah right pops. No jury in the world is gonna convict a baby. Mmm... except maybe Texas.
27584,129,274,1338000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,"Besides, she didn't mean it. It was an accident."
