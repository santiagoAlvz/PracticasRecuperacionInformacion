15080,84,8,75000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"There must be some mistake. We, uh, we make cookies here. Mr. Burns' old fashioned, good time, extra chewy..."

15082,84,10,87000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,The watchdog of public safety. Is there any lower form of life?
15083,84,11,90000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Don't worry, sir. I rounded up our less gifted employees and led them into the basement."
15085,84,13,95000,Dumb Employee #1,BASEMENT OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANT,"Duh, Homer, why are we down here?"
15086,84,14,100000,Homer Simpson,BASEMENT OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANT,"Oh, geez, I told you, Bernie. To guard the bee."

15096,84,24,132000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,The bee bit my bottom. Now my bottom's big! Oh!
15098,84,26,136000,Nrc Man,SIMULATOR VAN,"Homer, this is an exact replica of your workstation. Now, we're going to simulate a power surge in core sector eight."
15099,84,27,145000,Homer Simpson,SIMULATOR VAN,What the hell are you talking about?
15100,84,28,148000,Homer Simpson,SIMULATOR VAN,What do I do!? What do I do!? In the name of God you've got to tell me!

15108,84,36,198000,Nrc Man,Burns's Office,We're still not sure how he caused the meltdown. There wasn't any nuclear material in the truck.
15109,84,37,207000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Oh, very well, it's time for your bribe. Now you can either have the washer and dryer where the lovely Smithers is standing..."
15110,84,38,209000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Or you can trade it all in for what's in this box.
15111,84,39,217000,Nrc Man,Burns's Office,The box! The box!
15112,84,40,219000,Nrc Woman,Burns's Office,"Look, Burns, this is a big problem. You can't just throw money at it and make it go away."
15113,84,41,223000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Burns's Office,"Gentlemen, I've decided there will be no investigation. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go away."
15114,84,42,228000,Nrc Man,Burns's Office,"You're in big trouble, Burns. Homer Simpson's job requires college training in Nuclear Physics. Now you get your man up to speed or we'll be forced to take legal action."

15184,84,110,467000,C. Montgomery Burns,BOARD OF OVERSEERS CONFERENCE ROOM,"Yes, well, to have a successful baseball club, you need teamwork. Not some hot dog admissions officer playing by his own rules."

15196,84,123,531000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,Nerd!
15197,84,124,534000,Marge Simpson,Springfield University,"Homer, that isn't very nice."
15198,84,125,536000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Marge, try to understand. There are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time."
15199,84,126,546000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Hey pal, did you get a load of the nerd?"
15200,84,127,548000,Jock,Springfield University,Pardon me?

15207,84,134,576000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Marge, someone's squeezed all the life out of these kids. And unless movies and TV have lied to me, it's a crusty, bitter, old dean!"
15208,84,135,586000,Dean Bobby Peterson,Springfield University,"Hi there, hello, I'm Dean Peterson, but you can call me Bobby. I just want you to know if you ever feel stressed out from studying or whatever, I'm always up for some Hackey Sack. Or hey, if you just want to come by and jam, I used to be the bass player for ""The Pretenders."""
15209,84,136,600000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Boy, I can't wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt."
15210,84,137,607000,Professor,Springfield University,"Good morning and welcome to Nuclear Physics 101. I see a lot of new faces, but you know the old saying, ""Out with the old, in with the nucleus!"""
15212,84,138,616000,Professor,Springfield University,"Now, we'll begin by - oops..."
15213,84,139,623000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"You see that, sir. Drops his notes."
15214,84,140,634000,Professor,Springfield University,"Now, if anyone would like to stay, I'm going to hold a comprehensive review session after every class."
15215,84,141,644000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,Do we have to?
15216,84,142,644000,Professor,Springfield University,No.
15217,84,143,646000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,Then kiss my curvy butt goodbye!
15219,84,145,659000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase."
15220,84,146,664000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus. Besides, it isn't costing us - I swiped the cinderblocks from a construction site."
15222,84,148,672000,Foreman,Construction Site,"Sir, six cinderblocks are missing."
15223,84,149,674000,Architect,Construction Site,There'll be no hospital then. I'll tell the children.
15225,84,151,678000,Professor,Springfield University,"This proton accelerator de-stabilizes the atom in this chamber here, then propels it..."
15226,84,152,684000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Uh, excuse me ""Professor Brainiac,"" but I worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, I think I know how a proton accelerator works."
15227,84,153,693000,Professor,Springfield University,"Well please, come down and show us."
15228,84,154,693000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"All right, I will."
15229,84,155,697000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"In there, guys."
15230,84,156,697000,Men,Springfield University,"Thanks, Homer."
15231,84,157,704000,Dean,Springfield University,"Homer, no one blames you for the accident. We simply feel you might benefit with a little outside tutoring. I researched these names myself..."
15232,84,158,711000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Yeah, you've won this round, Dean. But the war isn't over."
15233,84,159,718000,Dean,Springfield University,Hello?
15234,84,160,720000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Hello, Dean? You're a stupid head."
15235,84,161,722000,Dean,Springfield University,"Homer, is that you?"
15237,84,163,722000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Hiya, gang!"
15238,84,164,731000,Doug,Springfield University,Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!
15239,84,165,731000,Gary,Springfield University,Stop the Humanoid!
15240,84,166,735000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Look, I'm supposed to get a physics tutor..."
15241,84,167,739000,Doug,Springfield University,"Well, you've come to the right place then. If there's one thing we know, it is science..."
15242,84,168,743000,Gary,Springfield University,And math...
15244,84,169,743000,Benjamin,Springfield University,And the words to every Monty Python routine...
15245,84,170,746000,Benjamin,Springfield University,We are the Knights who say Nee! Nee! Nee! Nee!
15246,84,171,746000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Heh heh. ""Nee."""
15248,84,173,754000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We played Dungeons and Dragons for three hours. Then I was slain by an elf.
15249,84,174,760000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen to yourself, man. You're hangin' with nerds."
15250,84,175,763000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You take that back...
15251,84,176,763000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, please. These boys sound very nice, but they're clearly nerds."
15252,84,177,768000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Really? But nerds are my mortal enemy.
15253,84,178,770000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, nerds are nothing to fear. In fact they've done some pretty memorable things. Some nerds of note include; popcorn magnate, Orville Redenbacher, rock star, David Byrne and Supreme Court Justice David Souter."
15254,84,179,782000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, not Souter... Oh, no."
15256,84,181,786000,Doug,Springfield University,"Come on, Mr. Simpson, you'll never pass this course if you don't know the periodic table."
15257,84,182,792000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,I'll write it on my hand...
15258,84,183,792000,Doug,Springfield University,Ho. Including all known Lanthanides and Actinides? Good luck!
15259,84,184,797000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"C'mon guys, look at yourselves. All you do is study. I'm gonna show you the true meaning of college!"
15260,84,185,809000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,We're gonna go out and par-ty!
15261,84,186,811000,Gary,Springfield University,"Wait a minute, I'll put on my snow pants."
15262,84,187,813000,Doug,Springfield University,Me too.
15263,84,188,813000,Benjamin,Springfield University,Me too.
15265,84,190,815000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aah, the college road trip. What better way to spread beer-fueled mayhem?"
15266,84,191,821000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,If you're going for a ride I'd like you to take Bart and Lisa.
15267,84,192,823000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But Marge, we're college guys and we're up to no good..."
15268,84,193,827000,Doug,Simpson Home,Mr. Simpson? Gary spilled his ear medicine.
15270,84,195,832000,Lisa Simpson,Highway,"Oh, those baby ducks were so cute. I can't believe they let us walk right up and feed them."
15271,84,196,837000,Gary,Highway,I need to go to the bathroom.
15272,84,197,837000,Lisa Simpson,Highway,We stopped five minutes ago.
15273,84,198,840000,Gary,Highway,"Yeah, but someone knocked on the door and I couldn't go."
15275,84,200,842000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"I'm telling you, a big crazy prank is just what the doctor ordered. The Dean'll go nuts!"
15276,84,201,850000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"I got it! We wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside, we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge."
15277,84,202,863000,Bart Simpson,Springfield University,"So it's a prank you're lookin' for, is it? I'll give you your prank..."
15278,84,203,872000,Bart Simpson,Springfield University,"The only other college in fifty miles is Springfield A&M, so they're our best target."
15279,84,204,877000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,Those bastards...
15280,84,205,877000,Bart Simpson,Springfield University,"Meet Sir Oinks-A-lot, the beloved mascot of Springfield A&M. Here he is presiding over last year's homecoming. Here he is conferring an honorary degree on Richard Nixon. And here he is rolling in his own filth. Gentlemen, I propose we kidnap Sir Oinks-A-lot..."
15281,84,206,896000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,And then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.
15282,84,207,900000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,What?
15284,84,209,909000,Homer Simpson,Springfield A&M,"Look! You pull its tail straight and it curls right back up again. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight..."
15286,84,211,917000,Doug,Springfield A&M,"Mr. Simpson, I don't think he likes that."
15287,84,212,923000,Homer Simpson,Springfield A&M,"Of course he does. He's a cute little piggy. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly..."
15288,84,213,927000,Homer Simpson,Springfield A&M,Ow! Why you little...
15290,84,215,933000,Doug,Springfield University,"Hey, the pig's acting kinda funny."
15291,84,216,933000,Gary,Springfield University,He and Mr. Simpson split a case of malt liquor.
15292,84,217,942000,Benjamin,Springfield University,"Guys, he's really sick."
15293,84,218,944000,Dean Bobby Peterson,Springfield University,"Hello, that sounds like a pig fainting."
15295,84,220,948000,Dean Bobby Peterson,Springfield University,"I'm sorry, boys, I've never expelled anyone before, but that pig had some powerful friends."
15296,84,221,960000,Richard Nixon,Springfield University,"Oh, you'll pay. Don't think you won't pay."
15298,84,223,966000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University Entrance,"Guys, believe me, I didn't mean to get you expelled..."
15299,84,224,969000,Benjamin,Springfield University Entrance,"Oh, don't worry Mr. Simpson. We can take care of ourselves."
15300,84,225,974000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield University Entrance,"Uh, wallet inspector."
15301,84,226,976000,Doug,Springfield University Entrance,Here you go. I believe that's all in order.
15302,84,227,979000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield University Entrance,"Huh, I can't believe that worked."
15303,84,228,981000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University Entrance,"Hey, that's not the wallet inspector."
15305,84,230,990000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, they don't have anywhere to stay, and they're geniuses. They'll solve all our problems. They'll elevate us to the status of kings on Earth."
15306,84,231,1002000,Benjamin,Simpson Home,"Mr. Simpson, we all have nose bleeds."
15307,84,232,1002000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, for the love of..."
15308,84,233,1009000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's wrong with this phone? It's making crazy noises.
15309,84,234,1014000,Gary,Simpson Home,"Those ""crazy noises"" are computer signals."
15310,84,235,1017000,Benjamin,Simpson Home,"Yeah, some guys at M.I.T. are sending us reasons why Captain Picard is better than Captain Kirk."
15311,84,236,1022000,Doug,Simpson Home,They're out of their minds!
15313,84,238,1022000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I heard about this. This is the one where Scratchy finally gets Itchy.
15314,84,239,1033000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Wow!
15315,84,240,1047000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,My purpose in life is to witness this moment.
15317,84,242,1067000,Gary,Simpson Home,We need the outlet for our rock tumbler.
15318,84,243,1070000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Plug it in! Plug it in!
15319,84,244,1070000,Gary,Simpson Home,What? The rock tumbler or the TV?
15320,84,245,1074000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The TV! The TV!
15321,84,246,1077000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Wow! They'll never let us show that again. Not in a million years!
15323,84,248,1084000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, start diggin' some nerd holes."
15324,84,249,1092000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher -- Can't we do something?
15325,84,250,1096000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, I'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in harmony. Right, Marge?"
15326,84,251,1100000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No. I want those geeks out of my house.
15327,84,252,1104000,Doug,Simpson Home,You really think you can get us back into college?
15328,84,253,1104000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Absolutely. Now the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme.
15329,84,254,1113000,Doug,Simpson Home,Why does it have to be zany?
15330,84,255,1115000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I got it! We're gonna fix it so you guys save the dean's life.
15332,84,257,1121000,Homer Simpson,Car,Perfect.
15334,84,259,1125000,Gary,Springfield University,Okay. We push him out of the way in exactly three seconds.
15335,84,260,1133000,Doug,Springfield University,Should we correct for wind resistance?
15336,84,261,1135000,Benjamin,Springfield University,Hmm. Possibly... What do you think?
15337,84,262,1138000,Doug,Springfield University,Oh my.
15339,84,264,1140000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,"Well, dean, I'm really sorry for the running-you-over prank."
15340,84,265,1145000,Dean Bobby Peterson,SPRINGFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,Prank?
15341,84,266,1145000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,And all those other pranks were my idea too. I'm the one who should be expelled.
15342,84,267,1150000,Dean Bobby Peterson,SPRINGFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,"Well, I'm touched by your honesty. And who knows, perhaps I've been a bit of an ogre myself."
15343,84,268,1156000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,"Yes, you have."
15344,84,269,1156000,Dean Bobby Peterson,SPRINGFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,"How's this, I'll re-admit your friends and we'll forget this whole silly incident ever occurred."
15345,84,270,1163000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,SPRINGFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,"Oh, Dean, this is what your new hip is going to look like."
15346,84,271,1167000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,SPRINGFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,You're gonna have to go easy on it.
15348,84,273,1170000,Benjamin,Springfield University,"Oh, it's good to be back after all these weeks."
15349,84,274,1173000,Doug,Springfield University,"Better check our answering machine, huh?"
15350,84,275,1176000,Automated Voice,Springfield University,Number of messages received zero.
15351,84,276,1179000,Gary,Springfield University,"We really want to thank you, Mr. Simpson."
15352,84,277,1183000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"No problem, guys. The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends."
15353,84,278,1190000,Professor,Springfield University,"So, in conclusion, good luck on tomorrow's big final exam."
15354,84,279,1195000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Exam?!? Oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams."
15356,84,281,1197000,Gary,Springfield University,What are you gonna do Mr. Simpson?
15357,84,282,1202000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Actually, I've been working on a plan. During the exam, I'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out."
15358,84,283,1210000,Gary,Springfield University,"Or, with our help you could cram like you've never crammed before."
15359,84,284,1215000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,Whatever. Either way is good...
15360,84,285,1232000,Gary,Springfield University,"Aw, man, I can't believe you failed."
15361,84,286,1240000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,I'm gonna lose my job just 'cause I'm dangerously unqualified.
15362,84,287,1245000,Gary,Springfield University,"Mr. Simpson, there is a way. We could... well, use a computer to change your grade."
15363,84,288,1250000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,Computers can do that?
15364,84,289,1252000,Gary,Springfield University,Oh yes. The only problem is the moral dilemma it raises... which requires...
15365,84,290,1256000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,Mora wuza?
15367,84,292,1260000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"An ""A plus""! How did you do it?"
15368,84,293,1263000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, let's just say I had help from a ""little magic box..."""
15369,84,294,1268000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You changed your grade with a computer?
15371,84,296,1270000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Way to go, dad!"
15372,84,297,1270000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college."
15373,84,298,1279000,Gary,Simpson Home,No we didn't.
15374,84,299,1279000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh. Then I learned the real value of college is to study and work hard.
15375,84,300,1286000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No you didn't. You only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong."
15376,84,301,1291000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmmm, true."
15377,84,302,1293000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"And I learned that in order for you to set a good example for your son, you're gonna take that course over again without cheating."
15378,84,303,1299000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Marge. You're worse than that crusty old dean."
15379,84,304,1303000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I guess it's back to college for me. And that means it's time to... What did I teach you guys?"
15380,84,305,1310000,Gary,Simpson Home,Par-ty down?
15381,84,306,1312000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes.
