24345,118,4,60000,Krusty the Clown,The Krusty the Clown Show,"See you tomorrow, kids. But before I go I'd just like to say..."
24347,118,6,76000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Ahh, there's nothing better than a cigarette, UNLESS it's a cigarette lit with a $100 bill."

24363,118,22,126000,Fat Tony,Krusty's Office,Okay. But we're only letting the bet ride because you crack us so consistently... up.

24365,118,24,137000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Office,No can do.
24366,118,25,141000,Accountant,Krusty's Office,"And those ridiculous bets you make! Gambling is the finest thing a person can do, if he's good at it. But you haven't won anything in months."
24367,118,26,148000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Office,So I'll just make some more money. Crank out some cheesy merchandise.
24370,118,27,152000,Accountant,Krusty's Office,"But you've already merchandized everything: Krusty's Monopoly Game,... the Krusty Krowd Kontrol Barrier. Nothing is selling anymore. Not even your new ""Lady Krusty"" line."

24375,118,32,176000,Accountant,Krusty's Office,"At this rate you'll be broke in a month. The only thing left to do is to open a clown college and train some ""regional"" Krustys."
24376,118,33,182000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Office,"You mean like that bozo, Bonko the Clown?"
24377,118,34,185000,Accountant,Krusty's Office,Exactly.
24378,118,35,186000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Office,"Forget it. I'll just cut back on the condor egg omelettes. Mmmm, a couple of those would be tasty right now."

24385,118,42,233000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,Clown college? You can't eat that.
24387,118,44,238000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, I got everything I was supposed to get. I'm not going to enroll in that clown college though. That advertisement had no effect on me whatsoever."
24388,118,45,258000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, Homer. The section you're supposed to be monitoring is on fire."
24389,118,46,271000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Clowns are funny.

24368,118,56,313000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I am holding still. I am squirming.
24399,118,57,317000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you can't just go around pretending to be Krusty. It's sacrilege. He's a one and only. I mean, he invented the pie fight, the prat fall, and the seltzer bottle... as far as I know."
24400,118,58,326000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as Tom Bosley. But Krusty!"
24401,118,59,331000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You weren't complaining when I got you this close to Chachi.

24417,118,75,388000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Klown Kollege,"And now everybody's favorite, the ""spin cycle fantastique"" trick. It's a great piece of buffoonery if you pull it off, but if you blow it, you'll look like a fool."
