137172,527,198,874000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Call me crazy, but I can't stop betting on dementia."
137173,527,199,878000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Now what say we turn the hot water on and off while your father's taking a shower.
137174,527,200,889000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Thank God I'm not in the shower!
137176,527,202,898000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Grampa, we've been spending so much time together, I almost feel like you're part of the family."
137177,527,203,903000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Awww...
137178,527,204,905000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And I've been wondering... not like I miss having my afternoons free or anything but... are you starting to feel better?
137179,527,205,912000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Absolutely not. My crotch is crotchety, sittin' down makes me uppity, and you call these cups pleated?"
137180,527,206,918000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, okay! Just checking."
137181,527,207,921000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dear She-Done-Left-Me-Records. Once again, I write protesting your holographic exploitation of blues icon Bleeding Gums Murphy. I call for a boycott and girl-cott of your entire catalogue until you... Sonny Rollins?!"
137182,527,208,938000,Sonny Rollins,Simpson Home,"That's right, Lisa. And I'm here to beg you to stop writing those letters."
137183,527,209,943000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You're siding with record companies?
137184,527,210,946000,Sonny Rollins,Simpson Home,"This isn't about money, Lisa. From Tupac Shakur to Dwight Eisenhower, holograms have introduced some of our leading dead people to a new audience of people with money."
137185,527,211,957000,Sonny Rollins,Simpson Home,Resetting... resetting... from Tupac Shakur to Dwight Eisenhower...
137186,527,212,962000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're a hologram, aren't you?"
137187,527,213,964000,Sonny Rollins,Simpson Home,No. Resetting... resetting...
137188,527,214,969000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Have you no shame?
137189,527,215,970000,Man In Van,Simpson Home,Does this answer your question?
137190,527,216,973000,Princess Diana,Simpson Home,"My name's Princess Di, and I'm here to say / When I watch a DVD, it's got to be Blu-ray! Take it, Gandhi!"

137193,527,219,989000,Moe Szyslak,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,"Hey, thanks, guys. I ain't never been to no fancy rooftop party before."
137194,527,220,994000,Moe Szyslak,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,No beer? That's a pretty big screw-up.
137195,527,221,998000,Ken,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,"Moe, we've got a special surprise."
137196,527,222,999000,Glen,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,You like chicks with nose clips?

137199,527,225,1007000,Moe Szyslak,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,"Hey, that is the most accurate picture of my face made of girl-parts that I have ever seen!"
137200,527,226,1012000,Ken,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,"And it's not decadent, because you can ask interns to do anything."
137201,527,227,1014000,Moe Szyslak,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,"Thanks. Thank you so much, Ken and Glen!"
137202,527,228,1016000,Glen,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,You're welcome.

137205,527,231,1020000,Moe Szyslak,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,Eh...
137206,527,232,1022000,Ken,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,"Moe, we love your whiskey, we love your back story, and we love that suit that hangs off you like silk on a skeleton."
137207,527,233,1027000,Glen,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,"So starting tomorrow, we're gonna sell shares in your company to the public. All you do is show up at the stock exchange, ring the bell, and you'll leave a rich man."

137209,527,235,1037000,Glen,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,Enjoy your last night as a Democrat!
137210,527,236,1041000,Moe Szyslak,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,Dang it. The suit's stuck in the door.
137211,527,237,1045000,Moe Szyslak,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,"No, no, no!"
137212,527,238,1047000,Moe Szyslak,TOP OF SKYSCRAPER PARTY,This building's got ninety-eight floors! And I'm goin' down to P-6! P-6!
137214,527,240,1061000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Moe? What are you doing?
137215,527,241,1064000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Midge, the suit got a little mussed up. I gotta ask ya... is it noticeable?"
137216,527,242,1070000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Thank God the kids aren't here.
137217,527,243,1072000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I was.
137218,527,244,1075000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Without my magic suit, I'm nothin'."
137220,527,245,1077000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"The suit wasn't magic, Moe. Don't you know the story of Dumbo the elephant?"
137221,527,246,1082000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Uh, I didn't go to movies as a kid. Spent all my time at the pierógi factory. Dab the potato, fold the dough. That was my Star Wars."
137222,527,247,1090000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Dumbo had a magic feather. He thought he needed it to fly, but it turned out the magic was in him the whole time."
137223,527,248,1099000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So you're saying Moe's Dumbo, his bourbon is the giant ears, and we're that flock of racist crows?"
137224,527,249,1106000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The crows weren't racist -- the people who drew them were.
137225,527,250,1110000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Okay, I get it. I get it. It wasn't the suit that made the bourbon -- it was me! And I can do anything!"
137226,527,251,1116000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't stand up!
137227,527,252,1117000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Except stand up.
137228,527,253,1118000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Grampa, I made your favorite dinner -- teething biscuits soaked in buttermilk."
137230,527,255,1128000,Grampa Simpson,BASEMENT,DA-DA-DA-DA-DAH...
137231,527,256,1128000,Grampa Simpson,BASEMENT,OH-OH-OH-OH-OHHH. THE PAIN! THE PAIN!

137233,527,258,1138000,Grampa Simpson,BASEMENT,"All right, boy, I admit it. I've been faking being hurt. Just like I fake liking those terrible homemade Christmas gifts you give."
137234,527,259,1148000,Bart Simpson,BASEMENT,But Mom said it was a gift made with love.
137235,527,260,1150000,Grampa Simpson,BASEMENT,Did she?
137236,527,261,1151000,Bart Simpson,BASEMENT,No. Even she thought it was crap.
137237,527,262,1154000,Grampa Simpson,BASEMENT,"But what you did wasn't for nothin'. It was the best two weeks of this final, horrible part of my life."
137238,527,263,1161000,Bart Simpson,BASEMENT,Well... you are the first thing I took care of that didn't die.
137239,527,264,1164000,Grampa Simpson,BASEMENT,I hear that a lot.
137241,527,266,1169000,Moe Szyslak,Capital City Stock Exchange,"Heya, guys."
