33836,154,1,36000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Did you hear that, Bart?"
33837,154,2,37000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe it was just the cat.
33838,154,3,39000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No. She's sleeping with
33839,154,4,39000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,me.
33841,154,6,47000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last night?
33842,154,7,50000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Attic? Oh, that's silly. Seriously, though, don't ever go up there."
33843,154,8,57000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, isn't it about time for the... ...you know."
33844,154,9,61000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, yeah. I'll go feed it."
33845,154,10,65000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fish heads, fish heads, do de do de doo..."
33849,154,14,95000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What's up there? / Is it a monster? / We have to know! / What's the secret?
33850,154,15,99000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No more questions. I work my butt off to feed you four kids and all you do I -- what?
33851,154,16,103000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Three! We have three kids, Homer!"
33852,154,17,106000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, three nosy kids. And you know what happens to nosy kids who ask too many questions?"
33853,154,18,112000,BART & LISA,Simpson Home,"No, what? / What? / Tell us, what happens? / Does something happen?"
33854,154,19,118000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hurry up! Mom and Dad'll be home soon!
33855,154,20,138000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The unsold copies of Dad's autobiography.
33821,154,21,140000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ohmigod, Bart, look!"
33857,154,24,158000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, do you think it's safe?"
33858,154,25,160000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't care. I can't breathe in here.
33860,154,27,166000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"See, Marge? Who needs a car wash when you can just drive around in the rain."
33861,154,28,170000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,MomDadWeSawSomethingInTheAtticAnd --
33862,154,29,173000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You went into the attic? I'm very disappointed and terrified.
33863,154,30,182000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my God, Marge, it's escaped!"
33864,154,31,192000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, Doctor, it's what we've always feared: it's loose. Hugo is loose. See you soon."
33865,154,32,199000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Who or what is Hugo?
33866,154,33,202000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm afraid we haven't been entirely honest with you, Bart. You see... you have a brother."
33867,154,34,208000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,So I have two brothers?
33868,154,35,210000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, please. Yes, Bart, you have a twin brother. You see, when you were born, there was... an irregularity."
33869,154,36,217000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,A monstrous irregularity.
33871,154,38,221000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"Yes, I remember Bart's birth well. You don't forget a thing like... Siamese twins."
33872,154,39,230000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I believe they prefer to be called ""conjoined twins."""
33873,154,40,230000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"And hillbillies prefer to be called ""sons of the soil,"" but it ain't gonna happen. Now normally, the birth of Siamese twins is a joyous occasion... But unfortunately, one of them was pure evil."
33874,154,41,254000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I think I'll bottle-feed that one.
33875,154,42,257000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,A routine soul smear confirmed the presence of pure evil. It was then I knew the only option was to separate you two immediately.
33876,154,43,265000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,You'll both need to sign these.
33877,154,44,274000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"But what to do with poor Hugo? Too crazy for Boys Town, too much of a boy for Crazy Town, the child was an outcast. So we did the only humane thing."
33878,154,45,285000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week.
33879,154,46,290000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It saved our marriage!
33880,154,47,291000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You expect me to believe all this? If any of it was true, wouldn't I have a big, hideous scar..."
33882,154,49,297000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,We've got to find Hugo.
33883,154,50,299000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"We'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to."
33884,154,51,303000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll start with Radio Shack.
33885,154,52,305000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Right. Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game."
33886,154,53,319000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're here, aren't you?"
33887,154,54,323000,Hugo,Simpson Home,"Yes, Bart. I never left you."
33888,154,55,327000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,W-w-what do you want from me?
33889,154,56,328000,Hugo,Simpson Home,You'll see. After the surgery.
33891,154,58,335000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're crazy!
33892,154,59,336000,Hugo,Simpson Home,"Am I? Well, perhaps we're all a little crazy. I know I am. I went mad after they tore us apart. But I'll be sane once I sew us back together."
33893,154,60,348000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But you'll kill both of us!
33894,154,61,349000,Hugo,Simpson Home,"No, it's easy. Look, I've been practicing. I made a pigeon-rat..."
33895,154,62,359000,Hugo,Simpson Home,"Well, let's get started. You want to be on the right or the left?"
33897,154,64,363000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"Hugo, stop!"
33898,154,65,366000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"There, there, Hugo. I understand. All those years caged up in here... why, you've probably never even seen your own face in the mirror, have you? Here..."
33899,154,66,382000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We think we saw Hugo at the airport! He was boarding a plane to Switzerland and... Oh.
33900,154,67,390000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"You know, isn't it interesting how the left, or sinister, twin is invariably the evil one? I had this theor... Wait a minute, Hugo's scar is on the wrong side! He couldn't have been the evil left twin! That means the evil twin is, and always has been... Bart."
33901,154,68,414000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, don't look so shocked."
33902,154,69,417000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"Well, chalk this one up to carelessness on my part. But I think there's a way to set everything right."
33903,154,70,430000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"Care for a drumstick, Hugo?"
33905,154,72,435000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, Hugo's eating his napkin!"
33907,154,74,441000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, can I have some turkey?"
33908,154,75,443000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, finish your fish heads. Then we'll talk."
33909,154,76,455000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,This tooth will be perfect for my science project.
33911,154,77,459000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and Chinese food. But I can still ruin soft drinks for everyone."
33912,154,78,468000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Lis. Check out my science project."
33913,154,79,470000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow! What's that supposed to prove?
33914,154,80,472000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That nerds conduct electricity.
33915,154,81,474000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow!
33917,154,83,481000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow! Stupid Bart!
33918,154,84,493000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh boy! Mold! That's science-fair paydirt!
33919,154,85,501000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmmm. Looks about the same.
33920,154,86,504000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ah.
33922,154,88,509000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Tiny little people!
33923,154,89,514000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,My God. I've created life!
33924,154,90,518000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa! Breakfast! We're having waffles!
33925,154,91,522000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, waffles!"
33926,154,92,527000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, these aren't waffles -- these are just square pancakes!"
33927,154,93,531000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, honey. The waffle iron's in the shop."
33928,154,94,535000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That waffle iron's been in the shop forever.
33929,154,95,538000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, how are my little stone age tub dwellers? Oh my gosh!"
33930,154,96,543000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,They're evolving so quickly! They've already reached the Renaissance... Wait! One of them is nailing something to the door of the cathedral! I've created Lutherans!
33932,154,98,563000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Wow, it's almost like seeing into the future!"
33933,154,99,566000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Hey, what is this goo? Are you trying to grow a friend?"
33934,154,100,569000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Hey, you built a model city. Is that the school?"
33935,154,101,573000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Oops, my fingers slipped. Oops, my fingers slipped. Oops, my fingers slipped."
33936,154,102,577000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Ba-rt stop it!
33937,154,103,587000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Oh, my poor little guys. That Bart is so rude."
33942,154,108,620000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,What the heck? Gah!
33945,154,111,636000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Your micro-jerks attacked me!
33947,154,112,638000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Well, you practically destroyed their whole world!"
33948,154,113,641000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"You can't protect them every second. Sooner or later you'll let your guard down, and then -- flush! It's toilet time for tiny town."
33951,154,116,664000,Prof. Mini-Frink,MARGARINE TUB,It worked! The debigulator worked!
33952,154,117,668000,Crowd,MARGARINE TUB,Hail Liiiiiiisaaaaaaa.
33953,154,118,672000,Notable,MARGARINE TUB,"Welcome to our world, most gracious Lisa."
33954,154,119,676000,Lisa Simpson,MARGARINE TUB,Your world is incredible! And you speak English!
33955,154,120,679000,Notable,MARGARINE TUB,"We have listened to you speak since the dawn of time, O Creator, and we have learned to imatoot you exarktly."
33956,154,121,688000,Lisa Simpson,MARGARINE TUB,You think I'm God?
33957,154,122,689000,Notable,MARGARINE TUB,But of course. You look down on us from heaven. You gave us life. And only your divine intervention can save us from the devil.
33958,154,123,698000,Lisa Simpson,MARGARINE TUB,The devil? What devil?
33959,154,124,700000,Notable,MARGARINE TUB,"The one you call ""Bart."""
33961,154,126,700000,Lisa Simpson,MARGARINE TUB,"Oh, no-no-no-no, you don't understand. Bart's just my brother."
33962,154,127,711000,Notable,MARGARINE TUB,The devil is your brother?
33964,154,129,716000,Notable,MARGARINE TUB,I must say we find that quite perplexing.
33965,154,130,720000,Man,MARGARINE TUB,"Uh, God, hi. Bill Watson... I, uh, live in the Clark Building. I have a question. If you're so good, why do you allow bad things to happen?"
33966,154,131,728000,Fat Man,MARGARINE TUB,Why am I so fat?
33968,154,133,734000,Lisa Simpson,MARGARINE TUB,"Listen, I can take care of everything. All you have to do is unshrink me."
33969,154,134,738000,Prof. Mini-Frink,MARGARINE TUB,"Unshrink you? Well that would require some sort of a... ""rebigulator,"" which is a concept so ridiculous it makes me want to laugh out loud and chortle."
33970,154,135,739000,Prof. Mini-Frink,MARGARINE TUB,"But... Oh, but not at you o holiest of gods with the wrathfulness, and the vengeance, and the blood-rain, and the hey, hey, hey, it hurts me."
33971,154,136,753000,Notable,MARGARINE TUB,"Look, the destroyer! He returns!"
33972,154,137,758000,Crowd,MARGARINE TUB,"Help! / Save us, Lisa! / Help us God! / Etc."
33973,154,138,760000,Lisa Simpson,MARGARINE TUB,"Bart, noooo!"
33977,154,140,767000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"First rate work, Bart. This universe you've created is even more impressive than Martin's milk carton ukulele. Willie, you can throw out the other projects, we have a winner!"
33979,154,142,781000,Lisa Simpson,MARGARINE TUB,"Principal Skinner, wait! I created the universe! Give me the gift certificate!"
33980,154,143,786000,Lisa Simpson,MARGARINE TUB,"Oh, great. I'm stuck in this lousy tub for the rest of my life."
33981,154,144,793000,Lisa Simpson,MARGARINE TUB,Shouldn't you people be groveling? And bring me some shoes. Nice ones!
33982,154,145,799000,Man #2,MARGARINE TUB,"She'll want socks, too. I'll get socks."
33984,154,147,807000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pond,"Ahh, the ole fishin' hole. So peaceful and relaxing, it doesn't even matter if I catch a single fish."
33985,154,148,819000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pond,"Come on, you stupid fish! Take the bait! Don't make me come down there!"
33986,154,149,827000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pond,What the-- whosa-- sonofa-
33988,154,151,842000,Homer Simpson,SAUCER,Oh my God... space aliens! Don't eat me! I have a wife and kids! Eat them!
33989,154,152,848000,Kang,SAUCER,"Silence. We are travelers from a certain nearby ringed planet whose name we'd prefer not to mention. My name is Kang, and this is my sister, Kodos."
33990,154,153,858000,Kodos,SAUCER,Hello.
33991,154,154,859000,Homer Simpson,SAUCER,"I suppose you'll want to probe me. Well, might as well get it over with."
33992,154,155,864000,Kang,SAUCER,Stop. We have reached the limits of what rectal probing can teach us.
33993,154,156,869000,Kodos,SAUCER,This is a mission of conquest. Take us to your leader.
33994,154,157,873000,Homer Simpson,SAUCER,"I guess you mean President Clinton. He usually hangs around Washington, D.C."
33995,154,158,877000,Kang,SAUCER,President Clin-Ton. Excellent.
33996,154,159,881000,Homer Simpson,SAUCER,"Except... um, there's this election next week, so after that it might not be him anymore. It might be what's-his-name, uh, Mumbly-Joe... uh, I saw him on TV the other... Uh, Bob Dole."
33997,154,160,896000,Kang,SAUCER,Hmm... an election. That complicates matters. Set grid coordinates for Bob Dole.
33999,154,162,905000,Dole,WASHINGTON D.C. - REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE,"Well, 'night, everybody."
34000,154,163,906000,Committee Staff,WASHINGTON D.C. - REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE,"'Night Sir / Good night, Mr. Dole / Good luck next week."
34001,154,164,909000,Dole,WASHINGTON D.C. - REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE,What? Bob Dole doesn't need this.
33975,154,166,917000,Clinton,WASHINGTON D.C. - WHITE HOUSE,What?! Wh-wh-wh-what's happenin'?! Is it noon already?
34003,154,168,928000,Dole,SAUCER,What the hell is this -- some kind of tube?
34004,154,169,932000,Clinton,SAUCER,"Well, thanks for taking care of Dole for me. I, uh -- Hey!"
34005,154,170,941000,Kang,SAUCER,Commence bio-duplication.
34006,154,171,952000,Homer Simpson,SAUCER,Oh no. Aliens... bio-duplication... nude conspiracies... Oh my God! Lyndon LaRouche was right!
34007,154,172,959000,KODOS-CLINTON,SAUCER,What? Are you still here? I'm afraid we'll have to dispose of you.
34008,154,173,968000,Homer Simpson,SAUCER,No! NO! What are you spraying me with!?
34009,154,174,970000,KANG-DOLE,SAUCER,Rum. So no one will believe your story.
34010,154,175,976000,KODOS-CLINTON,SAUCER,And don't come back!
34012,154,177,981000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Kent Brockman here with ""Campaign '96: America Flips A Coin"". At an appearance this morning, President Clinton made some rather cryptic remarks, which aides attributed to an overly tight necktie."
34013,154,178,992000,KODOS-CLINTON,Simpson Home,"I am Clin-Ton. As overlord, all will kneel trembling before me and obey my brutal commands. End communication."
34014,154,179,1001000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's Slick Willie for you. Always with the smooth talk.
34015,154,180,1005000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, Marge! There I was, I had just caught the largest fish you'd ever seen, when I was abducted by a flying saucer!"
34016,154,181,1013000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure you were, rummy."
34017,154,182,1015000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's one of the creatures!
34018,154,183,1017000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Senator Dole, why should people vote for you instead of President Clinton?"
34019,154,184,1021000,KANG-DOLE,Simpson Home,"It makes no difference which one of us you vote for. Either way, your planet is doomed. DOOMED!"
34020,154,185,1030000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Well, a refreshingly frank response there from Senator Bob Dole."
34021,154,186,1033000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,These candidates make me want to vomit in terror! I've got to stop them!
34023,154,188,1039000,Spokesman,Dole Campaign Stop,"Ladies and gentlemen, seventy-three-year-old candidate Bob Dole!"
34025,154,190,1045000,KANG-DOLE,Dole Campaign Stop,Abortions for all!

34027,154,192,1050000,KANG-DOLE,Dole Campaign Stop,Very well. No abortions for anyone!
34028,154,193,1056000,Crowd,Dole Campaign Stop,Boo!
34029,154,194,1056000,KANG-DOLE,Dole Campaign Stop,Hmm... Abortions for some... miniature American flags for others!
34033,154,197,1064000,KANG-DOLE,Springfield,Fooling these Earth-voters is easier than expected.
34034,154,198,1067000,KODOS-CLINTON,Springfield,Yes. All they want to hear are bland pleasantries embellished by an occasional saxophone-solo or infant kiss.
34035,154,199,1077000,Aide,Springfield,"Uh, Mr. President, sir, people are becoming a bit... confused, by the way you and your opponent are, well, constantly holding hands."
34036,154,200,1086000,KANG-DOLE,Springfield,"We are merely exchanging long protein strings. If you can think of a simpler way, I'd like to hear it."
34038,154,202,1099000,KODOS-CLINTON,SPRINGFIELD AUDITORIUM,"My fellow Americans: as a young boy, I dreamed of being a baseball. But tonight I say we must move forward, not backward... upward, not forward... and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom!"
34039,154,203,1124000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD AUDITORIUM,Stop! Those candidates are phonies!
34040,154,204,1130000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD AUDITORIUM,You heard me -- They're alien replicons from beyond the moon!
34041,154,205,1140000,SECRET SERVICEMAN,SPRINGFIELD AUDITORIUM,Don't forget your stinkin' flag.
34043,154,207,1143000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pond,"Oh, why won't anybody believe my crazy story?"
34046,154,210,1155000,Homer Simpson,SAUCER,Hold on guys. I'll help ya!
34047,154,211,1160000,Clinton,SAUCER,"Oh, no, am I still here? I don't wanna serve out my term naked in a tube."
34048,154,212,1166000,Dole,SAUCER,"I am so mad at the secret service right now. Hey, who the hell are you?"
34049,154,213,1171000,Homer Simpson,SAUCER,"I'm Homer Simpson, Sir, and I'm gonna get you back to Washington before it's too late!"
34050,154,214,1178000,Clinton,SAUCER,"You know, Senator, being in suspended animation gave me time to think. Partisan politics are tearing our country apart."
