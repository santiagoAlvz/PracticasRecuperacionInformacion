49106,209,1,66000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ahhh, lunchtime!"
49107,209,2,88000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, let's see what I've packed for myself today. One bouillon cube, one concord grape, one Philly cheesesteak, and a jar of garlic pickles. No one will want to kiss me after these, eh, Smithers?"
49108,209,3,104000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, it's their loss, sir."
49109,209,4,109000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yes...
49110,209,5,113000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Allow me, sir."
49111,209,6,119000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It's no use. Shall I send out for some Chinese?
49112,209,7,121000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, those people are all gristle. I want this jar open."
49114,209,9,131000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Worthless old geezers.
49052,209,10,132000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Next...
49115,209,11,137000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"All righty, I'll just-- You stinkin' g--"
49116,209,12,150000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Oh, for goodness sake. What we need around here is some fresh blood."
49117,209,13,155000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Would you like me to drain Simpson while he's passed out, sir?"
49118,209,14,157000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"No, no. To attract top graduates, we'll need to make a recruitment film. A picture that showcases our cutting edge technology."
49119,209,15,165000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"A talkie, sir?"
49120,209,16,166000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Yes, brilliant! That's just the kind of far-out gimmick we need."
49122,209,18,174000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Annnnd. Action!
49123,209,19,176000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Wow! What a graduation!
49124,209,20,180000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'll say.
49125,209,21,181000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"But with college behind us, we'll need careers. And good ones."
49126,209,22,185000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What about chestnut roasting? People always need chestnuts.
49127,209,23,188000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Or begging. I know a place that'll saw your legs off...
49128,209,24,191000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Slow down, fellas. I've got a way we can keep our legs, and still have a bright future."
49129,209,25,196000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Now you're dreaming.
49130,209,26,197000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, am I?"
49131,209,27,201000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Of course. Nuclear power.
49132,209,28,203000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It's the job of tomorrow... today!
49133,209,29,206000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Really?
49134,209,30,207000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, that settles it. For all those reasons and more, let us choose an electrifying career in... Line."
49135,209,31,216000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Nuclear power.
49136,209,32,217000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Nuclear power.
49137,209,33,220000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You dunder-headed stooges are the worst bunch of--!
49139,209,35,225000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey!
49140,209,36,227000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Pretty good, huh?"
49141,209,37,229000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it's better than that last Barbra Streisand movie."
49142,209,38,232000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I didn't quite get the point of it, Dad. Why would Lenny want someone to saw his legs off?"
49143,209,39,236000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, there were script problems from day one."
49144,209,40,238000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Didn't seem like anybody even read the script.
49145,209,41,241000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That was the problem. The important thing is, after all these years of paying my dues, I'm finally getting some decent parts."
49146,209,42,248000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're joining the Screen Actor's Guild?
49147,209,43,250000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I didn't choose to be a gifted actor, Marge. It chose me. I'm merely a vessel through which genius flows. Now help me make up some phony credits."
49148,209,44,259000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Fat Guy Number Three?
49149,209,45,261000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Good. Good.
49150,209,46,262000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Dad, it says they need your full name. You only put down your middle initial."
49151,209,47,265000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, what the heck is your middle name, anyway?"
49152,209,48,268000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know... I have no idea. Hey, Dad. What does the ""J"" stand for?"
49153,209,49,273000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,How should I know?
49154,209,50,278000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,It was your mother's job to name ya and love ya and such. I was mainly in it for the spanking.
49155,209,51,283000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But I can't ask Mom. She's on the run from the law.
49156,209,52,286000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Serves her right fer bein' a sixties radical. Though she was a demon in the sack.
49157,209,53,296000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, so, Dad, regarding that form... why not just make up a middle name?"
49158,209,54,299000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You might as well. You already made up a phony film credit.
49159,209,55,302000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No! Homer Simpson does not lie twice on the same form. He never has and he never will.
49160,209,56,308000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You lied dozens of times on our mortgage application.
49161,209,57,310000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but they were all part of a single ball of lies. The point is, I'm a grown man, and I deserve a middle name."
49162,209,58,316000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmm... I know where we might find your missing moniker. It's a bit of a drive, but on the way we can have a nice father son chat."
49163,209,59,327000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Great. I'll go shoot myself for bringing this up.
49165,209,61,337000,Grampa Simpson,FARM LAND,This is the hippie commune your mother ran off to when life with me became a living hell.
49166,209,62,343000,Homer Simpson,FARM LAND,"Wow, look at this place. There's a pond for skinny dippin', a tire for skinny swingin'... I can actually feel the good vibrations."
49167,209,63,355000,Homer Simpson,FARM LAND,Oww... ch.
49170,209,65,359000,Grampa Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"I remember them. Seth and Munchie. Look at those filthy, lazy, flea-ridden -- Oh hi, there!"
49171,209,66,366000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Hey, check it out!"
49172,209,67,368000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Is that... Abe Simpson? Geez, man, we haven't seen you since Woodstock."
49173,209,68,372000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,You went to Woodstock?
49174,209,69,374000,Grampa Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Your mother dragged us both to that God-forsaken lovefest...
49175,209,70,388000,Middle-aged Grampa,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Boooo! Bring on Sha-Na-Na!
49176,209,71,394000,Young Mona,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Whoa. Mellow out, Abe. Little Homer's trying to groove."
49177,209,73,411000,Middle-aged Grampa,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Shame on you, boy! Put some damn pants on, and then pull 'em down, 'cause it's time for a spankin'!"
49178,209,74,417000,Young Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Get a load of Captain Bringdown, whoa."
49179,209,75,421000,Young Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Yeah. Whoa.
148076,209,76,423000,Young Homer,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,But I want to play in the mud and be a hippie.
49180,209,77,427000,Middle-aged Grampa,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Never! What you need's a good long hitch in Vietnam. There must be an enlistment tent around here somewhere.
49181,209,78,434000,Grampa Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"If I'd a left it up to your mother, you'd've ended up in a hellhole like this, just lyin' around, never workin', without a care in your head full of long luxurious hippie hair..."
49182,209,79,449000,Hippie Girl #1,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Oh, Homer J., how do you keep your hair so rich and full?"
49183,209,80,455000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Lather, rinse, and repeat. Always repeat."
49184,209,81,459000,Hippie Girl #2,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Homer J., will you teach us to make love?"
49185,209,82,464000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Wow, I could have lived like that?"
49186,209,83,467000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"You know, Homer, your Mom was a pretty groovy chick."
49187,209,84,470000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,And a demon in the sack.
49188,209,85,474000,Grampa Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Oh, you heard about that, eh?"
49189,209,86,480000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Aaanyway, I-I still think about her every time I walk by that mural she painted."
49190,209,87,486000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Ohh, my mother painted that for me?"
49191,209,88,492000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Oh, my God! My middle name is right behind that shrub. I'll finally know what ""J"" stands for! From this moment forth, I will be known as Homer...Jay Simpson. It's so beautiful. What a magical gift for my mother to leave me."
49192,209,89,510000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,She also left her old poncho.
49169,209,90,512000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Get off of there, Ginsberg."
49193,209,91,518000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,I'll treasure this poncho forever.
49194,209,92,520000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Aw, y-you might want to wash that. The dog has a lot of skin and bladder problems."
49195,209,93,526000,Grampa Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"All right, we got what we came for, plus that stink rag to boot. Now, let's hit the road."
49196,209,94,532000,Grampa Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Just lyin' around... never workin'... without a care in...
49197,209,95,537000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"My head full of long, luxurious, hippie hair. I'll do it!"
49198,209,96,542000,Grampa Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Whuh?
49199,209,97,543000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"I'm gonna be a hippie, just like Mom wanted. I'm gonna let my spirit soar and love all of God's creatures!"
49200,209,98,550000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Get off, you stupid dog!"
49203,209,101,557000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, if I'm gonna be a real hippie, I have to learn from the master, Mr. Bob ""flower child"" Hope."
49204,209,102,566000,Bob Hope,Simpson Home,"Hey, peace, man. Far out. Groovy. I'm a hippie. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Jill St. John."
49205,209,103,576000,Jill St. John,Simpson Home,"Hey, Bob, I just came to invite you to the love-in."
49207,209,105,581000,Jill St. John,Simpson Home,I got you a date with the perfect flower child... Phyllis Diller.
49208,209,106,589000,Phyllis Diller,Simpson Home,Let's get it on.
49209,209,107,594000,Bob Hope,Simpson Home,Now I know how Dean Rusk feels. G'night everybody!
49210,209,108,598000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bummer... love-in... Dean Rusk... By George I've got it!
49211,209,109,605000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, do you mind? Your feet are really close to my potato."
49212,209,110,609000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Your potato? You can't like own a potato, man. It's one of Mother Earth's creatures."
49213,209,111,617000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, excuse yourself."
49214,209,112,619000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No way, narc. Bodily functions are a natural thing."
49215,209,113,623000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Not to mention hilarious.
49216,209,114,626000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, I really don't appreciate being called a narc."
49217,209,115,626000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And that poncho is filthy! Let me dry-clean it for you.
49218,209,116,634000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why do you have to turn everything into one big plastic hassle? Marge, you've got too many hang-ups. Like the whole shaving trip. C'mon, I want to see those legs all furry and gross."
49219,209,117,645000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That ain't gonna happen, bub."
49221,209,118,647000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, at least lose the bra. Free the ""Springfield Two,"" Marge! Free the ""Springfield Two!"""
49222,209,119,653000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmf. I think you've had too much strawberry wine.
49224,209,121,659000,Maude Flanders,Simpson Home,Ew! Help!
49225,209,122,660000,Maude Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oh, I've never seen anything like..."
49226,209,123,663000,Maude Flanders,Simpson Home,My eyes have been soiled!
49227,209,124,665000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, Maude. The human wang is a beautiful thing."
49228,209,125,669000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, for God sakes, put your poncho on!"
49229,209,126,671000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, okay. Narc."
49231,209,128,681000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Heads up!
49232,209,129,682000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Hey, it's Homer Jay!"
49233,209,130,684000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,My man! You've gone granola.
49234,209,131,686000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Right on.
49235,209,132,688000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Join the hack.
49236,209,133,696000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"That was cool. Think I'll stick around. We've got everything we need right here. Good times, sunshine, free love..."
49237,209,134,707000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Okay, time to get back to work."
49238,209,135,710000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Work!? But you're hippies!
49239,209,136,711000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Oh, we were on a break."
49240,209,137,713000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Time is money, man."
49242,209,139,722000,Homer Simpson,Barn,What is this place?
49243,209,140,724000,Seth,Barn,We are the largest organic juice company in Springfield.
49244,209,141,728000,Munchie,Barn,We grow our own vegetables and process them right here. And we give half the profits to war orphans.
49245,209,142,734000,Homer Simpson,Barn,"Profits, profits, profits! What kinda hippies are you? Peter Fonda must be spinning in his grave."
49247,209,144,743000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"W-We're just trying to pay the bills, Homer. I mean, we're still hippies at heart."
49248,209,145,747000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Oh, yeah? When's the last time you freaked out the establishment? You guys are total sellouts."
49249,209,146,753000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Wait. Don't you work for a nuclear power plant?
49250,209,147,756000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Look, we can sit here all day and play the blame game, or we can start freaking people out. C'mon, where's your freak bus?"
49251,209,148,764000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,I drive a Saturn.
49252,209,149,766000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,A Saturn?
49254,209,150,767000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"We used to have a bus. In a way, the sixties ended the day we sold it... December 31st, 1969."
49255,209,151,774000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Yeah, an old-time freak-out sounds tempting, Homer. But we've got a big order to fill."
49256,209,152,779000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Fine. I guess the juice business is more important than the ideals our hippie forefathers refused to go to war and die for.
49257,209,153,790000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,I-I suppose we could duck out for a couple hours.
49258,209,154,793000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Hey, we'll call it a business trip and write off the mileage."
49259,209,155,796000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Now your freak flag's flying! Let the freak-out begin! Woo hoo!
49260,209,156,803000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Ohh... we're never gonna freak anybody out with this music. I brought something from my personal stash that'll blow some minds.
49261,209,157,825000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Can you turn that down just a little?
49263,209,159,832000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Hey square, expand your mind! The doors of perception are open for business."
49264,209,160,837000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Street,"Thanks for the tip, Homer."
49265,209,161,842000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Never fear, the cosmic fool is here to blow the lid off your conformist, button-down world!"
49266,209,162,852000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Street,Weirdos!
49267,209,163,854000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Hi, Marge. We're freaking out squares!"
49268,209,164,856000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Oh, Lord."
49269,209,165,858000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"What's in your brand new bag, mama?"
49270,209,166,860000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Uh, it's that pair of Dockers you wanted. 48 waist with the balloon seat, right?"
49271,209,167,864000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Marge. Not in front of the hippies.
49273,209,169,870000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Uh-oh. I don't like the sound of that.
49274,209,170,874000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, please God, don't let them come in here."
49275,209,171,878000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Hear ye! Hear ye! The intergalactic jester proclaims this conformity factory closed!
49276,209,172,880000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Woo hoo!
49277,209,173,890000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Hm. Fifteen years of loyal service and this is how they tell me -- a jester with an invisible proclamation.
49279,209,175,900000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"That was fun. I don't know if we actually freaked anyone out, but --"
49280,209,176,904000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"No, no, no. Marge was definitely freaked out."
49281,209,177,906000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"Thanks, Homer. It was nice to reconnect with our hippie roots, if only for a--"
49282,209,178,910000,Seth,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,What the hell--
49284,209,180,913000,Munchie,Barn,Oh no! / Oh man!
49285,209,181,919000,Seth,Barn,"Your Frisbee jammed the juicilator, Homer!"
49286,209,182,922000,Munchie,Barn,Our entire shipment is ruined!
49287,209,183,925000,Homer Simpson,Barn,"Uh. Pretty, uh, freaky, huh?"
49288,209,184,928000,Seth,Barn,The only people who are going be freaked out are our stockholders.
49289,209,185,932000,Homer Simpson,Barn,I'm sensing some negative vibes here. But I promise tomorrow's freak-out will go a lot smoother.
49290,209,186,939000,Seth,Barn,"There won't be any more freak-outs! You're not a hippie, and you never were!"
49291,209,187,944000,Homer Simpson,Barn,"Yes, b-b-but the poncho..."
49292,209,188,946000,Munchie,Barn,"Please, Homer, just leave us alone."
148077,209,190,957000,Young Homer,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,How could you let me turn into you.
49294,209,191,960000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,B-b-but the poncho...
148078,209,192,962000,Young Homer,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,"B-b-b-b-but the poncho. Hit the road, square."
49295,209,193,976000,Homer Simpson,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Uh-oh.
49296,209,194,977000,Munchie,Groovy Grove Natural Farm,Oh! / For crying out loud!
