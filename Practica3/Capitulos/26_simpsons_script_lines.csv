156368,26,108,530000,Devil,Simpson Home,It won't cost you a thing... except your soul!
156369,26,109,536000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's gotten into Lisa?

156409,26,149,667000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"We could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable TV."

156435,26,175,775000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I see.
156436,26,176,777000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Come on, Lisa, now you're here for a reason. Is your father stealing bread?"
156437,26,177,781000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Maybe. I don't watch him every minute. But what I am sure of is, we're getting cable for free."
156438,26,178,787000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Well, I'm afraid that is stealing, Lisa, and I think you must do something... hmmm."
156439,26,179,792000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Should I have my father arrested?
156440,26,180,794000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Well, Lisa, on the surface, that would appear to be an ideal solution to the problem. But remember the Fourth Commandment, ""Honor thy father and thy mother."" Hmmm, Lisa, I would like to see you set an example by not watching the offending technology yourself?"
156441,26,181,810000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Thank you, Reverend Lovejoy."

156455,26,195,859000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey Lisa -- Racing from Belmont? Horsies!
156456,26,196,863000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, I'd rather go to heaven."
156457,26,197,866000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"There is something wrong with that kid. She's so moral. Why can't she be more like... well, not like Bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium."
156458,26,198,876000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you know, Bart was looking at that racy movie today, and Lisa's losing a little respect for you... Maybe we should think about unhooking the cable."
156459,26,199,889000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Unhook it?! But I love cable.
156460,26,200,891000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, then maybe you should pay for it."
156461,26,201,894000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, look, Marge. I can't afford it. When I can afford to pay for it, I will. But I can't, so I'm not going to."
156462,26,202,900000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"But Homer, I'm afraid that cable has become an evil presence in our home."
156463,26,203,905000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I never put my foot down about anything."
156464,26,204,905000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
156465,26,205,910000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,...but I am severely tempted to do it over this.
156466,26,206,912000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer."
156467,26,207,914000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I'm sorry, I think it's coming down."
156468,26,208,915000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Homer, not over this. No, no."
156469,26,209,917000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's coming down. My foot is, that's it, Marge. It's coming down. The cable stays. The foot has spoken."
156471,26,211,926000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Ugh! Soccer. Seen it.
156472,26,212,935000,Cable Guy,Simpson Home,"Hey, Simpson!"
156473,26,213,936000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Huh? Hey, how'd you get in here?"
156474,26,214,939000,Cable Guy,Simpson Home,"Well, your door wasn't locked in any serious way. I wonder if you'd be interested in this car stereo? A five hundred dollar value, but I'll let you have it for forty bucks."
156475,26,215,947000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Get out of my house! I don't wanna associate with criminals.
156476,26,216,950000,Cable Guy,Simpson Home,"Well, maybe I'll go see your neighbor."
156477,26,217,951000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,He's not home.
156478,26,218,952000,Cable Guy,Simpson Home,Even better.
156479,26,219,959000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Are you sure you want to do this, Homer? It doesn't look friendly."
156480,26,220,963000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, we can't be too careful. There are thieves everywhere, and I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff."
156481,26,221,970000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come one, come all, Top Hat Theatre is on the air. The most beautiful women in the world. Just fifty-cents. I am your host, Bart Simpson. You must be at least eight years old to enter."
156483,26,222,985000,Top Hat Announcer,Simpson Home,"And now, the Top Hat Channel is honored to present, ""Broadcast Nudes."""
156484,26,223,992000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Gross!
156485,26,224,993000,Martin Prince,Simpson Home,Yet strangely compelling.
156486,26,225,996000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,It's a raid!
156487,26,226,997000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh? What the? I know you -- come back here...
156488,26,227,1004000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that trash! Now go to your room."
156489,26,228,1009000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Man, I wish I was an adult so I could break the rules."
156490,26,229,1009000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh great.
156491,26,230,1017000,Barney Gumble,Simpson Home,"Here, I brought some imported generic beer."
156492,26,231,1020000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thank you, Barney. How many people are coming, Homer?"
156493,26,232,1023000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Just a select circle of my friends.
156494,26,233,1026000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oh Hello, Mrs. Homer. I have brought an assortment of jerkies."
156495,26,234,1029000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, didja swipe those from work?"
156496,26,235,1031000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Certainly not. What has been implied here?
156497,26,236,1034000,Boxing Announcer #1,Simpson Home,"Oh, no sir, there is no love lost between these two warriors. In fact, we almost had a scuffle earlier today, at the weigh-in."
156498,26,237,1041000,Boxing Announcer #2,Simpson Home,I understand you have a special motivation going into this bout.
156499,26,238,1045000,Champ,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I want to dedicate this fight to my manager Vinnie, who got me here, and then passed away just two weeks ago."
156500,26,239,1055000,Boxing Announcer #2,Simpson Home,Any response to that?
156501,26,240,1056000,Challenger,Simpson Home,"Yeth, I would also like to dedicate thIS fight to the memory of his deceased manager."
156502,26,241,1061000,Champ,Simpson Home,You can't do that!
156503,26,242,1062000,Challenger,Simpson Home,I can do whatever I want!
156504,26,243,1064000,Champ,Simpson Home,"You dedicate the fight to your manager, man!"
156505,26,244,1066000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I just want to call attention to the fact that I'm not watching this fight. It's my form of non-violent protest.
156506,26,245,1075000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Hey, Homer, I brought ya..."
156507,26,246,1077000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Quick, it's Moe. I gotta hide the mugs..."

156512,26,251,1100000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mr. Burns! Bart... quick. Hide the stuff I ""borrowed"" from work."
155214,26,252,1106000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Borrowed?
156513,26,253,1107000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, the stuff I stole from work!"

156517,26,257,1121000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Oh, hello, Simpson."
156518,26,258,1124000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,We were just in the neighborhood and thought we'd drop by.
156519,26,259,1128000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ugh, ah, hello, Mr. Burns. Would you like to watch the fight?"
156520,26,260,1132000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"The fight? Don't mind if I do. Oh, Simpson. Good news -- I brought some munchies. Smithers -- the Cheetos."
156522,26,262,1143000,Eddie,Simpson Home,Are you Homer Simpson?
156523,26,263,1150000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah.
156524,26,264,1151000,Lou,Simpson Home,Word on the street is that you have an illegal cable hook-up.
156525,26,265,1156000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No... No I... It wasn't me... It was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... I would never..."
156526,26,266,1158000,Eddie,Simpson Home,"Hey, hey, settle down big fella."
156527,26,267,1162000,Lou,Simpson Home,"We were, whoa, we were just wondering if we could watch the fight?"

156530,26,270,1176000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, Mom. It doesn't seem to be going very well."
156531,26,271,1179000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, don't give up. When you love somebody you have to have faith that in the end they will do the right thing."
156532,26,272,1186000,Boxing Announcer #2,Simpson Home,The Challenger learned how to fight in the notorious projects of Capital City and honed his skills while serving time for aggravated assault and manslaughter in Springfield Prison.
156533,26,273,1198000,Barney Gumble,Simpson Home,"All right, a local boy!"
156534,26,274,1200000,Challenger,Simpson Home,"For five years I was, I was incarcerated, away from my family and the mothers of my children. The conditions were irrevocable."

156536,26,276,1216000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, Lisa, Maggie..."

156539,26,279,1230000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your judging me, but I wanted you to know I've made a couple of really important decisions. Number one: I'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over. And Number Two: I'm not very fond of any of you."
156482,26,280,1246000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, back to the fight."
155252,26,281,1247000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sit down, boy!"

156544,26,285,1260000,Boxing Announcer #1,Simpson Home,"This fight is history! Stick a fork in it, it's done. A stunning knockout by a thunderous bolo punch in the closing seconds of the twelfth round, and Drederick Tatum is the new Champion of the World!"
156545,26,286,1272000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Everyone to my place for blueberry Squishees and microwave burritos!
156546,26,287,1277000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The greatest fight ever and I missed it.

156549,26,290,1285000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Oh, hogwash! Why, I once watched Gentleman Jim Corbett fight an Eskimo fellow bare-knuckled for a hundred and thirteen rounds. Back then, of course, if a fight lasted less than fifty rounds, we demanded our nickel back."
156550,26,291,1297000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Cable clippers, please."
156551,26,292,1298000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here you go, Homie."
156552,26,293,1300000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Go for it Dad!
156553,26,294,1302000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I beg you to reconsider. Tractor pulls, Atlanta Braves baseball, Joe Franklin..."
156554,26,295,1321000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oops.
156555,26,296,1325000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Third time's the charm.
