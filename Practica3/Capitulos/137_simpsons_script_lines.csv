29540,137,7,78000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, just think, Lis, that's our pickle brine burning Sideshow Mel."
29541,137,8,81000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That Sideshow Mel thinks he's so big. Whatever happened to Sideshow Bob?
29542,137,9,86000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't you remember, dad?"
29543,137,10,88000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,He framed Krusty. He tried to kill Aunt Selma. He rigged an election.
29544,137,11,93000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And he tried to murder me.
29545,137,12,95000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, yeah... But what I'll mainly remember is the laughter. I wonder what he's doing now?"
29547,137,14,104000,Sideshow Bob,Springwood Minimum Security Prison,"Ahh, Westminster Abbey. Edward the Confessor himself could not have done better. Now to set the clocks to Greenwich Mean Time."
29548,137,15,116000,Sideshow Bob,Springwood Minimum Security Prison,My dear Abbey!
29550,137,17,122000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Prison,THIS IS THE WAY WE MOP THE FLOOR / MOP THE FLOOR / MOP THE FLOOR / THIS IS THE WAY WE MOP THE FLOOR / ETC.

29555,137,22,148000,Enraged Prisoner,Springfield Prison,"Look here, that's enough, now! I own 60% of that network!"
29556,137,23,152000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Prison,"Alright, break it up, boys. It's time for work detail."
29557,137,24,155000,Enraged Prisoner,Springfield Prison,I suppose you don't like tabloid newspapers either.
29559,137,26,165000,Sideshow Bob,Air Force Base,"There, that's the last condom wrapper."
29560,137,27,172000,Sideshow Bob,Air Force Base,I renew my objection to this pointless endeavor. Informally now and by affidavit later... time permitting.
29561,137,28,179000,Chief Wiggum,Air Force Base,Shut yer word-hole! We gotta get this place clean for the air show.
29562,137,29,183000,Sideshow Bob,Air Force Base,"Air show? Buzzcut Alabamians spewing colored smoke from their whiz-jets to the strains of ""Rock You Like A Hurricane""? What kind of country-fried rube is still impressed by that?"
29563,137,30,195000,Lisa Simpson,Air Force Base,Wow! / Air show! / Cool! /
29564,137,31,199000,Marge Simpson,Air Force Base,Yeah.
29565,137,32,201000,Lisa Simpson,Air Force Base,"I wanna meet the first female Stealth bomber pilot. During the Gulf War she destroyed seventy mosques and her name is Lisa, too!"
29566,137,33,207000,Bart Simpson,Air Force Base,I wanna see some birds get sucked into the engines! Rare ones!
29567,137,34,211000,Marge Simpson,Air Force Base,"This year, I'm making earplugs out of biscuit dough!"
29568,137,35,214000,Marge Simpson,Air Force Base,They're ready.
29570,137,37,218000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,So weary.
29571,137,38,226000,Teenage Girl,Springfield Prison,"Grandma, this is my friend Craig."
29573,137,40,231000,GRANDMA,Springfield Prison,Friend? You mean you two aren't knockin' boots?!
29575,137,42,236000,GRANDMA,Springfield Prison,"Ever do the backseat mambo, Craigy?"
29576,137,43,240000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,I know that voice. TV's bottomless chum-bucket has claimed Vanessa Redgrave.
29577,137,44,246000,GRANDMA,Springfield Prison,Now I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza!
29578,137,45,251000,GRANDMA,Springfield Prison,Yeeeee-haw!

29581,137,48,262000,Chief Wiggum,Air Force Base,"Hey you, the state's not paying you five cents an hour to stand around. Now get busy."
29583,137,49,267000,Sideshow Bob,Air Force Base,"Oh, I'll get busy. I'll get very busy indeed."
29584,137,50,278000,Chief Wiggum,Air Force Base,"You still got it, Bob."
29585,137,51,282000,Bart Simpson,Air Force Base,"Way to guard the parking lot, Top Gun."
29586,137,52,284000,AIRMAN AT THE GATE,Air Force Base,I have three medals for this.
29587,137,53,289000,Chief Wiggum,Air Force Base,"Hey, where is Sideshow Bob and that guy who eats people and takes their faces?"
29588,137,54,293000,Very Normal Prisoner,Air Force Base,"I'm right here, Chief!"
29589,137,55,294000,Chief Wiggum,Air Force Base,Oh. Then where's Sideshow Bob?
29590,137,56,296000,Another Prisoner,Air Force Base,"Uh, he ran off."
29591,137,57,298000,Chief Wiggum,Air Force Base,"Oh, great. Well... if anyone asks, uh, I beat him to death, okay?"
29592,137,58,304000,Lou,Air Force Base,Right.
29593,137,59,312000,Airman Tour Guide,Air Force Base,"At this point in time, I would like to direct your attention to the particular air vehicle next to which I am currently standing. The Harrier jet is one of our more dollar-intensive ordnance delivery vectors."
29594,137,60,321000,Marge Simpson,Air Force Base,Five tires?! Am I seeing things?
29595,137,61,323000,Airman Tour Guide,Air Force Base,"...And although it looks complicated, it is so well-designed even a child could fly it."
29596,137,62,327000,Lisa Simpson,Air Force Base,Can I fly it?
29597,137,63,329000,Airman Tour Guide,Air Force Base,Of course you can not.
29599,137,65,334000,Homer Simpson,Duff Blimp Exhibit,Free Duff! Viva life!
29604,137,70,353000,Milhouse Van Houten,F-15 FIGHTER,"Take that, Mom! Take that, Dad! Send me to a psychiatrist will you?! Take that, Dr. Sally Waxler!!"
29606,137,72,368000,Aide,Air Force Base,"Uh, Colonel, they're expecting you at the podium in ten minutes."
29608,137,74,384000,Sideshow Bob,Air Force Base,Hmmmm.
29609,137,75,387000,Colonel,Air Force Base,What in the world according to Garp?! Those are my dress towels!
29610,137,76,394000,Colonel,Air Force Base,Who's in my private washroom? McGuckett? Let me in!

29612,137,78,399000,Colonel,Air Force Base,"What?! This is Colonel Leslie ""Hap"" Hapablap. If you don't open that door, I'll tear you up like a Kleenex at a snot party!"
29614,137,80,408000,Sideshow Bob,COLONEL'S WASHROOM,You say you're in the military?
29615,137,81,410000,Colonel,COLONEL'S WASHROOM,"Sweet Enola Gay! Son, I'm gonna come in there and corpse you up!"
29616,137,82,415000,Colonel,COLONEL'S WASHROOM,Corpse you up and mail you to Momma!!
29617,137,83,419000,Colonel,COLONEL'S WASHROOM,"Well, where'd he go? Got my knuckles all lined up for nothin'. Sorry, ladies."
29619,137,85,434000,Bart Simpson,Air Force Base,Look at that hunk o' junk.
29620,137,86,438000,Grampa Simpson,Air Force Base,"You're ignorant! That's the Wright Brothers' Plane! At Kitty Hawk in 1903, Charles Lindbergh flew it fifteen miles on a thimble full of corn oil. Single-handedly won us the Civil War, it did."
29621,137,87,451000,Bart Simpson,Air Force Base,So how do you know so much about American history?
29622,137,88,454000,Grampa Simpson,Air Force Base,"I pieced it together, mostly from sugar packets."
29623,137,89,461000,M.P.,Air Force Base,Authorization code?
29624,137,90,463000,Sideshow Bob,Air Force Base,"Code?! Son, this is Colonel Hapablap. That fool McGuckett sprayed runway foam all over Chuck Yeager's Acura. Now get down there with a chammy. Triple-time!"
29625,137,91,471000,M.P.,Air Force Base,"But, Colonel, I'm under strict orders to--"
29626,137,92,472000,Sideshow Bob,Air Force Base,"Sweet Enola Gay, son! Get moving or I'll tear you up like a Kleenex at a sn-- ""snot party."""
29627,137,93,479000,M.P.,Air Force Base,"Sir! Right away, Sir!"
29629,137,95,488000,Homer Simpson,AIR SHOW,"They didn't have any aspirin, so I got you some cigarettes."
29630,137,96,492000,Marge Simpson,AIR SHOW,"Well, maybe my headache will go away once the show starts."
29631,137,97,497000,Colonel,AIR SHOW,"Ladies and gentlemen, what a day for an air show. Not a cloud in the sky!"
29633,137,99,505000,Sideshow Bob,Air Force Base,"Except, perhaps, a mushroom cloud..."
29635,137,101,524000,Colonel,Air Force Base,"""To slip the surly bonds of Earth / And touch the face of God."" ""To Fly"" -- The dream of man and flightless bird alike. And now, hold on tight as we blast through the thrilling highlights of aviation history!"
29636,137,102,545000,Colonel,Air Force Base,"Say, did somebody say box-kites?"
29637,137,103,548000,Bart Simpson,Air Force Base,No!
29639,137,105,552000,Martin Prince,Air Force Base,The common box-kite was originally used as a means of drying wet string...
29642,137,108,564000,Loudspeaker,Air Force Base,'CAUSE WE CAN FLYYYYYYY / 'CAUSE WE CAN FLYYYYY-YYYY!
29643,137,109,569000,Marge Simpson,Air Force Base,Do they have to play that rock music?! Every note is pounding into my skull!
29646,137,112,579000,Colonel,AIR SHOW,Anybody out there feel the need for speed?
29647,137,113,582000,Lisa Simpson,AIR SHOW,Yay!
29648,137,114,584000,Marge Simpson,AIR SHOW,Yay.
29649,137,115,584000,Colonel,AIR SHOW,Then get ready for the pride of the United States Air Force -- the British-made Harrier Jump Jet!
29650,137,116,591000,Lisa Simpson,AIR SHOW,Da-ad! Why aren't you looking?
29651,137,117,597000,Homer Simpson,AIR SHOW,"Heh, heh. Why jerk my neck around like a goon when Tyranno-Vision decides what I should look at?"
29652,137,118,603000,Homer Simpson,AIR SHOW,"Oo, look, it's Maggie!"
29653,137,119,607000,Homer Simpson,AIR SHOW,Uh... Maggie?
29654,137,120,609000,Bart Simpson,AIR SHOW,Sideshow Bob!
29656,137,122,611000,Sideshow Bob,AIR SHOW,"Hello, Springfield. Sorry to divert your attention from all the big noises and shiny things, but something's been troubling me lately: television. Wouldn't our lives be so much richer if television were done away with?"
29657,137,123,626000,Moe Szyslak,AIR SHOW,What?!
29658,137,124,628000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,AIR SHOW,Surely he's not talking about VH-1!
29659,137,125,630000,Sideshow Bob,AIR SHOW,"Why, we could revive the lost arts of conversation... and scrimshaw. Thus, I submit to you: we abolish television. Permanently."
29660,137,126,640000,Homer Simpson,AIR SHOW,"Go back to Massachusetts, pinko!"
29661,137,127,642000,Sideshow Bob,AIR SHOW,"Oh, and one more thing, I've stolen a nuclear weapon. If you do not rid this city of television within two hours, I will detonate it. Farewell."
29662,137,128,656000,Sideshow Bob,AIR SHOW,"By the way, I'm aware of the irony of appearing on TV in order to decry it, so don't bother pointing that out."
29663,137,129,664000,Marge Simpson,AIR SHOW,"Kids, everything's going to be okay! Don't panic! Just don't panic!"
29664,137,130,666000,Lisa Simpson,AIR SHOW,"Mom! Mom, you're stepping on my heels and knocking my shoes off!"

29669,137,135,688000,Marge Simpson,AIR SHOW,Wait!! Wait! My children are in there!
29670,137,136,690000,Sentry,AIR SHOW,"You must be very proud, Ma'am."
29673,137,138,695000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Air Force Base,Our city will not negotiate with terrorists! Is there a city nearby that will?
29674,137,139,700000,Colonel,Air Force Base,"No need, Sir. We'll find that headcase faster than Garfield finds lasagna. Oh. I'm sorry... My... my wife thought that was gangbusters."
29675,137,140,716000,Grampa Simpson,Air Force Base,This elevator only goes to the basement. And someone made an awful mess down there!
29676,137,141,726000,Soldier #1,Air Force Base,Watch out! He's got his probe!
29678,137,143,733000,Lisa Simpson,Air Force Base,Bart! Bart! What are you doing?! We've got to get out of here!
29679,137,144,738000,Bart Simpson,Air Force Base,Target sighted. Launching air-to-nerd missile!
29680,137,145,740000,Lisa Simpson,Air Force Base,"Ow! C'mon, Mom and Dad are waiting!"
29681,137,146,743000,Colonel,Air Force Base,"Bob is not here! We have searched every square inch of this base, and all we have found is porno, porno, porno!"
29682,137,147,753000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Air Force Base,We only have twenty minutes left. Send in the esteemed representatives of television.
29683,137,148,761000,Krusty the Clown,Air Force Base,"Hey, hey! Now this is my kind of meeting!"
29684,137,149,765000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Air Force Base,"Gentlemen, it's time we face up to the un-face-up-to-able. We must sacrifice television in order to save the lives of our townspeople."
29685,137,150,774000,Krusty the Clown,Air Force Base,"Whoa, whoa, hoa, hoa, let's not go nuts. Would it really be worth living in a world without television? I think the survivors would envy the dead."
29686,137,151,787000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Air Force Base,"I appreciate your passion on behalf of your medium, but I'm afraid we're out of options. Television must go. May God have mercy on our souls."
29687,137,152,805000,Kent Brockman,Air Force Base,"...And as my final newscast draws to a close, I'm reminded of a few of the events that brought me closer to you: the collapse of the Soviet Union, premium ice cream price wars, dogs that were mistakenly issued major credit cards and others who weren't so lucky. And so, farewell."
29688,137,153,818000,Kent Brockman,Air Force Base,"Um, and, uh, don't forget to look for my new column in PC World magazine."
29690,137,155,827000,Bumblebee Man,Channel Ocho,"Muchos gracias, amigos, por todas las memorias... Y super-gracias a Goya!"
29692,137,157,836000,Sideshow Bob,Somewhere,"Success! They're giving in! Blast, I should've made more demands. Some decent local marmalade, for one. Oh, well, next time."
29695,137,159,848000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Agh! Not my Extendo-Glove! Oh, they haven't made those since the war! Not... oh, not my Paris backdrop! How'm I gonna make fun of the Frogs?"
29696,137,160,861000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Wait. If I could only stay on the air, I'd have a hundred percent of the audience. Think of the ratings."
29698,137,162,871000,Homer Simpson,Air Force Base,"Okay, so we can't go over the fence."
29699,137,163,873000,Marge Simpson,Air Force Base,I feel so helpless. What if something happens to them?
29700,137,164,877000,Homer Simpson,Air Force Base,"I'm sure they're fine, honey."
29701,137,165,879000,Marge Simpson,Air Force Base,"Well, at least they're wearing clean underwear."
29702,137,166,886000,Bart Simpson,Air Force Base,"Free 'n' easy, Lis. Ahh. There's nothing like an unfurnished basement for pure comfort."
29703,137,167,892000,Lisa Simpson,Air Force Base,"Huh? Hurry up, Mom and Dad are probably worried sick."
29704,137,168,897000,Colonel,Air Force Base,You know what really frosts my Kelvinator? That fruitcup's probably still laughing at us from his damn hidey-hole.
29705,137,169,903000,Aide,Air Force Base,"I'd rather take an order from Bill Clinton than hear that guy's snooty, high-toned voice again, Sir."
29706,137,170,909000,Lisa Simpson,Air Force Base,"High-toned voice. Bart, that's it. I know where Sideshow Bob is hiding."
29707,137,171,914000,Lisa Simpson,Air Force Base,"When Bob broadcast that message, his voice was higher than normal. And what makes your voice high?"
29708,137,172,921000,Bart Simpson,Air Force Base,"Tight, binding underwear?"
29709,137,173,922000,Lisa Simpson,Air Force Base,Helium. Sideshow Bob is in the Duff Blimp!
29711,137,175,928000,Sideshow Bob,Duff Blimp,"All Springfield trembles before the might of Sideshow Bob! Blasted helium. Shoo, shoo, shoo. Ahh, that's better."
29712,137,176,939000,Sideshow Bob,Duff Blimp,Gone... gone too... fabulous... marvelous...
29713,137,177,943000,Recorded Announcer,Duff Blimp,This is the Emergency Broadcast System. Stand by for an urgent bulletin.
29714,137,178,948000,Krusty the Clown,Duff Blimp,Hey hey!
29715,137,179,951000,Krusty the Clown,Duff Blimp,"Krusty the Klown is back on the air! Eight -- no, no, twelve hours a day! The only game in town!"
29716,137,180,958000,Sideshow Bob,Duff Blimp,Krusty?!! But how?!
29717,137,181,961000,Krusty the Clown,Duff Blimp,Comin' at ya live from the Civil Defense Shack in the remote Alkali Flats of the Springfield Badlands!
29719,137,183,968000,Krusty the Clown,CIVIL DEFENSE SHACK,"I'll be beamin' out eleven watts of wackiness -- hour after hour of unscripted, unrehearsed comedy! Featuring... um... you know... uh..."
29720,137,184,976000,Krusty the Clown,CIVIL DEFENSE SHACK,"Professor Gas Can! And, uh, former President Ike Eisenhower!"
29721,137,185,983000,Krusty the Clown,CIVIL DEFENSE SHACK,Let's get busy!
29722,137,186,985000,Sideshow Bob,CIVIL DEFENSE SHACK,"Oh, my utopia lies in ruins! How naive of me to think a mere atom bomb could fell the chattering cyclops."
29724,137,188,1002000,Sideshow Bob,CIVIL DEFENSE SHACK,"Well, at least I'll have my revenge..."
29725,137,189,1004000,Bart Simpson,CIVIL DEFENSE SHACK,"Bob, no!!"
29726,137,190,1006000,Lisa Simpson,CIVIL DEFENSE SHACK,Don't you see? That would be taking the easy way out --
29727,137,191,1009000,Sideshow Bob,CIVIL DEFENSE SHACK,I agree.
29729,137,193,1034000,Sideshow Bob,Duff Blimp,"""Best before November 1959."" Dammit, Bob, there were plenty of brand new bombs, but you had to go for that retro Fifties charm."
29731,137,195,1042000,Sideshow Bob,Duff Blimp,"Well, if it isn't my arch-nemesis Bart Simpson and his sister Lisa, to whom I'm fairly indifferent."
29732,137,196,1049000,Bart Simpson,Duff Blimp,So Krusty double-crossed you. But your basic plan was pure genius. Where do you get your ideas?
29733,137,197,1057000,Sideshow Bob,Duff Blimp,"Oh, please, let's not embarrass us both with that hoary old ""stall the villain with flattery"" scheme."
29734,137,198,1065000,Bart Simpson,Duff Blimp,I should've known you were too smart to fall for that.
29735,137,199,1068000,Sideshow Bob,Duff Blimp,Really? What type of smart? Book smart? Because there are a lot of people who are book smart. But it takes a very special type of genius to--
29736,137,200,1074000,Chief Wiggum,Duff Blimp,"Alright, Bob, it's over! Come out with your hands up!"
29737,137,201,1078000,Sideshow Bob,Duff Blimp,No! How did they find me?!
29738,137,202,1097000,Lisa Simpson,Duff Blimp,He's getting away!
29740,137,204,1102000,Colonel,HARRIER JET,"Aw, not the Harrier! We've got a war tomorrow."
29741,137,205,1106000,Sideshow Bob,HARRIER JET,God bless the idiot-proof Air Force.
29742,137,206,1114000,Airman With Pistol,HARRIER JET,They're gone!
29743,137,207,1117000,Colonel,HARRIER JET,"Hell, not the Wright Brothers' Plane! The Smithsonian's gonna have my ass on a platter!"
29745,137,209,1126000,Bart Simpson,Air Force Base,Daaadd! Hellllp!
29747,137,211,1131000,Homer Simpson,Air Force Base,"Hang on, boy! Daddy's comin' to save ya!"
29751,137,213,1136000,Lisa Simpson,Air Force Base,Mom! I found Sideshow Bob's hide-out and I got a secret message to the police and I had a blimp fall on me and I was in an atomic blast but I'm okay now!
