153888,18,4,91000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Look, there's only one thing worse than being a loser. It's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. And I never want that to happen to me."

153898,18,13,135000,Homer Simpson,Bus,"Sure, we get a nice mix here."
153899,18,14,137000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,"I can't think of a better place to spend a balmy summer's night than the old ball yard. There's just the green grass of the outfield, the crushed brick of the infield, and the white chalk lines that divide the man from the little boy."
153900,18,15,149000,Homer Simpson,Bus,"Lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. It comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here."
153901,18,16,155000,Marge Simpson,Bus,"I hope you'll space out the tubs this year, Homer."
153902,18,17,158000,Homer Simpson,Bus,What are you getting at?
153903,18,18,159000,Marge Simpson,Bus,"Well, last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire."
153904,18,19,163000,Homer Simpson,Bus,"Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the right - no, the duty, to make a complete ass of myself."
153906,18,21,173000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bus,"Ah, the Gammills. Good to see you."
153907,18,22,176000,GAMMILL,Bus,"You're an inspiration to all of us in waste management, sir."

153922,18,37,227000,Bart Simpson,Park,"Lousy, washed-up, broken-down... old tub of guts... who does he think he is anyway..."
153923,18,38,233000,Homer Simpson,Park,"What's the matter, boy?"
153924,18,39,234000,Bart Simpson,Park,He wouldn't sign my ball.
153925,18,40,235000,Marge Simpson,Park,"Well, he's a fine role model. Bart, give me that ball!"
153926,18,41,240000,Player #1,Park,"Hey, Flash, check out the mature quail headin' this way."
153927,18,42,243000,FLASH,Park,"Hey there, little lady. What can Flash do for ya?"

153941,18,56,297000,C. Montgomery Burns,BALL PARK,"Heh, heh. As well they might. You know, Smithers, when I was a young buck, my patented fadeaway pitch was compared by many to the ""trouble ball"" of the late great Satchel Paige. Spit on this for me, Smithers."
153942,18,57,308000,Waylon Smithers,BALL PARK,"One hocker coming up, sir."
153943,18,58,315000,Bart Simpson,BALL PARK,What a lame-o!

153969,18,88,475000,Homer Simpson,PRESS BOX,"Ohhh. Well, if someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe I'm all turned around on the subject. Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?"

153989,18,107,562000,Homer Simpson,BALL PARK,"As I got up in front of them, I felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol. It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle."

153994,18,112,599000,C. Montgomery Burns,BALL PARK,"Yes. Unfortunately, Homer Simpson's shameless display of exhibitionism tainted the entire evening. I want him banned for life from all company outings."
153997,18,115,614000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,"I thank you. You're too kind. Glad you enjoyed it, but I can't take all the credit. The batter did his part, too."
153998,18,116,622000,MR. O'HARA,Parking Lot,"Excuse me... You, sir -- the dancing fella. I'm Antoine ""Tex"" O'Hara. I own the Isotopes. Would you be interested in becoming our official mascot?"
153999,18,117,630000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,M-- me? A mascot for a bush league team?
154000,18,118,635000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,"I should have slept on it. Or at least stared blankly for a while. Perhaps if I'd been unable to think of a nickname, all our lives might have been spared."
153895,18,119,644000,Man On Bus,Parking Lot,"Hey, get on the bus, dancin' Homer."

154005,18,126,664000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Nope, this was my own bright idea. C'mon, we gotta hurry. Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. Save room for your nachos."
154006,18,127,672000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"For the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me, they were laughing towards me."

154020,18,141,776000,MR. O'HARA,OWNER'S OFFICE,"Homer, now we both knew when you began doing this you weren't gonna be here forever..."
154021,18,142,780000,Homer Simpson,OWNER'S OFFICE,"Oh, oh, oh, I get it. You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. You make me sick."
154022,18,143,787000,MR. O'HARA,OWNER'S OFFICE,"Homer, I'm not firing you. I just got the word -- You've been called up to Capital City."
154023,18,144,792000,Homer Simpson,OWNER'S OFFICE,Me? In the majors?
154024,18,145,794000,MR. O'HARA,OWNER'S OFFICE,That's right.
154025,18,146,795000,Homer Simpson,OWNER'S OFFICE,"Wait a minute, Capital City has a mascot. The greatest mascot there is: The Capital City ""Goofball""."
154026,18,147,802000,MR. O'HARA,OWNER'S OFFICE,"Yeah, but he's getting on in years and he needs someone to fill in for a couple of innings a night. Could be a big opportunity for you."
154027,18,148,809000,Homer Simpson,OWNER'S OFFICE,I'll say!
154028,18,149,810000,MR. O'HARA,OWNER'S OFFICE,Why don't you talk it over with your family?
154029,18,150,811000,Homer Simpson,OWNER'S OFFICE,Because they might say no.
154031,18,152,814000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced. I should've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife.
154032,18,153,820000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I shouldn't have called her that. Bite my tongue. Bite my tongue. Oooh.
154034,18,155,824000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't leave Springfield. I was born here and I thought I would die here.
154035,18,156,828000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It won't be so bad. You'll die someplace else.
154036,18,157,831000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, what am I supposed to do about friends?"
154037,18,158,834000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Phfft. You'll make new and better friends.
154038,18,159,837000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"But, Dad. We're simple people with simple values. Capital City is too big and too complex. Everyone in Springfield knows us and has forgiven us."
154039,18,160,846000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I'd be lying if I didn't say that this scares me a little. But we all have a calling, a reason The Almighty put us on this Earth. And yours might be to dance on dugouts."
154040,18,161,857000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean -- ?
154041,18,162,858000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Let's do it, Homer!"
154042,18,163,859000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, let's blow this pop stand and never look back."
154043,18,164,862000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.
154044,18,165,866000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not that simple. I've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence.
154046,18,167,870000,Supervisor,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Sure. What would you like -- four years? Five years?
154048,18,169,874000,NED,Simpson Home,"So, Simpson. You're really moving to Capital City?"
154049,18,170,877000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's right, Ned."
154050,18,171,878000,NED,Simpson Home,"Uh huh. And all this stuff is for sale, huh? You know, I-I-I... don't know how to say this, but, well..."
154051,18,172,883000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, knock it off, Flanders! Don't start blubbering on me. I'm gonna miss you too... not."
154053,18,174,889000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"I don't know, Bart. I mean, I'm gonna miss you and all, but..."
154054,18,175,894000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Come on, Milhouse. This way we'll be friends forever."
154055,18,176,897000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"Well, okay."
154056,18,177,899000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,Ewww!

154058,18,179,903000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"I'm gonna miss you, spit brother."
154060,18,181,905000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"I can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, my leaving would actually have meant something."
154062,18,183,915000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we have one quick stop and then it's on to Capital City."
154063,18,184,919000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,I can't believe it. Our baby sister in the big city.
154064,18,185,923000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,I'll call you every day.
154065,18,186,923000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"I'll call you, too."

154101,18,226,1108000,Homer Simpson,Capital City Cap Dome,Bart was strangely quiet. Later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. That wouldn't last.

154118,18,243,1183000,Marge Simpson,CAP DOME,You'd think the player's wives would be a little closer to the action.
154119,18,244,1186000,First Wife #3,CAP DOME,"Actually, this section is for the player's ex-wives."
154120,18,245,1189000,First Wife #1,CAP DOME,And then I found out that all the while there was this bimbo in Kansas City.
154121,18,246,1194000,First Wife #3,CAP DOME,Throw at his head!
154122,18,247,1197000,Homer Simpson,CAP DOME,Who'd've thought it? A free ticket to a big league park but I was too tense to enjoy the game. Every ounce of concentration I possessed was focused on the task at hand.

154129,18,254,1229000,Homer Simpson,CAP DOME,But they didn't care.
154130,18,255,1233000,Bart Simpson,CAP DOME,What's with these people? Why are they sitting on their hands?
154131,18,256,1236000,Lisa Simpson,CAP DOME,"Mom, what's he doing wrong?"
154132,18,257,1237000,Marge Simpson,CAP DOME,I don't know.
154133,18,258,1239000,Homer Simpson,CAP DOME,It was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark.
154134,18,259,1243000,Spectator #1,CAP DOME,This guy doesn't make me want to cheer.
154135,18,260,1245000,Spectator #2,CAP DOME,"Gee, I really pity him. Making a fool of himself in front of so many people."

154137,18,262,1253000,Homer Simpson,CAP DOME,The only applause I got was for dragging my carcass out of there.

154139,18,264,1262000,Dave Rosenfield,CAP DOME,"I'm sorry, young man; you're just not ready. Pick up your check at the front office... and for God's sake, put some clothes on!"
154141,18,266,1267000,Bart Simpson,STADIUM,"Well, I guess it's back to good old Springfield."
154144,18,267,1269000,Lisa Simpson,STADIUM,But I can't go back! Not after I've seen the bright lights of Capital City. I'll wither and die like a hothouse flower.
154145,18,268,1276000,Marge Simpson,STADIUM,Now stop it you two. And don't look too down. I'm sure this is hard enough for your father.
154146,18,269,1284000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,What a family.
154148,18,271,1286000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,My wife and kids stood by me. On the way home I realized how little that helped.
154150,18,273,1292000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"So that's it. The costume's buried now. As my son would say, I'm one sad ape-like dude."
154151,18,274,1299000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Wow.
154152,18,275,1300000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,What a saga.
154153,18,276,1301000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. I've become the center of attention."
154154,18,277,1307000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, it's riveting."
154155,18,278,1308000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Tell it again, Homer."
154156,18,279,1309000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Okay. I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.
154157,18,280,1315000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I don't know. They just do.
