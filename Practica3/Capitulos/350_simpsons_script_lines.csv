90591,350,34,172000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why? Is it messing you up?

90598,350,42,201000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,"Uh, yes. You relented at age twelve when he pulled you out of a house fire. Which you later found out he started. You should have seen the look on your face. In fact, here it is."

148366,350,45,214000,Teenage Milhouse,Simpson Home,"Sorry I'm late, Lisa. I was at the gym, totally gunning my lats. Just gunning 'em!"

90626,350,73,347000,Jenda,Girls Bathroom,"Oh, sorry, Lisa. Sink activate! I love your dress. Soap activate!"
90627,350,74,353000,Jenda,Girls Bathroom,Bart tells me you got into Yale. Sink terminate!
90645,350,75,355000,Teenage Lisa,Girls Bathroom,"Yeah, even though McDonald's owns Yale now, it's still a great school. And I could never afford to go there if I hadn't won the Montgomery Burns Scholarship."
90628,350,76,363000,Jenda,Girls Bathroom,"Oh yeah, that's the thing he had to do as punishment for stealing Christmas."
90646,350,77,367000,Teenage Lisa,Girls Bathroom,Yeah. I miss Christmas.

90637,350,86,392000,Jenda,Limo,"Whoa, look out! Bart, are you sure about this limo driver you hired?"
90639,350,88,398000,Otto Mann,Wooded Area,"I can fly! I can fly! Just kidding, I know I can't fly. I can glide, though!"
148318,350,90,418000,Teenage Bart,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"Jenda, I think we're ready to go all the way."
90641,350,91,422000,Jenda,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"Bart, don't be nervous. Sex on prom night is as American as our fifty-first state: Saudi-Israelia."
148319,350,92,429000,Teenage Bart,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"Jenda, that's not what I meant."
148320,350,93,432000,Teenage Bart,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,I love you. Will you marry me?
90642,350,94,436000,Jenda,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"That's really sweet... but marriage is a three-year commitment. I mean, do you even know what you're gonna do with your life?"
148321,350,95,444000,Teenage Bart,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"I've got it all figured out! You can waitress while I learn to cut meat. We'll live in a trailer, but to avoid paying for parking, I'll drive while you sleep. We'll never, ever stop!"
90647,350,96,455000,Jenda,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"Bart, I hate to say this, but I think outgrew you."
148322,350,97,458000,Teenage Bart,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,When?
90648,350,98,458000,Jenda,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,Just this minute.
90649,350,99,464000,Robo-Wiggum,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"Okay, love birds. Break it up."
90650,350,100,466000,Robo-Wiggum,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"Hey, this one's alone. Ha. What a loser."
90651,350,101,471000,Robo-Wiggum,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"Aw... you want some chicken? Just grab it with your hands, go ahead. We're not fancy here."
90653,350,103,488000,Bart Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,I'm tired of this. I wanna look at a different future.
90654,350,104,503000,Bart Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Meh.
148323,350,106,505000,Teenage Bart,Springfield,So that's how Jenda dumped me.
90656,350,107,508000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Son, sometimes people just grow apart, like me and your Mom."
148324,350,108,512000,Teenage Bart,Springfield,"No, Mom dumped you 'cause you blew all our money on this underwater house."
90657,350,109,517000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"She'll realize she was a fool, when..."
90658,350,110,520000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Hey! Come back with my patio furniture!
90660,350,112,524000,Homer Simpson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"Stupid flounders. Hey, I've got a great idea. We'll find some new lady friends."
90661,350,113,530000,Homer Simpson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"C'mon, boy, we're hitting the town. After decompressing, of course."
148325,350,114,543000,Teenage Bart,UNDERWATER HOUSE,So... what do you do to kill time in here?
90662,350,115,546000,Homer Simpson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,There's a DVD player but it doesn't work.
148326,350,117,553000,Teenage Bart,Springfield Streets,Why'd you buy the first hover car ever made? Didn't you know it'd take time to work out the kinks?
90664,350,118,559000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,I know! It's a hover car!
90665,350,119,571000,Bender,Springfield Streets,All right! You guys are my new best friends.
90666,350,120,575000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"You wish, loser!"
90668,350,122,597000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey Moe, hey Moe-clone."
90669,350,123,600000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Hiya Homer. / Hi Homer.
90670,350,124,602000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, hey, hey! I don't pay you to socialize."

90672,350,126,606000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Watch it with the attitude, Mister. You came from my back fat!"
90673,350,127,610000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Boy, I think I see my two favorite letters of the alphabet. E-Z."
90674,350,128,618000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,You moron! Why did I ever think I needed a clone?
90676,350,129,623000,MOE-CLONE,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, I'm not the clone, you're the clone!"
90677,350,130,626000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh please, not this again."
90678,350,131,628000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Son, say hello to Edna."
148327,350,132,636000,Teenage Bart,Moe's Tavern,"Dad, that's my fourth grade teacher!"
90679,350,133,638000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Oopsie.
148328,350,134,640000,Teenage Bart,Moe's Tavern,"Hi, Mrs. K. This is sure weird, huh?"
90680,350,135,643000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Moe's Tavern,Want it to get weirder?
148329,350,136,645000,Teenage Bart,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, I... don't think so."
90681,350,137,648000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Moe's Tavern,"Good call, Bart. We can both do better."
148330,350,138,652000,Teenage Bart,Moe's Tavern,"I wish I could talk to my fourth grade self just once. I'd say ""work hard, don't be such a screw up."""
148331,350,140,655000,Teenage Bart,Professor Frink's Lab,This time is so precious -- don't waste it!
90683,350,141,661000,Lisa Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,"Bart, maybe you should listen to this."
90684,350,142,663000,Bart Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,Oh! Now I have to start over.
90691,350,144,672000,Teenage Lisa,Simpson Home,Is that robot break-dancing?
148332,350,145,674000,Teenage Bart,Simpson Home,No. He activated his self-destruct mechanism.
148333,350,146,679000,Teenage Bart,Simpson Home,Love can really be painful.
90692,350,147,681000,Teenage Lisa,Simpson Home,Tell me about it. I broke up with Milhouse.
148334,350,148,684000,Teenage Bart,Simpson Home,How'd he take it?
90693,350,149,685000,Teenage Lisa,Simpson Home,Uh...
90698,350,151,688000,Teenage Milhouse,Downtown Springfield,What Lisa's problem? Milhouse mother say Milhouse handsome!
148335,350,153,698000,Teenage Bart,Simpson Home,I guess everyone in this family is doomed to wind up alone.
90694,350,154,702000,Teenage Lisa,Simpson Home,"Look, if you want Jenda to take you back you should show some initiative. Get a job."
148336,350,155,706000,Teenage Bart,Simpson Home,"A career? No problem, I speak three languages."
90695,350,156,709000,Teenage Lisa,Simpson Home,Armpit noises are not a language.
148337,350,157,711000,Teenage Bart,Simpson Home,Oh yeah?
90696,350,158,715000,Teenage Lisa,Simpson Home,"Look, my point is, show Jenda you want to be successful and she might take you back. It's never too late for love."
90688,350,159,722000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I am so glad you think so."
90689,350,160,725000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids... I want you to know I've started seeing someone. He's from Springfield, I think you know him..."
90690,350,161,733000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Hey hey! Krusty the Clown is dating your mom!
148338,350,163,740000,Teenage Bart,Simpson Home,"When Jenda hears about my great new career, she'll definitely take me back."
90700,350,165,751000,Anoop,FUTURISTIC KWIK-E-MART,You missed a spot. Do it again!
148339,350,166,755000,Teenage Bart,FUTURISTIC KWIK-E-MART,"Yes, Mr. Gheet."
90701,350,167,756000,Anoop,FUTURISTIC KWIK-E-MART,"I'm Anoop, you racist cracker!"
90702,350,168,759000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FUTURISTIC KWIK-E-MART,"Bart, I need you to make a delivery to an elderly shut-in."
90703,350,169,762000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FUTURISTIC KWIK-E-MART,"And to get there, you must go through the forbidden zone."
148340,350,170,767000,Teenage Bart,FUTURISTIC KWIK-E-MART,"Which one? Radioactive, smallpox, eternal midnight..."
90704,350,171,770000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FUTURISTIC KWIK-E-MART,"No, no. The one with the uni-clams."
148342,350,179,794000,Teenage Bart,Burns Manor,"Oh, I get it. You can't tip me because your hands are tied. My Dad pulls that scam all the time."
90711,350,180,800000,Snake Jailbird,Burns Manor,"Don't move, teenage Bart."
90712,350,181,803000,Snake Jailbird,Burns Manor,I've got you covered with my phaser-slash-cell phone.
90713,350,182,809000,Snake Jailbird,Burns Manor,"Dude, this is totally not the time to call me... I don't know, some kinda pasta... look, just get me what you're having, all right?... ew, not that."
90714,350,183,819000,Snake Jailbird,Burns Manor,What soups do they haaave...
90715,350,184,825000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Oh blessed urchin! How can I reward you?
148343,350,185,828000,Teenage Bart,Burns Manor,Uh... with the diamond?
90716,350,186,831000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"No, sorry. My diamonds are going to be retro-morphed into coal... the most valuable substance on earth. I know. I'll send you to Yale, with the Monty Burns Scholarship."
148344,350,187,840000,Teenage Bart,Burns Manor,I can't take your scholarship! It's going to my sister. It would break her heart.
90717,350,188,844000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Don't be so quick to say no. The ladies love an ivy-leaguer...
148345,350,189,848000,Teenage Bart,Burns Manor,They do?
90718,350,190,850000,Snake Jailbird,Burns Manor,Oh yeah!
90719,350,191,851000,Snake Jailbird,Burns Manor,"Once I home-invaded this Princeton dude, and he was like totally married."
90720,350,192,857000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,"Well, I guess an intensive four-year bachelor of arts program is the easiest way to get Jenda back."
90722,350,193,862000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Hello, Smithers. Nice of you to drop by... after my life was saved."
90723,350,194,866000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"Sir, you knew I was on a date."
148346,350,195,868000,Teenage Bart,Burns Manor,Mr. Smithers? I thought you were... you know... a...
90724,350,196,872000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"No, I'm straight now. As long as I take these injections every ten minutes."
90725,350,197,876000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,I love boobies!
90746,350,199,879000,Teenage Lisa,Simpson Home,"It's so great that Yale has finally forbidden men from taking science. Now let's see, should I major in Femistry or Galgebra?"
148347,350,200,888000,Teenage Bart,Simpson Home,"Listen, Lis, I've gotta tell you something. I'm going to Yale."
90747,350,201,892000,Teenage Lisa,Simpson Home,What? I don't want to go to the same college as you.
148348,350,202,896000,Teenage Bart,Simpson Home,Then I've got some great news! You're not going to Yale!
90728,350,205,903000,Bart Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,"Hey, I didn't do anything! Yet."
90729,350,206,907000,Lisa Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,You've wrecked my life! / You're gonna wreck my life!
90732,350,209,918000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"Hey Marge, why are you with Krusty? These kids are too old for clowns."
90733,350,210,922000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield High School,"Actually, Homer, I'm... into your lady."
90734,350,211,925000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"Hey, man, she's not my lady anymore. We split up, it's all cool, I... I'll kill you!"
90735,350,212,934000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield High School,Once they destroy each other...
90736,350,213,936000,MOE-CLONE,Springfield High School,...then we make our move.
90737,350,214,938000,Spider Moe,Springfield High School,"Yes, we make our move. What? A spider got into the cloning machine."
90739,350,216,944000,Seymour Skinner,GRADUATION STAGE,"Attention everyone. Please welcome our Valedictorian, Lisa Simpson. She will be attending Yale...I mean, Hot Dog on a Stick Management Camp."
90740,350,217,958000,Jenda,GRADUATION STAGE,That's odd. You get into Yale and Lisa can't go anymore.
90741,350,218,962000,Bart Simpson,GRADUATION STAGE,"Hey, what can I say. I love learning."
90742,350,219,964000,Seymour Skinner,GRADUATION STAGE,Bartholomew Simpson!
148349,350,220,966000,Teenage Bart,GRADUATION STAGE,What?

148350,350,222,969000,Teenage Bart,GRADUATION STAGE,Why don't you mail it to your butt?
90749,350,223,971000,Seymour Skinner,GRADUATION STAGE,"Bart, now that you've graduated I can finally say this: you really press my cider."
90753,350,227,982000,Teenage Nelson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"Yo, Bart! Good to see you're back with Jenda."
148351,350,228,985000,Teenage Bart,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"Hey, Nelson. What's up with your girlfriends?"
90754,350,229,988000,Teenage Nelson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,They each had twins.
90755,350,230,991000,Teenage Nelson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"Listen, girls... um, I'm goin' out for a pack of cigarettes."
90756,350,231,995000,Teenage Sherri,UNDERWATER HOUSE,Isn't that what your father said the day he left you?
90757,350,232,999000,Teenage Nelson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"Yeah. I never understood why he did it... 'til now! I'm comin', Papa!"
90758,350,233,1007000,Teenage Nelson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,Haw haw!
90759,350,234,1011000,Milhouse Van Houten,UNDERWATER HOUSE,Lisa had no right to break up with me. I'm not the first guy to get a nosebleed during a slow dance.
148352,350,235,1020000,Teenage Bart,UNDERWATER HOUSE,I'd better go talk to him.
90760,350,236,1022000,Jenda,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"Well, don't take too long. I think this might be our special night."
90767,350,237,1030000,Teenage Milhouse,UNDERWATER HOUSE,Why did Lisa dump me? Is it because of my small calves? They're the hardest place to add mass!
148353,350,238,1036000,Teenage Bart,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"Cheer up, Milhouse. You got your whole life ahead of you."
90768,350,239,1040000,Teenage Milhouse,UNDERWATER HOUSE,Oh no!
148354,350,240,1043000,Teenage Bart,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"Hey, I remember when you were a nerdy little fourth-grader. And now you're an emotionally crippled mini-Hulk. What girl wouldn't want that?"
90769,350,241,1051000,Teenage Milhouse,UNDERWATER HOUSE,Do you think Lisa might see that now that she's got nothin' else?
148355,350,242,1051000,Teenage Bart,UNDERWATER HOUSE,I guess so.
90770,350,243,1055000,Teenage Milhouse,UNDERWATER HOUSE,Boo yeah! Time to strike while the iron is sad!
90771,350,245,1061000,Teenage Milhouse,DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER,All right! Three hours to blast my quads!
90772,350,246,1066000,Teenage Milhouse,DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER,Li-sa! Li-sa! Li-sa!
90763,350,248,1072000,Jenda,Streets Of Springfield,"Bart, what's wrong? You seem distracted."
148356,350,249,1076000,Teenage Bart,Streets Of Springfield,"Oh, I was just thinking about Milhouse and Lisa."
90764,350,250,1079000,Jenda,Streets Of Springfield,M-hm. What are you thinking about now?
148357,350,251,1084000,Teenage Bart,Streets Of Springfield,"Hey, that rundown old house looks familiar! That's where Doc Frink used to live!"
90765,350,252,1091000,Jenda,Streets Of Springfield,I never had this problem with Todd Flanders.
148358,350,254,1100000,Teenage Bart,Professor Frink's Lab,This machine lets us look into the future. Wouldn't that be romantic?
90773,350,255,1105000,Jenda,Professor Frink's Lab,I'll tell you what would be romantic. Making love for the first time.
148359,350,256,1109000,Teenage Bart,Professor Frink's Lab,Totally. Right after I fiddle with these dials and levers.
90774,350,257,1118000,50-ish Lisa,Professor Frink's Lab,"You know, I was thinking of taking a poetry class at the community college."
90775,350,258,1123000,50-ish Milhouse,Professor Frink's Lab,Forget it. I had to sell all my marrow to pay the light bill.
90776,350,259,1128000,50-ish Milhouse,Professor Frink's Lab,I didn't have much marrow.
148360,350,260,1131000,Teenage Bart,Professor Frink's Lab,I can't let that happen. I gotta go.
90777,350,261,1135000,Jenda,Professor Frink's Lab,"Listen, Bart, if you leave me now, I can guarantee one thing: your future won't have me in it."
90789,350,263,1143000,Teenage Milhouse,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,Not going to Yale isn't the end of the world.
90784,350,264,1146000,Teenage Lisa,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"Yeah, I'm starting to see that."
90790,350,265,1148000,Teenage Milhouse,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"No, I mean, you're screwed! Your only hope is to clutch at straws! Straws who've always loved you."
90785,350,266,1156000,Teenage Lisa,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,Really?
148368,350,267,1157000,Teenage Milhouse,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,Really. C-can I kiss you?
90786,350,268,1160000,Teenage Lisa,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"Um, have you eaten onions lately?"
148369,350,269,1163000,Teenage Milhouse,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,No. But it's really hard 'cause I'm on an all-onion diet.
90787,350,270,1169000,Teenage Lisa,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,Well... okay. I guess this is my destiny.
148361,350,271,1177000,Teenage Bart,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,Nooooo!!!!!
148370,350,272,1177000,Teenage Milhouse,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,What are you doing?
148362,350,273,1179000,Teenage Bart,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,Keeping Lisa from destroying her life!
148371,350,274,1181000,Teenage Milhouse,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"Come on, let her destroy it!"
148372,350,276,1190000,Teenage Milhouse,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,Lenny! Carl! Can you pull me out?
90779,350,277,1194000,Lenny Leonard,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"Sorry, we're ghosts now."
90780,350,278,1196000,Carl Carlson,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,Our spirits live in those two trees.
90781,350,279,1198000,Lenny Leonard,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,"Or, maybe we're alive and we just feel like jerkin' you around."
90782,350,280,1201000,Carl Carlson,CLIFF WITH CITY VIEW,Or maybe we're one of each.
148363,350,282,1207000,Teenage Bart,Springfield Streets,"Look, I'm not taking the scholarship. You're the one who deserves to go to Yale."
90788,350,283,1211000,Teenage Lisa,Springfield Streets,"Oh, that's so noble. But what about Jenda?"
148364,350,284,1214000,Teenage Bart,Springfield Streets,"Hey, I'm waiting 'til I find a girl who likes me for me."
90792,350,286,1218000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,And you will! At the age of eighty-three. You die one minute later.
90793,350,287,1224000,Bart Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,And my brain is put in a...
90794,350,288,1226000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,Pauper's grave.
90795,350,289,1227000,Lisa Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,"Well Bart, I really appreciate what you're gonna do for me."
90796,350,290,1231000,Bart Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,But what happens to our parents?
90798,350,292,1236000,Homer Simpson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"Marge, I thought you'd never take me back after what I did to Krusty."
90799,350,293,1241000,Marge Simpson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,You mean get beaten up by him?
90800,350,294,1243000,Homer Simpson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,Exactly.
90801,350,295,1244000,Marge Simpson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"And I'll admit, it is kinda romantic under the sea."
90802,350,296,1248000,Homer Simpson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,You don't know the half of it.
90803,350,297,1277000,Bart Simpson,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"Oh, this sucks. I want to see Vice-President Cletus."
90804,350,298,1279000,VICE-PRESIDENT CLETUS,UNDERWATER HOUSE,"You want me to attend the funeral of the Sultan of Brunei? I would consider it my honor. Brandine, pack my evenin' britches. We goin' to Brunei!"
