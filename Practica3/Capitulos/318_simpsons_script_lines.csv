81749,318,24,129000,Homer Simpson,Sprawl-Mart,How dare you challenge my perceptions of what old people can do?
81750,318,25,132000,Grampa Simpson,Sprawl-Mart,I'm a Greeter! I'm here to make every visit special! And to size up potential shoplifters!
81751,318,26,140000,Nelson Muntz,Sprawl-Mart,Like I can't shoplift with my mouth.
81752,318,27,142000,Nelson Muntz,Sprawl-Mart,Haw haw!

81759,318,34,169000,Selma Bouvier,Sprawl-Mart,Your names can't hurt us.
81761,318,36,174000,Lisa Simpson,Sprawl-Mart,"Aunts Patty and Selma, can you help us pick out a Mother's Day gift?"
81762,318,37,179000,Selma Bouvier,Sprawl-Mart,You could give her one of these.
81763,318,38,180000,Patty Bouvier,Sprawl-Mart,"A Kitchen Carnival. We got one when we appeared on an episode of ""The Price Is Right"" which the network refused to air."
81764,318,39,189000,Selma Bouvier,Sprawl-Mart,Apparently we're not TV pretty.
81765,318,40,189000,Bart Simpson,Sprawl-Mart,Wow! It's a machine that makes carnival food at home.

81772,318,47,228000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, Marge, get a room!"
81710,318,48,255000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Only my hairdresser knows for sure.
81773,318,49,267000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmm, dare I pour caramel over the cotton candy?"
81777,318,53,286000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm gonna pour caramel on my clothes. And then, finally, I can eat my shorts."
81779,318,55,294000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What is that?!
81780,318,56,295000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This is eighty-five pounds of tooth-melting sugar. Dig in!
81781,318,57,304000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's it, kids. Suckle Daddy's sugar ball."
81783,318,59,326000,Lou,Simpson Car,"Chief, that guy shouldn't be in the carpool lane. His passenger is just a big piece of candy."

81792,318,68,354000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Cats!
81793,318,69,357000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Flanderses!
81794,318,70,362000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,I was saving sugar for my wedding night!
81795,318,71,366000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, it's time you got rid of that thing. All that candy is rotting your brain."
81796,318,72,372000,Candy Ball,Simpson Home,I think you should get rid of her. Then we can be together... forever!
81797,318,73,378000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe you're right, Marge. Or maybe you're right, candy ball. No, Marge. Then again... No, Marge. Definitely Marge."
81799,318,75,399000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,"Goodbye, old friend. I'll think of you whenever I have a stroke or a heart attack."
81801,318,77,411000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,"Oh my God, I'm gonna be killed by a bear! Well, I guess I don't have to worry anymore about the dangers of smoking."
81802,318,78,418000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DUMP,Smooth.
81806,318,82,432000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie! What happened to you?
81807,318,83,435000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, please. I'm too upset to talk about it."
81808,318,84,437000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But seeing you like this is more than I can bear.
81128,318,85,441000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bear?!
81809,318,86,443000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"... the angry president woke up, crawled out of his grave, and went back to work."
81810,318,87,449000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"That sound can mean only one thing -- it's time for another installment of ""Kent's Cowards."""
81811,318,88,452000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,Today's clip comes straight from the Springfield dump.
81812,318,89,461000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you got attacked by a bear?!"
81813,318,90,464000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I did a lot of stuff today. I went to Starbucks, but you didn't see that on tape."
81816,318,93,497000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"That hilarious footage was shot by local hunter, Grant Connor -- not with a gun, but with a camera!"
81817,318,94,504000,Grant Connor,Simpson Home,"That's right, Kent. I often get guns and cameras confused. One time, tragically, at a wedding."
81818,318,95,510000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't care if they think you're a coward, Dad. You did the right thing, hiding and crying."
81819,318,96,516000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, we'd rather have a live sissy mincing around the house than some dead hero any day."
81820,318,97,521000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Choke on your candor!
81821,318,98,526000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You can strangle Bart, but you can't strangle your humiliation."
81822,318,99,530000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's a deal!
81824,318,101,535000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey Simpson, I heard your Dad is afraid of a little old giant grizzly bear."
81825,318,102,541000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Elementary School,The only thing my Dad's afraid of is paying child support.
81826,318,103,545000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,My Dad once beat up six employees at KFC. And he'd been up for three days.
81828,318,105,550000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Homer Simpson, report to Mr. Burns' office immediately."
81830,318,107,563000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What a delightful practically-based joke.
81833,318,110,571000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hello? Anyone home?
81834,318,111,574000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge? Maggie?
81836,318,113,584000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""The Bear Went Over The Mountain""?! ""The Berenstain Bears""?! Ahhh, Goldilocks... and the Three Bears!"
81837,318,114,599000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh God, they're in our food! Teddy Grahams, Gummi Bears..."
81838,318,115,613000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you a Care Bear?
81839,318,116,615000,Care Bear,Simpson Home,I'm an intensive care bear.
81840,318,117,617000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why does a bear need a crowbar?
81841,318,118,620000,Care Bear,Simpson Home,I don't like to get my hands dirty.
81844,318,121,629000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Crying in the corner huh? Mind if I join you?
81845,318,122,632000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, go ahead."
81847,318,124,639000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right. That's enough, Fraidy Sue. Here's what you gotta do: find that bear what whupped you, and whup him back."
81848,318,125,646000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Can I fight human-style? By slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile?
81849,318,126,653000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You cowardly Swede! You face that bear like a man, or I'll never speak to you again."
81850,318,127,659000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But how will I find out what you had for lunch in nineteen twenty-eight?
81851,318,128,663000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I have a web site.
81852,318,129,665000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Welcome to my homepage. Why don't you visit more often?
81854,318,131,673000,Grant Connor,GRANT CONNOR'S HOUSE,"Mr. Simpson, if you want to find that bear that attacked you, use this."
81855,318,132,678000,Grant Connor,GRANT CONNOR'S HOUSE,It tracks an electronic tag I stuck in the bear's ear. It's the same technology they use to keep tabs on Gary Busey.
81856,318,133,685000,Homer Simpson,GRANT CONNOR'S HOUSE,"Finally, science has joined forces with revenge."
81857,318,134,689000,Grant Connor,GRANT CONNOR'S HOUSE,"Now, listen. The bull grizzly is seven feet tall, weighs more than a Mazda Miata, and can tear through a tree like a Jewish mother through self-esteem. Next time you face him, you better have some way to protect yourself."
81859,318,136,716000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Lookin' good. And I did it all without wasting money on one of those stupid welder's masks.
81861,318,138,724000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Behold! The ultimate in anti-bear technology: The Bear Buster Five Thousand. Available wherever fat men dream.

81864,318,141,748000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, there's no rear on that thing."
81865,318,142,750000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know. If I get really scared, I don't want to ruin the suit."
81867,318,143,754000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now look here, mister. I forbid you to fight a bear."
81868,318,144,757000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What kind of an example would I be if I didn't take revenge on things?
81869,318,145,761000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you can't get revenge on an animal. That's the whole point of Moby Dick."
81870,318,146,765000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, the point of Moby Dick is ""be yourself."""
81871,318,147,765000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're not going, and that's final."
81872,318,148,772000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. But do you know how ridiculous you look right now?
81873,318,149,784000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you awake? Marge?"
81875,318,151,804000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,Marge is sure gonna be steamed when she finds you missing.
81876,318,152,804000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,Or dead.
81877,318,153,809000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him."
81878,318,154,816000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're sneakin' out to fight that bear. I wanna go too.
81879,318,155,821000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No way. If something happens to me, you have to carry on the Simpson name."
81880,318,156,825000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Screw that. When I grow up, I'm legally changing my name to Joe Kickass."
81881,318,157,828000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That is so cool. All right, you can come."
81882,318,158,832000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, I think your father just left!"
81883,318,159,835000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,And Bart's missing too!
81884,318,160,837000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I've got a bad feeling about this. Let's check the suit closet.
81886,318,162,841000,Lisa Simpson,SUIT CLOSET,Zoot suit... astronaut outfit... Southern belle... Renaissance dandy... Country-western octopus...
81887,318,163,848000,Lisa Simpson,SUIT CLOSET,It's gone!
81888,318,164,850000,Marge Simpson,SUIT CLOSET,That man and his foolish pride! We've gotta go follow him.
81889,318,165,855000,Lisa Simpson,SUIT CLOSET,"I just wanted to see what it was like. Howdy, y'all. If you don't like mah song, I'll spray ya with ink!"
81891,318,167,866000,Homer Simpson,Woods,I never realized how hot this suit is. I'm sweating out all my blood-lust!
81892,318,168,872000,Bart Simpson,Woods,Why don't you take a bath in the river? This bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago.
81893,318,169,877000,Homer Simpson,Woods,Suh-weet.
81894,318,170,882000,Bart Simpson,Woods,"Hey, the batteries are missing from this thing."
81895,318,171,884000,Lenny Leonard,Woods,"Yeah, we borrowed 'em for the radio."

81903,318,182,919000,Marge Simpson,FOREST ROAD,"Mr. Connor, thank you for helping find my husband. I don't want my last words to him to be ""clip your toenails, they look like Fritos."""
81904,318,183,922000,Bart Simpson,FOREST ROAD,Mom! Mom! Stop the car!
81905,318,184,930000,Bart Simpson,FOREST ROAD,Dad went to take a bath and the bear carried him off!
81906,318,185,933000,Carl Carlson,FOREST ROAD,"Yeah, it almost wrecked the whole trip."
81907,318,186,935000,Grant Connor,FOREST ROAD,"Ma'am, I will find your husband before that bear kills him. But first, a snack."
81909,318,188,951000,Homer Simpson,Cave,"I guess this is it. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die a man."
81910,318,189,962000,Homer Simpson,Cave,Is this thing hurting you?
81912,318,191,977000,Homer Simpson,Cave,"Okay, it's probably the tag. But just to be sure..."
81913,318,192,991000,Homer Simpson,Cave,"Hey, you're not mean. It was just this tag that made you go ape-scat. We're not so different. Give me a hug."
81914,318,193,1003000,Homer Simpson,Cave,Jeez! I don't know why bear hugs enjoy such a great reputation.
81918,318,197,1027000,Homer Simpson,Field,That's funny.
81919,318,198,1033000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Oh no, the hunter has become the hunter!"
81920,318,199,1037000,Homer Simpson,Field,He must be following this thing. Well I'm gonna make sure it never harms another living creature.
81922,318,201,1050000,Radio Announcer,CAMPGROUND,"A killer bear is on the loose in Springfield Forest, and local laughingstock Homer Simpson is missing and presumed mauled."
81923,318,202,1057000,Homer Simpson,CAMPGROUND,"Wrong again, liberal media."
81924,318,203,1061000,Radio Announcer,CAMPGROUND,A bounty has been placed on the rogue bear in the amount of ten thousand dollars.
81925,318,204,1066000,Homer Simpson,CAMPGROUND,"Don't worry, I'll find you someplace safe."
81927,318,206,1072000,Grant Connor,Woods,The bear is no longer wearing his tracking device. And it looks like he's headed toward that wildlife sanctuary.
81928,318,207,1079000,Marge Simpson,Woods,Is there any sign of my husband?
81929,318,208,1081000,Grant Connor,Woods,"Your husband appears to be traveling with the bear, either as hostage or as what we call a ""Forest Bride."""

81935,318,214,1108000,Homer Simpson,OPEN FIELD,Wait! Stop! I know bullets can be scary sometimes. But I have an idea. First we pull off all of your fur.
81937,318,216,1118000,Homer Simpson,OPEN FIELD,"All right, all right I'm still thinking!"
81938,318,217,1120000,Homer Simpson,OPEN FIELD,"They're looking for a male bear, right?"
81940,318,219,1126000,Homer Simpson,OPEN FIELD,"It's so easy to condemn, so hard to create."
81941,318,220,1129000,Grant Connor,OPEN FIELD,"Okay boys, that bear's gonna make a dash for freedom. Unless we take him down."
81942,318,221,1135000,Cletus Spuckler,OPEN FIELD,"Yeah, all the way down."
81943,318,222,1138000,Grant Connor,OPEN FIELD,What you said didn't really add much.
