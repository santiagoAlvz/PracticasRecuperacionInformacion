32254,148,1,31000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, Spring Break in Hong Kong. Custom-made suits at slave-labor prices..."
32255,148,2,35000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Good lord, they've got this all wrong."
32256,148,3,40000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, this is Principal Seymour Skinner."
32257,148,4,42000,Ticketing Agent,Springfield Elementary School,"How can I help you, Principal?"
32258,148,5,43000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm afraid there are some problems with my tickets. I asked for a center seat, not an aisle seat. I specifically requested not to have the kosher meal. And I booked the flight leaving Saturday morning, not Friday morning!"
32259,148,6,54000,Ticketing Agent,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, I've gone ahead and made those changes. And with the one-day advance purchase price, it's just an extra... $7,830."
32260,148,7,61000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"G.M. Chrysler!! I can't afford that! But I can't close the school a day early just to suit my vacation. Or can I? Think, Seymour, think..."

32263,148,10,76000,Seymour Skinner,Bart's Classroom,"Yes, Go to Work with Your Parents Day! Tomorrow, you will learn by doing and apply your knowledge of fractions and gym to real-world situations!"
32265,148,12,85000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I still don't understand why you get to stay home and watch Mom work.
32266,148,13,88000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Because I've always been an advocate of women in the workplace, Lis."
32267,148,14,92000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't help it if Mom's workplace contains our TV.
32270,148,15,95000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm honored, Bart. And Lisa, you'll have a fine time at the plant with Dad. You've been interested in nuclear power for years."
32271,148,16,102000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I've signed numerous petitions to shut down that plant.
32272,148,17,105000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, there you go."
32273,148,18,106000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, you're blocking the TV. If you need something to do, you can fill out my form. Here."
32274,148,19,110000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Parent's occupation... Please note: Homemaker is not allowed, as it is not real work. That's why you don't get paid for it."""
32275,148,20,117000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart can take my place at the plant!
32276,148,21,122000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, but he so wanted to see women in the workplace..."
32277,148,22,124000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, how about Aunt Patty and Aunt Selma at the D.M.V.?"
32279,148,24,127000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of course! Of course! I would never, ever have thought of that!"
32281,148,26,135000,Patty Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,Some days we don't let the line move at all.
32282,148,27,139000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,"We call those ""weekdays."""
32283,148,28,142000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,Good one.
32284,148,29,143000,Bart Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Well, at least I'm not stuck at the cracker factory like Milhouse."
32286,148,31,148000,Milhouse Van Houten,Cracker Factory,Wow!
32287,148,32,153000,Kirk Van Houten,Cracker Factory,Ever wonder how crackers get salted?
32288,148,33,156000,Milhouse Van Houten,Cracker Factory,Have I?!
32290,148,35,159000,Milhouse Van Houten,SALTING ROOM,Wow!
32291,148,36,161000,Crackerman,SALTING ROOM,Crackers Ho!
32292,148,37,163000,Milhouse Van Houten,SALTING ROOM,I never knew cracker production could be so exciting! But where do they make those crackers with the peanut butter already inside?
32293,148,38,170000,Kirk Van Houten,SALTING ROOM,"Ah, put this on and come with me, Son."
32295,148,40,177000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Donut?
32296,148,41,179000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, thanks. Do you have any fruit?"
32297,148,42,182000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,This has purple stuff inside. Purple is a fruit.
32298,148,43,185000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh... Oh -- this is a map of nuclear sites around the country. As a safety inspector, I am responsible for changing most of these light bulbs."
32299,148,44,194000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Why are there so many burnt-out ones?
32268,148,45,197000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,'Cause they won't hire an assistant.
32301,148,47,201000,"Martin Prince, Sr.",Springfield Commodities Exchange,"Martin, here's ten dollars to invest in"
32302,148,48,201000,"Martin Prince, Sr.",Springfield Commodities Exchange,the futures market.

32307,148,53,215000,"Martin Prince, Sr.",Springfield Commodities Exchange,"And now you've lost all but $600. You got greedy, Martin."
32309,148,55,221000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'm sorry. I guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me.
32310,148,56,225000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Maybe we can make your job more fun... What are those?
32311,148,57,229000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I don't know.
32312,148,58,231000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, what if we used our imaginations...?"
32313,148,59,233000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Houston, we have a problem. Homer 13 is spinning out of control!"
32314,148,60,239000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'm going after him!
32315,148,61,245000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Boy, this is a lot more fun with a second person!"
32317,148,63,253000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Okay, one more step. I just gotta go laminate your license. You'll get it in two to three weeks."
32318,148,64,259000,Cletus Spuckler,Department of Motor Vehicles,Hot damn! No more sittin' in the dirt at the drive-in!
32319,148,65,263000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Bart, I left the driver's-license-making machine on. Turn it off."
32321,148,67,276000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,25 years old?! You're not 25 years old! This I.D. is completely fake!
32322,148,68,283000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Yes. You are right, Milhouse. It is a fake. Which makes it a fake I.D."
32323,148,69,288000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,A fake I.D.?! Cool!!
32324,148,70,291000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,And it's our ticket to the best Spring Break of our lives!

32332,148,80,328000,Milhouse Van Houten,STREET OUTSIDE MOE'S,"Spring breeeaaak! Yeah! Well, when are we gonna get rowdy?"
32333,148,81,336000,Bart Simpson,STREET OUTSIDE MOE'S,Maybe when we find something decent to do with this I.D.
32334,148,82,339000,Nelson Muntz,STREET OUTSIDE MOE'S,We could go rent a carpet shampooer...
32335,148,83,343000,Martin Prince,STREET OUTSIDE MOE'S,"Greetings, chums! Were your days at work as profitable as mine? I just had a sinful shopping spree at Wee World."
32336,148,84,352000,Bart Simpson,STREET OUTSIDE MOE'S,"Well, we're having the best Spring Break of our lives, and we don't need you around nerding it up."
32337,148,85,356000,Milhouse Van Houten,STREET OUTSIDE MOE'S,That job is taken.
32338,148,86,358000,Martin Prince,STREET OUTSIDE MOE'S,But surely I and my $600 could play some small part in your vacation fun.
32339,148,87,363000,Bart Simpson,STREET OUTSIDE MOE'S,"Oh yeah, right. Like there's any way to get some kicks with a big wad of cash and a license to drive..."

32355,148,103,428000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not fair! I'm the best student in school. How come I never heard about this competition?
32356,148,104,435000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe because you are, as we say in Latin, a Dorkus Malorkus."
32357,148,105,440000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's not Latin. Mom, Bart's faking it."
32358,148,106,443000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, honey, you've had your glory. Now it's Bart's turn."

32374,148,121,532000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, owls, eh? So you probably wouldn't want to spend another day at work with me..."
32375,148,122,537000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Sure I would! I can always learn about owls this summer at Bird Camp.
32377,148,124,547000,Martin Prince,Bart's Car,"Ah, we've arrived in the vast cornfields of Canada! How much farther to the Grammar Rodeo?"
32378,148,125,553000,Nelson Muntz,Bart's Car,Grammar Rodeo?! We're goin' to a Grammar Rodeo?!
32379,148,126,557000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Car,"We're not going to a Grammar Rodeo! That was just an alibi, Milton!!"
32380,148,127,561000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Car,Martin.
32381,148,128,562000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Car,Martin.

32385,148,132,568000,Martin Prince,Bart's Car,"Well, I realize it's trite, but we could tour the bridges of Madison County..."
32386,148,133,573000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Car,"Hey, who has better vacation ideas than Triple-A? According to the publisher of this Triple-A guidebook, no one."

32413,148,159,662000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Workstation,"Boy, Lisa, with you here this hardly seems like work at all. I don't know how I'm gonna make it through my nightshift without you."
32414,148,160,669000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Workstation,We could have a slumber party.
32415,148,161,670000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Workstation,"Oh, that'd be great! Sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire... It'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting-goods store."

32479,148,228,949000,Bart Simpson,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,"Well, we've still got a car and a wad of cash."
32480,148,229,952000,Martin Prince,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,"Er, no we don't. I must've spent our last ten dollars on this Al Gore doll."
32481,148,230,958000,Al Gore Doll,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,You are hearing me talk.
32360,148,231,961000,Nelson Muntz,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,I hate this place!
32482,148,232,968000,Bart Simpson,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,We've got no car!
32483,148,233,969000,Martin Prince,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,We've got no money!
32484,148,234,971000,Milhouse Van Houten,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,And no one knows we're here!
32485,148,235,972000,Martin Prince,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,We're stranded!
32487,148,237,975000,Nelson Muntz,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,"But on the plus side, I knocked over the Sunsphere."
32488,148,238,982000,Nelson Muntz,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,Haw haw!
32489,148,239,987000,Nelson Muntz,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,"This never would've happened if we'd gone to Macon, Georgia. I'm just sayin', is all."
32490,148,240,994000,Martin Prince,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,"Fellows, I think perhaps the time has come to call our parents."
32491,148,241,998000,Bart Simpson,DOWNTOWN KNOXVILLE,"No!! They'd kill us! Look, we got here on our own, so we can survive here on our own. All we need is money, food, and a way to get home. Follow me."

32503,148,253,1033000,Bart Simpson,PAWN SHOP,Come on! This train goes right through Springfield!
32506,148,256,1049000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Of course I'll accept! Bart! I've missed you so mu-- You want to speak to Lisa?
32507,148,257,1058000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So how's the National Grammar Rodeo, Bart?"
32508,148,258,1061000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, I really need your help, so I'm gonna let you in on a secret. There's no such thing."
32509,148,259,1065000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I knew it! I knew it because why would they have our National Grammar Rodeo in another nation?! Oh, Bart, you're going to be in sooo much trouble when--"
32510,148,260,1071000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm in trouble already. Here's what happened...So you've got to think of a way I can come home for free.
32512,148,261,1081000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmm... You could travel for free if you were a stewardess. Well, how badly do you want to get home? All right, all right, how about a courier? They travel for free, too. No, that's a terrier. They're dogs."
32515,148,264,1096000,Owner,Knoxville Bonded Courier Service,"Well, you sure don't look 25, but your unlaminated, out-of-state driver's license is proof enough for me. Here's your first assignment."
32517,148,266,1116000,Bart Simpson,Hong Kong International Airport,Zhè shì nide yánjing.
32518,148,267,1116000,Chinese Doctor,Hong Kong International Airport,Xiè xiè.
32519,148,268,1116000,Seymour Skinner,Hong Kong International Airport,What the...?
32521,148,270,1122000,Milhouse Van Houten,Knoxville Bonded Courier Service,"Can we call our parents yet, Bart?"
32522,148,271,1127000,Bart Simpson,Knoxville Bonded Courier Service,"Lisa? This isn't working. I've got to courier something to Springfield. And it's gotta be big enough to fit Milhouse, Martin, and Nelson inside."
32523,148,272,1133000,Lisa Simpson,Knoxville Bonded Courier Service,"But Bart, that'll cost a fortune."
32524,148,273,1136000,Owner,Knoxville Bonded Courier Service,"Simpson, how'd you like to escort 500 Big Macs to Marlon Brando's island?"
32525,148,274,1140000,Bart Simpson,Knoxville Bonded Courier Service,"Oh, I can't take much more of this. I'm counting on you, Lis."
32527,148,276,1150000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Whee.
32528,148,277,1151000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"What's wrong, honey?"
32529,148,278,1153000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"There's something troubling me, Dad...but I don't think I can tell you because it's a secret."
32530,148,279,1157000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, you don't have to tell me, but I thought we trusted each other with our secrets now. I mean, I haven't told a soul about your new boyfriend."
32531,148,280,1164000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Langdon Alger? Oh, I don't like him anymore... Okay, but you've got to promise you won't get mad or tell anyone, especially Bart."
32532,148,281,1171000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I promise.
32533,148,282,1173000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Bart rented a car with a phony driver's license and drove Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin to a wig outlet in Knoxville and the car got crushed and they're out of money and they can't get home and Bart's working as a courier and just came back from Hong Kong."
32534,148,283,1182000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes, that's a real pickle. Would you excuse me for a moment?"
32536,148,285,1199000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"All right, I have thought this through. I will send Bart the money to fly home, and then I will murder him."
32537,148,286,1206000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, no! Then he'll know I told! Dad, you said I could trust you."
32538,148,287,1213000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Okay, we'll work this out together. First things first: where is Knoxville?"
32539,148,288,1218000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"It's in Tennessee, right next to the Oak Ridge Nuclear Facility, birthplace of the atomic bomb."
32540,148,289,1224000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, maybe we could order something from Oak Ridge..."
32541,148,290,1226000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,...and Bart could be the courier!
32542,148,291,1230000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Y'ello, Oak Ridge? This is Springfield Nuclear. We need to order a... uh...T-437 Safety Command Console."
32543,148,292,1242000,Oak Ridge Engineer,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, Springfield, my computer shows your T-437 is fully operational."
32544,148,293,1246000,Oak Ridge Engineer,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, I suggest you... Oh my God! Oh, God, no! Oh! This can't be happening! This... You're operating without a T-437, Springfield!! Oh, Sweet Mother of Mercy! I mean... I mean... My God!..."
32545,148,294,1259000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"And have it sent to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, care of Homer J.--"
32546,148,295,1264000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No! Don't use your real name, or Bart will know!"
32547,148,296,1267000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Forget the name Homer Simpson. Have it sent care of... Langdon Alger.
32549,148,298,1274000,Milhouse Van Houten,Cargo Plane,"Uh, Bart... Bart, we really could use another air hole."
32550,148,299,1280000,Bart Simpson,Cargo Plane,Ssshh! They'll know you're in there!
32552,148,301,1286000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,...but I don't think I'd go back again next year. It's getting too commercial. They've forgotten it's supposed to be about the grammar.
32553,148,302,1301000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello? Oh, hello, Principal Skinner... No, Bart has never been to Hong Kong... Goodnight."
32554,148,303,1312000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello? Tennessee State Police? No, my son's car was not crushed in Knoxville. I don't know where to begin telling you what's wrong with that."
32555,148,304,1323000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello? No, Bart is not available tomorrow to deliver a human kidney to Amsterdam!"
32557,148,306,1332000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, are you laughing at me?"
