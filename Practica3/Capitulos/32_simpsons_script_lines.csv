158065,32,1,28000,JANEY,Springfield Elementary School,Did you hear about Miss Hoover? She drank a bottle of drain cleaner by mistake.
158066,32,2,32000,Chuck,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, I heard she fell down a well."
158067,32,3,36000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Come on now. Oh.
158068,32,4,38000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"My god, she's been dumped again."
158069,32,5,40000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Children, I won't be staying long. I just came from the doctor and I have Lyme disease. Principal Skinner will run the class until a substitute arrives."
158070,32,6,49000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,What's Lyme disease?
158071,32,7,50000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, I'll field that one. Lyme disease is spread by small parasites, called ticks. When a diseased tick attaches itself to you and begins sucking your blood,"
158073,32,9,58000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Malignant spirochetes infest your bloodstream, eventually spreading to your spinal fluid, and on into the brain."
158074,32,10,63000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"The brain? Oh, dear God!"
158075,32,11,66000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Come on, Elizabeth. Come, come."
158076,32,12,68000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well now, children, here we are, open your primers to page 32."
158077,32,13,73000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, substraction."
158078,32,14,77000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Bart Simpson... I know it's you.
158079,32,15,81000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,And here comes Snowball II. This is the one we kept.
158080,32,16,84000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,Ewwwwwww!
158081,32,17,86000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"We were going to keep the gray one, but the mother ate her."
158055,32,18,87000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,Ewwwwww!
158056,32,19,89000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"Mrs. Krabappel, he's traumatizing the children."
158082,32,20,92000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"As usual, I agree with you, Martin. Bart, shut that off and take your seat immediately."
158083,32,21,95000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh look, this is really cool. When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in."
158085,32,23,105000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"No children, your not seeing things, this, my little friends, is a schwa."
158086,32,24,114000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Are you the substitute?
158087,32,25,116000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, sir. Yes I am."
158088,32,26,117000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Are you insane?
158089,32,27,118000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"No, no sir. No, I'm not. It's my way of getting their attention."
158090,32,28,121000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, all right. Play friendly with your new teacher, children!"
158091,32,29,125000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,Howdy. I am a Texas cowboy. The year is 1830. You young'uns ask me any questions you like.
158092,32,30,131000,Chuck,Springfield Elementary School,Can we play kickball instead of science after lunch?
158093,32,31,134000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Kickball? Son, there ain't no kickball in 1830. Any other questions?"
158094,32,32,138000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Shoot! It's awfully quiet on the plains here. Well, how about this? Everybody, I want to see two eyes on every single person staring right at me, right now. There are three things wrong with my costume. Anybody names those three things will get my hat."
158095,32,33,152000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I believe I know the answer.
158096,32,34,154000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, well, wha... wha...what's your name?"
158097,32,35,156000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Lisa Simpson.
158098,32,36,157000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, go ahead, Miss Simpson."
158099,32,37,158000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Um, one: Your belt buckle says ""State of Texas"", but Texas wasn't a state until 1845."
158100,32,38,163000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,Very good.
158101,32,39,164000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Two: the revolver wasn't invented until 1835.
158102,32,40,167000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,That's excellent.
158103,32,41,168000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Three: You seem to be of the Jewish faith.
158104,32,42,170000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,Are you sure I'm Jewish?
158105,32,43,171000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Or Italian?
158106,32,44,171000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,I'm Jewish.
158107,32,45,172000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,And there weren't any Jewish cowboys.
158111,32,46,174000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Very good! That's excellent! And I'm also wearing a digital watch, but I'll accept that. Here you go, little lady. And for the record there were a few Jewish cowboys, ladies and gentlemen. Big guys, who were great shots, and spent money freely. I'm Mr. Bergstrom. Feel free to make fun of my name if you want. Two suggestions are Mister Nerdstrom and Mister Boogerstrom."
158112,32,47,188000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Boys and girls, today we will begin selecting a class president."
158113,32,48,198000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm not allowed to vote, but I strongly suggest you elect Martin. Martin..."
158114,32,49,202000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"As your president, I would demand a science fiction library featuring an A-B-C of the Overlords of the genre: Asimov, Master, Clarke..."
158115,32,50,214000,Wendell Borton,Springfield Elementary School,What about Ray Bradbury?
158116,32,51,215000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,I'm aware of his work. Thank you and keep watching the skies.
158117,32,52,221000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Excellent Excellent, Martin."
158118,32,53,224000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"If you're through with your pemmican, why don't we sing a song about cowboys? Now this one's not very accurate, but we can fix it up as we go along. Okay?"
158119,32,54,233000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Home, home on the range. Actually, the range was far from home, it was a very desolate place where danger and disease rode tall in the saddle. Where the deer and the antelope play. Unlike the efficient Indians, cowboys used only the tongue of the antelope and they threw the rest away."
158120,32,55,255000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day."
158121,32,56,267000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, what's this? Did you do it?"
158122,32,57,270000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No! No! It wasn't me! I would never do anything like that. It was just one of those immature people who, instead of building themselves up --"
158123,32,58,276000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,It's neat. Can I have it?
158124,32,59,277000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, but I didn't do it."
158125,32,60,278000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,Are you sure you didn't do it? It's good.
158126,32,61,280000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No, but I'm starting to wish I had."
158127,32,62,282000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Singing Dork!"
158128,32,63,285000,Classmate,Springfield Elementary School,Lisa
158129,32,64,290000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Any other nominations?
158130,32,65,291000,Terri/sherri,Springfield Elementary School,We nominate Bart Simpson!
158108,32,66,293000,Terri/sherri,Springfield Elementary School,Speech! Speech!
158109,32,67,294000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I had a speech ready... but my dog ate it!
158132,32,69,298000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Children! Bart, I need someone very reliable to deliver an important message to the principal's office."
158133,32,70,304000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Would you do it for me?
158134,32,71,306000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Why, Mrs. Krabappel! How would I know where the principal's office is?"
158135,32,72,312000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"People, what have I told you about encouraging him? When Bart wins approval for making a fool of himself, it makes him think that --"
158136,32,73,319000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Yay, Bart!"
158137,32,74,327000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Nobody, of the hundreds of people that visited the fair, knew that a grey spider had played the most important part of all. No one was with her when she died."""
158138,32,75,339000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Come on, Janey, everybody has a talent. I want to see yours, that's all."
158139,32,76,352000,JANEY,Springfield Elementary School,I don't have a talent.
158140,32,77,353000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,You cannot talk like that. There has to be something that you can do better than anybody else.
158141,32,78,358000,JANEY,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I can do this --"
158142,32,79,360000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes! Great! Ok, how about you, Ralph?"
158143,32,80,364000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,Wonderful! Chuck?
158144,32,81,368000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, that's disgusting. I love it! Lisa... come on, you're holding out on us. I see a saxophone over there!"
158145,32,82,374000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I can't.
158146,32,83,375000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Come on, Lisa, I bet you're good."
158147,32,84,377000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No, really, I can't."
158148,32,85,378000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,Sure you can; just try.
158149,32,86,379000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Please don't make me do it.
158150,32,87,381000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,All right. You owe me something special.
158151,32,88,388000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"So while I'm technically still married, there really hasn't been any marriage to speak of since Mister Krabappel moved into his little ""love nest."""
158152,32,89,397000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,This profession can put a lot of strain on a marriage.
158153,32,90,400000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Since he's been gone, I've been looking for a substitute to teach me a lesson I sorely need."
158154,32,91,406000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Mrs. Krabappel, you're trying to seduce me."
158155,32,92,409000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Well...
158156,32,93,411000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Krabappel, you're very nice, but it's the children I love."
158158,32,95,443000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"When I fall asleep, Mr. Bergstrom is the last thing I think of, and he's my first thought when I wake up."
158159,32,96,447000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmmm, I feel that way about your father."
158160,32,97,449000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no. You don't understand. When Mr. Bergstrom smiles, you only see these teeth --"
158161,32,98,451000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"-- but when you really make him laugh, you can see these two teeth. I think they're called the eye teeth."
158162,32,99,459000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't know if he had orthodontic work or what, but they're absolutely perfect."
158163,32,100,463000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmmm, I notice little things about your father, too."
158164,32,101,466000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Mom. This is different. I mean, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better."
158165,32,102,470000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Your father does that to me.
158166,32,103,471000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, are we gonna talk, or are we gonna talk?"
158167,32,104,475000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, we can talk, but first you have to accept the fact that I feel that way about your father!"
158168,32,105,478000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine.
158169,32,106,480000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yesterday, he read us ""Charlotte's Web"", and cried at the end, never trying to hide his tears."
158170,32,107,489000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A book made him cry! Boo hoo hoo!
158171,32,108,490000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Waaaaaaaah!
158173,32,110,496000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Remember, nobody, and I mean nobody gets back in after lunch without one igneous rock, that's volcanic, and one sedimentary, and that is layered. Lisa, can I see to you for a minute."
158174,32,111,506000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes! Yes, Mr. Bergstrom?"
158175,32,112,508000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, your homework is always so neat. How can I put this? Does your father help you with it?"
158176,32,113,513000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,No. Homework's not my father's specialty.
158177,32,114,515000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, there's no shame in it. I mean my Dad could really --"
158178,32,115,517000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Not mine.
158179,32,116,517000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,You didn't let me finish.
158180,32,117,518000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Unless the next word was burp, you didn't have to."
158182,32,119,522000,Martin Prince,Elementary - Bart's Classroom,"In a sample taken in this very classroom, a state inspector found 1.74 parts per million of asbestos --"
158183,32,120,529000,Bart Simpson,Elementary - Bart's Classroom,That's not enough! We demand more asbestos! More Asbestos!
158057,32,121,533000,Bart Simpson,Elementary - Bart's Classroom,More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos!
158185,32,123,539000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wow! You made the front page.
158186,32,124,542000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, Dad. It's just a popularity contest."
158187,32,125,544000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just a popularity contest?! Excuse me, what's more important than popularity? Now, Bart, do you really think you can win?"
158188,32,126,552000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure, why not?"
158189,32,127,553000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Woo woo! All right! I always knew you had personality. The doctors said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better. President Simpson. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?"
158190,32,128,564000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, yeah."
158191,32,129,565000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, go get 'em."
158192,32,130,568000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"He says, there aren't any easy answers! I say, he's not looking hard enough!"
158193,32,131,577000,Kids,Simpson Home,Yay!
158195,32,133,601000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, you'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator."
158196,32,134,605000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,You're going to miss your brother's antics.
158197,32,135,606000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,When?
158198,32,136,607000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,When? When your life takes you places the rest of us have only heard about.
158199,32,137,611000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Places where my intelligence will be an asset, not a liability?"
158200,32,138,613000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, there is such a place, believe me. It's true."
158201,32,139,616000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I believe everything you say, with your words, your body language and your Semitic good looks."
158202,32,140,622000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"""Dear Miss Hoover: You have Lyme disease. We miss you. Kevin's biting me. Come back soon. Here is a drawing of a spirochete. Love, Ralph."""
158203,32,141,631000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, that's great, Ralph!"
158204,32,142,634000,BERGSTROM,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, kids. I've learned that in two weeks the Springfield Museum of Natural History will be closing forever due to a lack of interest. I urge you to see it while you can."
158206,32,144,646000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmmm, Lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow, and I think you should take her."
158207,32,145,652000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The Museum!
158208,32,146,652000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmmm huh.
158209,32,147,652000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tomorrow... ugh; oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on... sleeping... eating a big sandwich... watching T.V... spending some time with the boy. Spending time with the boy. The boy needs attention, Marge."
158210,32,148,665000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I've been talking to Lisa and I'm concerned about your relationship with her."
158211,32,149,668000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Me, too, Mom. I think they're drifting apart."
158212,32,150,671000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Shut up, boy."
158213,32,151,672000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, please."
158214,32,152,673000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you don't understand. I can't do it because... you're trapped. If you were smarter, you might think of something, but you're not so you just might as well... all right! All right! I'll take her. Lousy brain."
158216,32,154,686000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"Hey, what do you mean by, ""Suggested Donation""?"
158217,32,155,690000,Woman In Booth,Museum,"Pay any amount you wish, sir."
158218,32,156,692000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"And what if I ""wish"" to pay zero?"
158219,32,157,695000,Woman In Booth,Museum,Then it's up to you.
158220,32,158,696000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"Oooh, so it's up to me, is it?"
158221,32,159,698000,Woman In Booth,Museum,Yes.
158222,32,160,699000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"I see, and you think that people are gonna pay you four dollars and fifty cents, even though they don't have to, just out of the goodness of their... Well, anything you say! Good luck, lady! You're gonna need it!"
158223,32,161,714000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,Mr. Bergstrom!
158224,32,162,715000,BERGSTROM,Museum,"Hi, Lisa."
158225,32,163,717000,Homer Simpson,Museum,Hey! You don't have to pay! Read the sign!
158226,32,164,719000,BERGSTROM,Museum,And this must be your father.
158227,32,165,719000,BERGSTROM,Museum,"His teeth had jagged edges to rip through your body, but he could've swallowed you whole!"
158228,32,166,726000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,Wow!
158229,32,167,727000,BERGSTROM,Museum,"Actually, Mr. Simpson, they do know a great deal about the process of mummification. First, they pulled the brain out through the nose with an iron hook, and stuffed the insides with sawdust and onions!"
158230,32,168,736000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,Ewww. Gross.
158231,32,169,737000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"Ohh, pretty creepy. Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than of the Wolf Man."
158232,32,170,742000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,Oh Lord.
158233,32,171,751000,BERGSTROM,Museum,Mr. Simpson... I'm gonna be presumptuous. I have noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.
158234,32,172,756000,Homer Simpson,Museum,She said that?
158235,32,173,757000,BERGSTROM,Museum,"Well, no, she didn't say it, but, you know, she..."
158236,32,174,760000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"But you can tell, right? She looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education, youthful looks and a clean credit record and thinks, ""Why me? What did I do to deserve this fat old piece of -- """
158237,32,175,762000,BERGSTROM,Museum,"Mr. Simpson, you have got to be a bigger man. There is a wonderful girl's future at stake."
158238,32,176,775000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"Well, if she's so wonderful, give her an A."
158239,32,177,775000,BERGSTROM,Museum,I am giving her an A.
158240,32,178,775000,Homer Simpson,Museum,Great. But don't tell her it was a favor to me. Tell her she earned it.
158241,32,179,781000,BERGSTROM,Museum,"Mr. Simpson, she did earn it."
158242,32,180,782000,Homer Simpson,Museum,You are smooth. I'll give you that.
158244,32,182,789000,Lisa Simpson,SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT STAIRCASE,He ruined the one chance I had of getting to know Mr. Bergstrom outside of school.

158270,32,208,845000,JANEY,Springfield Elementary School,"No, that means she was faking it."
0,32,209,848000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"No, actually, it was a little of both. Sometimes when a disease is in all the magazines and all the news shows, it's only natural that you think you have it."
1,32,210,856000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
2,32,211,856000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,I don't know. Although I'd sure like to talk to him. He didn't touch my lesson plan. What did he teach you?

4,32,213,864000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"The polls will be open from now until the end of recess. Now, just in case any of you have decided to put any thought into this, we'll have our final statements. Martin?"

23,32,232,931000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Lewis?
24,32,233,932000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Somebody must have voted.
25,32,234,933000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"What about you, Bart? Didn't you vote?"
26,32,235,936000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Uh oh.

39,32,247,970000,Lisa Simpson,Train Station,"Hey, Lisa, indeed."
40,32,248,971000,BERGSTROM,Train Station,What? What is it?
41,32,249,973000,Lisa Simpson,Train Station,"Oh, I mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?"
42,32,250,979000,BERGSTROM,Train Station,"Ah, I'm sorry, Lisa. You know, it's the life of the substitute teacher: he's a fraud. Today he might be wearing gym shorts, tomorrow he's speaking French, or, or, or pretending to know how to run a band saw, or God knows what."
43,32,251,993000,Lisa Simpson,Train Station,You can't go! You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
44,32,252,996000,BERGSTROM,Train Station,"Ah, that's not true. Other teachers will come along who..."

46,32,254,1000000,BERGSTROM,Train Station,"No, I can't lie to you, I am the best. But, you know, they need me over in the projects of Capital City."
47,32,255,1005000,Lisa Simpson,Train Station,But I need you too.
48,32,256,1007000,BERGSTROM,Train Station,That's the problem with being middle class. Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more.
49,32,257,1015000,Lisa Simpson,Train Station,"I, I understand. Mr. Bergstrom, I'm going to miss you."
50,32,258,1021000,BERGSTROM,Train Station,I'll tell you what...
51,32,259,1024000,BERGSTROM,Train Station,"Whenever you feel like you're alone and there's nobody you can rely on, this is all you need to know."
52,32,260,1032000,Lisa Simpson,Train Station,"Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom."
53,32,261,1034000,Conductor,Train Station,All aboard!
54,32,262,1036000,Lisa Simpson,Train Station,"So, I guess this is it? It you don't mind I'll just run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life?"
55,32,263,1057000,BERGSTROM,Train Station,"Goodbye, Lisa honey. It'll be okay. Just read the note."
58,32,265,1070000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart didn't get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. What are you so mopey about?"
59,32,266,1081000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Nothing.
60,32,267,1082000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, tell your father."
61,32,268,1084000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mr. Bergstrom left today.
62,32,269,1086000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh.
63,32,270,1087000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,He's gone. Forever.
64,32,271,1088000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And?
65,32,272,1089000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't think you'd understand.
66,32,273,1091000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand."
67,32,274,1096000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm glad I'm not crying because I would hate for you to think that what I'm about to say is based on emotion. But you, sir, are a baboon!"
68,32,275,1108000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Me?
69,32,276,1109000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, you! Baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!"
70,32,277,1112000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think you realize what you're saying.
71,32,278,1115000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Baboon!
72,32,279,1118000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. I just can't believe it was her."
73,32,280,1123000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!"
74,32,281,1129000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. There's a little girl upstairs who needs you. Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy."
75,32,282,1146000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Go Away.
76,32,283,1146000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, don't hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon?"
77,32,284,1158000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
78,32,285,1159000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Nuts.
79,32,286,1162000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This isn't going well at all.
80,32,287,1165000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, if you just want me to forgive you --"
81,32,288,1165000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say."
82,32,289,1172000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof."
87,32,291,1185000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?"
88,32,292,1211000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah.
89,32,293,1212000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
90,32,294,1220000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You're so silly.
91,32,295,1221000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Gimme a banana.
92,32,296,1223000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't have any banana.
93,32,297,1225000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, you're holding out on me."
94,32,298,1232000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry I called you a baboon, Dad."
95,32,299,1233000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Think nothing of it.
96,32,300,1242000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, what's the matter, son?"
97,32,301,1245000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, Dad, if just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted..."
98,32,302,1250000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?"
99,32,303,1255000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
100,32,304,1256000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Would you have to do extra work?
101,32,305,1257000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah.
102,32,306,1258000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?"
103,32,307,1264000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, no."
104,32,308,1265000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That's my motto."
105,32,309,1272000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey! Thanks, monkey-man."
106,32,310,1276000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Holy-moly... talk about parenting!
107,32,311,1282000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh oh.
108,32,312,1285000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three."
109,32,313,1292000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, did you straighten everything out...?"
110,32,314,1293000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life."
