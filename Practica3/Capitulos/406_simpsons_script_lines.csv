105341,406,7,110000,Kirk Van Houten,PICNIC AREA,"Attention, everyone... Luann and I have some big news."
105342,406,8,115000,Bart Simpson,PICNIC AREA,Is it that you're brother and sister? Because you really look a lot alike.

105344,406,10,119000,Bart Simpson,PICNIC AREA,Half-brother and half-sister?

105352,406,18,128000,Milhouse Van Houten,PICNIC AREA,This is so awesome! Finally you guys will stop using me as a pawn in your fights.
105353,406,19,135000,Luann Van Houten,PICNIC AREA,"Milhouse, you're not a pawn."
105354,406,20,137000,Milhouse Van Houten,PICNIC AREA,"I know, I know."
105355,406,21,138000,Luann Van Houten,PICNIC AREA,Did your father say you were?
105356,406,22,140000,Milhouse Van Houten,PICNIC AREA,No. I swear. I made it up! Like kids do!
105357,406,23,144000,Kirk Van Houten,PICNIC AREA,"Well, now that we're a family again, you can stop your lying."
105359,406,25,149000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer! The wedding's in twenty minutes! Just pick a tie!
105360,406,26,154000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,There are so many choices. Bolo? Clip on? Piano keys? Ten Commandments of Beer?
105361,406,27,161000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The cornerstones of the Brewish faith.
105362,406,28,164000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you wear a tie that goes with my eyes?
105363,406,29,168000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And what color would that be?
105364,406,30,170000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't know what color my eyes are?
105365,406,31,173000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Of course I know!
105366,406,32,174000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No peeking. I'm wai-ting.
105367,406,33,179000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh...
105368,406,34,180000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You really don't know, do you?"
105369,406,35,182000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Is ""beautiful"" a color?"
105370,406,36,184000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
105371,406,37,184000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, give me a break! I don't notice the color of people's eyes! I just judge them on the color of their skin."
105372,406,38,190000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. Since the color of my eyes isn't important to you then you don't get to see them until you remember!
105374,406,40,212000,Homer Simpson,Beach,She's wearing white? She must have rolled the odometer back to zero.
105375,406,41,219000,Marge Simpson,Beach,"So you're good at noticing dress colors, but not the eyes that make your dinner!"
105377,406,43,226000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Beach,We are gathered here in the sight of God and this unsafe-for-swimming beach to celebrate the holy un-divorcing of Kirk and Luann.
105378,406,44,236000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Beach,Ow! What the?
105379,406,45,238000,Otto Mann,Beach,Little help?
105380,406,46,241000,Homer Simpson,Beach,Spaz.
105381,406,47,245000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Beach,"Do you, Kirk, take Luann to re-have and re-hold?"
105382,406,48,249000,Kirk Van Houten,Beach,I do.
105383,406,49,250000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Beach,"And do you, Luann, take Kirk despite the fact that he is fundamentally the same man that you said in court was unfit to load your dishwasher?"
105384,406,50,259000,Kirk Van Houten,Beach,Uh...
105385,406,51,259000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Beach,Whose very touch repulsed you?
105386,406,52,262000,Kirk Van Houten,Beach,"Uh, your--"
105387,406,53,262000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Beach,Whose many annoying...
105388,406,54,264000,Kirk Van Houten,Beach,"Uh, you're reading an early draft of our vows."
105389,406,55,266000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Beach,"Just say ""I do."""
105390,406,56,266000,Luann Van Houten,Beach,I do.
105391,406,57,268000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Beach,You may now kiss the bride. But make it quick. The seagulls have gotten into the hors d'oeuvres.
105392,406,58,275000,Hispanic Teen,Beach,"My friends, do not eat! Is made with seagull meat!"
105394,406,60,279000,Kirk Van Houten,CRUISE SHIP TERMINAL,"See you in a week, Milhouse! Have fun at the Simpsons'!"
105395,406,61,282000,Luann Van Houten,CRUISE SHIP TERMINAL,"If you don't like Mrs. Simpsons' cooking, you have your ""mommy meals""!"
105396,406,62,282000,Milhouse Van Houten,CRUISE SHIP TERMINAL,I got 'em!
105397,406,63,287000,Marge Simpson,CRUISE SHIP TERMINAL,"Why does every kid who stays with us bring ""mommy meals""? So I put pineapple in my potato salad. Live a little, huh!"
105399,406,65,297000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"...that's why, to this day, you never see a shark with monkey arms."
105400,406,66,304000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Great story, Mr. Simpson."
105401,406,67,306000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But why do all your bedtime stories have commercials in them for the container store?
105402,406,68,310000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Because if I do it enough, maybe they'll start to pay me."
105403,406,69,315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sleep tight. The Container Store now has five convenient locations!
105404,406,70,319000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Now that my Mom and Dad are back together, I'm happy every day. I can't wait to wake up so tomorrow can start."
105405,406,72,344000,Kirk Van Houten,CRUISE SHIP,"Uh-uh-uh. We're gonna start this marriage off right. This time, I'm gonna carry you over the threshold."
105408,406,75,359000,Passenger,Ship,Dear God! I need more nickels!
105410,406,77,364000,Kirk Van Houten,CRUISE SHIP,Luann... is that you nibbling on my knee?
105412,406,79,371000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Check it out -- an animal hole.
105413,406,80,374000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Where does it go?
105414,406,81,376000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Only one way to find out.
105416,406,83,385000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Tarantulas! I'll save you, Baby Burps-A-Lot!"
105417,406,84,392000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Spider burps!
105418,406,85,399000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Backyard,This week is the best! I don't care if my parents ever come back!
105422,406,89,419000,First Officer,Evergreen Terrace,Milhouse Van Houten?
105423,406,90,421000,Milhouse Van Houten,Evergreen Terrace,Yes?
105424,406,91,424000,Second Officer,Evergreen Terrace,"Son, your parents have been lost at sea. I'm sorry."
105425,406,92,428000,Milhouse Van Houten,Evergreen Terrace,Oh my God! I said I didn't care if they ever came back! This is my fault!
105426,406,93,436000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Drown, monster, drown!"
105427,406,94,442000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Hey who died?
105428,406,95,443000,Milhouse Van Houten,Evergreen Terrace,"My parents, probably."
105429,406,96,446000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,So you guys aren't ice cream men?
105431,406,98,456000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"If my parents are lost at sea, are you gonna find them?"
105432,406,99,461000,First Officer,Simpson Home,"We'll try, but...have you ever been to the sea? It's huge."
105433,406,100,465000,Second Officer,Simpson Home,"And we have to search all of them -- 'cause they all, you know, connect."
105435,406,102,469000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, boy. They'll find your parents soon."
105436,406,103,472000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"And until they do, you can stay here."
105437,406,104,475000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And we'll move your bedtime to an hour later so you'll have more time to be alone with your thoughts.
105441,406,105,488000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey come on, why don't you cheer up with a glass of Ocean Spray? Oh boy -- forget that. How about some... Cap'n Crunch? Uh, Seven Seas Italian dressing? No, no! Uh, Chicken of the Sea tuna? Billy Ocean CD? The history of Atlantic Records?"
105442,406,106,507000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Stop naming things!
105443,406,107,508000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I want to, but I can't!"
105444,406,108,510000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Then go to Moe's!
105445,406,109,511000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good idea. I'll drown my sorrows in Anchor Steam Beer! Oh, I'm sorry!"
105446,406,110,520000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't we do something special for you -- get you all snazzed up.
105447,406,111,523000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Like I'm going to a funeral?
105448,406,112,526000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No! Don't talk like that! There's always hope.
105449,406,113,529000,Second Officer,Simpson Home,"We just wanted to let you know, we've stopped searching."
105451,406,115,533000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"This'll cheer you up. I'll let you kill me in ""Bar Brawl Four: Final Fracas""."
105452,406,116,541000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh. I slipped on some blood. I'm totally vulnerable to a full-body jukebox slam.
105453,406,117,548000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, it's easy. Just push A, B, up, up, left trigger, right trigger, and both triggers at once."
105454,406,118,553000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Isn't there already enough pain in this world? Let's just pay the check and go.
105457,406,121,575000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Thanks, Mags. I could use a pick-me-up."
105458,406,122,586000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Oh my God. I've become the world's oldest baby. Men don't get their moo-moo from a ba-ba!
105459,406,123,595000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,They get their moo-moo from a big-boy cup!
105460,406,124,601000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"I can't be a baby anymore. I'm alone now. I have to be a man! Thanks, Mags."
105461,406,125,615000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Where is it?
105462,406,126,618000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I gotta find out what color Marge's eyes are.
105463,406,127,621000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Cha-ching!
105464,406,128,627000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Marge darling, what's the combination to our wedding album?"
105465,406,129,633000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Our anniversary!
105468,406,132,639000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"Alright, Dragon's Eye, may your path be true and your caroms many."
105438,406,133,644000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Just shoot!
105439,406,134,647000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh oh, it's rolling towards that loner!"
105440,406,135,649000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Who is it?
105470,406,137,655000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,It's Milhouse!
105471,406,138,656000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That's not the Milhouse I know.
105472,406,139,659000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Haw-haw, you know Milhouse."
105473,406,140,662000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, everyone. My best friend is a little messed up, so everyone be extra nice to him."
105474,406,141,668000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey loser, your mom called. She said ""glub, glub."""
105476,406,143,669000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,One day you'll be more haunted by those words than I am.
105477,406,144,677000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Why aren't you crying?
105478,406,145,679000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,I wish I could cry. Tears would cleanse my soul.
105479,406,146,684000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, Milhouse! You're very brave."
105480,406,147,689000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Go ahead, beat me up. Maybe then I'll feel something."
105482,406,149,700000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Eh, what's the point?"
105483,406,150,704000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Milhouse, that was the bravest thing I've ever seen."
105484,406,151,707000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"I always wanted you to hold my hand, Lisa. And now that you are, I'm too numb to feel anything. It's like you're wearing oven mitts and I'm in my winter parka."
105485,406,152,717000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That's so poetic.
105486,406,153,720000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Looks like you're not the coolest kid in school anymore.
105487,406,154,723000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, I'm happy to see Milhouse get some hand-on-hand action. But no one is cooler than Bartholomew J. Simpson."
105488,406,155,730000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Really? See ya at lunch.
105489,406,156,735000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Anyone want to sit over here? You can have my pizza crust.
105490,406,157,739000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Young man, you look like you enjoy fun and excitement."
105491,406,158,742000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Please Bart, you're embarrassing yourself."
105493,406,160,752000,Sherri Mackleberry,Simpson Home,Milhouse -- call me if you need to talk.
105494,406,161,756000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"If you want to come to my place, I've got a squirrel in a shoebox. I'm just sayin'..."
105495,406,162,762000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Thanks, but I want to take a walk alone..."
105496,406,163,765000,Boys,Simpson Home,Whoa!
105497,406,164,767000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,...and work some stuff out.
105500,406,166,771000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on! Look at me, I'm cool. I've got my backpack on frontwards, and I'm krumping!"
105501,406,167,782000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Check it out! This image has not been sped up.
105502,406,168,787000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"There's a time for krumping, and this isn't it."
105504,406,170,797000,Marge Simpson,House,"I'll krump with you, sweetie pie."
105507,406,173,815000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Oh my God, look at these poll numbers."
105508,406,174,819000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Aye Carumba! Oh man. Milhouse has gone from being a comic figure to a tragic one.
105509,406,175,826000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"If he could go back to being happy, I could go back to being cool."
105510,406,176,826000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Boy, stop talking to yourself!"
105512,406,178,831000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Your thoughts should stay in your head! Heh, heh, I sure told him. Now, what am I gonna do about Marge?"
105514,406,180,838000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Let's see... Milhouse would be happy again if he had family to take care of him. Family, family..."
105515,406,181,846000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Every Christmas... Milhouse gets Danish butter cookies from... Solvang, California... where he has a beloved un... ...cle!"
105517,406,183,858000,Old-style Operator,TELEPHONE COMPANY OFFICE,"Directory assistance for Solvang, a little bit of Denmark on California's central coast. ... We have three Van Houtens."
105518,406,184,867000,Bart Simpson,TELEPHONE COMPANY OFFICE,Fine. I'll call three numbers. What are they?
105519,406,185,870000,Old-style Operator,TELEPHONE COMPANY OFFICE,"Butter cookie eight, two one four seven, Hans Christian Anderson five, five one six six, and Aquavit three, twenty-five ninety-nine."
105521,406,187,890000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Airport,"Okay, so which one of these losers is Milhouse's Uncle Norbert?"
105522,406,188,894000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Airport,"Norbert? Norbert? Oh, this guy's a total Norbert."
105523,406,189,898000,NERD,Springfield Airport,Norbert? I wish. My name is Gaylord Q. Tinkledink.
105524,406,190,914000,NORBERT,Springfield Airport,Bart? I'm Norbert Van Houten. But everyone calls me Zack.
105525,406,191,917000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Airport,You're Uncle Norbert?
105526,406,192,918000,NORBERT,Springfield Airport,"Well I'm one of the Danish Van Houtens, not the Dutch Van Houtens. Now my nephew Milhouse needs me and I'm here for him."
105528,406,193,926000,GAYLORD Q. TINKLEDINK,Springfield Airport,"And I'm here to find my nephew, Nerdletaub Z. Pantybottom. Let us join forces."
105529,406,194,934000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Airport,Would you be my uncle?
105530,406,195,936000,UNCLE NORBERT,Springfield Airport,"No, but have a butter cookie."
105532,406,197,947000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Milhouse, there's someone who wants to see you."
105533,406,198,951000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield,Uncle Zack?
105534,406,199,953000,UNCLE ZACK,Springfield,"Milhouse, your parents may be gone, but I'm here for you now."
105535,406,200,956000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield,"Well, I don't need you. I've learned to take care of myself."
105536,406,201,962000,UNCLE ZACK,Springfield,"I see. You've become quite a young man. Self-reliant, mature. You've shed your Dutch ways and become a true Dane. But uh, perhaps you're not too cool... to give your Uncle a hug."
105537,406,202,977000,UNCLE ZACK,Springfield,"I promise you won't be alone anymore, son."
105538,406,203,985000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,And that takes care of that.
105539,406,204,989000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Oh man, now he's even more popular!"
105540,406,205,992000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,"He's troubled, but I can save him!"
105541,406,206,994000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Oh, for cryin' out loud."
105543,406,208,999000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'll never remember what color Marge's eyes are!"
105544,406,209,1002000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Brown? No. Orange? No. Elm? Rake? Guessing?
105545,406,210,1013000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, well, look who's strollin' down Alzheimer Avenue. You used to know everything about that wife of yours. Even wrote a song about her."
105546,406,211,1021000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"A song? Wait, it's coming back to me."
