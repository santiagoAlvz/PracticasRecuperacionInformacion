89792,347,47,215000,Selma Bouvier,Selma's Hospital Room,Jub-Jub can't take care of me when I'm old and sick. All he can do is eat me when I'm dead.

89794,347,49,225000,Homer Simpson,Selma's Hospital Room,"Come on kids, we should go. Goodbye, Selma."

89822,347,77,331000,Mr. Zhao,ADOPTION AFFAIRS OFFICE,"Of course. The Chinese government only allows wholesome, married couples to adopt. No ""hen without cock."" I apologize if that is a double-entendre in your language. It is not in ours."
89823,347,78,341000,Selma Bouvier,ADOPTION AFFAIRS OFFICE,Don't worry. I'll just write my husband's name on this form. Have you ever heard of MacGyver?

89906,347,161,701000,Madam Wu,CHINESE STREET,That is quite an insult to your other children.
89907,347,162,704000,Bart Simpson,CHINESE STREET,"We understand, ma'am. We're pretty lousy kids."
89877,347,163,707000,Madam Wu,CHINESE STREET,"Lisa, soon you will have a Chinese baby sister who will surpass you academically."
89908,347,164,712000,Lisa Simpson,CHINESE STREET,I don't know about that -- I'm considered pretty smart.

89915,347,171,745000,Chinese Announcer,ZHENGYICI THEATER,I regret to inform you that our final stunt will not be performed. Our star acrobat had an onset of out-spokenness and suffered a bullet-related death.
89916,347,172,756000,Disgruntled Audience Member,ZHENGYICI THEATER,This is most disillusioning!
89917,347,173,759000,Disgruntled Audience Member #2,ZHENGYICI THEATER,It seems our leaders are not all-knowing!
89918,347,174,761000,Disgruntled Audience Member #3,ZHENGYICI THEATER,Now I will question everything! Why doesn't Pearl Jam ever come here?
89920,347,176,767000,Madam Wu,ZHENGYICI THEATER,"Homer, we need your acrobatic skills. Only you can prevent this riot, and save our beloved Communist dictatorship."

89939,347,195,869000,Selma Bouvier,Hospital Room,"This is Homer, your daddy. Without him, I wouldn't have you."
89940,347,196,874000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,Awww. She likes my eyes.
89941,347,197,879000,Selma Bouvier,Hospital Room,"Homer, I do appreciate what you did. How'd you like a little time with ""Miss October""?"
89942,347,198,885000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,"I would, but Marge would kill me... I mean ohh, right."
89943,347,199,894000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,"Homer, of all the sneaky, dishonest things you've ever done, playing Selma's husband was by far the sweetest."
89944,347,200,902000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,"It wasn't easy, Marge -- I've missed you so much."
89945,347,201,908000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,"Okay, one quick snuggle."
89946,347,202,910000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,Is there any other kind?

89955,347,211,953000,Homer Simpson,Simpsons' Hotel,"Wow, the fortune cookies here really are more accurate."
89958,347,214,966000,Homer Simpson,Airport,I am so sorry about what happened. But at least you saw what it was like to be married to me for a little while.
89960,347,216,977000,Lisa Simpson,Airport,"Listen, I've got a plan to get Ling back. But we must be discreet. You never know where there might be a spy."
89961,347,217,983000,Chinese Man,Airport,"Yes, tell me your plan in detail, American sister. Don't have a cattle, dude."
89962,347,218,990000,Lisa Simpson,Airport,"Uh, let's talk about this outside."
89964,347,220,997000,Marge Simpson,ORPHANAGE,"Hold still, Homie."
89965,347,221,997000,Lisa Simpson,ORPHANAGE,"Yeah, Dad. If you don't look perfect, you'll never be able to sneak in and steal Ling back."
89966,347,222,1007000,Lisa Simpson,ORPHANAGE,"You look just like a Buddha statue. Now, all you need is an expression of utter serenity."
89967,347,223,1014000,Marge Simpson,ORPHANAGE,Just think about the day you found that Junior Mint in your bellybutton.
89969,347,224,1024000,Chinese Guard #1,ORPHANAGE,A Buddha statue? We cannot leave it outside. It is bad Feng Shui.
89970,347,225,1029000,Chinese Guard #2,ORPHANAGE,Feng Shui? I thought that was just a trick to sell crappy end-tables to the West.
89971,347,226,1033000,Chinese Guard #1,ORPHANAGE,Just put this hook in his nostril and pull.
89973,347,228,1057000,Chinese Guard #1,ORPHANAGE,I've never moved a Buddha this heavy.
89974,347,229,1059000,Chinese Guard #2,ORPHANAGE,Let's cut him in chunks and worship the chunks.
89976,347,231,1071000,Homer Simpson,NURSERY,Now let's see... which one is Ling?
89977,347,232,1078000,Homer Simpson,NURSERY,Ling?... Ling?... Ling?...
89978,347,233,1088000,Homer Simpson,NURSERY,Ling!
89980,347,235,1097000,Lisa Simpson,BEIJING STREET,"If we can just get to the Delta Airlines Gold Medallion Lounge, they can't get in without spending frequent flyer miles."
89981,347,236,1104000,Marge Simpson,BEIJING STREET,"Plus, we get free apple, orange and grapefruit juice!"
89982,347,237,1107000,Madam Wu,BEIJING STREET,I'm afraid that juice is not on your tongue just yet!
89983,347,238,1115000,Madam Wu,BEIJING STREET,Give the back baby -- I cannot allow her to be raised by an unmarried woman.
89984,347,239,1120000,Selma Bouvier,BEIJING STREET,"Madam Wu, I too work for a cruel and faceless empire -- the Department of Motor Vehicles. May I talk to you bureaucrat to bureaucrat?"
89985,347,240,1130000,Madam Wu,BEIJING STREET,Yes. But you first must sign this form.
89986,347,241,1134000,Madam Wu,BEIJING STREET,And initial here.
89987,347,242,1135000,Madam Wu,BEIJING STREET,And here.
89988,347,243,1135000,Madam Wu,BEIJING STREET,Now we must find a notary.
89989,347,244,1139000,Functionary,BEIJING STREET,This is Wang Pu's time to shine!
89990,347,245,1143000,Madam Wu,BEIJING STREET,Proceed.
89991,347,246,1144000,Selma Bouvier,BEIJING STREET,"Madam Wu, we both love the enforcement of pointless rules. But there's a greater joy in bending the rules to help someone who thinks all hope is gone."
89992,347,247,1157000,Homer Simpson,BEIJING STREET,"I was this woman's husband for a few days, in name only, and beer will soon obliterate that memory. But I don't think this baby could find any greater love on your planet or ours."
89993,347,248,1172000,Madam Wu,BEIJING STREET,"You may not believe this... but I once was a baby myself. My father was a Ping-Pong champion. He died when the ball got stuck in his throat. The Heimlich maneuver was invented the very next day. My mother raised me alone, so I know it can be done."
89994,347,249,1189000,Madam Wu,BEIJING STREET,"You may keep your baby. But you, drop the panda!"
89995,347,250,1192000,Homer Simpson,BEIJING STREET,But he loves me.
89996,347,251,1194000,Homer Simpson,BEIJING STREET,Why you little... I'll endanger you!
89998,347,253,1215000,Madam Wu,FISHING WHARF,"Goodbye, Simpsons."
89999,347,254,1217000,Selma Bouvier,FISHING WHARF,"You'll be back some day, Ling. As a spoiled American teenager."
90001,347,256,1229000,Homer Simpson,FISHING WHARF,Something's wrong with Bart. He's acting weird.
90002,347,257,1232000,Chinese Man,FISHING WHARF,"Feast on my shorts, stupid father man."
90003,347,258,1234000,Homer Simpson,FISHING WHARF,"Wait, you're not Bart! Eh, close enough."
90005,347,260,1243000,Red Dragon,FISHING WHARF,AMERICAN JERKS ARE GOING HOME / NOW WE SLEEP FOR A THOUSAND YEARS / WHEN WE WAKE THE WORLD WILL END...
90006,347,261,1261000,David Silverman,FISHING WHARF,"David Silverman here, Supervising director of the Simpsons. And tonight, I'm gonna show you how to draw Bart. Now, you start off with a tin can like this, and a little tuna fish can for the bottom part of his head. A little hinge of an ear, a big sausage for a nose, two giant golf balls for eyes. Now, here's a little trick about the hair. It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine points. And uh, there you go. Perfect Bart every time. Now, once you've mastered how to draw Bart, you can put him in all sorts of costumes. Some that he likes...some that he hates."
90007,347,262,1295000,David Silverman,FISHING WHARF,"Well, that's it, my friends. Thank you very much. Keep watching."
