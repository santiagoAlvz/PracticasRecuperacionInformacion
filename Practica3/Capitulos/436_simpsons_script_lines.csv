113060,436,4,46000,Hockey Announcer #2,Simpson Home,"Uh-oh, Someone could lose a tooth!"
113062,436,6,49000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is no time to pat the bunny, Maggie. Daddy's watching a very important Mid-Atlantic Hockey League Conference Semi-Final do-over game."
113063,436,7,57000,Hockey Announcer #1,Simpson Home,"As we enter the seventh amazing overtime, the members of Sesame Street on Ice wait impatiently to begin their matinee performance."
113064,436,8,65000,Hockey Announcer #1,Simpson Home,"Hold the Black Label, Mabel! The Utica Mohawks' Pete Mavroudis has broken through the 'topes' defense!"
113065,436,9,71000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Stop him, Babando!"
113066,436,10,72000,Hockey Announcer #1,Simpson Home,He winds up for the shot! And Delacroix slides in front!
113067,436,11,75000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're supposed to be spending time with your daughter.
113068,436,12,78000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I will, when it's not sports season. I just want to know how the game ends."
113040,436,13,82000,Hockey Announcer #2,Simpson Home,And this game is over! Unbelievable! You'll never see anything like that again!
113069,436,14,88000,Hockey Announcer #1,Simpson Home,"So that will do it from Wayne Bockhorn, Jean-Pierre PÃ©tomane, and me, Doc Jacques Lalonde, here at Utica's Kill-Kwik Rat Poison Arena."
113070,436,15,97000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wha-wha-what's the score?!
113071,436,16,98000,Hockey Announcer #3,Simpson Home,"Now stay tuned for ""Picking the Perfect Apple,"" it's already in progress."

113077,436,22,109000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I will never... know... the score!
113079,436,24,113000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You want to know the score? I'll tell you the score.
113080,436,25,116000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Marge. This is a definite high point for our marriage."
113081,436,26,119000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here's the score, Mister:"
113082,436,27,119000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes?
113083,436,28,121000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Your daughter barely knows who you are!
113084,436,29,124000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's ridiculous. Who's your daddy, Maggie? Who's your daddy?"
113085,436,30,135000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,He is pretty good with her.
113087,436,32,149000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Look Marge! It's just what you want. Me spending the day with Muggsy.
113088,436,33,153000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maggie.
113089,436,34,154000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you're not naggy. You just set the bar impossibly high."
113090,436,35,158000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Can you at least bring a sweater for Maggie?
113091,436,36,160000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Impossibly high. Now, let's get started on the greatest daddy-daughter day ever!"
113092,436,37,173000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Not even heated up. Typical dog.
113094,436,39,182000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Sidewalk,"This is it, Maggie -- the place where Daddy goes every morning."
113096,436,41,190000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Now, you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while Daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder."
113097,436,42,201000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, what are you doing?"
113098,436,43,202000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"I'm spiffin' up the place! Jeez, can't a guy clean his bar for the first time ever without people makin' polite inquiries?"
113099,436,44,212000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Huh. I got a window here.
113100,436,45,218000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, Maggie could play out there... while I watch her from in here. Whaddaya say, Maggie?"
113101,436,46,225000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Aw, her first enabling."
113102,436,47,228000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Hi, Maggie! / Up here, beautiful! / Yo, Mags!"
113103,436,48,231000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,It's me! Uncle Barney! Remember I taught you your ABCs. A-B- P-K...
113104,436,49,243000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"So, uh, I s'pose you guys are still wonderin' why I'm cleanin' the bar."
113105,436,50,246000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Ooh, hey Maggie! Maggie, Maggie, Maggie!"
113106,436,51,248000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Hello Maggie... hello Maggie.
113107,436,52,249000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Hey Maggie! Maggie look at my face!
113108,436,53,255000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,It all began about a month ago...
113110,436,55,257000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Public Library,"It was a typical Friday night: me surfing the net at the public library, with occasional drinking fountain breaks."
113111,436,56,264000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Public Library,"Ah, just how I like it: warm and rusty."
113113,436,58,273000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Public Library,I couldn't believe it -- I finally found an intelligent sophisticated woman who hadn't heard any of my knock-knock jokes.
113114,436,59,281000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Public Library,"""Orange who?"" All right Moe, give her the punchline nice and easy."
113115,436,60,286000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Public Library,Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
113116,436,61,286000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Public Library,The gargoyle has landed!
113117,436,62,295000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Public Library,"""You're funny. Very nice. Now, how can I put this? Um... ""Are you sure you're not actually some creepy guy in a public library?"""
113118,436,63,300000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Public Library,"""No. How 'bout you?"" Actually, there is a much creepier guy right next to me."
113119,436,64,307000,Cat Lady,Springfield Public Library,You know I'm a woman. We used to own a cat together! She had babies! Here's yours!
113120,436,65,321000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Public Library,"I would do anything to chat with Maya, short of actually purchasing a computer. We decided to take the next big step -- exchanging photos..."
113122,436,67,330000,Moe Szyslak,Library,"Okay, this is it. I finally get to see what she looks like. Dast I click on this j-peg? No. I dasn't."
113123,436,68,339000,Moe Szyslak,Library,Yes I dast!
113124,436,69,344000,Carl Carlson,Library,"So, what does she look like?"
113125,436,70,347000,Lenny Leonard,Library,Whoa!
113127,436,71,348000,Moe Szyslak,Library,"Yeah, she was a knockout. Which meant I was screwed. Because now I had to send her a picture of me."
113128,436,72,357000,Moe Szyslak,Library,"All right, before I send this, I'd better, uh, un-beady the eyes... de-Neanderthal the brow... smooth out my hate lines... lighten up the ear hair... switch my lips..."
113129,436,73,357000,Moe Szyslak,Library,"Then, black tie the whole deal."
113130,436,74,369000,Moe Szyslak,Library,"Aw, I can't build a relationship on a lie. The lies come later."
113131,436,75,380000,Moe Szyslak,Library,She thinks I'm cute?!
113132,436,76,382000,Moe Szyslak,Library,Oh frabjulous day! Calloo Callay!
113133,436,77,386000,Moe Szyslak,Library,"So, that's why I'm cleanin' things and flushin' things, and makin' this place look respectable."
113134,436,78,394000,Moe Szyslak,Library,She's coming to meet me. Here. Tonight.
113135,436,79,398000,Moe Szyslak,Library,"Moe's rat-free tavern! Oh, ah, heya, Marge. Yeah, yeah, Homer's here."
113136,436,80,402000,Moe Szyslak,Library,"Oh, you want Homer. I'm sorry, I thought you meant Himmler. Heinrich Himmler. You know, the guy who invented the Heimlich manure?"
113137,436,81,408000,Marge Simpson,Library,Those are two different people!
113138,436,82,409000,Moe Szyslak,Library,"Uh, well they're both here, and neither one's your husband. This press conference is over."
113140,436,84,425000,Homer Simpson,CHILDREN'S PARK,"Ooh, Maggie made some new friends."
113141,436,85,428000,Homer Simpson,CHILDREN'S PARK,"Aw, burrowing your head into your Daddy. A sign that my baby is happy and confident."
113143,436,87,453000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, she said she'd be here at exactly eight o'clock."
113144,436,88,457000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,You callin' my girl a liar?!
113145,436,89,463000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Okay.
113146,436,90,468000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I've been stood up.
113147,436,91,471000,Maya,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, I'm down here."
113148,436,92,474000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, you're a little person? I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. What's the correct term?"
113149,436,93,479000,Maya,Moe's Tavern,Little person.
113150,436,94,480000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Whoa! Look at me bein' polite!
113151,436,95,482000,Maya,Moe's Tavern,"So, aren't you gonna invite me in?"
113152,436,96,485000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh of course, of course. Um, I-I just have to -- I have to tidy up the place! Just one second."
113153,436,97,500000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"So Maya. Um, you always been this size, or is this like a Benjamin Button deal? No, I mean is, I just...your picture just made you look more... life-sized."
113155,436,98,510000,Maya,Moe's Tavern,That was taken at Legoland. I was afraid you'd be disappointed in the real me.
113156,436,99,515000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Are you kiddin' me? You're the best thing to come into this bar since cable TV. And unlike cable TV, I ain't stealin' you from the Chinese restaurant across the street there."
113157,436,100,524000,Chinese Restaurateur,Moe's Tavern,I see you watch ESPN Two! I know!
113158,436,101,527000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, that's great there, Ling Chow."
113159,436,102,530000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"So, uh, you still want to go out?"
113160,436,103,532000,Maya,Moe's Tavern,That's why I'm here.
113161,436,104,532000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Great. Let me get a car seat.
113162,436,105,534000,Maya,Moe's Tavern,Car seat?
113163,436,106,534000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I took out the passenger seat to save gas. But I'm gonna use it now. 'Cause we're gonna do the town!
113165,436,108,545000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"...so instead of getting a new bar sign, I saved three hundred bucks by changing my name to Moe..."
113166,436,109,550000,Luigi,Luigi's,"Moe! You eat alone again tonight, huh? Table for one! Facing the wall!"
113167,436,110,555000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"Whoa, whoa, whoa -- not so fast, garlic press. I'm here with my date."
113168,436,111,559000,Luigi,Luigi's,She's beautiful! But so far away.
113171,436,114,567000,Maya,Moe's Car,Mmm... you're a good kisser.
113172,436,115,570000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Car,"Yeah, I practice by siphoning gas out of other people's tanks. But I never tasted super-premium that was half as good as you."
113173,436,116,578000,Maya,Moe's Car,"Oh, Moe."
113174,436,117,580000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Car,Yeah.
113178,436,121,588000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"How'd your date go, Moe?"
113179,436,122,590000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Incredible. I've never felt like this before. It's like my heart wants to do her.
113180,436,123,594000,Barflies,Moe's Tavern,Awww.
113181,436,124,596000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"So, when are we gonna meet her?"
113182,436,125,597000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, I can't wait till you guys get to uh..."
113183,436,126,606000,Thought Bubble Lenny,Moe's Tavern,"Yep, that's what we'd do!"
113184,436,127,607000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Let me ask you guys somethin': how would you treat a person who's generally dynamite but uh, in some way... a little different?"
113185,436,128,616000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,You mean like how we treat Homer?
113186,436,129,618000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,'Cause he can't remember limericks?
113187,436,130,619000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I can too! ""There once was this guy from an island off the coast of Massachusetts... uh, Nantucket, I think it was. Anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh..."
113189,436,132,638000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Look at him struggling with the simplest rhyme.
113190,436,133,641000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"It's a-a-b-b-a, dumbass!"
113191,436,134,669000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,There you are!
113192,436,135,669000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Aww. Innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. How sweet. Maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow.
113194,436,137,681000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Maggie. Have some grapefruit."
113195,436,138,684000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"She seems upset. Maybe if I lay down a beat on my bongos, that'll soothe her."
113196,436,139,694000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, do you have any idea what's gotten into Maggie?"
113197,436,140,697000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How would I know?
113198,436,141,699000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You've been spending so much time with her.
113199,436,142,701000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I have not! Oh right, you think I do."
113200,436,143,707000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"When you leave your children, do you really know who you're leaving them with?"
113201,436,144,712000,Nanny,Simpson Home,Your little angels are safe with me. Enjoy your second honeymoon!
113202,436,145,718000,Nanny,Simpson Home,You -- wash me unmentionables!
113203,436,146,722000,Nanny,Simpson Home,And you! Pre-heat the oven for two children at four-fifty.
113204,436,147,728000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"When you can't be there, Prying-Eye Surveillance can."
113205,436,148,733000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"We take images from your camera, scramble them, beam them to our orbiting satellite, unscramble them, then scramble them again, then unscramble them that all-important final time. Our competitors claim we scramble our images too much. We say, ""Can you love your children too much?"""
113206,436,149,745000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"The only thing better than Prying-Eye watching your children, is you watching your children."
113207,436,150,745000,Announcer,Simpson Home,And we all know that's not gonna happen.
113209,436,152,765000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait a second, Marge: do you really want to use your baby as a tool to spy on your husband?"
113210,436,153,770000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes you do.
113211,436,154,772000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I wasn't talking to you.
113212,436,155,773000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"When you say it, it's not just in your head."
113126,436,158,778000,Maya,WOODED STREET,This is where I live.
113215,436,159,780000,Moe Szyslak,WOODED STREET,"Uh... So is there a knob or an ""open sesame""-type deal, or what?"
113216,436,160,786000,Maya,WOODED STREET,My house is over there.
113217,436,161,788000,Maya,WOODED STREET,"You didn't actually think I lived in a tree, did you?"
113218,436,162,792000,Moe Szyslak,WOODED STREET,"No, hey, a lot of people live in trees... uh, Tarzan, the Berenstain Bears, flood victims..."
113220,436,164,807000,Umpa-lumpas,MAYA'S HOUSE,UMPA-LUMPA / WE ARE SO SMALL...
113221,436,165,811000,Moe Szyslak,MAYA'S HOUSE,Gah! Why should I be watchin' anything when I could look at the most beautiful thing in the world: youse.
113222,436,166,817000,Maya,MAYA'S HOUSE,Mese?
113223,436,167,819000,Moe Szyslak,MAYA'S HOUSE,Dat's right. Kiss the troll and win a prize.
113224,436,168,826000,Maya,MAYA'S HOUSE,Listen... there's one thing that keeps bothering me.
113225,436,169,829000,Moe Szyslak,MAYA'S HOUSE,"Is it my religion? 'Cause I am a snake handler, but not an observant one. If we have kids, they just have to have a ceremony with a cobra by age three so grandfather will be happy."
113226,436,170,839000,Maya,MAYA'S HOUSE,"No, that's fine. It's just that I can't help wondering why you've never introduced me to anyone you know. When your mailman waved to us, you made me hide under that traffic cone."
113227,436,171,848000,Moe Szyslak,MAYA'S HOUSE,"Well, I do know this one couple -- the Simpsons I believe their name is -- that ain't too judgmental. She's a standup dame and he's a fall-down drunk. We'll make a double date of it. Now, let's get back to what we were..."
113228,436,172,861000,Moe Szyslak,MAYA'S HOUSE,Hey. What's goin' on? You've turned into a doll!
113229,436,173,865000,Maya,MAYA'S HOUSE,I just do that to freak people out.
113232,436,176,868000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Here she is, uh, Homer. The wonderful girl I been tellin' you about."
113233,436,177,881000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Pleased to meet you. Uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but I have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that I can't help wondering about."
113234,436,178,893000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"In a nuclear power plant, just how is nuclear energy turned into electricity?"
113235,436,179,900000,Maya,Simpson Home,"Well... If I remember my high school physics, the controlled nuclear reaction creates steam which powers a turbine..."
113236,436,180,906000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Man oh man, slap a ring on that!"
113237,436,181,917000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, Homer. Let's see what my baby's been up to."
113238,436,182,923000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here we are, Maggie. That park you love..."
113013,436,183,927000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge! Moe and Maya are here for a double date.
113154,436,184,929000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh! Okay, I'm coming."
113239,436,185,933000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,See you when the moon comes out.
113241,436,187,947000,Homer Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Man, that made me thirsty."
113242,436,188,950000,Moe Szyslak,South Street Squidport,For you.
113243,436,189,954000,Marge Simpson,South Street Squidport,"She's beautiful, Moe."
113244,436,190,956000,Moe Szyslak,South Street Squidport,Yeah. She sure is.
113246,436,192,959000,Moe Szyslak,South Street Squidport,"Here comes ours, honey."
113247,436,193,970000,Moe Szyslak,South Street Squidport,Would you look at me. I'm the happiest bartender in the world.
113248,436,194,975000,Moe Szyslak,South Street Squidport,"Sorry, fellas."
113250,436,196,980000,Moe Szyslak,MAYA'S HOUSE,"Maya... there's something I wanna ask ya, um... I don't know why I'm so nervous... this makes more sense than anything I've ever done... well, other than keepin' all my Netflix movies and sayin' the post office lost 'em. Anyway..."
113251,436,197,991000,Moe Szyslak,MAYA'S HOUSE,Um... will you marry me?
113252,436,198,995000,Maya,MAYA'S HOUSE,Are you asking me to be your... little woman?
113253,436,199,999000,Moe Szyslak,MAYA'S HOUSE,As long as you don't mind having a small wedding.
113255,436,201,1004000,Moe Szyslak,MAYA'S HOUSE,"And we can drink champagne out of an acorn top. Our first dance will be on the head of a pin! I've been hoggin' all the good ones. All right, now you go. But hey, keep it short!"
113256,436,202,1020000,Moe Szyslak,MAYA'S HOUSE,"What's the matter, Doll? We were just having fun."
113257,436,203,1023000,Maya,MAYA'S HOUSE,I stopped having fun about ten jokes ago. And you just kept going.
113258,436,204,1027000,Moe Szyslak,MAYA'S HOUSE,"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Forgive me, kitten... I mean cat... I mean, tiger... I mean saber-toothed tiger. I mean--"

113260,436,206,1034000,Moe Szyslak,MAYA'S HOUSE,"Okay. I screwed this up pretty bad and, uh, I'm sorry. How long do you people remember things?"
113261,436,207,1040000,Maya,MAYA'S HOUSE,Get out.
113263,436,209,1047000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Guys, after all the years I've given you advice, now I need a little advice from you."
113264,436,210,1051000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,We never follow your advice.
113265,436,211,1052000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"The one time I did, I went to jail for three years."
113266,436,212,1055000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"You made some good friends, didn't ya?"
113267,436,213,1056000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Just 'cause you're chained to a guy don't make him your friend.
113268,436,214,1059000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Tomato, tomahto. Now how am I gonna win Maya back?"
113269,436,215,1062000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Well, if I've learned anything from romantic comedies, is that you've got to make a grand, reckless gesture, the kind that looks like it might blow up in your face."
113270,436,216,1069000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,But what if it blows up in my face?
113271,436,217,1071000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"With your face, who cares?"
113273,436,219,1074000,Moe Szyslak,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"...you gotta make me shorter, Doc."
113274,436,220,1077000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,What do you mean?
113275,436,221,1078000,Moe Szyslak,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"I mean take out bones, guts, whatever you gotta do to make me a micro-Moe."
113276,436,222,1083000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,What you're asking is completely unethical. No licensed physician would perform that operation.
113278,436,224,1089000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Operating Room,"Now close your eyes and when you wake up, you will be a woman."
113279,436,225,1094000,Moe Szyslak,Operating Room,"No, no, no, no, no -- I want to be shorter for a woman."
113280,436,226,1097000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Operating Room,"Uh-oh, I mixed you up with the last guy!"
113281,436,227,1102000,Dewey Largo,Operating Room,I look nothing like Julie Newmar!

113284,436,230,1111000,Maya,DR. NICK'S OPERATING ROOM,"Moe, why did you do this?!"
113285,436,231,1114000,Moe Szyslak,DR. NICK'S OPERATING ROOM,I ain't done nothin' yet.
113286,436,232,1114000,Moe Szyslak,DR. NICK'S OPERATING ROOM,But I'm considering it because I want to share your world forever.
113287,436,233,1119000,Maya,DR. NICK'S OPERATING ROOM,"Moe, if you have to be like me to love me, then you're not seeing the real me."
113288,436,234,1126000,Moe Szyslak,DR. NICK'S OPERATING ROOM,"Oh, I see you, Maya. I see you every time I look at the moon. I see ya in puddles after it rains. I see ya in the glazed eye of a barfly who's had one too many."
113289,436,235,1138000,Moe Szyslak,DR. NICK'S OPERATING ROOM,"So cut me down to size, Doc. And can you wrap up the bones so my dog can have fun with 'em."
113290,436,236,1143000,Maya,DR. NICK'S OPERATING ROOM,"But Moe, I don't want someone who sees me as short. I want someone who just sees me as beautiful. Goodbye."
113293,436,239,1154000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, no more delays. I've got to watch this."
113294,436,240,1169000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll save you, Maggie!"

113298,436,244,1193000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Maggie, I love you from the tip of your toes to the bow on your hair with the red blinking light. God bless your mother for making you with me."
113299,436,245,1204000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whatcha watchin', honey?"
113300,436,246,1207000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer Simpson, you are a strong finisher."
113301,436,247,1210000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And I'm good at beginnings.
113305,436,251,1221000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"What's the matter, Homer?"
113306,436,252,1222000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Not a thing in the world.
113307,436,253,1223000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, I wish I could say the same."
113308,436,254,1225000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, this was a great thing for you. You went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. And sometime when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. And that means someone can love you again. And that'll make you smile."
113309,436,255,1251000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Hey! Homer was right.
113310,436,256,1254000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Who'da thought such a little woman could make me feel so big?
