12384,74,105,493000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ralph thinks I like him. But I only gave him a valentine 'cause I felt sorry for him.
12385,74,106,498000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, sweet pity. Where would my love life have been without it?"
12386,74,107,502000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What do you say to a boy to let him know you're not interested?

12397,74,118,537000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Good.
12399,74,120,542000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"Dad, how do you get a girl to like you?"
12400,74,121,545000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"Son, whether you want to win a girl or crack a nut, the key is persistence. Keep at it and never lose your cool."
12401,74,122,558000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,Let that be a lesson to the rest of you... nuts.
12402,74,123,562000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"Okay, dad, I'll be persistent. Is that how you got mom?"

12408,74,128,596000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Now, why do they call this a Urine Monkey? Ugh... I just found out."
12409,74,129,603000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That's funny for so many reasons. We have to go to that show.
12410,74,130,608000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Forget it. To get those tickets our parents would have to be part of Springfield's cultural elite.
12411,74,131,613000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Can you believe Flanders threw out a perfectly good toothbrush?
12412,74,132,619000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Eww.
12413,74,133,624000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh no, it's Ralph! Just make some excuse."

12415,74,135,630000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Yes, sir. I'd do anything for Lisa."
12416,74,136,633000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Really?
12417,74,137,637000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Mr. Simpson, the tar fumes are making me dizzy."
12418,74,138,642000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, they'll do that."
12420,74,140,646000,Rex,Springfield Elementary School,"""Dearest Martha, since boyhood I have yearned to be on the one-dollar bill. And with your help, this I shall achieve. Sincerely, George Washington."""
12421,74,141,658000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Thank you, Rex. I've selected the cast for our President's Day pageant. Martha Washington will be played by Lisa Simpson."
12423,74,143,668000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,George Washington will be played by... Ralph Wiggum.
12424,74,144,674000,Rex,Springfield Elementary School,What? This is a travesty! Everyone knows I'm the best actor in this ridiculous school.
12425,74,145,680000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Sit down, Rex."
12426,74,146,681000,Rex,Springfield Elementary School,"I will not sit down. Someone's gotten to you, you deceitful cow."
12427,74,147,685000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"That's absurd, Rex. Ralph won the part fair and square."
12428,74,148,689000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"That's the signal. Take the boot off the car, boys."
12430,74,150,695000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Now Ralph is in this play with me. I just know he's going to embarrass me in front of the whole school.
12301,74,151,705000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, no. It's a package from Ralph."
12431,74,152,710000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, a Malibu Stacy Convertible! ""Look in the tunk."" He must mean trunk."
12432,74,153,719000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tickets to the Krusty Anniversary Show! Oh, he must want me to go with him."
12433,74,154,726000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, it isn't fair. I'm ten times the Krusty fan you are. I even have the Krusty home pregnancy test."
12434,74,155,733000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm not sure I should go. I don't even like him.
12435,74,156,736000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're right, Lis. You shouldn't go. It wouldn't be honest. I'll go, disguised as you."
12436,74,157,741000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What if he wants to hold hands?
12437,74,158,743000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
12438,74,159,744000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What if he wants a kiss?
12439,74,160,746000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
12440,74,161,747000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What if he...
12441,74,162,748000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't want to know how far I'll go.
12442,74,163,750000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, is it right to take things from people you don't like?"
12443,74,164,755000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure it is, honey. You do mean stealing, don't you?"
12444,74,165,758000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, actually, it's not as bad as stealing, but my conscience is bothering me."
12445,74,166,763000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Your conscience? Lisa, don't let that pushy little weenie tell you what to do."
12446,74,167,769000,Homer's Conscience,Simpson Home,"Homer, that's a terrible thing to say."
12447,74,168,771000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, shaddup."
12448,74,169,772000,Homer's Conscience,Simpson Home,"Yes, sir."
12450,74,171,775000,Ralph Wiggum,Police Car,I am so glad you cho-cho-chose to come.
12451,74,172,779000,Lisa Simpson,Police Car,"Hmm, I think you should give that a rest, Ralph. Chief Wiggum, how did you ever get these tickets?"
12452,74,173,784000,Chief Wiggum,Police Car,Krusty knows how to play ball.
12454,74,175,790000,Chief Wiggum,ADULT MOVIE THEATER,"Ah, nothin' beats a good porno movie."
12455,74,176,794000,Krusty the Clown,ADULT MOVIE THEATER,Chief Wiggum! Is this a bust?
12456,74,177,796000,Chief Wiggum,ADULT MOVIE THEATER,"Uh. Yeah. That's just what it is, a bust."
12457,74,178,800000,Lisa Simpson,ADULT MOVIE THEATER,That story isn't suitable for children.
12458,74,179,802000,Chief Wiggum,ADULT MOVIE THEATER,Really? I keep my pants on in this version.
12459,74,180,806000,Lisa Simpson,ADULT MOVIE THEATER,Eiw.
