41907,184,26,178000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,In this reporter's opinion it's time for our lard-laden lads to shape up. Get out and try fun activities like military service...Frenetic dancing...
41908,184,27,178000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,Or good old-fashioned Pee Wee Football!
41909,184,28,189000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"There you go, Bart, Pee Wee Football will melt away those unsightly pounds and inches."

41951,184,70,332000,Ned Flanders,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"Well, actually, Lisa, these balls are synthetic."
41952,184,71,335000,JANEY,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"And for every ball you buy, a dollar goes to Amnesty International."

41958,184,77,353000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"Hey, Flanders. You're the worst coach this team has ever had."
41959,184,78,357000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,He's the only coach this team has ever had. And the season hasn't even started yet.
41960,184,79,363000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"Yeah, well... he's wearing that hat like an idiot."
41961,184,80,366000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"You know, Homer, it's very easy to criticize."
41962,184,81,369000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"Fun, too."
41963,184,82,370000,Ned Flanders,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"All right, Wildcats! Are you ready to give 110 per cent, take it one game at a time, and go the whole nine yards?"
41964,184,83,377000,Team,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,Yeah! Nine yards!
41965,184,84,379000,Ned Flanders,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"Okilly-dokilly, let's put on our game faces."

41971,184,90,422000,Nelson Muntz,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"Okay, Simpson, you're blocking for me on this play."
41972,184,91,425000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,All right!
41973,184,92,431000,Nelson Muntz,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"Hut, hut, hike, hike, HUT!"

41979,184,98,461000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"Huh, big deal. I've been carried out of Moe's like that hundreds of times."
41982,184,100,468000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm tellin' ya, Flanders can't coach at all! Now I'm not the type to have a grudge for no reason..."
41983,184,101,474000,Roy Firestone,Simpson Home,"Sir, if I could just break in for a moment..."
41984,184,102,476000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, Roy."
41985,184,103,477000,Roy Firestone,Simpson Home,Do you have a question for Sandy Koufax?
41986,184,104,480000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes. Mr. Koufax, don't you think Flanders is a big jerk? Y'ello? Y'ello?"
41987,184,105,489000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, Homer again. I think we got cut off. Y'ello?"
41989,184,107,503000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,Flaaaan-ders... Flaaaan-ders...

41996,184,114,528000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"Dad, that was really mean."

41999,184,117,541000,Ned Flanders,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,Do you have a problem with the way I'm coaching?
42000,184,118,544000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"No, no. No, no, no. It's just that, well, like I was yelling earlier, it seems like anyone with half a brain could coach better than you."
42001,184,119,552000,Ned Flanders,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,"Uh-huh. Half a brain, huh? Well, you know what? It sounds like you just volunteered!"
42002,184,120,557000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PEE WEE FOOTBALL FIELD,Me? But you were doing such a great job.
42005,184,123,568000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're not gonna make the team with that kinda attitude.
42006,184,124,571000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't want to make the team.
42007,184,125,573000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Then why are you running the obstacle course?
42008,184,126,576000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you wearing my self-defense whistle?
42009,184,127,579000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You never use it.
42011,184,129,583000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good morning, everybody."
42012,184,130,584000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wipe that smile off your face.
42013,184,131,586000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What did I do?
42014,184,132,588000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. From now on, I'm gonna work you like a dog. Now go fetch me twenty laps."

42016,184,134,595000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Do it.
42017,184,135,599000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You shouldn't pressure Bart like that.
42018,184,136,601000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if you know a better way for me to live through my son, I'd like to hear it."
42019,184,137,609000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I knew it. Slowing down already, huh?"
42020,184,138,612000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How can you treat him that way? Don't you remember how bad your father made you feel when you played sports?
42021,184,139,622000,Teenage Smithers,Simpson Home,"Well, that's the end of the girls' floor exercise. Now, let's bring on the men!"
148225,184,140,629000,Teenage Homer,Simpson Home,"Wish me luck, Dad."
42022,184,141,630000,MIDDLE-AGE GRAMPA,Simpson Home,Just don't screw up like you always do.
42023,184,142,649000,Teenage Lenny,Simpson Home,"Wow, he's dy-no-mite!"
148314,184,143,653000,Teenage Marge,Simpson Home,What's his name again?
42024,184,144,659000,MIDDLE-AGE GRAMPA,Simpson Home,You're gonna blow it!
42025,184,145,666000,MIDDLE-AGE GRAMPA,Simpson Home,That's what I get for having faith in ya.
42026,184,146,672000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,My father never believed in me.
42027,184,147,677000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm not gonna make the same mistake. From now on I'm gonna be kinder to my son, and meaner to my Dad."
42029,184,149,683000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Quit runnin', son. I just want to give ya a big hug!"
42039,184,150,687000,Bart's Thoughts,Backyard,It's gotta be a trick. Run like the wind.

42031,184,152,694000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,Will you hug meeeee? Hug meee!
42033,184,154,701000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Good practice, team. Okay, it's time for the easiest part of any coach's job, the cuts."
42034,184,155,708000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Now while I wasn't able to cut everyone I wanted to, I have cut a lot of you. Wendell is cut. Rudy is cut. Janey, you're gone. Steven, I like your hustle. That's why it was so hard to cut you."
42035,184,156,721000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Congratulations, the rest of you made the team."
42036,184,157,726000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Except you, you and you."
42037,184,158,728000,Martin Prince,Football Field,Bart didn't get cut. What a surprise...
42038,184,159,732000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Now just because I'm his father, he'll get no special treatment. He calls me ""Coach"" just like everyone else. Which he'll be doing... as our new starting quarterback!"
41949,184,160,742000,Team,Football Field,Oh no. What? / No way! / Aww.
41981,184,161,745000,Nelson Muntz,Football Field,What a rip!!
42040,184,162,748000,Bart Simpson,Football Field,"But, Coach?"
42041,184,163,749000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"What is it, sweetie?"
42042,184,164,750000,Bart Simpson,Football Field,Nelson's a great quarterback. He's carryin' this team!
42043,184,165,753000,Team,Football Field,"Yeah. / Yeah, he's right. / He's good."
42044,184,166,755000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Not any more. From now on, you're my main man. Okay, now everyone give me five laps, and hit the showers. Oh, Rod, you don't have to. You're cut."
42046,184,168,768000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,But I can't play quarterback. I don't even know how.
42047,184,169,771000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Son, you can do anything you want. I have total faith in you."
42048,184,170,775000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,Since when?
42049,184,171,776000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Since your mother yelled at me. Now how 'bout that hug?
42050,184,172,779000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,"Dad, the car!"
42051,184,173,781000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,I got it.
42053,184,175,785000,Ned Flanders,Football Field,"Good luck, Homer. No hard feelin's."
42054,184,176,787000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it, Flanders?"
42055,184,177,792000,Bart Simpson,Football Field,"Ready. Set. Hut, hut!"
42056,184,178,794000,Bart Simpson,Football Field,Yahh!
42057,184,179,804000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"It's okay, son. You'll do better next time."
42058,184,180,809000,Milhouse Van Houten,Football Field,NopleaseBartdon't!
42060,184,182,816000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,Look at him go!
42061,184,183,820000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Exx-cellent poise, son. You panicked, but you didn't lose your cool."
42063,184,185,829000,Players,Football Field,"Bart, over here! Come on. / Over here! / We're all open! / Over here!"
42064,184,186,834000,Nelson Muntz,Football Field,"Just throw it, doofus!"
42066,184,188,838000,Bart Simpson,Football Field,"Aw, crap."
42067,184,189,843000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Great debut, son. You really settled in after some early jitters."
42068,184,190,847000,Bart Simpson,Football Field,Are you kidding? I reeked!
42069,184,191,849000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Oh, really? Do reeky players get the game ball?"
42070,184,192,853000,Homer Simpson,Football Field,"Hey, everybody! Let's hear it for Bart!"
42071,184,193,859000,Bart Simpson,Football Field,"Gimme a ""B""?"
42072,184,194,861000,Nelson Muntz,Football Field,"I won't give you a ""B"" but I'll tear ya a new ""A."""
42073,184,195,861000,Milhouse Van Houten,Football Field,"Yeah, if I wasn't your friend, I'd tell you you sucked."
42074,184,196,869000,Sherri Mackleberry,Football Field,"You ruined our undefeated season. You ruined everything, ruiner. My sister likes you."
42075,184,197,876000,Nelson Muntz,Football Field,"Listen here, daddy's boy. You cost us one more game and you're dead."
42076,184,198,883000,Ralph Wiggum,Football Field,You're going to heaven!
42078,184,200,896000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's gonna take a miracle for me to become a good quarterback.
42079,184,201,903000,Stranger,Simpson Home,"Excuse me, son."
42080,184,202,904000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, Joe Namath!"
42081,184,203,906000,Joe Namath,Simpson Home,That's right. My car broke down in front of your house.
