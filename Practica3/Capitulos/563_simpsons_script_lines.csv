146237,563,2,68000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,WALKIN' DOWN A CORRIDOR / USIN' BOTH MY FEET / WISH I WAS IN FLORIDOR / NOW I WILL REPEAT / OH I'M WALKIN' DOWN A CORRIDOR / USIN' BOTH MY FEET...
146238,563,3,81000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Don Bookner. Can't believe you're retiring.
146239,563,4,84000,DON BOOKNER,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yep. It's time for the gold watch.
146240,563,5,88000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Thank you. You are free to go.
146241,563,6,94000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Good ol' Don.
146242,563,7,95000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"We sure will miss your, your, um, uh -- what'd you do again?"
146243,563,8,100000,DON BOOKNER,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Safety Inspector. 7-G.
146244,563,9,102000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"But, wait a minute! That's my job!"
146245,563,10,104000,DON BOOKNER,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes. Of course it is. There are two of us, and I've been covering for you all these years."
146246,563,11,110000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That would explain a lot. But why did you do it?
146247,563,12,115000,DON BOOKNER,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I felt there was something special in you. It's like rooting for the Cubs. You keep thinking they'll make it and then you realize they never, ever will."
146248,563,13,125000,DON BOOKNER,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,But now you won't have me to protect you.
146249,563,14,128000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, please! All I'm asking you to do is stay twenty-one more years!"
146250,563,15,132000,DON BOOKNER,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Too late. I'm gone. If I was Fred Flintstone I'd be at the end of the dinosaur's tail.
146251,563,16,137000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW...
146252,563,17,140000,Smitty,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW...
146253,563,18,142000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOOOW!
146254,563,19,149000,DON BOOKNER,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY. Last time I'm covering your ass, Homer."
146226,563,20,155000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I have such a big ass.
146255,563,22,161000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How was your day?
146256,563,23,162000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Stressful. Do you see how loose my tie is?
146258,563,25,167000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,For the first time I actually had to do my job.
146259,563,26,171000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, sweetie..."
146260,563,27,171000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And Marge, I've got this weird new feeling in my stomach. A little sour and a little sick."
146261,563,28,181000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"There's a Yiddish word for it: ""shpilkes."""
146262,563,29,184000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,They have a lot of funny words for not-so-funny things.
146264,563,31,190000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, Homer. Carl and I are gonna see if we can sneak out of the men's room without setting off the automatic toilets, ninja-style."
146265,563,32,197000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Look, I don't have time for childish games. If I don't do my job, atoms go boom!"
146266,563,33,204000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Simpson! I want a full plant status report at five o'clock.
146267,563,34,207000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Can I get a four fifty-five wakeup call?"
146268,563,35,210000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No.
146270,563,37,214000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Dammit.
146272,563,39,217000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought we weren't allowed to do homework at the table.
146273,563,40,220000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's called a double standard. One of the bedrocks of parenting.
146274,563,41,225000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You've been working so hard lately. Maybe you should take a break.
146275,563,42,229000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No. Marge, if I lose my job in this economy, it's a death sentence. Oh, I guess, as a fallback, I could direct films like Angelina Jolie. How many properties do we have an option on?"
146276,563,43,240000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,None.
146277,563,44,240000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What?! When were you gonna tell me?
146279,563,46,244000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,When?!
146280,563,47,247000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie... workaholic is probably your best ""aholic"" ever, but you need to relax...so I got us all tickets to see the circus on Saturday."
146281,563,48,259000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The circus? Hmmm, I haven't been to the circus since I was a kid."
148212,563,49,266000,Young Grampa,Simpson Home,Son! Look over there!
148213,563,50,270000,Young Grampa,Simpson Home,"I mean, look over there!"
148214,563,51,273000,Young Grampa,Simpson Home,Ten bucks a cone?! Look back at the elephant!
146283,563,52,278000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, Marge. We can go to the circus. Maybe I can finally find out why a man would think a stool is a proper defense against a lion."
146286,563,55,290000,Homer Simpson,Circus Tent,Dammit! This circus Wi-Fi is a joke!
146287,563,56,295000,Marge Simpson,Circus Tent,I thought you were going to try to relax.
146288,563,57,298000,Homer Simpson,Circus Tent,How can anyone relax when they made us park in stack parking?
146289,563,58,301000,Lisa Simpson,Circus Tent,I knew he wasn't gonna like the stack parking.
146290,563,59,304000,Homer Simpson,Circus Tent,What kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you?!
146291,563,60,310000,Homer Simpson,Circus Tent,The early bird gets the shaft!
146292,563,61,313000,CIRCUS AUDIENCE,Circus Tent,Shhh!
146293,563,62,323000,Homer Simpson,Circus Tent,Oh my God. What if all those clowns are parked in the same lot as us? Maybe there's better Wi-Fi in the freak tent.
146294,563,63,331000,Homer Simpson,Circus Tent,"'Scuse me, pardon me, what the Hell?"
146295,563,64,334000,Homer Simpson,Circus Tent,"Oh! Finally! The business call I've been waiting for! Hello, this is--"
146298,563,67,337000,Homer Simpson,CIRCUS,"Come on, kids! There's nothing you'd be interested in here."
146299,563,68,346000,FINGERNAIL MAN,CIRCUS,Hey!
146300,563,69,348000,Homer Simpson,CIRCUS,"Eh, they'll grow back."
146301,563,70,351000,Marge Simpson,CIRCUS,"Homer, I have to use the Porta Potty."
146302,563,71,355000,Homer Simpson,CIRCUS,Oh for God's-- now? Do you have to?
146303,563,72,358000,Marge Simpson,CIRCUS,No woman uses one of these by choice.
146304,563,73,367000,Bart Simpson,CIRCUS,"Hey Dad, since we've gotta wait, can't we please see an act?"
146305,563,74,371000,Homer Simpson,CIRCUS,Fine. But I'll be amazed if I'm astounded.
146307,563,76,376000,Cletus Spuckler,HYPNOTIST TENT,...thereby proving Zorn's lemma.
146308,563,77,378000,Brandine Del Roy,HYPNOTIST TENT,Give me my damn husband back!
146309,563,78,381000,Cletus Spuckler,HYPNOTIST TENT,Dang! Look at all them hobo signs! My head bone hurts.
146310,563,79,388000,SVEN-GOLLY,HYPNOTIST TENT,"I need a new volunteer. How about you, sir?"
146311,563,80,393000,Homer Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,"Hey, is that time right? I have a deadline in an hour and a half!"
146312,563,81,398000,Lisa Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,"You know, Dad, studies show being hypnotized makes you more efficient."
146313,563,82,402000,Homer Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,Okay.
146282,563,83,404000,Bart Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,Is that true?
146314,563,84,406000,Lisa Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,I just wanted to see him cluck like a chicken.
146315,563,85,406000,SVEN-GOLLY,HYPNOTIST TENT,"Now we've never met, have we, sir?"
146316,563,86,411000,Homer Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,"Ooh, patter!"
146317,563,87,413000,SVEN-GOLLY,HYPNOTIST TENT,Do you have any children?
146318,563,88,414000,Homer Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,"No, but we're having fun trying. Wait, I mean three."
146319,563,89,419000,SVEN-GOLLY,HYPNOTIST TENT,When I snap my fingers you shall be ten years old.
146320,563,90,424000,Homer Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,"Look, can we get to the point? I'm stack parked. Did you hear me? Stack..."
146321,563,91,429000,SVEN-GOLLY,HYPNOTIST TENT,You are ten years old.
146322,563,92,430000,Homer Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,No I'm not.
146323,563,93,431000,SVEN-GOLLY,HYPNOTIST TENT,Yes you are.
146324,563,94,432000,Homer Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,No I'm not.
146325,563,95,432000,SVEN-GOLLY,HYPNOTIST TENT,Yes you are.
146326,563,96,434000,Homer Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,No I'm not.
146327,563,97,435000,SVEN-GOLLY,HYPNOTIST TENT,Yes you are.
146328,563,98,435000,Homer Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,Yes you are.
146329,563,99,437000,SVEN-GOLLY,HYPNOTIST TENT,"Yes, yes you are."
146330,563,100,437000,Homer Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,Yes you are.
146331,563,101,440000,SVEN-GOLLY,HYPNOTIST TENT,"Look, I said, you are."
146332,563,102,442000,Homer Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,Yeah you are too.
146333,563,103,444000,SVEN-GOLLY,HYPNOTIST TENT,Only a ten-year-old boy could be this annoying!
146335,563,105,449000,Bart Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,I'm not convinced.
146336,563,106,452000,Homer Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,"I know you are but what am I, infinity plus one! Jinx!"
146337,563,107,455000,Bart Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,"Only the coolest kid ever could think of that! Good golly, Sven-Golly! You did it!"
146338,563,108,460000,Chief Wiggum,HYPNOTIST TENT,"Sven-Golly, born Svenjamin Golly, you are under arrest for mesmerizing the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to induct Kiss."
146339,563,109,468000,Chief Wiggum,HYPNOTIST TENT,"...you are wanted by the police, by which I mean Sting... Andy Summers... and... hey is it-- is it getting hot in here?"
146340,563,110,478000,Lou,HYPNOTIST TENT,"Oh, not again."
146341,563,111,481000,Lisa Simpson,HYPNOTIST TENT,"Mom, Dad's been hypnotized to think he was ten!"
146345,563,115,494000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Now I'm gonna test just how deeply Homer's mind has been affected. Take a sip of this, young man."
146346,563,116,504000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Ew! Gross!
146347,563,117,506000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,What did you give him?
146348,563,118,507000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Beer.
146349,563,120,509000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,This hypnotism is strong. Dinner theater strong!
146350,563,121,513000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,My husband can't really think he's ten.
146351,563,122,515000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"I'm saying he so desperately needs to believe he's ten, that only the original hypnotist who did this can undo the trance without risking permanent damage to Homer's psyche."
146352,563,123,525000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Help... help me.
146353,563,124,528000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Dear God!
146354,563,125,528000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Psych!
146355,563,126,531000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Oops.
146356,563,127,532000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,So what do we do?
146357,563,128,534000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Do not force the truth. For now, treat Homer just as you would a regular ten-year-old boy."
146358,563,129,539000,Bart Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Can he be nine so I can beat him up?
146359,563,130,541000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Oh, I'm afraid not. The rules of hypnotism are inflexible."
146360,563,131,544000,Bart Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Then can we get pizza on the way home?
146361,563,132,546000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Ask for boogers on Bart's half!
146362,563,133,548000,Bart Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Good one.
146363,563,134,549000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Booger pizza. You better pray they find that hypnotist, Marge."
146365,563,136,553000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Get the ball, boy! C'mon!"
146366,563,137,555000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Go get it, boy!"
146368,563,139,559000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Go get it, boy!"
146370,563,141,562000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Go get it, boy!"
146372,563,143,564000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey! Ow! Ow! I thought you were my best friend! Ow! Ow!
146373,563,144,570000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,So... where is he gonna sleep?
146374,563,145,572000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I guess it'll have to be in Bart's room. And I thought when Homer cut off his thumb was bad."
146375,563,146,580000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Um, Mrs. Simpson?"
146381,563,152,595000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Homer, can't you sleep with Mom?"
146382,563,153,598000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I'd be too nervous. Have you noticed that she's kinda hot?
146383,563,154,602000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Gross! Weird! Complicated! Go to sleep!
146385,563,156,608000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Bedroom,I really do miss my Homie this time of night.
146386,563,157,620000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Bedroom,We're gonna have a lot of mittens this winter.
146388,563,159,624000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"If I'm gonna get through this day, I better Irish up my coffee."
146389,563,160,632000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm ready to go to school.
146390,563,161,634000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer... you're not going to school.
146391,563,162,636000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm not? Cool! Am I sick?
146392,563,163,639000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"'Cause if I'm sick, I get to stay home and make s'mores. All I need is graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire..."
146393,563,164,641000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"...did I say graham crackers?... chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire..."
146394,563,165,649000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oops, my homework!"
146395,563,166,650000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fine, you can go to school!"
146397,563,168,653000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yo, this is tunnel tag. When you're tagged, you have to spread your legs and freeze."
146398,563,169,657000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Guess I chose the wrong day to wear culottes.
146399,563,170,660000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Every day's the wrong day to wear culottes. You're ""it""!"
146400,563,171,667000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Can I play?
146401,563,172,668000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, God, no."
146402,563,173,673000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"If Milhouse can play, anyone can play!"
146403,563,174,676000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Once again I'm the lower bound! You're it!
146404,563,175,681000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Is that a grown man going between the children's legs?
146405,563,176,685000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,There's nothing in the rule book against it.
146406,563,177,687000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,It's on page one of the rule book!
146407,563,178,690000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,That's where I doodle.
146408,563,179,691000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"It's a comic strip I do called ""Bumble and Grumble."" Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son."
146409,563,180,698000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,No he doesn't.
146411,563,182,700000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm beat.
146413,563,184,703000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Today was fun.
146414,563,185,705000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Yeah! Listen, Homer...do you ever think about what you want to do when you're grown up?"
146416,563,186,710000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"I'll eat in bed. Not just snacks, messy stuff like lasagna... Oh, and TV would be on. Loud."
146417,563,187,718000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Hey, would you ever wanna have a real job and a family?"
146418,563,188,721000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Pff. Wife? Three kids? Steady job? If I did, I'd secretly be very sad. You could tell by how much I would eat and drink and just sit on the couch."
146420,563,190,727000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Yeah. Thank God that never happened.
146421,563,191,737000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Wow. He doesn't want to be my Dad. He just wants to be a kid like me. Almost makes me not wanna prank him. Almost.
146423,563,193,753000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Touché.
146425,563,195,764000,Bart Simpson,Park,"If you wedgie me, my friend will beat you up."
146426,563,196,767000,DOLPH,Park,That's not your friend. It's your screwed-up dad.
146427,563,197,770000,Jimbo Jones,Park,"Pretty sad, really."
146428,563,198,772000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Park,We'll leave you alone.
146429,563,199,774000,Bart Simpson,Park,"You did it, Homer! You saved me from the bullies! You're the coolest kid I ever met."
146430,563,200,779000,Milhouse Van Houten,Park,What about me?
146431,563,201,781000,Bart Simpson,Park,You're in the top hundred.
146432,563,202,782000,Milhouse Van Houten,Park,Boo-yeah!
146433,563,203,783000,Bart Simpson,Park,Now you're not.
146436,563,206,813000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa...
146437,563,207,813000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,...your Ma says I should do something with you. Need some help with your homework?
146438,563,208,819000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm done.
146439,563,209,820000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wanna see me make a muscle?
146440,563,210,821000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Not right now.
146441,563,211,823000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that's everything I know that girls like."
146442,563,212,826000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen, Homer. I just want to take advantage of this opportunity to have you enjoy my saxophone with me."
146443,563,213,834000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay.

146447,563,217,854000,Carl Carlson,Lisa's Bedroom,Thank God they pulled that other safety inspector out of retirement.
146449,563,219,861000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD FISHING HOLE,"D-DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO! Y'know, you're the closest thing I've ever had to a brother."

146451,563,221,869000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD FISHING HOLE,Change back to what?
146452,563,222,869000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD FISHING HOLE,Look in the lake. Tell me what you see.
146453,563,223,872000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD FISHING HOLE,Bloated corpse under the water. I'd say he's been there a few months at least. Interesting the way his lips move just like mine. Why do you ask?
146454,563,224,882000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD FISHING HOLE,No reason. Brother.
146459,563,229,899000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Chief, I hope this is the call I've been praying for."
146460,563,230,902000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,It is. We have captured Sven-Golly. Using a specially-dedicated anti-hypnosis squad.
146461,563,231,910000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, bring him here now! I want my Homie back! I miss him and the things he did!"
146463,563,233,917000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Lis, you know how Dad thinks he's a ten-year-old?"
146464,563,234,920000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"I've been emotionally dealing with that all week. So, yes."
146465,563,235,922000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Well, now that hypnotist is gonna come back and snap him out of it!"
146466,563,236,926000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Look, Dad had to get cured some time. There's nothing we can do about it."
146467,563,237,930000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Or isn't there not?
146469,563,239,933000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"All right, Sven-golly. You're gonna untangle this guy's noodle and that's it. No more hypnotizing anyone."
146470,563,240,939000,SVEN-GOLLY,Simpson Home,"You have my word, Chief Kangaroo."
146471,563,241,943000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Boing. Boing. Boing. Boing.

146474,563,244,956000,SVEN-GOLLY,Simpson Home,I'm good. I'm not that good. Haw-haw.
146476,563,246,962000,Bart Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,I wanted you to enjoy being a kid just a little longer.
146478,563,248,965000,Homer Simpson,SOARIN' OVER SPRINGFIELD RIDE,Woo hoo!
146480,563,250,981000,Krusty the Clown,SOARIN' OVER SPRINGFIELD RIDE,I do it all myself!
146481,563,251,1006000,Usher,SOARIN' OVER SPRINGFIELD RIDE,"We've returned to Itchy and Scratchy Land, which means you'll have to pay again."
146483,563,253,1012000,Homer Simpson,Park,What do we do next? What do we do next?
146484,563,254,1014000,Chief Wiggum,Park,Homer Simpson!
146485,563,255,1016000,Chief Wiggum,Park,Your second childhood is over! You're going back to taking statins and paying FICA!
146486,563,256,1021000,Bart Simpson,Park,No! You can't take him now! We've only been on two rides!
146487,563,257,1024000,Chief Wiggum,Park,"Hey, you should've used Fast Pass!"
146488,563,258,1026000,Bart Simpson,Park,Fast Pass can't solve everything!
146489,563,259,1028000,Chief Wiggum,Park,Spoken like a kid who's never lived in a non-Fast Pass world.
146490,563,260,1033000,Marge Simpson,Park,"Homer, come here."
146491,563,261,1044000,Homer Simpson,Park,"Bye, Bart. Stay ten forever."
146492,563,262,1048000,Bart Simpson,Park,"Goodbye, friend."
146493,563,263,1052000,Marge Simpson,Park,"Before you fix him... can you change one little thing? I'm embarrassed to ask this, but after we... snuggle, he always rolls over and goes to sleep and I'd rather..."
146494,563,264,1055000,SVEN-GOLLY,Park,That's the only thing you want changed? Everything else about him is perfect?
146495,563,265,1072000,Marge Simpson,Park,Yes.
146496,563,266,1073000,SVEN-GOLLY,Park,"Where were you when I was straight? All right, let's do this."

146500,563,270,1092000,Homer Simpson,Park,"Marge, sweetie, I'm not gonna lie. I must have tied one on at Moe's. If you have it in your heart, could you forgive me and totally blame my friends?"
146501,563,271,1101000,Marge Simpson,Park,"Homie, I've missed you!"
146502,563,272,1107000,Homer Simpson,Park,Ooh! I've missed you too.
146506,563,276,1125000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,What the? Lasagna in bed?!
146507,563,277,1128000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Recommended by a kid I used to know.
146508,563,278,1130000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Y'know, I used to have this friend... I told him all my dreams. Really, really great kid."
146509,563,279,1137000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,You think so?
146510,563,280,1138000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,The best. Wonder what ever happened to him.
146511,563,281,1141000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Well... maybe you sat on him and he was never seen again.
146415,563,282,1145000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Why you little--
146512,563,283,1147000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"You know, boy, I'm not sure I can strangle you anymore. I'm gonna try something new."
146513,563,284,1154000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"What do you say, boy? Wanna split the lasagna?"
146514,563,285,1157000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Get lost.
146515,563,286,1157000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Why you little...?!

146526,563,297,1201000,SVEN-GOLLY,SUBTERRANEAN GLASS CELL,"Once again, you're too smart for me, my friend."
146527,563,298,1204000,Chief Wiggum,SUBTERRANEAN GLASS CELL,That's why I'm the master hypnotist and you're the bumbling Police Chief.
146528,563,299,1208000,SVEN-GOLLY,SUBTERRANEAN GLASS CELL,"Exactly so, Sven-Golly. Exactly so."
146529,563,300,1214000,Chief Wiggum,SUBTERRANEAN GLASS CELL,See you tomorrow?
146530,563,301,1214000,SVEN-GOLLY,SUBTERRANEAN GLASS CELL,"Yes uh I, might be a little late."
146531,563,302,1219000,Chief Wiggum,SUBTERRANEAN GLASS CELL,That Chief Wiggum. What a dope.
