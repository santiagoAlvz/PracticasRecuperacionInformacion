124358,480,15,156000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Who the hell are Cheech and Chong?
124359,480,16,158000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, Cheech and Chong were the Beavis and Butthead of their day!"
124360,480,17,163000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Who are Beavis and Butthead?
124361,480,18,166000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've failed as a parent. I swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy. To the media room!
124363,480,20,172000,Chong,THE SIMPSON ATTIC,Open up. It's the police.
124364,480,21,174000,Cheech,THE SIMPSON ATTIC,"Oh man, I gotta get rid of my grass!"
124365,480,22,180000,Homer Simpson,THE SIMPSON ATTIC,He's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily!
124366,480,23,185000,Homer Simpson,THE SIMPSON ATTIC,Back then we'd play these albums again and again till they were filled with skips and clicks and pops. Which was about three times.
124367,480,24,194000,Lisa Simpson,THE SIMPSON ATTIC,These are comedy albums?
124368,480,25,196000,Lisa Simpson,THE SIMPSON ATTIC,The Noisy Minority... The Upside-Down Bubblegum Collective... The Regional Lampoon... The Plymouth Grok Experiment... Fro And Flo... Allan Sherman's Helter Shmelter...
124369,480,26,206000,Marge Simpson,THE SIMPSON ATTIC,What are you guys doing up there?
124370,480,27,208000,Homer Simpson,THE SIMPSON ATTIC,Hide the dope!
124371,480,28,210000,Bart Simpson,THE SIMPSON ATTIC,We don't have any dope.
124372,480,29,211000,Homer Simpson,THE SIMPSON ATTIC,Then what did I just smoke?
124375,480,32,219000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Lou, I want you to confiscate these brownies."
124376,480,33,222000,Lou,Springfield Clamphitheater,There's no drugs in these brownies.
124377,480,34,223000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Clamphitheater,I said confiscate!
124378,480,35,225000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Uh, also confiscate me a t-shirt, uh, triple-X-L."
124379,480,36,229000,Lou,Springfield Clamphitheater,I thought you said double-X-L was a real wakeup call.
124380,480,37,232000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Clamphitheater,That was for pants.
124381,480,38,234000,Announcer,Springfield Clamphitheater,Ladies and gentlemen: Krusty the Clown!
124382,480,39,236000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Thank you. When they asked me to introduce Cheech and Chong, I said ""how much?"" And they said ""we don't pay for introductions,"" so I said ""then I don't need this crummy gig,"" and they said ""yes, you do,"" and I said... ladies and gentlemen, Cheech and Chong!"
124383,480,40,250000,Chong,Springfield Clamphitheater,Who is it?
124384,480,41,250000,Cheech,Springfield Clamphitheater,"It's me, Dave, man. Open up, I got the stuff."
124385,480,42,259000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,I thought they'd do bits -- but their most famous bit?!
124386,480,43,263000,Cheech,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Will you open up, I got the stuff with me."
124388,480,44,265000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Ooo, he's gonna say ""Dave's not here!"""
124389,480,45,265000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,Dave's not here! Dave's not here!
124390,480,46,270000,Audience,Springfield Clamphitheater,Dave's not here!
124391,480,47,270000,Audience,Springfield Clamphitheater,Dave's not here! Dave's not here!
124392,480,48,274000,Cheech,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Say the line, man!"
124393,480,49,275000,Chong,Springfield Clamphitheater,They already know the line. What's the surprise? What's the point?
124394,480,50,279000,Cheech,Springfield Clamphitheater,The point is they still give us a shoebox full of twenties to do this! Now say it!
124395,480,51,284000,Chong,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Dave's not... Dave's not gonna sell out anymore, man! I, I can't say it!"
124397,480,53,292000,Cheech,Springfield Clamphitheater,"What are you doing, man?!"
124398,480,54,294000,Chong,Springfield Clamphitheater,"What am I doing?! What am I-- I'm experimenting, man! I'm growing as an artist, okay?"
124399,480,55,298000,Cheech,Springfield Clamphitheater,That's not the Cheech and Chong brand.
124400,480,56,301000,Chong,Springfield Clamphitheater,Brand? Brand? I'm a seventy-two year old man. I've eaten eggs every which way they cook 'em -- I can't play it safe anymore.
124401,480,57,308000,Cheech,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Look, these people pay good money to see ""Dave's not here!"" You owe them ""Dave's not here!"""
124402,480,58,308000,Chong,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Well, how about this? Chong's not here! Man!"
124403,480,59,321000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,Oh no! Chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases.
124404,480,60,325000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,Ay carumba!
124406,480,62,328000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Homie, you know all the bits. Maybe you could help him!"
124407,480,63,332000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,I can't do reefer comedy -- I'm drunk. Two different animals.
124408,480,64,336000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Homer Simpson, that man's albums have given you decades of entertainment -- and seen you through some very square times. Help him!"
124409,480,65,353000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Dave's not here, man!"
124411,480,67,362000,Cheech,Springfield Clamphitheater,"No man, I'm Dave. D-A-V-E!"
124412,480,68,365000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,Dave?
124413,480,69,366000,Cheech,Springfield Clamphitheater,That's right. Now open up the door.
124414,480,70,368000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Dave's not here, man!"
124418,480,74,377000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Clamphitheater,"You find this funny, sir?"
124420,480,75,379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Just because it's too hip for you, Smithers..."
124421,480,76,386000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,I'll give Dave your message.
124422,480,77,389000,Very Tall Man,Springfield Clamphitheater,I don't find this funny at all.
124423,480,78,392000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,My time being wasted was not wasted!
124425,480,80,397000,Cheech,Springfield Clamphitheater,"Hey man, you're alright! How'd you like to be the new Chong?"
124426,480,81,402000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,Yes! Will I get to meet Dave?
124427,480,82,404000,Cheech,Springfield Clamphitheater,There is no Dave.
124428,480,83,405000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Clamphitheater,How 'bout Don Johnson?
124429,480,84,406000,Cheech,Springfield Clamphitheater,It'd be easier to meet Dave.
124431,480,86,414000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It is so cool for you to let me go on tour with Cheech.
124432,480,87,417000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"And remember, on the road, the only vice you can indulge in is gluttony. Save lust and rage for me and the kids."
124433,480,88,425000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetie, don't worry. I'm gonna come back so horny and angry..."
124434,480,89,430000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Awww.
124436,480,91,431000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,I can't believe I'm riding around in Cheech's van! The van made of weed!
124437,480,92,436000,Cheech,Springfield Street,It's not made of weed.
124438,480,93,437000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Oh. What's it made of? Hash? Shrooms? Lysergic acid diethylamide?
124439,480,94,443000,Cheech,Springfield Street,No! The van is just made of van.
124441,480,96,447000,Cheech,Springfield Street,"Look, Homer, I really need you to be on your game, you know? A lot of our fans have gone through rehab, so they're much more critical."
124442,480,97,453000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Don't worry, Cheech. I know all the classic bits of you and Chong."
124443,480,98,458000,Cheech,Springfield Street,"Don't say that name! Now, you drive -- I have to go black out his face on some t-shirts with a Magic Marker."
124444,480,99,462000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Can we get high from the fumes?
124445,480,100,464000,Cheech,Springfield Street,No!
124447,480,102,478000,Chong,Springfield Street,"Okay, man, what I'm looking for in a new Cheech is someone who is, like, open-minded and adventurous. I haven't decided about the mustache yet, but you need your own suspenders."
124448,480,103,489000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Street,"Snap, snap!"
124449,480,104,491000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Street,Our friendship died with the first snap and you buried it with the second.
124450,480,106,495000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,You ever notice how your nose makes boogers? What's up with that?
124451,480,107,499000,Chong,Springfield Elementary School,Uh... next!
124452,480,108,501000,Gil Gunderson,Springfield Elementary School,"I can't pay the rent. You must pay the rent. I can't pay the rent. You must pay the rent. I'll pay the rent. My hero. Aw, who am I kiddin'? I don't got the money."
124453,480,109,514000,Chong,Springfield Elementary School,Next.
124455,480,111,525000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Zoom!
124457,480,113,528000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I am your substitute teacher, Sister Mary Elephant. Class, attention, attention, class, class -- shut up! Thank you."
124458,480,114,537000,Chong,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, no, man. No routines from the old regime."
124459,480,115,540000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Really? But Sister Mary's no-nonsense attitude is what inspired me to become an educator.
124460,480,116,545000,Chong,Springfield Elementary School,"Just let your freak flag fly, man."
124461,480,117,547000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I guess as long as I fold it afterward and don't display it at night... Oh, perhaps I should improvise, or ""do an improv?"""
124462,480,118,554000,Chong,Springfield Elementary School,"I want you to reinvent the wheel! No, de-invent the wheel! No -- re-unvent the whool!"
124463,480,119,559000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, I'll get my prop trunk!"
124464,480,120,564000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"A lot of people have cell phones, but I like to eat healthy. So I invented... the celery phone! Hello? Hello?"
124465,480,121,572000,Chong,Springfield Elementary School,"Wow. You are the un-funniest man I've ever seen. Which means, teaming up with you would be totally pushing the envelope."
124466,480,122,579000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Mother, how did you get this number -- it's a prop phone! Yes, I have your celery... I took the limpest stalk there was!"
124467,480,123,587000,Chong,Springfield Elementary School,Stop it! Stop riffing! The gig is yours!
124469,480,125,591000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,Time to finally return your father's overdue movies.
124470,480,126,595000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,Is it really okay to just drop them into the pit where the Blockbuster used to be?
124471,480,127,599000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,Got a better idea?
124475,480,131,611000,Marge Simpson,SHABBY HOUSE,"Um, hello... I'm Marge Simpson... I think I've given you money a of couple times..."
124476,480,133,619000,Marge Simpson,SHABBY HOUSE,"No, no, no, no, no, no -- I don't want the money back, I just came for my dog."
124479,480,136,631000,Lisa Simpson,SHABBY HOUSE,"Easter grass, Cable Ace Awards, aquariums full of broken pinball game parts, popped but uneaten Jiffy Pop still in the silver bubble, sample-sized shampoos, detergents and whiskeys..."
124480,480,137,643000,Marge Simpson,SHABBY HOUSE,I hate to say this about the Cat Lady... but I think she's crazy. She's a hoarder!
124482,480,139,651000,Lisa Simpson,SHABBY HOUSE,This is so sad. Can we help her?
124483,480,140,654000,Marge Simpson,SHABBY HOUSE,We can. It'll be great. Like a reality show without the cameras.
124484,480,141,658000,Lisa Simpson,SHABBY HOUSE,"You mean, just reality."
124485,480,142,660000,Moe Szyslak,SHABBY HOUSE,"Yeah, that's what you think."
124486,480,143,662000,Moe Szyslak,SHABBY HOUSE,"Cut, print, mail to NBC."
124489,480,146,669000,Homer Simpson,Tour Van,CHEECH AND CHONG HAS LOST ITS CHONG / I AM THE CHONG NOW... TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AT ME-E...
124490,480,147,682000,Cheech,Tour Van,"That's funny, Homer. Now we really have to work on the show."
124491,480,148,686000,Homer Simpson,Tour Van,"Oh yeah, I getcha -- ""work on the show."" Maybe we should start at four-twenty, right? Marijuana reference!"
124492,480,149,693000,Cheech,Tour Van,"Yeah, I got it. Listen, man, comedy is hard work."
124493,480,150,698000,Homer Simpson,Tour Van,Hard work? I thought this was gonna be fun.
124494,480,151,700000,Cheech,Tour Van,It is fun! The fun is the knowledge that our audience gets a good value for their hard-earned dollar!
124495,480,152,707000,Homer Simpson,Tour Van,CHEECH IS SURE A LOT LESS COOL / THAN I IMAGINED...
124496,480,153,710000,Cheech,Tour Van,Stop that!
124497,480,154,712000,Homer Simpson,Tour Van,BETTER SHUT UP / CHEECH IS REALLY MAD / I WISH THAT I HAD GONE WITH CHO-ONG...
124499,480,156,722000,Marge Simpson,CAT LADY'S HOUSE,"Now, we've managed to preoccupy the cat lady for the next few hours."

124504,480,161,774000,Marge Simpson,CAT LADY'S HOUSE,Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
124505,480,162,775000,Marge Simpson,CAT LADY'S HOUSE,A perfectly-good hot lather dispenser. I can't count the number of times Homie's cried in anguish over his lukewarm lather.
124506,480,163,784000,Marge Simpson,CAT LADY'S HOUSE,"Ooh, a pen from the Milwaukee Hilton! ...a phone answering machine from the '80s!"
124507,480,164,792000,Cat Lady,CAT LADY'S HOUSE,NOBODY'S HOME!
124508,480,165,795000,Marge Simpson,CAT LADY'S HOUSE,"All of J.D. Salinger's books, except ""Catcher In The Rye!"" Used pizza protectors!"

124524,480,181,906000,Cheech,Springfield Street,"Yeah! I'm taking you to a museum, man. Chong and I used to come here all the time."
124525,480,182,912000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Why aren't you exactly like your stage persona?
124527,480,184,916000,Cheech,ART MUSEUM,"Now Homer, this Viramontes image is an example of how Chicano poster art preserves a culture ignored by Eurocentric society."
124528,480,185,924000,Homer Simpson,ART MUSEUM,Eurocentric! When do we have wacky adventures?
124529,480,186,929000,Cheech,ART MUSEUM,"Ah, that's just the movies, man."
124530,480,187,930000,Homer Simpson,ART MUSEUM,Can we at least get some French fries?
124531,480,188,932000,Cheech,ART MUSEUM,Too high in trans-fats.

124537,480,194,957000,Seymour Skinner,COMEDY CLUB,Dave is here! Man.
124538,480,195,960000,Gary Chalmers,COMEDY CLUB,Skin-ner! This dessert menu is funnier than you!
124539,480,196,966000,Seymour Skinner,COMEDY CLUB,"Yes, but I'm funnier than the cocktail napkins."
124540,480,197,969000,Gary Chalmers,COMEDY CLUB,"They're blank, Seymour."
124541,480,198,971000,Seymour Skinner,COMEDY CLUB,"Yes, but there're two k-sounds in ""cocktail."""

124544,480,201,976000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, how was your first day of school?"
124545,480,202,979000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I met the new principal, Mr. Baumgartner. He seemed really cool. When he walked through the gym, he shot a basket!"
124548,480,205,1004000,Grampa Simpson,MAZE,Who has disturbed my tomb?
124549,480,206,1007000,Lisa Simpson,MAZE,"Grampa, you're not dead."

124553,480,210,1019000,Cheech,CAPITOL CITY THEATER,"Now Homer, what did we agree about personal phone calls during rehearsal time?"
124554,480,211,1025000,Homer Simpson,CAPITOL CITY THEATER,It's disrespectful to the high standards people have come to expect from Cheech and Chunk.
124555,480,212,1030000,Cheech,CAPITOL CITY THEATER,That's right. Now let's take it from the part where we sniff each other's butts.
124556,480,213,1033000,Homer Simpson,CAPITOL CITY THEATER,"Yes, sir."
124557,480,214,1034000,Cheech,CAPITOL CITY THEATER,"Come on, sniff!"
124559,480,216,1036000,Cheech,CAPITOL CITY THEATER,"That's a movie sniff. This is live theater. Now inhale, damn it."
124561,480,218,1043000,Cheech,CAPITOL CITY THEATER,I'm hearing it but I'm not feeling it.
124564,480,221,1054000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Tour bus parked. Gotta save Marge!
124565,480,222,1058000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe the crazy house would throw out all these forks.
124566,480,223,1064000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are ""insane?"" Well, sometimes people can be too."
124567,480,224,1070000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you talking about?
124568,480,225,1072000,ELEANOR,Simpson Home,"Marge, you saved me. Now I want to save you."
124569,480,226,1075000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm not a hoarder! Do the Yankees hoard pennants? Does Marrakesh hoard intrigue?
124570,480,227,1082000,ELEANOR,Simpson Home,"Marge, Marge, what can one person honestly do with..."
124571,480,228,1086000,ELEANOR,Simpson Home,"Filled-in mini golf score sheets... European ketchup...rolls of ""I Voted"" stickers..."
124572,480,229,1099000,ELEANOR,Simpson Home,Styrofoam shaped like old computers!
