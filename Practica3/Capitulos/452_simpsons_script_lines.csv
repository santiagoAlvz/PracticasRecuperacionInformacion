116983,452,124,465000,Kent Brockman,Hospital Room,Our top story: last night's big lotto winner has still not come forward.
116984,452,125,470000,Kent Brockman,Hospital Room,"Once again, those numbers are: one, six, seventeen, twenty-two, twenty-four, and thirty-five."
148630,452,126,475000,Homer's Thoughts,Hospital Room,A million dollars -- now I'm really glad I didn't die!
116985,452,127,480000,Kent Brockman,Hospital Room,The mysterious winner purchased the ticket at seven-oh-seven last night.
116986,452,128,484000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,Seven-oh-seven? That's exactly the moment I was furious at you for missing our toast. And now I'm the one who has to ask... Can you forgive me?
116987,452,129,495000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,I'll try.
148631,452,130,496000,Homer's Thoughts,Hospital Room,"Wait... if I tell Marge I won, she'll know I was buying the ticket when I was supposed to be onstage with her. I'm rich and I can't even tell my own wife!"

116988,452,132,514000,Homer's Spirit,Hospital Room,"Wow, I do look pretty calm down there."

116997,452,141,569000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Barn, thanks for picking up the money for me."
116998,452,142,575000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, what should I buy first? Hitler's baseball? A mirror that gives me advice?"
116999,452,143,580000,Magic Mirror,Simpson Home,My advice is to buy Hitler's baseball.
117000,452,144,583000,Barney Gumble,Simpson Home,"Wait a minute, Homer! You can't spend any of that money or Marge will know you lied."
117001,452,145,588000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah.
117002,452,146,592000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge? What are you doing?
117003,452,147,594000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"The laundry. The machine's on the fritz, and we can't afford the four hundred dollars to fix it."
117004,452,148,602000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here I am a millionaire, and I can't even help the woman who gave birth to me."
117005,452,149,606000,Barney Gumble,Simpson Home,"Why don't you just buy things your family needs, and leave them where they'll find them?"
117006,452,150,612000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Barney, that's brilliant! Just for that, you can help yourself to anything from this tree."
117007,452,151,617000,Barney Gumble,Simpson Home,That's not the money tree.
117008,452,152,619000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I know. It's where I hide my adult magazines.
116889,452,155,634000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"All right, it's all hooked up."
117011,452,157,640000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,This isn't normal TV. It's a videogame that encourages activity and exercise!
117012,452,158,646000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Please, at least try the tennis game."
117013,452,159,652000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,My puppet -- with this wand I control it how? By jumping?
117014,452,160,656000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,You use the wand like a tennis racket to hit an invisible ball.
117015,452,161,661000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Look at me! I'm big Bill Tilden!
117016,452,162,665000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,I think I'm lookin' at a poop later.
117018,452,164,673000,Homer Simpson,Park,"Catch, boy!"
117019,452,165,677000,Homer Simpson,Park,Oops -- the Frisbee went into the bushes. Why don't you go find it?
117020,452,166,681000,Bart Simpson,Park,"You threw it, you go find it."
117021,452,167,683000,Homer Simpson,Park,Why you little...
117022,452,168,683000,Bart Simpson,Park,Ow! There's a big box in here!
117023,452,169,688000,Homer Simpson,Park,A box? No way!
117024,452,170,691000,Homer Simpson,Park,A new washing machine? No way!
117025,452,171,694000,Marge Simpson,Park,That's just what we need! But how are we going to get it home?
117026,452,172,698000,Homer Simpson,Park,You go rent us a truck.
117027,452,173,703000,Bart Simpson,Park,Ow!
117029,452,175,757000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And now, Marge's secret benefactor is going to get her the luxury she's always dreamed of: a toaster wide enough for bagels. I'll just take out a little money from my ""local branch."""
117030,452,176,765000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hm. Not as much money as there used to be.
117031,452,177,773000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer?
117033,452,179,773000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you doing?
117034,452,180,775000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why... I'm just...
117037,452,183,786000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,There's money in this tree. What the hell is going on?
117038,452,184,790000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lenny... and Carl... A fortune cookie... I ran into the candy machine... and I found an Emerson, Lake, and Palmer..."
117039,452,185,798000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah, legitimately, but you're too scared to do anything fun with it?"
117040,452,186,816000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son, if I was interested in fun, I would've run away the day you were born."
117041,452,187,820000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look man, you've got to enjoy yourself a little. You work hard, or at least you're out of the house a lot."
117042,452,188,826000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're right. I have been acting like Telethon Jerry Lewis when I should've been acting like rest-of-the-year Jerry Lewis. Will you teach me how to put myself first?
117043,452,189,835000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And how.
117044,452,190,837000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Not so fast!
117046,452,192,840000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Don't forget my cut.
117047,452,193,842000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Um... your cut of what?
117048,452,194,843000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"I don't know. I just go around sayin' that, in the hope it'll be applicable. I'll be on my way now."
117049,452,195,849000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,On my way.
117052,452,198,856000,Bart Simpson,STAPLES CENTER-TYPE ARENA,Wait!
117053,452,199,857000,Bart Simpson,STAPLES CENTER-TYPE ARENA,I have to go to the bathroom!

117059,452,205,874000,Chris Martin,STAPLES CENTER-TYPE ARENA,Yeah. Come on up. You can play the tambourine.
117060,452,206,876000,Homer Simpson,STAPLES CENTER-TYPE ARENA,"I said someone like me, I didn't say me."

117080,452,226,948000,Bart Simpson,ZERO-G JET,"Rich kids don't need school! When I grow up, you can buy an apartment building and make me the super."
117081,452,227,953000,Homer Simpson,ZERO-G JET,"With that attitude, you'll never super in one of my buildings!"
117082,452,228,956000,Homer Simpson,ZERO-G JET,"Boy, I am through spoiling you. First thing tomorrow you're going back to the rotten life you've always enjoyed."

117088,452,234,992000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Why is the TV back on? What happened to the videogame?
117089,452,235,995000,Nurse,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, the videogame. You'd think it'd be dishwasher-safe, but it wasn't."
117090,452,236,999000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Why would you put it in the dishwasher?
117091,452,237,1005000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,You ruined it on purpose. You want the old folks to be zombies -- because it makes your jobs easier!
117092,452,238,1010000,2nd Nurse,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Ooh, excuse us. We tried to make the worst job in the world easier."
117093,452,239,1016000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well, I agree it's not the most pleasant job in the world, but..."
117094,452,240,1019000,Nurse,Springfield Retirement Castle,Don't forget the low pay and the constant presence of death.
117095,452,241,1021000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well, you still should have let them have their fun!"
117096,452,242,1023000,Nurse,Springfield Retirement Castle,They should've had their fun before they got here.

117101,452,247,1036000,Bart Simpson,Dining Room,"No problem. I'll just sit here, closer to Mom's ear. Mom, how do you think we really got that Panini Press?"
117102,452,248,1043000,Marge Simpson,Dining Room,I thought the government sent it to us as part of the stimulus package. At least that's what the letter said.
117103,452,249,1051000,Bart Simpson,Dining Room,"Well actually, Mom--"
117105,452,250,1052000,Homer Simpson,Dining Room,"Um, on second thought, boy, why don't you take my chair?"
117106,452,251,1057000,Marge Simpson,Dining Room,"So Bart, how's your big school presentation coming along?"
117107,452,252,1061000,Bart Simpson,Dining Room,"Oh great, now that Dad's gonna star in it."

117132,452,277,1138000,Bart Simpson,Streets Of Springfield,"Hey, hey, hey. Let's not get crazy. If you quit, I'm telling Mom everything."
117133,452,278,1143000,Homer Simpson,Streets Of Springfield,Not if I tell her first.
117134,452,279,1148000,Bart Simpson,Streets Of Springfield,Now how am I supposed to get to soccer practice?
