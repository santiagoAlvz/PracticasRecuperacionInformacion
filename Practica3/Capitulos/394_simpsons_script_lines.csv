102195,394,1,150000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR HOMER / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!
102196,394,2,158000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't have to make a wish, because I already have this wonderful family. I wish for infinity hamburgers."
102198,394,4,175000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I get it. These are those trick candles you can't blow out."
102199,394,5,181000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Dad, they're the opposite."
102200,394,6,183000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,E-Z Blo...
102201,394,7,183000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This ends now!
102203,394,9,196000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's okay, Homie. You're probably just tired from not doing anything all day."
102204,394,10,202000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-huh... uh-huh...
102205,394,11,203000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you're out of shape even for an American."
102207,394,12,206000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll just focus on one area... How many did I get? None? That's cool.
102209,394,14,243000,Flint Drywall,Simpson Home,"You know how many fires are started by birthday candles? If you do, tell me. It would settle a bet down at the station house. I say five, Gus says a million."
102210,394,15,251000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This disasterette was a real wake up call. We need to find a way to protect our irreplaceables!
102211,394,16,257000,Flint Drywall,Simpson Home,You could buy a fireproof safe.
102212,394,17,260000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Or we could just resolve to be more careful with our open flames.
102213,394,18,263000,Flint Drywall,Simpson Home,"Sir, we've been here six times this month."
102214,394,19,265000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but uh-- One of those I dialed nine-one-one by mistake, but I was too embarrassed to admit it, so I set the house on fire. It feels good to tell the truth. No, I'm lying again, it feels bad."
102215,394,20,278000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, everyone gets to put one precious item in our fireproof safe. For me, it's the family photo album."
102216,394,21,289000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Aw. Our kids used to be so cute!
102217,394,22,292000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Used to?!
102218,394,23,293000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, deal with it."
102219,394,24,295000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's so hard to choose just one item worthy of the safe. So I made this elaborate decision tree, which in itself is worthy of preservation."
102220,394,25,305000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tick tock, sweetie."
102221,394,26,306000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I picked my Malibu Stacy hybrid convertible. It runs on her old makeup and out-of-style shoes.
102222,394,27,312000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm going with the cologne I wore on our first date.
102224,394,29,320000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm putting in my ""Catch A Rising Krusty"" doll!"
102225,394,30,326000,Krusty Doll,Simpson Home,"Where do the kids today get these band names? ""The Kinks?"" ""The Stones?"" Sounds like my last physical!"
102226,394,31,334000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,References.
102227,394,32,336000,Krusty Doll,Simpson Home,No! Wait! Don't--
102228,394,33,339000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Now we have nothing to worry about in the event of a fire except our lives.
102229,394,34,345000,Krusty Doll,Simpson Home,You see all these crazy new electronics? iPod... iTunes... I give up!
102231,394,36,359000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,What's that coming out of the safe?
102233,394,37,361000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"I don't know. Maybe the Krusty doll accidentally turned on the car's headlights, which focused on the cologne bottle, causing it to boil, and soon explode."
102234,394,38,368000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Dad, that's ridiculous."
102236,394,40,372000,Krusty Doll,Simpson Living Room,"What's the deal with this ""California pizza""? If I wanted cheese and fruit, I'd have to..."
102237,394,41,385000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Nooooo! It's gone! That family album was a record of my accomplishments -- it's like what a résumé is for a man.
102238,394,42,397000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"I agree, Mom, it's very sad. But we'll have to move on -- it's not like we can restage all our family photos."
102239,394,43,405000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Restage the photos?
102240,394,44,408000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Lisa, you fool! You've doomed us all!"
102241,394,45,412000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Noooo!
102244,394,48,434000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Okay, we're recreating our series finale party for ""Star Trek: Voyager."""
102245,394,49,442000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Living Room,Oh man. I thought I was strong enough to get through this again -- but I'm not.
102246,394,50,449000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, Captain Janeway! Your mission ended too soon! Too soon..."
102248,394,52,465000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Our new photos are back!
102250,394,54,472000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's why I got duplicates!
102251,394,55,475000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, there's my first saxophone recital!"
102252,394,56,478000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart looks so cute as a mighty oak in the school play!
102253,394,57,482000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here I am on the space shuttle, orbiting Earth."
102254,394,58,485000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It sure was nice of NASA to send you up again.
102255,394,59,488000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh my God!
102256,394,60,490000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Check out what's happening behind your restaged anniversary dinner!
102257,394,61,493000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Duffman's on a date with Booberella!
102258,394,62,495000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,He's supposed to be in a stable long-term gay relationship!
102259,394,63,500000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This is a celebrity scandal! We could sell that photo to a tabloid.
102260,394,64,505000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And they pay big money for photos.
102261,394,65,508000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge! This isn't like you.
102262,394,66,510000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it's just about what we need to pay for our fire damage."
102147,394,67,514000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Spooky.
102263,394,70,520000,Tabloid Editor,EDITOR'S OFFICE,"This is good. Real good! Like Lindsay Lohan looking drunk, high and bony. Click, click, career over, see ya in the gutter, freckles. Homer, I'll pay ya two hundred bucks. Bring me more snaps like this, and I'll make you a moderately wealthy man!"
102264,394,71,530000,Homer Simpson,EDITOR'S OFFICE,Moderately wealthy?
102265,394,72,533000,Thought Bubble Homer,EDITOR'S OFFICE,Wheeee -- I'm sort of rich! I can rent anything I want!
102266,394,73,538000,Homer Simpson,EDITOR'S OFFICE,That's quite an offer -- can I discuss it with my wife?
102267,394,74,540000,Tabloid Editor,EDITOR'S OFFICE,"Sure, why not?"
102268,394,75,541000,Homer Simpson,EDITOR'S OFFICE,Then I'll do it!
102270,394,77,548000,Little Boy,Aztec Theater,"Oh boy, I can't wait to see Krusty."
102271,394,78,551000,Little Girl,Aztec Theater,"Look, there's his chauffeur-driven Town Car!"
102272,394,79,557000,Krusty the Clown,Aztec Theater,Your head dinged my door panel.
102273,394,80,559000,Krusty the Clown,Aztec Theater,Jerks like you oughtta be shot!
102274,394,81,561000,Homer Simpson,Aztec Theater,Krusty! How 'bout a nice shot of you with the boy you injured?
102275,394,82,565000,Krusty the Clown,Aztec Theater,"Paparazzi?! Get lost, ya parasite!"
102276,394,83,568000,Homer Simpson,Aztec Theater,"How 'bout you, Gabbo?"

102278,394,85,572000,Homer Simpson,Aztec Theater,"Okay, how 'bout an autograph for my kids?"
102279,394,86,575000,Gabbo,Aztec Theater,"Well, when you put it that way... Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!"
102281,394,88,582000,Homer Simpson,Upscale Supermarket,"Okay boy, this is that snooty supermarket all the celebrities shop at. You're gonna help me ambush them. Look at this place. Imported beer? Seedless grapes? Chewing gum?"
102282,394,89,597000,Homer Simpson,Upscale Supermarket,The clown on this cereal box is just a person!
102283,394,90,600000,Bart Simpson,Upscale Supermarket,"There's the Rich Texan -- and his daughter, Paris Texan."
102284,394,91,604000,Paris Texan,Upscale Supermarket,"C'mon, baby -- barf for mama."
102285,394,92,606000,Homer Simpson,Upscale Supermarket,"Okay boy, do something annoying. But leave yourself room to build."
102286,394,93,611000,Bart Simpson,Upscale Supermarket,"Hey Paris, I saw a disgusting part of your body on the internet... your face!"
102287,394,94,616000,Paris Texan,Upscale Supermarket,I'm still breaking in this nose!
102289,394,96,633000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Look at those celebrities: I've met them all, and yet they don't even acknowledge my existence."
102290,394,97,639000,Betty White,Springfield Street,"Hello, Homer. Have you lost weight?"
102291,394,98,641000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Oh, like you care, Betty White."

102294,394,101,647000,Betty White,Springfield Street,I was talking about your baby.
102295,394,102,649000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Oh, uh... she's looking very snappy!"
102296,394,103,651000,Betty White,Springfield Street,"Thanks for taking my picture! If you want me to sign it, here's a stamped, self-addressed envelope. And give Santa's Little Helper a big hug for me."
102297,394,104,661000,Betty White,Springfield Street,"Yeah, that's right, just walk away."
102299,394,106,668000,Drederick Tatum,PILLOWMINT HOTEL,"Beautiful day, isn't it, Freddie? God bless you and yours."
102300,394,107,671000,Bart Simpson,PILLOWMINT HOTEL,Dad! It's Drederick Tatum. Try to get him to punch you.
102301,394,108,674000,Homer Simpson,PILLOWMINT HOTEL,No problem. Hey Drederick!
102302,394,109,677000,Drederick Tatum,PILLOWMINT HOTEL,"Yes, how can I help you, my handsome friend?"
102303,394,110,679000,Homer Simpson,PILLOWMINT HOTEL,Your hip hop CD was boastful and unnecessary!
102304,394,111,682000,Drederick Tatum,PILLOWMINT HOTEL,"Okay, here we go."
102305,394,112,698000,Drederick Tatum,PILLOWMINT HOTEL,That's what I think of the fourth estate!
102306,394,113,700000,Homer Simpson,PILLOWMINT HOTEL,What are the first three?
102307,394,114,702000,Drederick Tatum,PILLOWMINT HOTEL,"Nobility, clergy and commoners. Learn your French history!"

102311,394,118,711000,Tabloid Editor,The Springfield Inquisitor Offices,What the hell did you do that for?
102312,394,119,713000,Homer Simpson,The Springfield Inquisitor Offices,I wanted to remember my place in the book I was reading.
102314,394,121,719000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boy, I never thought I'd have my own dark room."
102315,394,122,722000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, but why does it have to be in my bedroom?"
102316,394,123,725000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lis, you can't stay here if you're gonna keep talking."
102317,394,124,728000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's eleven at night and I can't get to sleep!
102318,394,125,730000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, then you could come over here and help daddy pour chemicals."
102319,394,126,735000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay.
102321,394,128,741000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Kids. They always say they're not tired when they're the most tired of all.
102324,394,130,748000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,That photo's mine. That photo's mine. That photo's mine.
102325,394,131,752000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, I do like the extra money. But I think maybe you should stop exploiting human beings' private misfortunes."
102326,394,132,759000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"See Marge, everyone says they hate these magazines, but it's impossible to set them down."
102327,394,133,764000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, it is not! Watch me."
102329,394,135,776000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Sideshow Mel is in a custody battle? And it's turning bitter?
102330,394,136,781000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,If you read one more thing it is a purchase.
102331,394,137,783000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Experts disagree on location of Heaven?!
102332,394,138,786000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Purchase!
102335,394,141,792000,Lisa Simpson,Helicopter,"Okay, this is the place."

102337,394,143,802000,Lisa Simpson,Helicopter,No! Should I attach it for you?
102338,394,144,807000,Homer Simpson,Helicopter,If you don't mind!

102343,394,149,827000,Homer Simpson,WATERFALL,"Up, up, and annoy!"
102345,394,151,832000,Homer Simpson,WATERFALL,I also wreck bar mitzvahs!
102346,394,152,835000,Rose Quimby,WATERFALL,Is that horrible man gone yet?
102347,394,153,838000,Mayor Joe Quimby,WATERFALL,"Yes, mother, barring some sort of pendulum effect."
102349,394,155,843000,Homer Simpson,WATERFALL,"First Amendment rules, privacy drools!"
102350,394,156,848000,Rainier Wolfcastle,WATERFALL,Time to squash that shutterbug.
102351,394,157,850000,MARIA SHRIVER KENNEDY QUIMBY,WATERFALL,You promised me one day where you wouldn't swear revenge on someone!
102352,394,158,855000,Rainier Wolfcastle,WATERFALL,Promise revoked.
102355,394,161,861000,Rainier Wolfcastle,CELEBRITY MANSION,"Greetings, famous faces and sizzling stars."
102357,394,163,866000,Rainier Wolfcastle,CELEBRITY MANSION,"Thank you for responding to my e-vite. Krusty, your response was the least funny."
102359,394,164,872000,Krusty the Clown,CELEBRITY MANSION,I'm a visual comedian. Did you get the j-peg?
102360,394,165,875000,Rainier Wolfcastle,CELEBRITY MANSION,Wouldn't open.
102362,394,167,877000,Rainier Wolfcastle,CELEBRITY MANSION,"I wish to discuss our mutual enemy, Homer Simpson."
102364,394,169,881000,Rainier Wolfcastle,CELEBRITY MANSION,"Now do not worry. In my film ""A Future Droid in King Arthur's Court,"" I learned that it takes a Robo Knight to defeat a Robo Knight."
102366,394,171,890000,Rainier Wolfcastle,CELEBRITY MANSION,"And to defeat a paparazzo, it takes this man!"
102368,394,173,896000,Rainier Wolfcastle,CELEBRITY MANSION,Let me introduce the world's greatest celebrity shutterbug: Enrico Irritazio.
102369,394,174,903000,Enrico Irritazio,CELEBRITY MANSION,Buongiorno!
102370,394,175,905000,The Rich Texan,CELEBRITY MANSION,"How are you gonna help us, Beefaroni?"
102371,394,176,908000,Enrico Irritazio,CELEBRITY MANSION,"Allow me to explain. I take embarrassing pictures of Homer -- harass him day and night. Justice will be served, and I will be a god in your eyes!!!"
102373,394,178,921000,Rainier Wolfcastle,CELEBRITY MANSION,"See, it is good. I declare this meeting adjourned! Now please, take some sushi. Because if I give it to the dogs, they will think ""oh, now I get sushi all the time."" And I am not made of sushi."
102375,394,180,935000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,"Now Maggie, I had to use your car seat to hold the new TV Guide...so I'm gonna hang you from the mirror."
102377,394,182,952000,Enrico Irritazio,Parking Lot,Smile!
102378,394,183,955000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,"He's trying to make me look like a bad father. Maggie, take the wheel!"
102379,394,184,960000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,"Ten and two, Einstein!"
102380,394,185,967000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,Can't I even have privacy here?!
102382,394,187,979000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Street,Scandalous!
102383,394,188,980000,C. Montgomery Burns,Street,Repugnant!
102384,394,189,981000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Street,Ausgezeichnet!
102385,394,190,982000,Sideshow Mel,Street,I shall make this photo into my screensaver! Somehow.
102387,394,192,988000,Homer Simpson,TABLOID EDITOR'S OFFICE,How could you publish this? I thought we were friends!
102392,394,193,991000,Tabloid Editor,TABLOID EDITOR'S OFFICE,"I have no friends! Friends take time! And time is money! And money pays for things! Like a manicure! And a boiled egg! Get me one of each! But not boiled, poached! Ah, what the hell, it's Friday--scrambled! Sometimes I wish I had a twin. Not that much, though. We'd just fight."
102394,394,195,1002000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And then he said he didn't want a twin because they'd just fight.
102395,394,196,1006000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetie, maybe it's time you retired from paparazzing. It's never fun to get a taste of your own medicine."
102396,394,197,1014000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're right -- I'm giving up photography...
102397,394,198,1015000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And my own medicine!
102398,394,199,1018000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So long, anti-clotting agent!"
102399,394,200,1020000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Clot-clot-clot-clot-clot!
102402,394,203,1028000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Club,"With Homer Simpson out of the way, we can go back to our lives of sybaritic excess."
102403,394,204,1033000,Waitress,Club,Stem cell fajita?
102404,394,205,1035000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Club,Leave the tray.
102406,394,207,1046000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Listen to 'em. They're on top of the world while I'm sittin' here pretending I have a stool.
102407,394,208,1051000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,All because of a bunch of stuff that happened.
102408,394,209,1054000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, don't be so quick to abandon this paparazzo thing."
102409,394,210,1058000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, it's an American tradition to cut people down to size because they've brought so much joy into our lives."
102410,394,211,1063000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"You know who I can't stand? That Robin Williams. Y'know one time I saw him eating dinner with his children, he wouldn't take the time out to do all the funny bits from his movies."
102411,394,212,1073000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"And my sister once saw Burt Reynolds at an airport, and he wouldn't even co-sign her mortgage."
102412,394,213,1077000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,You guys are right -- I should get back in the game. But I threw away my camera.
102413,394,214,1082000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Uh here, use this one."
