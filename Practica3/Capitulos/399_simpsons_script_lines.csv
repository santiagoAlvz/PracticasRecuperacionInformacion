103511,399,33,170000,Kiefer Sutherland,Simpson Home,"The following takes place between two thirty-four p.m. and three oh-four p.m. Or maybe it's a.m. Whichever one is the morning one, it's not that one."
103514,399,35,181000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Apu, I'm returning a yogurt I wasn't a hundred per cent satisfied with."
103515,399,36,188000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh my God, if a dead fish and a homeless person had a baby, and the baby puked, and a dog ate the puke, this smells like the rear end of that dog! I'll give you any yogurt in the store, just take that thing with you when you go!"
103516,399,37,204000,Jimbo Jones,Kwik-E-Mart,Let's spit in the coffee pots.

103522,399,43,217000,Jimbo Jones,Kwik-E-Mart,That yogurt is toxic! It's just what we've been looking for!
103523,399,44,225000,DOLPH,Kwik-E-Mart,Now this crossword's nothin' but swears.
103525,399,46,230000,Seymour Skinner,Kwik-E-Mart,"We've got what we need -- Milhouse, bring them in."
103526,399,47,233000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,Roger that.
103527,399,48,236000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,"And Lisa, if I don't make it back, there's a letter in my locker I want you to read."
103528,399,49,241000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,I already read it.
103529,399,50,242000,Seymour Skinner,Kwik-E-Mart,We've all read it.
103530,399,51,244000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Wait, Milhouse -- hold your position. Something doesn't add up."
103531,399,52,247000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Look what the bullies could have stolen...
103532,399,53,249000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Big Chief Rotten Cheeks Chewing Tobacco...a take-a-penny tray with a quarter in it!
103533,399,54,256000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,So why steal the yogurt? We have to find out what they're up to.
103534,399,55,260000,Seymour Skinner,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hmmmm... Milhouse, change of plan -- observe and follow."
103535,399,56,264000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,Permission to buy a Hostess fruit pie to keep my strength up?
103536,399,57,267000,Seymour Skinner,Kwik-E-Mart,Denied.
103538,399,59,273000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey Milhouse, who're you spying on? Those bullies?"
103540,399,61,283000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Kwik-E-Mart,What about the fat guy?
103541,399,62,284000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey, lay off -- you're the fat one of you guys!"
103542,399,63,287000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Kwik-E-Mart,I'm bulking up for football.
103543,399,64,291000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,I'm still alive! You call that playing to win?!
103545,399,66,304000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,"Mr. Simpson, I'm scared."
103547,399,67,306000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"This is our life now, Milhouse. We're dumpster folk."
103549,399,69,311000,Lisa Simpson,CTU,I've lost Milhouse.
103550,399,70,312000,Seymour Skinner,CTU,He'll be somewhat missed.
103551,399,71,316000,Seymour Skinner,CTU,Whom do we send now?
103553,399,73,320000,Lisa Simpson,CTU,"Principal Skinner, you know we have only one agent who stands a chance with those bullies. My brother."
103554,399,74,331000,Seymour Skinner,CTU,"Lord, give me guidance. That's right, the guidance department -- detention room. Thank you, Mrs. Lord."
103556,399,76,352000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,All out! I can't make my famous raisin sponge-cake without raisins! Kids love the zing of raisins!
103558,399,78,367000,Bart Simpson,DETENTION ROOM,"If I help you, I want full immunity for all pranks past and future, and you have to teach me a swear word I don't already know."
103559,399,79,375000,Seymour Skinner,DETENTION ROOM,No deal.
103560,399,80,377000,Bart Simpson,DETENTION ROOM,"Okay, suit yourself -- it's not like you have any major events coming up that the bullies would want to disrupt."
103561,399,81,383000,Seymour Skinner,DETENTION ROOM,The bake sale!
103562,399,82,386000,Lisa Simpson,DETENTION ROOM,"Principal Skinner, as we both know, but you might need reminding, the annual bake sale provides ninety percent of the school's funding."
103563,399,83,393000,Seymour Skinner,DETENTION ROOM,"Okay, you have a deal, you conniving little..."
103564,399,84,399000,Bart Simpson,DETENTION ROOM,"Wow, that's a swear?"
103565,399,85,401000,Seymour Skinner,DETENTION ROOM,Used as a noun it is.
103566,399,86,402000,Bart Simpson,DETENTION ROOM,Sweet. Now I'm gonna need some wheels.
103567,399,87,405000,Seymour Skinner,DETENTION ROOM,"Yes, of course -- I think we can wrangle you a used bicycle. Do you prefer Schwinn or Huffy? Bart? Where did he-- My car keys!"
103570,399,90,415000,Jimbo Jones,BULLIES' HIDEOUT,"Roadkill, burnt hair, my sister's retainer case, six weeks of bottled farts, possum placenta, sweat from a walk-around Goofy suit. And finally, ""T.C.B.Y."": that container of botulized yogurt. Okay everyone, masks on."
103571,399,91,441000,Jimbo Jones,BULLIES' HIDEOUT,"Gentlemen, we've created the mother of all stink bombs."
103573,399,93,447000,DOLPH,BULLIES' HIDEOUT,Most satisfactory.
103574,399,94,451000,Jimbo's Mom,BULLIES' HIDEOUT,"Jimbo, sweetie, I have to run to the bank. Are you boys gonna be okay alone?"
103575,399,95,454000,Jimbo Jones,BULLIES' HIDEOUT,"Put a top on, Mom! Everyone's seen your implants."
103576,399,96,458000,Jimbo's Mom,BULLIES' HIDEOUT,But the doctor said the air will help them--
103577,399,97,459000,Jimbo Jones,BULLIES' HIDEOUT,Just go!
103578,399,98,462000,DOLPH,BULLIES' HIDEOUT,"Lookin' good, Carol!"
103579,399,99,487000,Marge Simpson,BULLIES' HIDEOUT,I saw it first! / You are such a liar!
103580,399,100,492000,Marge Simpson,BULLIES' HIDEOUT,You give that to me!
103582,399,102,520000,Ralph Wiggum,JIMBO'S BASEMENT,Must... escape.
103583,399,103,527000,Jimbo Jones,JIMBO'S BASEMENT,Springfield Elementary is about to be Stinkfield Elementary.
103585,399,105,538000,Bart Simpson,JIMBO'S HOUSE,"Lisa, they're gonna put a stink bomb in the school! I might be able to stop them, but I'll need a schematic of Jimbo's house."
103586,399,106,544000,Lisa Simpson,JIMBO'S HOUSE,Jimbo drew a couple of pictures of his house in second grade. But I can't vouch for their accuracy -- the teacher gave him a frowny-face.
103588,399,108,555000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,JIMBO'S BASEMENT (END SPLIT-SCREEN),I'm so proud of us.
103589,399,109,560000,Jimbo Jones,JIMBO'S BASEMENT (END SPLIT-SCREEN),You got Jimbo.
103590,399,110,561000,Martin Prince,JIMBO'S BASEMENT (END SPLIT-SCREEN),"They're on to you, Jimbo! Get out of there! Scram!"
103591,399,111,564000,Martin Prince,JIMBO'S BASEMENT (END SPLIT-SCREEN),"--bled eggs would be lovely for breakfast, mother. Just go! Quickly!"
103592,399,112,569000,Jimbo Jones,JIMBO'S BASEMENT (END SPLIT-SCREEN),"We're busted! Thanks, mole. Now make your split screen vanish!"
103593,399,113,573000,Martin Prince,JIMBO'S BASEMENT (END SPLIT-SCREEN),Will do!
103596,399,116,581000,Bart Simpson,JIMBO'S HOUSE,"Dammit, these blueprints are all wrong! Where's the roller coaster room? And the shark tank?"
103598,399,118,603000,Bart Simpson,BASEMENT,"Son of a beach ball, they're gone!"
103600,399,120,609000,Bart Simpson,BASEMENT,"I've got a man down! Well, not a man. A very special boy."
103601,399,121,615000,Jack Bauer,BASEMENT,"Chloe, I need those schematics now!"
103602,399,122,617000,Bart Simpson,BASEMENT,What? Who is this?
103603,399,123,618000,Jack Bauer,BASEMENT,"I'm Jack Bauer, who the hell are you?"
103604,399,124,620000,Bart Simpson,BASEMENT,"Me? Uh, I'm... Ahmed Adoody."
103605,399,125,620000,Jack Bauer,BASEMENT,"Chloe, find out all you can about Ahmed Adoody. Does anyone there know Ahmed Adoody?"
103606,399,126,629000,Chloe O'Brien,BASEMENT,"Ahmed Adoody, wealthy Saudi financier. Disappeared into Afghanistan in the late nineties."
101702,399,127,632000,Jack Bauer,BASEMENT,Really?
103513,399,128,632000,Chloe O'Brien,BASEMENT,"No, Jack, it's a joke name. You're being set up!"
103546,399,129,636000,Jack Bauer,BASEMENT,Dammit!
103608,399,132,643000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now let's see, twenty minutes at three hundred degrees is the equivalent of five minutes at... twelve hundred degrees."
103609,399,133,652000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Now to make the folded index card that goes in front of the cake.
103611,399,135,674000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Pink frosting fixes everything!
103613,399,137,681000,Homer Simpson,DUMPSTER,"Say, is your butt numb from all this vibrating? Mine is. Still, I wouldn't describe it as unpleasant. Well, let's get some shut-eye."
103614,399,138,692000,Homer Simpson,DUMPSTER,"Ooh, it's that bar I like! Wait here in the car."
103615,399,139,696000,Milhouse Van Houten,DUMPSTER,Ow!
103617,399,141,700000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, this might hurt a little. No problem."
103618,399,142,705000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, sweet mother of Mary!"
103619,399,143,712000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, Milhouse, what do you want to do?"
103620,399,144,714000,Milhouse Van Houten,Moe's Tavern,"Well, the school's having a bake sale."
103621,399,145,715000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Ol' Betsy'll get us there.
103623,399,147,723000,Cosine,CTU,We are projecting an effective stink radius farther than any of us can kick a kickball.
103625,399,149,728000,Lisa Simpson,CTU,"Sir, we have to call off this bake sale, now!"
103626,399,150,731000,Seymour Skinner,CTU,"Yes, yes, yes. We have to do something. Although, the basketball hoops have been retracted... D.J. Funtimes has already cashed his deposit... And Superintendent Chalmers won't be happy to hear..."
103627,399,151,743000,Gary Chalmers,CTU,"I won't be happy to hear what, Seymour?"
103628,399,152,745000,Seymour Skinner,CTU,Um... that uh... bake sale revenue projections are through the roof.
103629,399,153,749000,Gary Chalmers,CTU,I'm very happy to hear that. You don't know me at all!
103630,399,154,754000,Lisa Simpson,CTU,"We have to find those bullies before the bake sale starts. Martin, run a top-down search on the school security grid."
103631,399,155,760000,Martin Prince,CTU,Will do -- and you chose the perfect person!
103632,399,156,770000,Martin Prince,CTU,The stink bomb! I can't let anyone see it!
103633,399,157,774000,Lisa Simpson,CTU,"Martin, anything?"
103634,399,158,775000,Martin Prince,CTU,I wish! This is as boring as mainstream cinema.
103636,399,160,780000,Lisa Simpson,CTU,So true.
103637,399,161,800000,Homer Simpson,CTU,Cops! Act natural!
103638,399,162,804000,Homer Simpson,CTU,"Hello, Officer!"
103639,399,163,806000,Chief Wiggum,CTU,"Afternoon, ma'am. What is it about a woman in a dumpster?"
103642,399,166,827000,Milhouse Van Houten,Street,Wait! Mr. Simpson!
103643,399,167,839000,Marge Simpson,Street,My cake!
103646,399,170,857000,Jimbo Jones,VENTILATION ROOM,They're gonna wish the bake sale was a nose-plug sale!
103647,399,171,860000,DOLPH,VENTILATION ROOM,And it totally isn't!
103649,399,173,865000,Groundskeeper Willie,VENTILATION ROOM,Teens? In Willie's hidey hole?! I'll mop up your blood from the inside!
103652,399,176,880000,Lisa Simpson,CTU,We have a fire alarm in the ventilation room!
103653,399,177,882000,Martin Prince,CTU,I'll check it out!
103655,399,179,891000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"SKIP, SKIP, SKIP TO MY LOU... Top of the morning, Nelson."
103656,399,180,894000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"And to you, Martin."
103657,399,181,895000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"SKIP TO MY LOU, MY DARLING..."
103658,399,182,897000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey Nelson, what gives? Martin just skipped past you singing ""Skip to my Lou,"" and you did nothing!"
103659,399,183,904000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Can't a guy enjoy a catchy tune?
103660,399,184,910000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I'm unclear on what you want!
103661,399,185,915000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Is Martin working for Jimbo?!
103662,399,186,919000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Yes!
103663,399,187,922000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Yes what?
103664,399,188,925000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Yes sir.
103665,399,189,928000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Lisa... are you on a secure line?
103666,399,190,930000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I am. You're on a Bluetooth cell phone, the most vulnerable device known to man."
103667,399,191,935000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"But it looks so cool. Listen, there's a mole inside CTU."
103668,399,192,938000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,A mole?!
103669,399,193,939000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, a mole. Now I don't have much time, so I'm just gonna come right out and say his name, so get ready to know his name. His name is the following: M--"
103670,399,194,949000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"SKIP, SKIP, SKIP TO MY LOU..."
103672,399,196,956000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"Rice Krispie Treats? Way to phone it in, Sarah Wiggum!"
103673,399,197,960000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"Excuse me, excuse me, I'm in the sale! I'm in the sale!"
103675,399,199,966000,Martin Prince,VENTILATION ROOM,"Okay, I kept my end of the deal. Release my friends."
103676,399,200,973000,Martin Prince,VENTILATION ROOM,"All here, from Asimov to Zarathustra... where's Phobos?!"
103677,399,201,978000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,VENTILATION ROOM,He's with us now.
103679,399,203,982000,Jimbo Jones,VENTILATION ROOM,We're outta here. Smell you later.
103680,399,204,984000,DOLPH,VENTILATION ROOM,Three minutes later to be exact.
103681,399,205,991000,Martin Prince,VENTILATION ROOM,What have I done?
103683,399,207,1017000,Marge Simpson,GYMNASIUM,"Raisin cake! Who wants raisin cake? Don't worry, it's not too moist!"
103684,399,208,1026000,Homer Simpson,GYMNASIUM,Can I have some more money?
103685,399,209,1029000,Marge Simpson,GYMNASIUM,I gave you ten dollars.
103686,399,210,1030000,Homer Simpson,GYMNASIUM,All the other moms gave their husbands twenty.
103687,399,211,1033000,Marge Simpson,GYMNASIUM,Well all the other husbands don't come home dirty from fighting.
103688,399,212,1037000,Homer Simpson,GYMNASIUM,"I had to fight! Lenny said his dad is Hulk Hogan, and I know he's not!"
103689,399,213,1041000,Marge Simpson,GYMNASIUM,Here's five more dollars.
103692,399,216,1046000,Lisa Simpson,CTU,"Bart, are you all right? Bart?"
103693,399,217,1048000,Bart Simpson,CTU,"Hey, I'm fine -- They haven't made a French horn yet that can hurt me. Now, I'm sending you a picture of the bomb."
103694,399,218,1057000,Lisa Simpson,CTU,"My God, that's a class-five stench-dispersal unit! We have to short out that fan."
103695,399,219,1066000,Bart Simpson,CTU,"""HDW"". What's that?"
103696,399,220,1066000,Groundskeeper Willie,CTU,That's the main valve of the hot dog water recirculation system. There's over thirty years of wiener soakings in there.
103697,399,221,1076000,Bart Simpson,CTU,"Lis, you have to release that water. It's the only way to short out the fan."
103698,399,222,1080000,Lisa Simpson,CTU,But you and Willie will drown!
103699,399,223,1082000,Seymour Skinner,CTU,"Possibly, but I can't risk Superintendent Chalmers finding out about--"
103700,399,224,1085000,Gary Chalmers,CTU,"Finding out about what, Seymour?"
103701,399,225,1086000,Seymour Skinner,CTU,Um... about how early press coverage of the bake sale is uniformly positive.
103702,399,226,1091000,Gary Chalmers,CTU,"Once again, you have thoroughly misgauged my response. This is going on your permanent record."
103705,399,228,1105000,Bart Simpson,VENTILATION ROOM,The hot dog water's gonna push us into the fan!
