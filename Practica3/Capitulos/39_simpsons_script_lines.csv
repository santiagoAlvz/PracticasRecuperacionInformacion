2052,39,43,200000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Oh, licking envelopes can be fun! All you have to do is make a game of it."
2053,39,44,203000,Bart Simpson,Skinner's Office,What kind of game?
2054,39,45,205000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Well... for example... you could see how many you can lick in an hour, and then try to break that record."

2062,39,53,247000,Troy McClure,CHOCOLATE FACTORY ORIENTATION ROOM,"In those days, instead of being wrapped in a hygienic package, chocolate was wrapped in a tobacco leaf."
2063,39,54,253000,Troy McClure,CHOCOLATE FACTORY ORIENTATION ROOM,"And instead of being pure chocolate like we have today, it was mixed with shredded tobacco. And they didn't eat it. They smoked it."
2065,39,56,261000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"You didn't believe me when I said it would be fun, did you?"

2123,39,116,540000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,They're not mine. My boss said his warehouse was full.
2124,39,117,543000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, right. Son... I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you'll learn..."
2125,39,118,553000,Delivery Man,Simpson Home,Uh... Fat Tony sent me over to pick up the goods.
2126,39,119,555000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Right in here my man.

2131,39,123,569000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"We have... uh... Please, we have a number of leads. And let me assure all you smokers out there... there is no shortage of cigarettes."
2132,39,124,577000,Reporter,Simpson Home,How do we know that?
2133,39,125,579000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"All right, let me refer that question back to Jack Larson, of Laramie Tobacco Products. Jack?"
2134,39,126,583000,Jack Larson,Simpson Home,"Thank you Chief. Folks, I'm pleased to announce that a new truckload of Laramies with their smooth good taste and rich tobacco flavor is already heading towards Springfield. And the driver has been instructed to ignore all stop signs and crosswalks."

2136,39,128,604000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city. He is the cancer and I am the... uh... ... what cures cancer?
2137,39,129,611000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, is your boss a crook?"
2138,39,130,613000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think so. Although it would explain an awful lot.
2140,39,132,618000,Fat Tony,Club,Me and the boys wish to thank you for hanging onto this stuff for us.
2141,39,133,622000,Bart Simpson,Club,"Thanks... uh... Say, are you guys crooks?"
2142,39,134,627000,Fat Tony,Club,"Bart, um... is it wrong to steal a loaf of bread to feed your starving family?"
2143,39,135,632000,Bart Simpson,Club,No.
2144,39,136,633000,Fat Tony,Club,"Well, suppose you got a large starving family. Is it wrong to steal a truckload of bread to feed them?"
2145,39,137,638000,Bart Simpson,Club,Uh-uh.
2146,39,138,639000,Fat Tony,Club,"And what if your family don't like bread, they like cigarettes?"
2147,39,139,643000,Bart Simpson,Club,I guess that's okay.
2148,39,140,645000,Fat Tony,Club,"Now, what if instead of giving them away, you sold them at a price that was practically giving them away. Would that be a crime, Bart?"
2149,39,141,653000,Bart Simpson,Club,Hell no!
2150,39,142,655000,Fat Tony,Club,Enjoy your gift.

2157,39,148,682000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"A job's a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal."
2158,39,149,691000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Bart's been acting very strangely. And that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks."
2159,39,150,698000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How long does it take to deliver a pizza?
2161,39,152,701000,Fbi Agent #1,PIZZA DELIVERY TRUCK,Looks like our cover's blown.

2164,39,155,704000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,See? It was all your imagination.
2165,39,156,707000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I want you to go down to that club and talk to them. Just see what kind of people they are. Please, Homie?"
2166,39,157,715000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, all right."
2168,39,159,719000,Homer Simpson,Club,"Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read 'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes."

2175,39,166,737000,Fat Tony,Club,"Homer, you're a hellava father."
2177,39,168,740000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, what did you find out?"
2178,39,169,743000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding."
2180,39,171,747000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"More ""stink lines"" boys."
2181,39,172,751000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,What's this? What are you boys doing?

2185,39,176,773000,Fat Tony,Club,I don't know what happened. He's never late. Louie! Make up some Manhattans.
2186,39,177,777000,Louie,Club,But I only know how to make wine spritzers.
2187,39,178,779000,Fat Tony,Club,Now!
2188,39,179,787000,Rival Gang Leader,Club,"What have I done to deserve this flat, flavorless Manhattan?"
2189,39,180,800000,Rival Gang Leader,Club,"Come on, boys."
2156,39,181,803000,Fat Tony,Club,The kiss of death. That's all I need!
2190,39,182,810000,Bart Simpson,Club,Lousy Skinner.
2191,39,183,812000,Fat Tony,Club,You are late for work.
2192,39,184,814000,Bart Simpson,Club,Of course I'm late for work. How can I be on time when Principal Skinner keeps me after school?

2194,39,186,820000,Bart Simpson,Club,"He sure is, Patrone."

2197,39,189,832000,Secretary,Skinner's Office,"Some large men to see you, sir."
2198,39,190,834000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,I don't have an appointment with any large men --
2199,39,191,837000,Fat Tony,Skinner's Office,You Skinner?
2200,39,192,840000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"I'm PRINCIPAL Skinner, yes. And how, may I ask, did you get past the hall monitors?"
2202,39,194,850000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Children, I don't know how to break this to you, but Principal Skinner is... ... MISSING!"
2203,39,195,861000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Uh-oh.
2206,39,198,876000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,I thought I found him but it was only a cat.
2209,39,201,884000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Now please... Please, please, I can assure you we'll be using the most advanced, scientific techniques in the field of... body finding."

2223,39,215,936000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,That's not true! It's just a rumor! You're engaged in speculation. I know the law. You can't prove anything.
2225,39,217,951000,Skinner Body,Simpson Home,You killed me Bart.

2253,39,245,1058000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,That Simpson boy is looking at a hundred and eighty years.
2256,39,246,1061000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a ten-year-old child can be tried as an adult.
2258,39,248,1068000,Fat Tony,Courtroom,I didn't order this Skinner guy killed.
2259,39,249,1070000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,But aren't you the head of this gang?
2260,39,250,1072000,Fat Tony,Courtroom,"No, I just stop by the club occasionally to read the complimentary newspaper."
2261,39,251,1077000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,Then who is the Kingpin... the Capo de tuti Capi?
2262,39,252,1080000,Fat Tony,Courtroom,That's the guy.
2263,39,253,1081000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,Hey!
2264,39,254,1083000,Fat Tony,Courtroom,"Forgive me, Don Bartholomew."
2265,39,255,1085000,Louie,Courtroom,"We tried to stop the kid, but he wouldn't quit. It was like he went crazy."
2266,39,256,1089000,Legs,Courtroom,"Prostitution, loan sharking, numbers. The kid liked to wet his beak in everything."
2267,39,257,1096000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,"Mr. Simpson, you've been the boy's father for ten years. Do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous criminal syndicate?"
2268,39,258,1103000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it's true, it's true! All the pieces fit."
2269,39,259,1115000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"In light of the damning testimony from your fellow gangsters, your father, your teachers and a seemingly endless parade of emotionally shattered baby-sitters, this court has no choice but to..."
2270,39,260,1125000,Seymour Skinner,Courtroom,Stop!
2271,39,261,1125000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,Principal Skinner!
2272,39,262,1129000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,I thought he was dead.
2273,39,263,1130000,Seymour Skinner,Courtroom,"I suppose you're all wondering where I've been. It all started a week ago. I was at my desk, revising and updating the school dress codes, when..."
2275,39,265,1134000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,I was suddenly confronted by a gang of toughs acting on behalf of one Bart Simpson. Or so they said.
2276,39,266,1145000,Louie,Skinner's Office,We really think there's promise in the boy.
2277,39,267,1147000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Get out!
2278,39,268,1147000,Fat Tony,Skinner's Office,"Okay, okay, you don't have to yell."
2280,39,270,1150000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Garage,To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently.
2284,39,271,1161000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Garage,"For the next week I stayed alive by eating my mother's delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand. I made a game of it, seeing how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that record. Occasionally the police arrived to search my home."
2286,39,273,1177000,Chief Wiggum,Skinner Home,"Find anything this time, boys?"
2287,39,274,1179000,Lou,Skinner Home,"Nah... no sign of him, chief."

2289,39,276,1181000,Psychic,Skinner Home,I see nothing here but I'm afraid it's splitsville for Delta Burke and Major Dad.
2290,39,277,1185000,Chief Wiggum,Skinner Home,But they seemed so happy.
2291,39,278,1187000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"I shouted until I was hoarse, but they couldn't hear me."
2293,39,280,1190000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Garage,I'M IN HERE!!!
2294,39,281,1192000,Chief Wiggum,Skinner's Garage,"Well, let's go."
2295,39,282,1193000,Eddie,Skinner's Garage,"Okay, Chief."
2296,39,283,1195000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Garage,"Finally I realized if I was ever going to get out of there, I would have to do it myself."
2297,39,284,1199000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Garage,"I formed a crude rocket from a discarded cigar tube. And remembering an experiment from my days as a fourth grade science teacher, I concocted a fuel from baking soda and the juice of discarded lemon wedges."
2298,39,285,1210000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Garage,"The rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide, dragging behind it the end of a vacuum cleaner cord."
2299,39,286,1215000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Garage,"I grabbed on to the vacuum cleaner, pushed the cord retractor button and was on my way to freedom."
2301,39,288,1223000,Seymour Skinner,Courtroom,And that's my courageous story.
2302,39,289,1227000,Prosecuting Attorney,Courtroom,"Your Honor, the prosecution moves that Principal Skinner's testimony be stricken from the record."
2303,39,290,1231000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,Denied. Case dismissed.
2304,39,291,1234000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,"Your Honor, do I still get paid?"
2306,39,293,1239000,Fat Tony,Courthouse Steps,Hey Bart! I hope there are no hard feelings.
2307,39,294,1241000,Bart Simpson,Courthouse Steps,Get bent.
2308,39,295,1242000,Fat Tony,Courthouse Steps,"I deserved that. Look, I know we let you down, but me and the boys, we still think you've got a big future in racketeering and extortion."
2309,39,296,1251000,Bart Simpson,Courthouse Steps,"Sorry Fat Tony. I used to think your gang was cool, but now I learned that crime doesn't pay."
2254,39,297,1256000,Fat Tony,Courthouse Steps,"Yeah, you're right."

2313,39,301,1283000,Neil,Simpson Living Room,Shaddup!
2314,39,302,1284000,Neil,Simpson Living Room,"Where do you want it, Skinner?"
2315,39,303,1288000,Neil,Simpson Living Room,Not smart.
2316,39,304,1292000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Cool!
2317,39,305,1293000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Hey, when do we get the check for this?"
2318,39,306,1295000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us."
2319,39,307,1299000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers.
