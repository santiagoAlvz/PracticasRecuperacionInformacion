45917,198,80,398000,Gil Gunderson,IRS WAITING ROOM,"Oh, this is bad. This is really bad. You work and you slave and you steal just enough for a sweet lick of that shiny brass ring. Don't I get a lick? Doesn't Gil get a lick?"

45936,198,99,472000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. It goes all the way to the president."
45937,198,100,479000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"There you go, Ratboy."
45938,198,101,480000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Does this make me look fat?
45939,198,102,482000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, it makes you look like a tool of government oppression."
45940,198,103,485000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But not fat.
45942,198,105,488000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"So if my cover gets blown and I need help, what's the signal?"
45944,198,107,496000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, I see you're watchin' the ball game. Looks like a good one. Any of you involved in any illegal activity? Cause I could sure go for some."

45948,198,111,512000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Maybe. But first I need to hear about some other crimes to get me fired up.
45949,198,112,517000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,You mean like the time you was running moonshine out of your basement?
45950,198,113,521000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Or that telemarketing scam you pulled?
45951,198,114,523000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Uhhhh, like those. But involving you."
45952,198,115,527000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, you, you mean like the time Barney beat up George Bush."
45953,198,116,530000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Barney? That was me! And I'd do it again.
45954,198,117,534000,Charlie,Moe's Tavern,"Why stop there, Homer? My militia has a secret plan to beat up all sorts of government officials. That'll teach 'em to drag their feet on high-definition TV."
45955,198,118,543000,Agent Johnson,Moe's Tavern,You're under arrest for conspiracy.
45956,198,119,546000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, how did they finger Charlie? Somebody musta ratted him out."
45957,198,120,551000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, that's ridiculous, Moe. End transmission."
45959,198,122,558000,Agent Johnson,CITY PARK,My superiors were pleased with your work. You have a flair for treachery.
45960,198,123,562000,Homer Simpson,CITY PARK,"Well, I'm just glad it's all over."
45961,198,124,564000,Agent Johnson,CITY PARK,"Ohh, you're not through, Simpson. We have a high-risk assignment for you."
45962,198,125,568000,Homer Simpson,CITY PARK,"Why do you keep picking on me? Marge's name was on that tax return, too."
45963,198,126,573000,Agent Johnson,CITY PARK,Let's take a walk.
45964,198,127,574000,Homer Simpson,CITY PARK,Walk? That wasn't part of the deal.
45966,198,129,582000,Agent Johnson,Springfield Mall,We're here. Get in.
45967,198,130,586000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Mall,My shirt fell off.
45968,198,131,592000,Agent Johnson,Springfield Mall,"Mr. Simpson, please cover your ears while I say the secret access word. Cheese."

45971,198,134,610000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,Losers...
45972,198,135,612000,Agent Johnson,Springfield Mall,"Shut up, Simpson."
45973,198,136,613000,Mission Impossible Voice,Springfield Mall,"To ease this crisis, President Truman promised relief."
45974,198,137,617000,Truman,Springfield Mall,American tax dollars will help our allies who fought so poorly and surrendered so readily.
45976,198,139,626000,Mission Impossible Voice,Springfield Mall,"To make good on this drunken boast, Truman authorized the one-time printing of the largest denomination currency ever: a trillion-dollar bill."
45977,198,140,636000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,Ooh! A trillion-dollar bill? 'Atsa spicy meatball!
45978,198,141,645000,Mission Impossible Voice,Springfield Mall,The man chosen to deliver this precious cargo to Europe was America's wealthiest and therefore most trustworthy citizen... C. Montgomery Burns.
45980,198,143,661000,Mission Impossible Voice,FRENCH AIRPORT,"Unfortunately, the money never arrived."
45981,198,144,664000,British Official,FRENCH AIRPORT,"Well, this is a kick in the knickers."
45982,198,145,666000,Spanish Official,FRENCH AIRPORT,Should we complain to somebody?
45983,198,146,668000,French Official,FRENCH AIRPORT,"No! I say we just act snooty to Americans, forever!"
45984,198,147,673000,Spanish Official,FRENCH AIRPORT,I agree.
45985,198,148,674000,French Official,FRENCH AIRPORT,Heh!
45986,198,149,674000,Mission Impossible Voice,FRENCH AIRPORT,This film will self-destruct... if not properly stored.
45987,198,150,679000,Agent Johnson,FRENCH AIRPORT,"We believe Burns still has that bill hidden somewhere in his house. But all we've ascertained from satellite photos is that it's not on the roof. We're hoping that as his trusted employee, you can help lead us to it."
45989,198,151,691000,Homer Simpson,FRENCH AIRPORT,"But Mr. Burns gave me my job. And he hasn't fired me, even after three meltdowns and one China Syndrome. I can't betray him."
45990,198,152,699000,Agent Johnson,FRENCH AIRPORT,"I'm afraid you have no choice. And remember, this information is highly classified."
45991,198,153,708000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FRENCH AIRPORT,Cheeeese.
45992,198,154,710000,Mission Impossible Voice,FRENCH AIRPORT,"Good morning, Agent Johnson. The film you are about to see..."

45995,198,157,724000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Oh, stop fishing for compliments, Smithers. Go home to your can of mushroom soup."
45996,198,158,728000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"Sir, a kind word now and then..."
45997,198,159,730000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,I'm choking it down. Isn't that thanks enough?
45998,198,160,733000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,Sometimes I don't know why I bother.
45999,198,161,740000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,I'm in.
46000,198,162,752000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Now what, Smithers? I... You're not Smithers."
46001,198,163,755000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Uh, I'm Homer Simpson, your trusted employee."
46002,198,164,759000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Employee, eh? What a pleasant surprise."
46003,198,165,764000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Hmm... A pack of vicious dogs should be ripping you to pieces...
46004,198,166,769000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Uhh, I don't know what to tell you."
46005,198,167,771000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Very well, come on in. Perhaps I have something I can scald you with."
46006,198,168,779000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"It'll, uh, be a few minutes. So, what brings you to my home?"
46007,198,169,784000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Well, Mr. Burns, you always come off as kind of a gruff, crotchety loner, but we both know that deep down inside..."
46008,198,170,792000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Ya! Ha!
46009,198,171,794000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Still cold.
46010,198,172,795000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Hmm. Well, let me get you a towel."
46011,198,173,800000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Starting search for trillion-dollar bill.
46012,198,174,806000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"C'mon... Where are you?... Here, Trilly, Trilly."

46015,198,177,827000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Oh, I get it. I'm on to you."
46016,198,178,832000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"You're from Collier's magazine, aren't you? Are you going to put me in Star Snoop?"
46017,198,179,838000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Uh, yeah, sure. That thing."
45988,198,180,841000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Well, I won't go without a fight, wink, wink. Heh. Let me show you around."
46018,198,181,845000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,I hope you don't mind a little walking.
46019,198,182,850000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Well, of course, I didn't want a racehorse in my living room, but you don't say no to Spring Byington, do you?"
46020,198,183,856000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"No you don't. Heh, heh."
46021,198,184,859000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Heh, heh, heh. Heh, heh. Ohh, you'll find this amusing -- the suit Charlie Chaplin was buried in."
46022,198,185,863000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Ewww!
46023,198,186,864000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Here's a scoop for your readers: the Hall of Patriots.
46024,198,187,868000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,That intrepid lad is my great grandfather! Franklin Jefferson Burns. Tossing that tea without a care for what the caffeine would do to the Fenway Flounder.
46025,198,188,879000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Is that a fish?
46026,198,189,880000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,It was.
46027,198,190,881000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Hey, that guy looks like you."
46028,198,191,883000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Oh-ho, that's me all right, standing up against America's reckless, spendthrift politicians. It commemorates my liberation of a trillion dollars that would have been foolishly squandered."
46029,198,192,894000,Agent Johnson,Burns Manor,Let's move.
46030,198,193,897000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Is that the trillion-dollar bill in his hand?
46031,198,194,901000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Well, that would be pretty careless of me, wouldn't it? I keep the real bill right here."
46032,198,195,907000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Wowww, that must be worth a fortune."
46033,198,196,911000,Agent Johnson,Burns Manor,Nobody move!
46034,198,197,913000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,What the...?!

46036,198,199,919000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"I'm not the thief, the government is. Every year you make hard-working Joes like my reporter friend here pay income taxes, and for what? Aid to ungrateful foreigners, do-nothing nuclear missiles, tomb polish for some unknown soldier..."
46037,198,200,937000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Hey, he's right..."
46038,198,201,939000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,You crooks in Washington have...

46042,198,205,959000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Take that, Uncle Sam!"
46044,198,207,982000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Faster, Simpson! Those jack-booted G-men won't be far behind."
46045,198,208,986000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,We'll hide out at my place. I've got beer.
46046,198,209,988000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,No. We need help. And there's only one man who can get us out of a jam like this.
46048,198,211,993000,Waylon Smithers,Smithers's Apartment,You'll be swell! / You'll be great! / Gonna have the whole world on a plate...
46049,198,212,1001000,Waylon Smithers,Smithers's Apartment,"All right, all right. Keep your top on."
46050,198,213,1006000,Waylon Smithers,Smithers's Apartment,"Why, sir, what a pleasant..."
46052,198,215,1010000,C. Montgomery Burns,BURNS' BEARCAT,"...So now, our own government is hunting us down like a couple of common snow leopards."
46053,198,216,1015000,Waylon Smithers,BURNS' BEARCAT,"It's an outrage, sir."
46054,198,217,1018000,Agent Johnson,BURNS' BEARCAT,This is Agent Johnson from the FBI. Be on the lookout for a 1936 maroon Stutz Bearcat.
46055,198,218,1027000,Chief Wiggum,BURNS' BEARCAT,That really was more of a burgundy...
46056,198,219,1029000,Homer Simpson,BURNS' BEARCAT,"Ohh, we're never gonna make it. Let's just divide up the trillion now, and go our separate ways."
46057,198,220,1034000,Waylon Smithers,BURNS' BEARCAT,"Uhmm, I'm afraid we've got to get out of the country."
46058,198,221,1037000,C. Montgomery Burns,BURNS' BEARCAT,"Capital idea! Let's blow this fascist popsicle stand. We'll purchase a small island somewhere and start our own country, free from the relentless tyranny of Uncle Sam."
46059,198,222,1048000,Homer Simpson,BURNS' BEARCAT,But I can't leave the country! What about my wife and kids?
46060,198,223,1052000,Waylon Smithers,BURNS' BEARCAT,That can be shipped.
46062,198,225,1053000,Agent Johnson,Simpson Home,"Okay, kids, I want some answers. Where do you think your father would go with a trillion dollars?"
46063,198,226,1060000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,My Dad has a trillion dollars? Wow! I can buy and sell your sorry ass. I'll give you a billion dollars to empty the cat box for me.
46064,198,227,1067000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No! No, Bart! That money's going toward your college education."
46065,198,228,1072000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Who needs college, Mom. We're trillionaires! Let's buy dune buggies."
46068,198,231,1081000,C. Montgomery Burns,AIRCRAFT HANGAR,Contact!
46069,198,232,1083000,C. Montgomery Burns,AIRCRAFT HANGAR,"Remove the chocks, Simpson. Simpson?"
46072,198,235,1094000,C. Montgomery Burns,AIRCRAFT HANGAR,There's soda on the plane!
46075,198,238,1100000,Agent Johnson,Burns's Plane,Attention fugitives. You are leaving U.S. jurisdiction. Turn back immediately or we will be unable to prosecute you.
46076,198,239,1106000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Plane,We'd better do what he says.
46077,198,240,1108000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Plane,"No, wait! We're now over international waters."
46078,198,241,1111000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Plane,Woo hoo! We can gamble!
46079,198,242,1113000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Plane,Yes!

46084,198,247,1123000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Plane,Any of these islands would make a fine new country.
46085,198,248,1125000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Plane,I call President!
46086,198,249,1125000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Plane,Vice President!
46088,198,251,1128000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Plane,"Ooo, there's a big one. And it has freedom written all over it."
46089,198,252,1133000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Plane,"Sir, that's Cuba."
46090,198,253,1136000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Plane,"Cuba, eh? Take her down, Smithers."
46091,198,254,1138000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Plane,"Uh, you're flying the plane, sir."
46092,198,255,1141000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Plane,Excellent.
46094,198,257,1144000,C. Montgomery Burns,Havana International Airport,"Sorry about the landing, boys. This fog is so thick I can't see my own cataracts."
46095,198,258,1153000,Customs Official,Havana International Airport,Purpose of visit?
46097,198,260,1160000,Homer Simpson,Havana,"Oh, you're gonna love it in Cuba, Marge. There's shredded pork everywhere."

46099,198,262,1166000,Homer Simpson,Havana,Nice to meet you.

46102,198,265,1190000,C. Montgomery Burns,Taxi,"So, you say Batista's gone? Did you know that?"
46103,198,266,1194000,Homer Simpson,Taxi,I had no idea.
46104,198,267,1195000,C. Montgomery Burns,Taxi,"Well in that case, just take us to whoever's in charge."
46107,198,270,1200000,Castro,PRESIDENTIAL PALACE,"Comrades, our nation is completely bankrupt. We have no choice but to abandon Communism."
46109,198,272,1207000,Castro,PRESIDENTIAL PALACE,"I know, I know, I know. But we all knew from day one this mumbo-jumbo wouldn't fly."
46111,198,274,1214000,Castro,PRESIDENTIAL PALACE,I call Washington and tell them they won.
46112,198,275,1217000,Cuban Undersecretary,PRESIDENTIAL PALACE,"But Presidente, America tried to kill you."
46113,198,276,1220000,Castro,PRESIDENTIAL PALACE,"Ah, they're not so bad. They even named a street after me in San Francisco."
46115,198,278,1227000,Castro,PRESIDENTIAL PALACE,It's full of what!?
46116,198,279,1229000,Guard,PRESIDENTIAL PALACE,"Presidente, three men are here to see you. They claim to have a trillion-dollar bill."
46117,198,280,1234000,Castro,PRESIDENTIAL PALACE,Ay Caramba!
46119,198,282,1236000,C. Montgomery Burns,CASTRO'S PRIVATE OFFICE,"Oh, so the island's not for sale, eh? Well, will you at least permit us to live in your socialist paradise?"
46120,198,283,1244000,Castro,CASTRO'S PRIVATE OFFICE,You're talking about Cuba?
46121,198,284,1246000,C. Montgomery Burns,CASTRO'S PRIVATE OFFICE,Exactly. All we ask is preferential treatment because of my fabulous wealth.
46122,198,285,1251000,Castro,CASTRO'S PRIVATE OFFICE,May I see?
46123,198,286,1252000,C. Montgomery Burns,CASTRO'S PRIVATE OFFICE,"Oh-ho-ho. See with your eyes, not with your hands."
46124,198,287,1255000,Castro,CASTRO'S PRIVATE OFFICE,"Please, we are all amigos here."
46125,198,288,1257000,Homer Simpson,CASTRO'S PRIVATE OFFICE,"Mr. Burns, I think we can trust the President of Cuba."

46130,198,293,1274000,Homer Simpson,Ocean,"It's hard to believe there's a place worse than America, but we found it."
46131,198,294,1279000,C. Montgomery Burns,Ocean,"Yes, I, too, feel renewed appreciation for the good old U.S. of A. Oppression and harassment are a small price to pay to live in the land of the free."
46132,198,295,1289000,Waylon Smithers,Ocean,"But, uh, sir, aren't you facing some serious jail time?"
46133,198,296,1293000,C. Montgomery Burns,Ocean,"Well, if it's a crime to love one's country, then I'm guilty. And if it's a crime to steal a trillion dollars from our government and hand it over to communist Cuba, then I'm guilty of that, too. And if it's a crime to bribe a jury, then so help me, I'll soon be guilty of that!"
46134,198,297,1313000,Homer Simpson,Ocean,God bless America!
