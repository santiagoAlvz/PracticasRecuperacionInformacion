108884,419,99,462000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,I do feel bad for missing so much of Homer's childhood. But at least he wasn't raised by a television...

108899,419,114,530000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm fine -- it's my feelings that are mad.
108900,419,115,533000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetheart, when I left you, it was because I thought I could make the world a little bit better. Maybe all I did was make my own world a lot worse. I only hope you can forgive me."

108915,419,129,618000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Homie -- your mom wouldn't have wanted you to stay in bed forever."
108916,419,130,623000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll tell you what she didn't want -- me to be a jerk to her and then she dies.
108917,419,131,628000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Say something comforting.
108918,419,132,631000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, comforting, comforting... Uh Dad, whenever I would hang out with Grandma, she would always ask me about you. And I'd say you suck, and she would say... you don't suck that bad."
108919,419,133,643000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,She said I didn't suck?
108920,419,134,645000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That bad.
108921,419,135,646000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That bad. Wow.

108925,419,139,652000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I just wish she hadn't died thinking I hated her.
108926,419,140,656000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, you should always make peace with your loved ones."
108927,419,141,658000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"I think I'll give my ma a call right now. Hey Mom, I just wanted you to know that you mean-- Yeah, he's here."

108934,419,148,693000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"I mean, do you think my mother's out there somewhere? Does she know I feel bad about things I said?"
108935,419,149,698000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, perhaps she's around us now. She may have already been reincarnated as... that newborn baby, or that tiny mouse in the nacho cheese..."
108936,419,150,706000,Ned Flanders,Kwik-E-Mart,Oh for crying out loud -- people aren't mice!
108937,419,151,709000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, what a surprise -- Joe Jesus Junior is gonna set us all straight."
108938,419,152,713000,Ned Flanders,Kwik-E-Mart,"Look Homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our Lord, who came back as bread. That's it."
108939,419,153,719000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,That's it.
108940,419,154,724000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,That's the thing with your religion -- it's a bummer.
108941,419,155,727000,Ned Flanders,Kwik-E-Mart,Even the sing-alongs?
108942,419,156,728000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"No, the sing-alongs are okay."
108944,419,158,729000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, look what I found with your mother's things."

108947,419,161,743000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maggie, that's the same Garry that filmed your birthday party. Remember, he brought his girlfriend and they got in a fight."
108948,419,162,751000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, Homer. If you are watching this right now, I am dead. Or, if I'm not dead, you've gotten into my stuff. But if I am dead, this is my will. And if I'm not, get out of my stuff."
108949,419,163,762000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"To my grandson Bart, I leave my Swiss army knife."

108953,419,167,779000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You got nothing! You got nothing!
108954,419,168,782000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I have a purse for you. It's woven out of nature's most amazing material, hemp."
108955,419,169,790000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmm, it smells like concerts!"
108956,419,170,793000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"And lastly, for Homer, I leave you something very special."
108957,419,171,798000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo!

108961,419,175,804000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"At exactly three o'clock, release my ashes. I love you, Homer. And now, because they're your favorite, please enjoy some animal bloopers."
108962,419,176,813000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, ma. You always knew just how to make everything all right."
108963,419,177,820000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It works on so many levels.
108967,419,179,833000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MONUMENT PARK,"Okay, this is it. I've got one last chance to make up for the things I said to my Mom. I will avenge you!"
108968,419,180,840000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MONUMENT PARK,"It's not really avenging her, Dad. Just the fulfillment of her last wish."
108969,419,181,843000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MONUMENT PARK,"I'm really glad you corrected me, Lisa. People are always really glad when they're corrected."
108971,419,183,852000,Homer Simpson,HIGHER UP ON MESA,"This is hard work. Isn't it, boy? Boy?"
108973,419,185,857000,Bart Simpson,FOOT OF MOUNTAIN,"Hey, Homer! Your butt still looks big from down here!"
108974,419,186,860000,Homer Simpson,FOOT OF MOUNTAIN,Why you little...
108976,419,188,865000,Lisa Simpson,FOOT OF MOUNTAIN,"You know, spiritually speaking, Grandma's ashes won't know where they've been thrown from... So, in a way... uh... I'm lying down now."
108977,419,189,878000,Homer Simpson,FOOT OF MOUNTAIN,"I always knew that at the end, it would all come down to me."
108978,419,190,882000,Marge Simpson,FOOT OF MOUNTAIN,"Excuse me, I think I'm holding up better than you are. In fact, I've got energy to spare."
108979,419,191,887000,Homer Simpson,FOOT OF MOUNTAIN,"To spare, eh?"
108981,419,193,891000,Homer Simpson,FURTHER UP MESA,"Marge, your back is so sweaty. I'm starting to slip off."

108989,419,201,932000,Homer Simpson,TOP OF BUTTE,"Mom, we didn't know each other very well. If we did, you never would have asked me to climb anything. But even when you weren't around, I always felt good, knowing you were out there somewhere."

108994,419,206,977000,Soldier #1,TOP OF BUTTE,Judging from the wind direction... distance... time of day... the ashes must have come from... him!
108912,419,207,984000,Soldier #2,TOP OF BUTTE,"Ever since you started watching ""Monk"" you think you are Monk. You're not Monk!"
108965,419,208,991000,Homer Simpson,TOP OF BUTTE,I've gotta get out of here!
108996,419,209,997000,Homer Simpson,TOP OF BUTTE,I'm safe as long as nothing disturbs this incredibly delicate balance.
108997,419,210,1007000,Homer Simpson,TOP OF BUTTE,Wheee!
108998,419,211,1008000,Soldier #1,TOP OF BUTTE,You're not supposed to like it!
108999,419,212,1010000,Homer Simpson,TOP OF BUTTE,Show me the law that says I can't! Wheee!
109000,419,213,1015000,Soldier #1,TOP OF BUTTE,Are you hurt?
109001,419,214,1016000,Homer Simpson,TOP OF BUTTE,I don't think so.
109002,419,215,1017000,Soldier #1,TOP OF BUTTE,"So we gotta do that, too."
109005,419,218,1031000,Officer,SECRET BASE,Here's your mother.
109006,419,219,1034000,Homer Simpson,SECRET BASE,"You can have her. To me, she's been nothing but trouble."
109007,419,220,1038000,C. Montgomery Burns,SECRET BASE,What's the delay?
109008,419,221,1039000,Officer,SECRET BASE,"Mr. Burns, we had a saboteur."
109009,419,222,1041000,C. Montgomery Burns,SECRET BASE,"Well, well, well..."
109010,419,223,1042000,C. Montgomery Burns,SECRET BASE,Who's this delightful young lady?
109011,419,224,1045000,Officer,SECRET BASE,"She's what held up the launch, sir."
109012,419,225,1047000,C. Montgomery Burns,SECRET BASE,Pity. You and I could've shared the world.
109013,419,226,1049000,Officer,SECRET BASE,You do know you're talking to a bag of ashes.
109014,419,227,1052000,C. Montgomery Burns,SECRET BASE,"Hey, I've seen your wife. She's no Mamie Van Doren."
109015,419,228,1056000,Homer Simpson,SECRET BASE,Just what are you guys up to?
109016,419,229,1059000,C. Montgomery Burns,SECRET BASE,I suppose there's no harm in telling you. I'm using the rocket to dispose of Springfield's nuclear waste -- by sending it straight to the heart of the Amazon rainforest!
109017,419,230,1068000,Homer Simpson,SECRET BASE,The rainforest?! That's that thing Lisa likes!
109018,419,231,1072000,C. Montgomery Burns,SECRET BASE,"Well, maybe she'll like it better filled with dying trees and mutated animals."
109019,419,232,1076000,Homer Simpson,SECRET BASE,"You monster! On another subject, next Thursday I have to leave work early. I assume that's cool."
109020,419,233,1082000,Female Automated Voice,SECRET BASE,All systems operational.
109021,419,234,1082000,C. Montgomery Burns,SECRET BASE,Excellent.
109022,419,235,1089000,Homer Simpson,SECRET BASE,"Mom, I'm so sorry. You just wanted to stop one more senseless act of madness in the world. Well, if I get out of this I promise you I'll grant your last wish."
109023,419,236,1099000,Bart Simpson,SECRET BASE,"Homer! Hey, Homer!"
109024,419,237,1100000,Bart Simpson,SECRET BASE,Here's Gramma's knife!
109025,419,238,1100000,Homer Simpson,SECRET BASE,Toss it down!
109026,419,239,1105000,Homer Simpson,SECRET BASE,"Thanks, boy."
109028,419,241,1109000,Homer Simpson,MOUNTAIN BASE,How am I ever gonna take on all those guys?
108995,419,242,1115000,Homer Simpson,MOUNTAIN BASE,"Hm, what could I make from those two things?"
108966,419,243,1119000,Homer Simpson,MOUNTAIN BASE,No...
109029,419,245,1124000,Marge Simpson,Mountain,"My purse is made of hemp -- if we burn it, the ""silly smoke"" will mellow out those guards!"
109030,419,246,1130000,Lisa Simpson,Mountain,We can ignite it with these crystal earrings Grandma gave me.
109031,419,247,1133000,Marge Simpson,Mountain,I thought she gave you her rebellious spirit.
109032,419,248,1136000,Lisa Simpson,Mountain,I found them on her nightstand.
109033,419,249,1139000,Lisa Simpson,Mountain,What? Bart got a Swiss Army knife.
109035,419,251,1151000,Soldier #1,MOUNTAIN SECRET BASE,"Hey, did you ever think about how like your fingers are like legs for your hand?"
109036,419,252,1157000,Soldier #2,MOUNTAIN SECRET BASE,Imagine what cute little shoes they'd wear.
109037,419,253,1159000,Soldier #1,MOUNTAIN SECRET BASE,"That's already a thing -- thimbles, right?"
109038,419,254,1163000,Homer Simpson,MOUNTAIN SECRET BASE,God Bless America!
109039,419,255,1177000,C. Montgomery Burns,MOUNTAIN SECRET BASE,Send in reinforcements!
109040,419,256,1179000,Officer,MOUNTAIN SECRET BASE,"Actually, you only hired ten. A couple called in sick. And the Jewish guy has to leave at sunset."
109041,419,257,1185000,C. Montgomery Burns,MOUNTAIN SECRET BASE,Fine.
109042,419,258,1189000,Homer Simpson,MOUNTAIN SECRET BASE,"That'll do, brick, that'll do."
109043,419,259,1191000,Female Automated Voice,MOUNTAIN SECRET BASE,"Base self destruct sequence activated. Detonation in ten, nine, eight..."
109045,419,261,1204000,Marge Simpson,Mountain,Homie?
109046,419,262,1213000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,Now I'll just add water to these ashes and bring my mother back to life.
109047,419,263,1217000,Marge Simpson,Mountain,"It doesn't work that way, Homie."
109048,419,264,1219000,Lisa Simpson,Mountain,But she'll live on forever in what you did today.
109049,419,265,1222000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,"Well then, Mom, this was for you."
109050,419,266,1251000,Little Homer,Mountain,More sugar! More sugar!
109051,419,267,1253000,Mona Simpson,Mountain,No.
109052,419,268,1253000,Little Homer,Mountain,Why not?
109053,419,269,1255000,Mona Simpson,Mountain,Because you're sweet enough.
