7759,58,8,151000,Milhouse Van Houten,School Bus,"Yeah, you shake it up and it tells the future."

7760,58,11,156000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,Will I pass my English test?
7761,58,12,159000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"""Outlook not so good."" Wow! It does work!"
7762,58,13,163000,Milhouse Van Houten,School Bus,"Let me try. Will I get beat up today? ""All signs point to yes."""
7763,58,14,168000,Nelson Muntz,School Bus,That ball knows everything.
7764,58,15,174000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Hey, I got a good one. Will Milhouse and I be friends till we're toothless old men with hair coming out of our ears? READING BALL, SURPRISED) ""Don't count on it."" Will Milhouse and I be friends when we're high school dropouts living off Uncle Sucker? ""It looks doubtful."" Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day?"
7765,58,16,195000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,What could come between two bestest buddies like us?
7767,58,18,199000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Samantha I've always been suspicious of transfer students... Other principals try to unload problem cases that way... Lord knows I do.
7768,58,19,209000,Samantha Stanky,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm a good student, Principal Skinner."
7769,58,20,211000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah sure, and they told me I'd get a big parade when I got back from 'Nam. Instead they spat on me. I can still feel it searing. So, now let's just see what the permanent record has to say, shall we?"
7770,58,21,222000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Hmm... no detention... fairly good attendance record... Oh, I see you beat that bed wetting problem in the second grade."
7771,58,22,229000,Samantha Stanky,Springfield Elementary School,That's in there?
7772,58,23,230000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't worry. They'll forget. Just like they forgot about me in that tiger cage for eighteen agonizing months. Every night I'd wake up screaming. Well, let's meet your classmates."
7773,58,24,245000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey Bart, was this thing right about your test?"
7774,58,25,248000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"To those who doubt the power of the Magic 8-Ball, I say ""Behold my ""F!"""

7777,58,28,260000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I think we should discuss this later, Edna. Now, it's never easy to come to a new school, so let's make her feel right at home. Please say a big elementary school hello to Samantha Stinky."

7781,58,32,282000,Samantha Stanky,Springfield Elementary School,Uh-huh.
7782,58,33,282000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,So why don't you stand up in front of the class and tell us about yourself? I'll be grading you on grammar and poise.
7783,58,34,288000,Samantha Stanky,Springfield Elementary School,"We just moved here from Phoenix. My Dad owns a home security company. He came to Springfield because of its high crime rate and lackluster police force. All my friends are back in Phoenix, and this town has a weird smell that you're all probably used to -- but I'm not."
7784,58,35,304000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"It'll take you about six weeks, dear."
7785,58,36,306000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, Milhouse, would you like a wet willie?"
7786,58,37,309000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Sure.

7793,58,44,332000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Class, in order to explain why your hormones will soon make you an easy target for every smooth talking Lothario with his own car and tight jeans, I will now show a short sex education film."
7794,58,45,343000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Ezekiel and Ismail, in accordance with your parents' wishes, you may step out into the hall and pray for our souls."
147796,58,46,352000,TROY,Springfield Elementary School,"Hello, I'm actor Troy McClure. You kids might remember me from such educational films as ""Lead Paint: Delicious But Deadly,"" and ""Here Comes the Metric System!"" I'm here to provide the facts about sex in a frank and straightforward manner. And now, here's ""Fuzzy Bunny's Guide To You-Know-What."""
147797,58,47,372000,TROY,Springfield Elementary School,"This is Fuzzy Bunny. About a year ago he noticed his voice was changing, he had terrible acne, and had fur where there was no fur before. He also noticed Fluffy Bunny!"
7796,58,49,385000,Bart Simpson,CLASSROOM,Bo-ring!
147798,58,50,389000,TROY,CLASSROOM,Fluffy and Fuzzy went to the park... the ice cream social... the boat show... and various other wholesome activities. And they never ruined their fun by giving in to their throbbing biological urges. Then came the big day. Fluffy and Fuzzy got married!
147799,58,51,407000,TROY,CLASSROOM,That night came the honeymoon.
7797,58,52,412000,Kids,CLASSROOM,Eew!
7798,58,53,414000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CLASSROOM,She's faking it.
147800,58,54,416000,TROY,CLASSROOM,The most satisfying part of the night was knowing that they waited.
147801,58,55,419000,TROY,CLASSROOM,"Nine months later, Fluffy gave birth to fourteen beautiful bunnies. Eight survive."
147802,58,56,425000,TROY,CLASSROOM,"And now that you know how it's done, don't do it."
7799,58,57,431000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CLASSROOM,Any questions?
7800,58,58,433000,Nelson Muntz,CLASSROOM,"Mrs. Krabappel, how come you don't live with Mr. Krabappel?"
7801,58,59,437000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CLASSROOM,Because Mr. Krabappel chased something small and fluffy down a rabbit hole.
7802,58,60,441000,Samantha Stanky,CLASSROOM,How do we know when we fall in love?
7803,58,61,443000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CLASSROOM,"Oh, don't you worry. Most of you will never fall in love and marry out of fear of dying alone."
7804,58,62,450000,Bart Simpson,CLASSROOM,"How would I go about creating a half-man, half-monkey type creature?"
7805,58,63,453000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CLASSROOM,"I'm sorry, that would be playing God."
7806,58,64,456000,Bart Simpson,CLASSROOM,"God shmod, I want my monkey-man."
7808,58,66,460000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, that's a nice dress."
7809,58,67,463000,Samantha Stanky,Springfield Elementary School,My dad makes me wear it. I hate it.
7810,58,68,465000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I hate it too. Uh -- can I walk you home?"
7811,58,69,466000,Samantha Stanky,Springfield Elementary School,Okay.
7813,58,71,470000,Otto Mann,Bus,"Everybody on, but no shoving. Just kiddin', you can shove all you want."
7814,58,72,475000,Bart Simpson,Bus,"Hey, wait Otto-man, you can't leave. Milhouse isn't here yet."
7815,58,73,479000,Otto Mann,Bus,"Sorry Bart-dude, no time. My girlfriend's dancing topless at the airport bar from four fifteen to four twenty."

7822,58,80,500000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Yeah, but never a girl. What if I want to strut around nude?"
7823,58,81,503000,Samantha Stanky,Bart's Treehouse,Maybe I should go.

7828,58,84,524000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"No, but my sister's got a wide selection of crappy comics."
7829,58,85,533000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,you guys wanna see something gross?
7831,58,87,545000,Announcer,Bart's Treehouse,"Tonight on Smartline -- ""I'm Okay, You're Too Fat"". Here's your host, Kent Brockman."
7832,58,88,552000,Kent Brockman,Bart's Treehouse,"Good evening. Did you know that thirty-four million American adults are obese? Taken together, that excess blubber could fill the Grand Canyon two-fifths of the way up. That may not sound impressive, but keep in mind it is a very big canyon."
7834,58,90,565000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This sucks. Where is that channel changer?
7835,58,91,571000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, eh, I'll give it a chance."
7836,58,92,573000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Americans have grown up with the image of the jolly fat man. Dom DeLuise, Alfred Hitchcock, and of course, Santa Claus. But in real life, Santa would be suffering from gallstones, hypertension, impotence, and diabetes."
7837,58,93,602000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I wish they had never invented fried cheese!
7838,58,94,608000,Grave Digger,Simpson Home,We've got to widen the hole.

7840,58,96,619000,Female Announcer,Simpson Home,"We take eighteen ounces of sizzling ground beef and soak it in rich creamery butter. Then we top it off with bacon, ham and a fried egg. We call it the ""Good Morning Burger!"""

7845,58,101,639000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Okay, Milhouse... I'll trade your Carl Yastrzemski baseball card for my Omar Vizquel."

7849,58,105,657000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"Well, you kinda-sorta are."
7851,58,106,665000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Milhouse, we're living in the age of cooties. I can't believe the risk you're running. Besides, what's so great about kissing?"
7852,58,107,673000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"Bart, it's not just the kissing. A lot of it is waitin' to kiss. You know like when you open an Eskimo Pie and you wait just a little bit for it to melt?"
7853,58,108,683000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,But she doesn't melt.
7854,58,109,685000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,Oh yes she does!

7860,58,115,701000,Female Announcer,Bart's Treehouse,And dip it in rich creamery butter.
7861,58,116,705000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Dad, what if I told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?"
7862,58,117,709000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"I'd say ""You're a lying scumbag."" Why sweetie?"
7863,58,118,713000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,According to Eternity Magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. That's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.
7864,58,119,721000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Oh Lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter."
7865,58,120,724000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"They'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. As you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less."

7871,58,126,751000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmmm... Hostage negotiations.
7872,58,127,755000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen, Tabouli, we're ignoring all of your demands. What do you say to that?"
7873,58,128,763000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Better give me the weight loss tape.
7875,58,130,769000,Worker #1,Warehouse,"We're out of ""Subliminally Slim."""
7876,58,131,769000,Worker #2,Warehouse,"Eh, just send him the vocabulary builder."

7882,58,141,823000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lamentably, no. My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety."
7883,58,142,832000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't you usually play with Milhouse after school?
7884,58,143,835000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,He has a girlfriend.
7885,58,144,836000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Milhouse?
7886,58,145,839000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, all they do is kiss."
7887,58,146,841000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How cute. They don't open their mouths do they?
7888,58,147,845000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
7889,58,148,846000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How cute.
7892,58,151,855000,Bart Simpson,Bus,Hey Martin.
7893,58,152,855000,Martin Prince,Bus,Bart? This is the first time anyone has ever sat next to me since I successfully lobbied to have the school day extended by twenty minutes.
7894,58,153,864000,Bart Simpson,Bus,"Listen Martin, right now I'm looking for a friend who won't leave me for a girl."
7895,58,154,868000,Martin Prince,Bus,That's me. I'm just as unpopular with the ladies as I am with the chaps.
7896,58,155,873000,Bart Simpson,Bus,"Yeah, right. Anyway... do you want to do something after school?"
7897,58,156,876000,Martin Prince,Bus,"It's a date. Everyone, Bart and I would like to announce that we are friends!"
7899,58,158,884000,Martin Prince,MARTIN'S ROOM,"Now Bart, would you care to listen to me play the lute?"

7903,58,162,903000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know if that tape is working. You ate three desserts tonight.
7904,58,163,906000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
7905,58,164,912000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,There's another thing I've been wanting to talk to you about...
7906,58,165,915000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tut tut, gentle Marge. For here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!"
7907,58,166,924000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What in God's name are you talking about?

7916,58,176,972000,Bart Simpson,Theater,"Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't the three of us go spit on the Principal's car?"
7917,58,177,977000,Milhouse Van Houten,Theater,"Listen, Bart... there's such a thing as spendin' too much time together."
7918,58,178,983000,Bart Simpson,Theater,Oh. Fine. I'm tired of watching you two lip wrestle. There's plenty of other ways to be grossed out in this town.
7919,58,179,993000,Milhouse Van Houten,Theater,"Bart, wait!"
7920,58,180,993000,Bart Simpson,Theater,Yeah?
