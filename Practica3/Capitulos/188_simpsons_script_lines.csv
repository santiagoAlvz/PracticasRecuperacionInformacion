43066,188,1,38000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,Stupid heater! Don't make me come in there!
43067,188,2,41000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Streets,Why do you always wait until Christmas Eve to do your shopping? The crowds are just beastly.
43068,188,3,47000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"You know me, Marge. I crave the hustle and bustle."
43072,188,7,67000,Marge Simpson,Try-N-Save,Homer! Look at this mob! The good toys are probably all gone.
43073,188,8,74000,Homer Simpson,Try-N-Save,"Oh, Santa's got a little trick up his sleeve."
43074,188,9,78000,Homer Simpson,Try-N-Save,"Attention, shoppers. Register 9 is now open for your shopping convenience."
43075,188,10,83000,Homer Simpson,Try-N-Save,"Sorry, these are for display only... This has been recalled... Oo, Bart would like this... We're out of these..."
43076,188,11,87000,Shopper,Try-N-Save,Out?! But I just --
43077,188,12,88000,Homer Simpson,Try-N-Save,Register 9 is now closed.
43079,188,14,101000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, kids, I made your favorite cookies -- Christmas trees for the girls, and bloody spear-heads for Bart."
43080,188,15,108000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aww, thanks, Mom."
43082,188,17,116000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,This year's tree is just perfect. That old aluminum one was so fake.
43083,188,18,120000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I couldn't agree more. From now on, it's plastic all the way."
43085,188,20,128000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, did you hear that?"
43086,188,21,130000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Could it be...?
43088,188,24,145000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, kids. Let's try the lights!"
43089,188,25,156000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's crap-tacular.
43090,188,26,167000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Hocus-pocus, mucus-pukus..."" My powers of deduction tell me you're getting a hand-made sweater. Possiblyyy yellow."
43091,188,27,179000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom! Make him stop!
43092,188,28,180000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! Put down that yellow sweater! Nobody's going near their presents until 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.
43094,188,30,188000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Seven A.M. No earlier. And you can't set your alarm clocks 'cause I got 'em!
43095,188,31,195000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,For once we're gonna celebrate Christmas as a family.
43096,188,32,199000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hallooo? Anybody home?
43097,188,33,210000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, 12 glasses of water. That'll wake me up nice and early, and I'll have a big head-start on opening presents. Pure genius."
43098,188,34,218000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You didn't invent that, Bart. The Indians used to drink water to wake up early for their attacks."
43099,188,35,224000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's always about the Indians, isn't it, Lis?"
43100,188,36,227000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dear Santa. If you bring me lotsa good stuff, I promise not to do anything bad between now and when I wake up. Amen."
43101,188,37,236000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Owww! I'll kill you!
43102,188,38,277000,Fans,Simpson Home,Go! Go! Go! / We're number 1!
43103,188,39,280000,Cheerleader,Simpson Home,"Gimme a ""P""!"
43104,188,40,280000,Fans,Simpson Home,"""P""! Go! Go! Go! ""P""! ""P""! ""P""!"
43105,188,41,290000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Worked like a charm.
43106,188,42,292000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh! Oh! Oh!
43107,188,43,299000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,How sweet it is!
43108,188,44,315000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Aunt Selma. Always good for a fin. Whoa-ho-ho. Here we go."
43109,188,45,327000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The Inferno-buster 3000! I knew Santa wouldn't have time to check that list twice.
43110,188,46,336000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoa... Yeah...
43111,188,47,340000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Cool...

43117,188,53,380000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer! I think I heard a noise.
43120,188,56,392000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Knock it off...
43122,188,57,405000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Snow covers all. Pure, white snow."
43123,188,58,419000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I gotta get back to bed!
43125,188,60,423000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What happened?
43126,188,61,426000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What the-- Where's Christmas? Lisa, where's Christmas?"
43127,188,62,431000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, what were you doing outside?"
43128,188,63,436000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't know how to tell you this, but... I came down a little early and... um... well... uh..."
43129,188,64,436000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I saw - a burglar and he was - he took - and he got all our stuff. Including the tree.
43130,188,65,457000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We were robbed?
43131,188,66,459000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh.
43132,188,67,462000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How could somebody...?
43133,188,68,463000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I know...
43134,188,69,466000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Can - we - skip - church?
43135,188,70,477000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Now, um, what did this, ah, Christmas thief look like?"
43136,188,71,481000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, he had a glass eye, a wooden leg, um... big scar on his cheek..."
43137,188,72,487000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Anything unusual?
43138,188,73,489000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hooks for hands. Um, oh, uh, and he was wearing a striped convict shirt. And he was carrying a big sack with a dollar sign on it."
43139,188,74,496000,Lou,Simpson Home,Classic burglar.
43140,188,75,498000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Ahh, cheer up. We'll catch this guy."
43141,188,76,501000,Lou,Simpson Home,"Uh, Chief..."
43142,188,77,503000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,What? You can't rule it out.
43143,188,78,507000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, there's no easy way to say it, kids: God hates us."
43144,188,79,511000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, since when is Christmas just about the presents? Aren't we forgetting the true meaning of this day? The birth of Santa?"
43145,188,80,518000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart's absolutely right. This is the one day that shouldn't be about material things.
43146,188,81,524000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, why don't we walk over to Grampa's and cheer up the old folks? That'll make us feel better."
43147,188,82,530000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, but they'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me happy."
43149,188,84,541000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Streets,Looks like the Flanders are having a nice Christmas.
43150,188,85,544000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"Oh yeah? We'll show 'em. Come on, kids, pretend we've got new cross-country skis."
43151,188,86,561000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield Streets,"Merry Christmas, Simpsons!"
43152,188,87,569000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,That's not as fun as it looks.
43153,188,88,571000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Streets,Nothing could be as fun as that looks.
43154,188,89,573000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Streets,"Hey, look what I got, Bart! A ""Tickle Me Krusty!"""
43155,188,90,575000,Krusty Doll,Springfield Streets,"Hey, kid, get your finger outta there!"
43157,188,92,579000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Streets,Ow!

43164,188,99,606000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Sounds like you're having a rough Christmas, Homer. You know what I blame this on the breakdown of? Society."
43165,188,100,612000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, you're right, Moe. You're always Moe."
43166,188,101,617000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, look! Your house is on TV!"
43167,188,102,620000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"You take that back, Barney!"
43168,188,103,622000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Nah, he's right, Homer."
43169,188,104,624000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Stay out of this, old man."
43170,188,105,626000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,"Dateline: Kent Brockman. I'm here at the scene of the Christmas burglary, where a creature was stirring last night. And what he was ""stirring"" was ""up trouble."""
43171,188,106,627000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,"Is your husband or lover here, ma'am?"
43172,188,107,638000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,No. My husband is... at church.
43173,188,108,641000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Aw, that's my girl. I love you, Marjorie."

43175,188,110,646000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,You shut up.
43176,188,111,648000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,"So when you realized Christmas was ruined, how did you feel?"
43177,188,112,652000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,How do you think I felt?
43178,188,113,655000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,"Absolutely devastated. ""Absolutely devastated."" The words of a heart-broken mother. For there will be no fire truck for little Bart. No sweater for little Lisa. No Cajun sausage for little Homer..."
43180,188,115,671000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,"So while you're home today eating your sweet, sweet holiday turkey, I hope you'll all choke just a little bit."
42925,188,117,683000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lousy doormat.
43183,188,118,687000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer! You won't believe what's happened! It's a miracle!
43184,188,119,690000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Marge, I don't wanna hear any more about that silver polish."
43186,188,121,700000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,People saw our story on the news and they've opened their hearts to us!
43187,188,122,704000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Simpson Home,"Arr, we just gave what we could."

43211,188,146,791000,Poor Violet,Simpson Home,"God bless you, Bart Simpson. I'd kiss you, but doctor says I'm sick."
43213,188,148,803000,Homer Simpson,KLIFF'S KAR CHALET,"Is this car $15,000?"
43214,188,149,806000,Cliff,KLIFF'S KAR CHALET,"It is now. And because of your loss, folks, I'll throw in the undercoating for two hundred -- nooo, four hundred and ninety bucks."
43215,188,150,815000,Homer Simpson,KLIFF'S KAR CHALET,What a deal! I'd be a sucker not to get it.
43216,188,151,818000,Bart Simpson,KLIFF'S KAR CHALET,"I don't know about this, Dad. Shouldn't we give the money to charity or some...? Ow!"
43217,188,152,822000,Cliff,KLIFF'S KAR CHALET,"Oh, I'm sorry. I jabbed you with my pen."

43234,188,169,882000,Homer Simpson,Road,I knew this would happen.
43235,188,170,884000,Marge Simpson,Road,"Well, at least the burglar's having a merry Christmas."
43237,188,172,893000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! You're up early.
43238,188,173,894000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I couldn't sleep.
43239,188,174,895000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's wrong?
43240,188,175,901000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,There was no burglar.
43241,188,176,902000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No burglar? / What? / what's he mean?
43242,188,177,904000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I accidentally burned up the tree and the presents. I'm really sorry.
43243,188,178,911000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little...
43244,188,179,914000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, no! Your hands are too weak!"
43245,188,180,917000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Stop that!

43247,188,182,931000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Kent Brockman here for a follow-up with Springfield's favorite hard luck family, the Simpsons!"
43248,188,183,936000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Folks, any words for the Christmas thief, if he's watching?"
43249,188,184,940000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, Kent. ""Hello, jerk. We may never find you, and we should probably all stop looking. But one thing's for sure: you do exist."""
43250,188,185,952000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Strong words. Strong, bewildering words."
43251,188,186,957000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Also, we want to thank the whole town for their generosity."
43253,188,188,961000,Cameraman,Simpson Home,"Hey, look!"
43254,188,189,962000,Cameraman,Simpson Home,It's little Bart's fire truck!
43255,188,190,968000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,Little Lisa's sweater? Little Homer's sausage?! What in the name of holy hell is going on here?
43256,188,191,974000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, it's true! We weren't robbed! That part we made up! But the rest is true!"
43257,188,192,981000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait! He's just covering for me! I destroyed the presents, then I buried the evidence. And I acted alone."
43258,188,193,987000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,So the family never knew about any of this.
43259,188,194,990000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, the boy told us. But that was after we filed a phony police report."
43260,188,195,995000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,And after we spent all the townspeople's money.
43261,188,196,997000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,So you can see why my husband had to lie to you a moment ago.
43263,188,198,1002000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,So this was all a scam. And on Christmas.
43264,188,199,1007000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Yeah. Jesus must be spinning in his grave.
43266,188,201,1010000,Poor Violet,SPRINGFIELD TV STORE,We gave them our vitamin money.
43267,188,202,1015000,Store Owner,SPRINGFIELD TV STORE,"Hey! Hey! Shoo, ya lousy freeloaders! Come back when you get some parents."
43269,188,204,1018000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"In my long career, I've seen some pretty shabby things. But this putrid fraud out-stinks them all."
43270,188,205,1027000,Cameraman,Simpson Home,And... cut.
43271,188,206,1030000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"I just want to thank you folks so much. This has turned out to be a great, great story for me."
43272,188,207,1045000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I think they're running out of tomatoes.
43273,188,208,1047000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but they've still got plenty of pumpkins."
43274,188,209,1050000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer. I'm so ashamed."
43276,188,210,1053000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Relax, Marge. This'll all blow over."
43279,188,213,1071000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,"Oh, no. Look at the line!"
43280,188,214,1073000,Moe Szyslak,Krusty Burger,"Oh, there they are."
