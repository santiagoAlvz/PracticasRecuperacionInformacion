23212,113,214,1085000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Town Square,I assure you his belching is the result of an unrelated alcohol problem.
23213,113,215,1096000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Town Square,It just ain't the same without Homer. He knew how to drive a car.
23215,113,217,1105000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son! My dear Son. From now on I'm going to be a good and attentive father. And for starters your ""old man"" is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike!"
23216,113,218,1124000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, number one: I know how to ride a bike. Number two: I already own a bike. And number three: that is a girl's bike."
23217,113,219,1131000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're no girl, you're a boy. A good boy. You can be president. Scratch that. You will be president."
23218,113,220,1139000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad!
23219,113,221,1141000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.
23220,113,222,1143000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Dad. I want to get down. This tire is filthy, and the steel belts are poking me."
23221,113,223,1150000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wheeee! Wheeee!!!
23222,113,224,1153000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No! No! No! No!!!
23223,113,225,1153000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No offense, Homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting."
23224,113,226,1159000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,B-But I'm using my whole ass.
23225,113,227,1161000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary."
23226,113,228,1168000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! But now, I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking."
23227,113,229,1178000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sure he meant to say ""serious drinking."""
23228,113,230,1181000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's what I assumed.
23231,113,233,1186000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,Here's where it all started to go wrong. How'm I supposed to be a good dad when I never had one myself?
23232,113,234,1194000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I actually got to meet Santa Claus. Some father... Wait a minute.
23233,113,235,1204000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,Dad? This photo is a blessing. It eases my pain.
23180,113,236,1220000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,This tonic's caused me nothin' but trouble. You've done all the damage you're gonna do!
23207,113,237,1228000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,"Aw, nuts."
23208,113,238,1236000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,Dad!
22268,113,239,1237000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,Son!
23234,113,240,1238000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house.
23235,113,241,1242000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,"No, I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house."
23236,113,242,1245000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,You know what?
23237,113,243,1245000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,What?
23238,113,244,1248000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,We're both screw-ups.
23239,113,245,1249000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,It doesn't matter. What matters is you were right when you told me I never said anything nice about you.
23240,113,246,1258000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,So are you gonna say something nice now?
23241,113,247,1262000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,"Well, I hadn't thought that far ahead."
23242,113,248,1265000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,"Okay, here it goes... I'm not sorry I had you, Son. And I was always proud that you weren't a short man."
23243,113,249,1278000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,"Aw, Dad."
23244,113,250,1284000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,"Whaddya say we roll on the grass, son?"
23245,113,251,1288000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Farmhouse,"I'm with you, Dad."
