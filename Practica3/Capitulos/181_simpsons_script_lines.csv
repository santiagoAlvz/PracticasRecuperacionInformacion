41123,181,107,525000,Man On Tv,Simpson Home,That's damn fine coffee you got here in Twin Peaks. And damn good cherry pie.
41124,181,108,537000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Brilliant! I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
41125,181,109,543000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I want you to look at this drawing Bart did."

41138,181,122,575000,Grampa Simpson,Hallway,I'm gone.
41140,181,124,579000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Mrs. Simpson, physically your son is as sound as a dollar. I'm afraid Bart's severe emotional dysfunction stems from a deep-seated psychological trauma."
41142,181,126,590000,Marge Simpson,DOOR,"With nowhere else to turn, we went to see the school psychologist..."
41144,181,128,593000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Dr. Pryor's Office,"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, there's nothing to be alarmed about. Public school can be intimidating to a young child, particularly one with as many flamboyantly homosexual tendencies as your son."
41145,181,129,606000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Pryor's Office,Bart's gay?
41146,181,130,607000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Dr. Pryor's Office,"Bart? Uh, whoo, wrong file."
41147,181,131,612000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Dr. Pryor's Office,"Uh, look, th-the point I'm trying to make here is that Bart must learn to be less of an individual and more a faceless slug..."
41148,181,132,625000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Dr. Pryor's Office,"Hmm. Lisa, how old are you?"
41149,181,133,627000,Lisa Simpson,Dr. Pryor's Office,I am three and three eighths!
41150,181,134,629000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Dr. Pryor's Office,"Hm. Lisa, if I have five apples and I take away three apples, how many apples do I have left?"
41151,181,135,637000,Lisa Simpson,Dr. Pryor's Office,Two apples!
41152,181,136,638000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Pryor's Office,Wait a minute... she's right!
41153,181,137,642000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Dr. Pryor's Office,"Heh, very good."
41154,181,138,644000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Dr. Pryor's Office,"Marge, Homer, I believe your Lisa may be gifted."
41155,181,139,648000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Pryor's Office,"That's wonderful! But still, can't you do anything for Bart?"
41156,181,140,651000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Pryor's Office,"Marge, he's five. His life is over. Lisa's the wave of the future."
41157,181,141,656000,Lisa Simpson,Dr. Pryor's Office,Wave of da future!
41158,181,142,657000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Dr. Pryor's Office,"That's right, honey. If you nurture her gift now, there's no telling what she can do."
41159,181,143,663000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Pryor's Office,Wow. Just think of the possibilities.
41160,181,144,667000,Announcer,Dr. Pryor's Office,Lisa Simpson has won the Nobel Prize.
41161,181,145,671000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Pryor's Office,Nah.
41162,181,146,672000,Announcer,Dr. Pryor's Office,Lisa Simpson has won the Nobel Prize for Kickboxing.
41163,181,147,676000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Pryor's Office,Hm.
41164,181,148,681000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Dr. Pryor's Office,Uh... I'll give you the address of a nice pre-school.

41174,181,158,714000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PRIVATE PRESCHOOL,"Look, I knew private school would be expensive but I was hoping we could get a scholarship of some sort."
41175,181,159,718000,Headmistress,SPRINGFIELD PRIVATE PRESCHOOL,Sorry. I don't have anything to offer you unless you're a member of a minority group.
41176,181,160,723000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PRIVATE PRESCHOOL,"Excellente! Muchas gracias, Señorata!"
41177,181,161,727000,Headmistress,SPRINGFIELD PRIVATE PRESCHOOL,Sorry.

41179,181,163,729000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PRIVATE PRESCHOOL,"Come on, honey. I guess this is a world you'll never know."
41182,181,166,738000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever. Bart was miserable at school, and Lisa's gifts were going to waste."
41183,181,167,747000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, Homer? It's five years later and I'm still miserable at school."
41184,181,168,751000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,And my gifts are still going to waste.
41185,181,169,753000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And sometimes I feel so smothered by this family I just want to scream till my lungs explode! Uh... I'll go start dinner now.
41186,181,170,760000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You do that.
41188,181,172,767000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hello!
41189,181,173,768000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, what are you doin' here?"
41190,181,174,770000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Looking for my teeth.
41192,181,176,774000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Gimme those!
41193,181,177,776000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Better wash these off. Ah, the hell with it."
41194,181,178,781000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Grampa, as long as you're here, we were telling a story that took place when Bart was five and Lisa was three."
41195,181,179,788000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I know this story! The year is nineteen-aught-six. The President is the Divine Miss Sarah Bernhardt. And all over America, people were doing a dance called the Funky Grampa! Oh I'm the --"
41196,181,180,808000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeeesss. Well, as if our troubles weren't bad enough, Springfield was going through an unseasonable heat wave..."
41197,181,181,816000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"And so, Springfield's heat wave continues with today's temperature exceeding the record for this date, set way back four billion years ago when the earth was just a ball of molten lava."
41198,181,182,826000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ohhh. So hottt.
41199,181,183,831000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, have you seen the frozen peas?"
41200,181,184,835000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uhh... you keep 'em. Now listen. If we can't afford private school, maybe there's some other way to encourage Lisa. Umm, an art class... ballet lessons... they have some fun things you could do at the Museum on Saturday..."
41201,181,185,848000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh-uh. Forget it Marge. There is no way I am spending my Saturdays at a Museum. Unless... Museums don't have foosball, do they?"
41202,181,186,859000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You lose, Michelangelo's David. Who's next?"
41203,181,187,862000,Man,Simpson Home,Meeee!
41204,181,188,867000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess it doesn't matter. All these things cost money and we just don't have it. Unless...
41205,181,189,873000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Unless what?
41206,181,190,875000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, there's that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the new air conditioner."
41207,181,191,879000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! And our stopgap solution is getting cranky."
41209,181,193,888000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I cannot believe this. I'm trying to give our daughter a head start in life and you aren't helping a bit.
41210,181,194,893000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, name one successful person who ever lived without air conditioning."
41211,181,195,897000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Balzac!
41212,181,196,898000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.
41213,181,197,901000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But Balzac is the name--
41214,181,198,903000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Up up up up up up up. If ""ifs"" and ""buts"" were candy and nuts y... how does the rest of that go?"
41215,181,199,909000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Please, just promise you won't buy an air conditioner till we've figured out a way to help Lisa."
41216,181,200,913000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, all right, I promise. There must be another way to get an air conditioner..."
41217,181,201,919000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Mmmm... re-circulated air.
41218,181,202,929000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Uh... Homer?
41219,181,203,930000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What, Flanders."
41220,181,204,932000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, sir, I hate to be a Suspicious Aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?"
41221,181,205,943000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I admit it looks bad, Flanders, but haven't you heard of ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"""
41222,181,206,951000,Todd Flanders,Simpson Home,"Got him, Dad!"
41223,181,207,953000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"And so, just as things looked their worst..."
41224,181,208,957000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,...I realized I could make money selling my medication to Deadheads!
41225,181,209,961000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Grampa, what are you talking about?"
41226,181,210,964000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, nothing."
41227,181,211,966000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"As I was saying, things couldn't be worse for Lisa or Bart..."
41229,181,213,970000,Kindergarten Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,"And the ugly duckling was amazed to realize it had grown into a beautiful swan! So you see children, there is hope for anyone."
41230,181,214,977000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Even me?
41231,181,215,977000,Kindergarten Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,No.
