30824,142,9,67000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Yay!! We're getting a new TV!!
30825,142,10,71000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Let's go to the Sharper Image. They've got a TV shaped like a Fifties diner!
30826,142,11,75000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"No, let's go to the Nature Company. They've got a TV assembled by Hopi Indians!"
30827,142,12,79000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,We can't afford to shop at any store that has a philosophy. We just need a TV. We're going to go to the outlet mall in Ogdenville.
30833,142,17,108000,Homer Simpson,Appliance Zone,"Look at these low, low prices on famous brand name electronics!"
30834,142,18,112000,Bart Simpson,Appliance Zone,"Don't be a sap, Dad. These are just crappy knock-offs."
30835,142,19,116000,Homer Simpson,Appliance Zone,"I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see it. And look, there's Magnetbox and Sorny."
30836,142,20,121000,Salesman,Appliance Zone,"Listen, I'm not going to lie to you: those are all superior machines. But if you like to watch your TV -- and I mean really watch it -- you want: the Carnival√©. It features: two-pronged wall plug, pre-molded hand-grip well, durable outer casing to prevent fall-apart..."
30837,142,21,137000,Homer Simpson,Appliance Zone,"Sold! You wrap it up, I'll start bringin' in the pennies."
30840,142,24,144000,Marge Simpson,FASHION MART,"Honey, I don't think these clothes are us..."
30841,142,25,147000,Lisa Simpson,FASHION MART,Who are they?
30842,142,26,148000,Cletus Spuckler,FASHION MART,"Hey, Brandine! You could wear this shirt to work."
30843,142,27,152000,Brandine Del Roy,FASHION MART,"Oh, Cletus, you know I gotta wear the shirt what Dairy Queen give me."
30844,142,28,158000,Lisa Simpson,FASHION MART,"Hey, Mom! There's something in here!"
30845,142,29,162000,Marge Simpson,FASHION MART,"Oh, it's beautiful. Can it be real Chanel?"
30846,142,30,166000,Marge Simpson,FASHION MART,It is.
30847,142,31,169000,Marge Simpson,FASHION MART,90 dollars?!
30848,142,32,172000,Lisa Simpson,FASHION MART,"But it's marked down from $2,800!"
30849,142,33,183000,Lisa Simpson,FASHION MART,"Oh, you look so sophisticated -- just like Mary Hart!"
30850,142,34,187000,Marge Simpson,FASHION MART,"It fits like a dream, too. But we can't afford $90 even if it is a bargain. It wouldn't be right to buy something just for me. If it were a suit we could all wear, maybe, then..."
30851,142,35,199000,Lisa Simpson,FASHION MART,"C'mon, Mom, you never treat yourself to anything."
30852,142,36,202000,Marge Simpson,FASHION MART,"Oh, sure I do. I treated myself to a Sanka not three days ago. But this is a real find."
30853,142,37,209000,Lisa Simpson,FASHION MART,Just buy it. You don't have to rationalize everything.
30854,142,38,214000,Marge Simpson,FASHION MART,"Alright, I will buy it. It'll be good for the economy."
30856,142,40,225000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You look great.
30857,142,41,227000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Really? You like it? Oh, I'd love to wear this someplace special."
30858,142,42,232000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Spurlock's Cafeteria it is.
30859,142,43,235000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What about the symphony -- or the theater?
30861,142,44,238000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What's the point of going out? We're just gonna wind up back here anyway.
30865,142,48,256000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, Mrs. Simpson, you are looking very prosperous today. Might I interest you in some of our impulse items here by the cash register? Perhaps a crazy motorized wiggle pen? Look at the craziness."
30866,142,49,269000,Evelyn,Kwik-E-Mart,"Attendant, I'd like some gas."
30867,142,50,272000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Yes, I'm sorry, I do not speak English. Okay."
30868,142,51,275000,Evelyn,Kwik-E-Mart,But you were just talking to --
30869,142,52,276000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Yes, yes! Hot dog! Hot dog! Yessir, no sir, maybe, okay!"
30870,142,53,279000,Evelyn,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, I can't pump it myself. I'm calling Triple-A."
30871,142,54,281000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"I used to be a little overwhelmed, too, but it's not that hard. I can show you."
30872,142,55,287000,Evelyn,Kwik-E-Mart,"Marge? Is that you? Marge Bouvier, from high school?"
30873,142,56,291000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"yeah. Hi, Evelyn."
30874,142,57,295000,Evelyn,Kwik-E-Mart,How about that. Marge. You look wonderful. And to think I heard you married Homer Simpson.
30875,142,58,302000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,I did marry Homer.
30876,142,59,304000,Evelyn,Kwik-E-Mart,Come. You must show me the pumps.
30877,142,60,306000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Ninety percent of the time, if the gas isn't pumping, this is your problem."
30878,142,61,311000,Evelyn,Kwik-E-Mart,"Automotive skills and fashion sense. Well, you've come a long way from the girl I knew nothing about in high school."
30879,142,62,317000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"We ran with different crowds. You had your debutante balls and skinny-dipping, and I had my home shoe repair course."
30880,142,63,327000,Evelyn,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, my, you haven't changed a bit as far as I know. Say, why don't you drop by the country club tomorrow?"
30881,142,64,333000,Evelyn,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, and bring the family."
30882,142,65,340000,C. Montgomery Burns,Kwik-E-Mart,You there -- fill it up with petroleum distillate and re-vulcanize my tyres! Post haste!
30884,142,67,349000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, comb your hair. Homer, I don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie."
30885,142,68,355000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But Sipowicz does it.
30886,142,69,357000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"If Detective Sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that, too?"
30887,142,70,360000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I wish I was Sipowicz.
30889,142,71,362000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Do I have to go? That country club is a hotbed of exclusionist snobs and status-seeking social-climbers.
30890,142,72,368000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've told you, I don't like you using the word hotbed. Please, Lisa, we so rarely get to do things like this. And everybody -- everybody, please -- be on your best behavior. Bart, no grifting."
30891,142,73,379000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aww, raspberries."
30893,142,75,386000,Guard,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Name, please?"
30894,142,76,387000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Simpson family.
30895,142,77,388000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,We're not poor.
30896,142,78,392000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Well, we're not."
30897,142,79,393000,Guard,Springfield Glen Country Club,Go on in. They're expecting you at the clubhouse.
30899,142,81,400000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Wow. Livin' large!
30900,142,82,402000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Ohhh. I've always dreamed of coming here. Everybody keep smiling, and I know we're going fit right in."
30901,142,83,420000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Glen Country Club,Baaaahhhh!
30902,142,84,420000,Evelyn,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Oh, Marge, you made it. And you wore that lovely suit."
30903,142,85,425000,Evelyn,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Karen , Gillian , Elizabeth , Patricia , Roberta , Susan , meet Marge."
30905,142,87,434000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Pleased to meet you. You look like such a happy bunch... of people.
30906,142,88,441000,Dorothy Parker-ish Socialite,Springfield Glen Country Club,That's the trouble with first impressions. You only get to make one.
30908,142,90,447000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Oh, that reminds me of a funny apron I saw..."
30909,142,91,451000,Evelyn,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Uh, you know, Marge, your family doesn't have to stand in the alcove."
30910,142,92,455000,Evelyn,Springfield Glen Country Club,They're free to enjoy the club.
30911,142,93,458000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Uh, c'mon, kids, let's go sit in the car 'til your Mom's done fitting in."
30912,142,94,466000,Patricia,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Eliza-Beth is right. Why shout yourself hoarse at incompetent salesclerks, when you can get nearly everything mail-order?"
30913,142,95,473000,Evelyn,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Mmm-hmm, I won't eat anything unless it's shipped overnight from Vermont or Washington State."
30914,142,96,477000,Roberta,Springfield Glen Country Club,We order our steaks through The New Yorker.
30915,142,97,479000,Dorothy Parker-ish Socialite,Springfield Glen Country Club,I have a sneaking suspicion that L.L. Bean and Eddie Bauer are selling me the same honey.
30916,142,99,486000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"I get food through the mail, but in a different way. Every month Good Housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes. Sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you cook yourself."
30917,142,100,498000,Patricia,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Hmmm. That's very true, Marge. One night Wif and I came home late, and we decided not to wake Iris, and instead we microwaved our own soup."
30919,142,102,510000,Patricia,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Of course it was a horrible mess, but Iris didn't mind cleaning it up..."
30921,142,104,516000,Women,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Oh, that Iris is a gem. / Hooray for Wif! / Why can't my Thurston be more like Wif?"
30923,142,106,520000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Didn't everybody have a wonderful time? I thought it was so opulent -- like the Playboy Mansion, but non-sexual."
30924,142,107,528000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"That place is weird. A man in the bathroom kept handing me towels, 'til I paid him to stop."
30925,142,108,533000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You should've held out longer, boy."
30926,142,109,535000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The rich are different from you and me.
30927,142,110,537000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes. They're better. Socially better. And if we fit in, we can be better too. So today, while the rest of you were out being different, I did a very good job of fitting in. So good that Evelyn gave us a guest pass. They might even ask us to join!"
30928,142,111,552000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boy, Marge, you must've really done a number on those rich suckers."
30929,142,112,557000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, don't thank me. Thank my beautiful new suit."
30931,142,114,565000,Brittany Brockman,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Fritz, you idiot. I didn't order a bologna sandwich. I ordered an abalone sandwich."
30932,142,115,573000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,I don't know what Mom's thinking. This whole country club scene is so decadent...
30933,142,116,576000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"All these - spoiled - brats - and - their - smug, complacent parents. It just reinforces...the unspoken - class - system - of... horses - sitting - on - their - high... horses I'm sorry. I gotta go!"
148655,142,117,597000,Marge's Thoughts,Springfield Glen Country Club,We've got a winning hand. We can take the rest of the tricks!
148656,142,118,601000,Marge's Thoughts,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Ooh, you'd better be careful. The purpose of this game is to make friends. You don't make friends by winning."
148657,142,119,606000,Marge's Thoughts,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Still, there's nothing more popular than a gracious winner."
148658,142,120,609000,Marge's Thoughts,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Don't ask me, I'm just hair. Your head stopped eighteen inches ago."
30935,142,121,615000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Queen of Hearts. I believe all the rest are ours.
30936,142,122,619000,Roberta,Springfield Glen Country Club,Well played! We could have stopped them if you had changed to a different suit.
30937,142,123,624000,Dorothy Parker-ish Socialite,Springfield Glen Country Club,"I thought perhaps changing suits had gone out of fashion... eh, Marge?"
30941,142,127,643000,Tom Kite,Springfield Glen Country Club,"You know, Homer, the traditional way to cheat in golf is to lower your score."
30942,142,128,648000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,That's one way.
30943,142,129,649000,Tom Kite,Springfield Glen Country Club,"I'm the club pro, Tom Kite. How 'bout I give you a few pointers on your game? Now you don't want to over-think..."
30944,142,130,656000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Not an issue.
30945,142,131,658000,Tom Kite,Springfield Glen Country Club,Keep your head down.
30946,142,132,659000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Huh?
30947,142,133,660000,Tom Kite,Springfield Glen Country Club,Pretend there's no one else here...and just go at your own pace.
30948,142,134,669000,Tom Kite,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Wow! Very impressive! You're a natural, Mr. Simpson."
30949,142,135,672000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Really?
30950,142,136,674000,Tom Kite,Springfield Glen Country Club,Uh-huh. All you need is your own set of clubs.
30951,142,137,674000,Tom Kite,Springfield Glen Country Club,And stay the hell out of my locker! You can keep the shoes.
30953,142,139,684000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln had the same handicap?"
30954,142,140,687000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, please. I have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow."
30955,142,141,693000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, willya, Marge?"
30957,142,143,705000,Roberta,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Love your outfit, Marge. The vest says ""Let's have lunch,"" but the culottes say, ""You're paying!"""
30958,142,144,706000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Why thank you, Roberta."
30959,142,145,712000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Mom, look! I found something more fun than complaining!"
30960,142,146,719000,Evelyn,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Marge, your family is fitting in perfectly here. If all goes well at Saturday's ball, I'd love to sponsor you for membership."
30961,142,147,727000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Oh, that would be a dream come true. I'll be there with bells on!"
30962,142,148,733000,Dorothy Parker-ish Socialite,Springfield Glen Country Club,Bells? Where exactly will you be attaching them to that mangled Chanel suit?
30964,142,150,740000,Evelyn,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Oh, don't worry, Marge. Her idea of wit is nothing more than an incisive observation humorously phrased and delivered with impeccable timing. I'm sure you'll be a smash at the ball and I just know you'll have a lovely new outfit."
30966,142,152,761000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, that's some mighty fine chippin', Homer."
30967,142,153,763000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yeah. Can ya bank it into the handicapped stall?
30968,142,154,765000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Seat down.
30969,142,155,771000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hmmm. Who is that lavatory linksman, Smithers?"
30970,142,156,775000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Homer Simpson, Sir. One of the fork- and-spoon operators from Sector 7G."
30971,142,157,779000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, he's certainly got a loose waggle. Perhaps I've finally found a golfer worthy of a match with Monty Burns, eh?"
30972,142,158,786000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, his waggle is no match for yours, Sir. I've never seen you lose a game...except for that one in '74 when you let Richard Nixon win. That was very kind of you, Sir."
30973,142,159,794000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, he just looked so forlorn, Smithers, with his ""Oh, I can't go to prison, Monty! They'll eat me alive!"""
30975,142,161,799000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Say, I wonder if this Homer Nixon is any relation?"
30976,142,162,804000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Unlikely, Sir. They spell and pronounce their names differently."
30977,142,163,809000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Bah. Schedule a game and I'll ask him myself.
30979,142,165,811000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Oh, this game could mean big things for me, Marge. If I beat Mr. Burns, I mean really wallop him bad... I'm sure to get that big raise I've been gunning for."
30980,142,166,821000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"All right, all right, but if you win, don't make a scene and dance around with your ""woo-hoos,"" please. We can't afford a single slip-up. They're judging us."
30981,142,167,829000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Mom, did you like horses when you were my age? 'Cause I heard--"
30984,142,168,835000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"I don't know. Lisa, tonight is very important. Mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one."
30985,142,169,841000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Mom, do you want to know the fifteen reasons I like horses better than cars? One: a horse never--"
30986,142,170,845000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"I really need to concentrate on this, Lisa, would you mind--"
30987,142,171,847000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,You know how a horse goes like this? Mom? Like this? Mom?
30988,142,172,851000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"...I've already altered this so many times, it's nearly impossible to..."
30989,142,173,855000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!
30990,142,174,856000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"LISA, PLEASE!!"
30992,142,176,869000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,No-No-NO-NO-NOOO!
30993,142,177,876000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"At times like this, I guess all you can do is laugh."
30995,142,179,889000,Marge Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,I need a formal dress for tonight!
30996,142,180,892000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,You've come to the right place.
30997,142,181,894000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,We've got classy duds up the ying-yang.
30998,142,182,896000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"I call this one ""Fantasy in Maroon."""
30999,142,183,896000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"It's got some cigarette burns, but we can patch 'em up with Nu-Vinyl."
31000,142,184,902000,Marge Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Mmm, it's a bit peppery for me. Why don't we put this in the ""maybe"" pile."
31001,142,185,908000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"This was originally a Halloween costume, but it found its way into my regular rotation."
31002,142,186,914000,Marge Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Uh-huh.
31004,142,188,917000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Good morning, Mr. Burns. Beautiful day to be outside, isn't it?"
31005,142,189,921000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Rant on, Simpson, but your vainglorious boasting will only add savor to my inevitable triumph."
31006,142,190,928000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Yes.
31007,142,191,933000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Woo hoooooooooo--
31009,142,193,937000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Yes. You're in deep ""D'oh"" now."
31010,142,194,949000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Perfect as always, Sir. Right on the green."
31012,142,196,959000,C. Montgomery Burns,Golf Course,"Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club! The sand wedge!"
31013,142,197,965000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,"Mmm, open-faced club sand wedge..."
31014,142,200,975000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Glen Country Club,"You're four strokes behind, Simpson."
31016,142,202,983000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Oh, a cunning stratagem, Sir. It's curving right toward the green... and... it's... there."
31017,142,203,992000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,He got to the green in one shot?!
31018,142,204,995000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,How - can - that - old - man - hit - SO - FAR?!!
31019,142,205,1002000,Tom Kite,Springfield Glen Country Club,Now keep your head down... Ignore all distractions...
31023,142,209,1014000,Marge Simpson,FASHION MART,Miss... Miss! Do you have a Chanel suit or any other high-quality clothes?
31024,142,210,1020000,Saleslady,FASHION MART,"No, ma'am. But we do have a shipment of slightly burnt Sears Activewear coming in this afternoon."
31025,142,211,1025000,Marge Simpson,FASHION MART,"Oh, I give up."
31026,142,212,1027000,Cletus Spuckler,FASHION MART,What time and how burnt?
31028,142,214,1029000,C. Montgomery Burns,Golf Course,"Cripes, man, can't you ever get to the green in less than two shots?"
31030,142,216,1039000,C. Montgomery Burns,Golf Course,"Smithers, what are you doing up here?"
31031,142,217,1041000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,And what are you doing with his ball?
31032,142,218,1042000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,And all those other balls?!
31033,142,219,1044000,Waylon Smithers,Golf Course,"There are no other balls. Uh, just these, uh, reptile eggs! Ooh, step away, they're endangered!"
31034,142,220,1053000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,"These aren't reptile eggs! You've been cheating! No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball, you put a fresh one on the green!"
31035,142,221,1061000,C. Montgomery Burns,Golf Course,"Cheating for me? Good lord, Smithers, that's patently unnecessary. I'm one of the world's finest golfers! In all the years you've caddied for me, I've never lost a-- Oh."
31036,142,222,1074000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,So you're not the best golfer here! Wait'll I tell everyone about this! You stink!
31037,142,223,1082000,Waylon Smithers,Golf Course,"You know, Homer, Mr. Burns holds a lot of sway at this club. If you would keep quiet about the alleged... decades of cheating, I'm sure he'd support your application for membership tonight."
31038,142,224,1090000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,Bull-honkey! I don't care about joining this stupid club.
31039,142,225,1093000,C. Montgomery Burns,Golf Course,But does your wife?
31040,142,226,1100000,Krusty the Clown,Golf Course,I knew my kind wasn't welcome here.
31041,142,230,1117000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, you are lookin' fab-u-lous."
31042,142,231,1120000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, you look great! You can do anything with that sewing machine."
31043,142,232,1124000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I can't. C'mon, let's go."
31044,142,233,1126000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean it's a new dress? Where did you get it?
31045,142,234,1128000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The outlet store.
31046,142,235,1129000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, two finds in one store! What are the odds?"
31047,142,236,1132000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Call it fate. Let's go...
31048,142,237,1133000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How much did it cost?
31049,142,238,1134000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,A dollar. Let's go.
31050,142,239,1135000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,With tax or without?
31051,142,240,1136000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Without. Let me go!
31052,142,241,1137000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So with tax, how much was it?"
31053,142,242,1138000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why do you have to question everything I do?!!
31054,142,243,1140000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You look nice, is all."
31057,142,246,1148000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Homer, what are you doing?"
31058,142,247,1149000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,I'm driving up to the main building. They've got valet parking tonight.
31059,142,248,1152000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,We can't drive this up there. They'll see the dent. They'll see the coat hanger antenna. Stop the car. We're walking.
31060,142,249,1158000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"But Marge, valets. For once, maybe someone will call me ""Sir,"" without adding ""you're making a scene."""
31062,142,251,1161000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"I'm gonna regale everyone with my anecdote. You know, the one I tried to say on the radio? Heh, heh, who's gonna bleep me this time?"
31063,142,252,1178000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,I'm gonna pose as an Italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money.
31064,142,253,1183000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"I'm gonna ask people if they know their servants' last names, or, in the case of butlers, their first."
31065,142,254,1188000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"No, no, no! Not tonight! No vulgarity, no mischief, no politics. Just be good."
31066,142,255,1198000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"I'm sorry, Mom. I'll behave."
31067,142,256,1200000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,I won't say anything controversial.
31068,142,257,1202000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"I just won't say anything, okay, honey?"
31069,142,258,1211000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"You kids should thank your mother. Now that she's a better person, we can see how awful we really are."
31070,142,259,1227000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Come here, Maggie."
31071,142,260,1230000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Oh, Homie, I like your in-your-face humanity. I like the way Lisa speaks her mind. I like Bart's... I like Bart. And I like my old green dress. I didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown."
31072,142,261,1248000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Our savings?!
31074,142,263,1250000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Don't worry, I saved the receipt. We'll have a $3,300 credit at Chanel."
31075,142,264,1254000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"They have beer and gum, right?"
31076,142,265,1256000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"C'mon, let's go. I wouldn't want to join any club that would have this me as a member."
31077,142,266,1263000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,It's okay. Those snobs never would've made us members anyway.
31078,142,267,1270000,Evelyn,Springfield Glen Country Club,I wonder where Marge could be? She's missing her own initiation.
31079,142,268,1274000,Dorothy Parker-ish Socialite,Springfield Glen Country Club,I hope she didn't take my attempt to destroy her too seriously.
31080,142,269,1280000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Where's Homer? Oh, and to think I spent all afternoon baking him this cake."
31081,142,270,1289000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Glen Country Club,I pickled the figs myself.
31083,142,272,1298000,Employee,Krusty Burger,"Hey, did you guys just come from the prom?"
31084,142,273,1301000,Bart Simpson,Krusty Burger,Sort of.
31085,142,274,1302000,Marge Simpson,Krusty Burger,"But, you know, we realized we're more comfortable in a place like this."
31086,142,275,1309000,Employee,Krusty Burger,"Man, you're crazy! This place is a dump."
