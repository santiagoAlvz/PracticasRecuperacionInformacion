13652,79,24,153000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Hello, Seymour."
13653,79,25,155000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,So what's the word down at One School Board Plaza?
13654,79,26,157000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,We're dropping the geography requirement. The children weren't testing well. It was proving to be an embarrassment.
13655,79,27,162000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Very good. Back to the three R's.
13656,79,28,162000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Two R's come October.
13657,79,29,165000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Hm. What do you think of the banners?
13658,79,30,168000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Nothing but transparent toadying.
13659,79,31,170000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,They were the children's idea. I tried to stop them.
13660,79,32,173000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"It's always the children's fault, isn't it, Seymour?"
13661,79,33,176000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, yes it is, sir."
13663,79,35,178000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Imagine, a school out there with no bullies."
13664,79,36,182000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,Science geeks not getting beat up... kids using their lunch money for food...
13665,79,37,188000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I can't take it!
13666,79,38,194000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, I think I can squeeze through that vent."

13680,79,52,230000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Ach, my beauty, wait till the Superintendent sees you. Were it not a violation of God's law, I'd make ye my wife."
13681,79,53,240000,Scottish Woman,Springfield Elementary School,Now there is a lonely man.
13682,79,54,249000,Scottish Woman,Springfield Elementary School,I'm new in town. Be there a cool loch where a lass could wash her long red hair?
13683,79,55,255000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Nay, but there's a pool at me apartment complex. There was a rat in the deep end -- but we got him!"
13684,79,56,262000,Scottish Woman,Springfield Elementary School,Ah! Lead on.
13685,79,57,265000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Forty-eight... forty-nine... fifty. Flag's up to date. Very good, Seymour. Now, are these children as smart as they look?"

13693,79,65,289000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Let's go.
13694,79,66,292000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Did that boy say what's a battle?
13695,79,67,292000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,No he said what's that rattle. It's about the heating duct.
13696,79,68,296000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Hm, it sounded like battle."
13697,79,69,298000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I've had a cold.

13704,79,76,324000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Let's go.

13710,79,82,341000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"Seymour, you run a tight ship."
13711,79,83,343000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"Well, you know what they say, sir. ""Where there's no smoke, there's no fire."""
13712,79,84,347000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Yard,What an odd remark.
13713,79,85,349000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"Why, that looks like a fifty cent piece. I'll just bend over and get it."
13714,79,86,355000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Yard,It seems to be caught between these two flowers.
13715,79,87,359000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Yard,NOOOOO!
13717,79,89,362000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Ow, ow, ow. Seymour I was thinking of promoting you to Assistant Superintendent. But, instead, that plum goes to Holloway."

13724,79,96,382000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"There's no detention this time, Simpson. This is the end. You are expelled from Springfield Elementary!"
13728,79,100,402000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Tonight on ""Eye on Springfield"": The Munchkins from ""The Wizard of Oz""... Where are they now?"
13729,79,101,408000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,And we'll visit a nudist camp... for animals!
13730,79,102,412000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"But first, a look at the local holiday that was called ""distasteful"" and ""Puerile"" by a panel of hillbillies. Whacking Day!"
13731,79,103,421000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh no. No!
13732,79,104,423000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,In a tradition that dates back to founding father Jebediah Springfield...every May 10th local residents gather to drive snakes into the center of town and whack them to snake heaven.

13743,79,115,471000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, Dad. I don't need school. I'll make my way as a bootblack. Shine yer boots Guv'nor?"
13744,79,116,476000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No son of mine is gonna be a 19th Century Cockney bootblack. We're gonna find you another school.
13746,79,118,487000,Marge Simpson,RELIGIOUS SCHOOL,Now remember Bart. This is a religious school. So be very careful about what you say and do here.

13748,79,120,493000,Mr. Ogden,RELIGIOUS SCHOOL,"Now Bart, since you're new here, perhaps you'd favor us with a psalm."
13749,79,121,498000,Bart Simpson,RELIGIOUS SCHOOL,"How about ""Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit?"""
13750,79,122,498000,Mr. Ogden,RELIGIOUS SCHOOL,"Well, beans were a staple of the Israelites... yes, proceed."

13753,79,124,508000,Mr. Ogden,RELIGIOUS SCHOOL,"Avert your eyes, children, he may take on other forms!"
13755,79,126,523000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess that's it. I just can't be educated. I can always get a job testing dangerous food additives.
13756,79,127,532000,Scientist #1,Simpson Home,"We'd like you to try this new diet cola. We call it ""Nature's Goodness."""

13767,79,138,573000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But killing snakes is evil.
13768,79,139,575000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe so, Lisa, but it's part of our oh-so-human nature. Inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved."
13769,79,140,586000,Evil Homer,Simpson Home,I AM EVIL HO-MER... I AM EVIL HO-MER... I AM EVIL HO-MER... I AM EVIL HO-MER...
13770,79,141,598000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Have a nice day at school, Lis. I'll just try to make the best of a bad situation. Ahhh..."
13771,79,142,607000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart. Get dressed for school. I expect you to be in your seat when the bell rings.

13776,79,147,630000,Bart Simpson,GARAGE,I didn't do it.
13777,79,148,656000,Marge Simpson,GARAGE,"Oh, that's right. I invited a guest speaker to talk to the class."

13808,79,181,802000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Then, what should I do?"
13809,79,182,804000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time. Like that day I hit the referee with a whiskey bottle. Remember that?
