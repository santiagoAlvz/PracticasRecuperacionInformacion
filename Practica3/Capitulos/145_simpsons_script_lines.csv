31567,145,5,50000,Announcer,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,"Our first race is a benefit for daredevil Lance Murdock , who's hospitalized with cirrhosis of the liver !"
31568,145,6,60000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,All right! Liver!
31569,145,7,64000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,"Boy, it sure would be fun to carpool in one of those, huh, kids? I'd be a real hot-rod mama, wouldn't I? Huh? Huh?"
31570,145,8,71000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,"You missed the race, mama."
31571,145,9,73000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,I wish I'd pay more attention.
31572,145,10,78000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,"Smithers, this beer isn't working. I don't feel any younger or ""funkier."""
31573,145,11,83000,Waylon Smithers,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,"I'll switch to the tablespoon, Sir."

31551,145,19,121000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,Excellent.
31579,145,20,128000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,"Oh, this novelty foam hand is ludicrously oversized. Go swap it for a smaller one."
31580,145,21,134000,Waylon Smithers,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,"It is a bit ostentatious, Sir. I'll be right back."
31581,145,22,140000,Lenny Leonard,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,"Hey, Burnsie! Ha! -- This was some swell shindig. Thank you very much."
31582,145,23,145000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,Smithers! What's happening?!
31583,145,24,146000,Lenny Leonard,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,I had a great time and... and I just want to shake your hand...

31587,145,28,157000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,Smithers!
31588,145,29,159000,Waylon Smithers,SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP,Oh my God!
31591,145,32,168000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Limo,"You should've seen the murderous glint in his eye, Smithers. And his breath reeked of beer and pretzeld bread."
31592,145,33,176000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Limo,"I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns. This was all my fault."
31593,145,34,178000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Limo,"Oh, don't concern yourself. If things had turned ugly I always had my mace."
31594,145,35,183000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Limo,"Don't let me off the hook that easily, Sir. I failed you and I'll never forgive myself. Never! Never! Never!"
31596,145,37,195000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Limo,Never! Never! Never!
31598,145,39,200000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Good morning, Sir. To make up for my failure last night, I've alphabetized your breakfast. You can start with the waffles, and work your way up to the zwieback. And to prevent newsprint from rubbing off on your hands, I've laminated today's newspaper."
31599,145,40,213000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I appreciate the thought, but my pen won't write on this. How am I supposed to do the ""Junior Jumble?"""
31600,145,41,220000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, I can't even grovel properly! I'm a buffoon! I don't deserve to live on your planet anymore!"
31601,145,42,233000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Huh?
31602,145,43,233000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Pull yourself together, man! I dare say you're in need of a long vacation."
31603,145,44,237000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No! Don't make me take a vacation! Without you, I'll wither and die."
31604,145,45,242000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That's a risk I'm willing to take.
31552,145,46,243000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"But what would you do without me, Sir?"
31605,145,47,245000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Tchah! I'm not a baby who needs a nursemaid to burp me. You see? Now I insist you take a vacation just as soon as a temporary substitute can be found.
31607,145,49,261000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I've got to find a replacement who won't outshine me. Perhaps if I search the employee evaluations for the word ""incompetent..."""
31608,145,50,264000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"714 names! Huh. Better be more specific. ""Lazy"", ""Clumsy"", ""Dimwitted"", ""Monstrously Ugly""."
31609,145,51,273000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Aw, nuts to this. I'll just go get Homer Simpson."
31611,145,53,285000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. Everyone always says they have to work a lot harder when I'm around.
31612,145,54,292000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, Dad, assisting Mr. Burns could give your career a real shot in the arm."
31613,145,55,296000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, Homer, assisting Mr. Burns could give your career a real shot in the arm."
31614,145,56,300000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mo-omm! I just said that!
31615,145,57,302000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Sor-ry. Next time get your own darned corn.
31617,145,59,306000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Um, is this the chair I'll be sitting on?"
31618,145,60,308000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yah. Now I realize caring for Mr. Burns seems like a big job, but actually it's just 2800 small jobs."
31619,145,61,315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh-huh. But this is the chair, right?"
31620,145,62,316000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Your new duties will include answering Mr. Burns' phone, preparing his tax return, moistening his eyeballs, assisting with his chewing and swallowing, lying to Congress, and some light typing."
31621,145,63,326000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Montgomery Burns' office... Oh, hello Mrs. Burns... I'll see if your son is available."
31622,145,64,331000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Mr. Burns has a mother!? She must be a hundred million years old!
31623,145,65,335000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,She has limited capacities. All she can do is dial and yell.
31624,145,66,338000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I'm sorry, Monty can't come to the phone right now. He's in a very important meeting and can't be disturbed."
31628,145,68,349000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh-huh... Okay, I'll give him the message. Mr. Burns can't stand talking to his mother. He never forgave her for having that affair with President Taft."
31629,145,69,359000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Heh, heh. Taft, you old dog..."
31630,145,70,364000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Really, Smithers, I'll be fine! I'm sure your replacement will be able to handle everything. Who is he, anyway?"
31631,145,71,371000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, Homer Simpson, Sir. One of your organ banks from sector 7-G. All the recent events of your life have revolved around him in some way."
31632,145,72,380000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Simpson, eh?"
31633,145,73,381000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, Mr. Smithers? I don't understand 2700 of my new duties."
31634,145,74,387000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, the van's leaving. Which one duty is giving you the most trouble?"
31635,145,75,390000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Um, what do I do in case of fire?"
31636,145,76,394000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sorry, can't hear you. Bye-bye!"
31637,145,77,402000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Just my luck.
31638,145,78,414000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Good lord, Smithers! You look atrocious. I thought I told you to take a vacation."
31639,145,79,418000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, Smithers already left, Sir. I'm his replacement, Homer Simpson."
31640,145,80,422000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ah, yes, Simpson. I'll have my lunch now. A single pillow of shredded wheat, some steamed toast, and a dodo egg."
31641,145,81,429000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,But I think the dodo went extinct...
31642,145,82,430000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Get going! And answer those phones, install a computer system, and rotate my office so the window faces the hills."
31643,145,83,436000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. Um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? The things?"
31645,145,85,460000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lousy two-legged pants.
31646,145,86,462000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. ""Little Rascals"" isn't on 'til 6."
31647,145,87,467000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I know. I'm taping it. I want to get to Mr. Burns' house bright and early to make his breakfast.
31648,145,88,471000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, poor Homie. Poor, poor..."
31650,145,90,484000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Hmmm. One of these must be a breakfast maker.
31651,145,91,487000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Well, it's my job to cook him breakfast, and I'm gonna cook the best damned breakfast he ever ate!"
31626,145,92,516000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Dough-nuts?! I told you I don't like ethnic food!
31627,145,93,520000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Here. Tell me how my stocks did yesterday.
31652,145,94,522000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Uh... they all won.
31653,145,95,526000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Eh? What about my options?
31654,145,96,528000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Well, you can either get up or go back to sleep."
31655,145,97,530000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,I believe I'll get up.
31657,145,99,533000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Scrub harder. Got to get that layer of dead skin off.
31660,145,102,539000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,I think the fangs today.
31662,145,104,549000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Simpson? Simpson?
31663,145,105,554000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Did you get that report on the accounting department?
31664,145,106,557000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes, Sir, I did."

31668,145,110,583000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Is it about my cube?
31669,145,111,584000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It's Mr. Smithers. He's calling for you.
31671,145,113,586000,Waylon Smithers,Tropical Beach,"How is everything going there, sir?... Well, I have a lot of free time on my hands. If you Fed Ex'd me your mail, I'd be happy to open it and return it to you."
31673,145,115,593000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Everything's fine, Smithers. But this Simpson fellow seems to be getting dumber by the minute. I've never seen anything quite like it... Anyhoo, you just enjoy your vacation."
31677,145,119,606000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look alive, Simpson! I'm not paying you to goldbrick!"
31678,145,120,610000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes! Yes, sir!"

31684,145,125,620000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, stop exploiting your father. Homie, why don't you lie down and relax."
31685,145,126,624000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns wants me to do some long division."

31697,145,138,657000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Nothing other than drive me to distraction with his incompetent boobery. Terrible at everything. A complete moron. But I'm not really free to talk right now.
31698,145,139,667000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Look, stop calling me and start enjoying your vacation. Remember, I want to see lots of pictures when you get back."
31700,145,141,673000,Waylon Smithers,TROPICAL NIGHT CLUB,"Ah... actually, Sir, picture taking is not allowed at this particular resort. Whoops, I've got to go now -- there's a line forming behind me."

31703,145,144,692000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I asked for light starch on my nightcap!

31708,145,149,708000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You're a travesty of a truke of an assistant.
31711,145,152,730000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Is there something wrong, Homie?"
31712,145,153,733000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No.

31715,145,156,740000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"What happened, Dad?"
31716,145,157,741000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I punched Mr. Burns right in his 104 year-old face.
31717,145,158,744000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you sure he's dead? Maybe you just really really hurt him.
31718,145,159,747000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay. Maybe everything's all right. Maybe if you go apologize, he won't even fire you. If he's alive."
31720,145,161,759000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Mr. Burns?
31722,145,163,771000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I'm really sorry I hit you, Mr. Burns. Here, let me put some salt on that eye."

31726,145,167,787000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I've seen people activate this machine a thousand times. Doesn't seem to be any trick to it... Let's see... Smithers... ""S-M-I-T-H-E-R-S"". Success! It's ringing!"

Listen to me, you... when I catch you, I'm going to pull out your eyes and shove 'em up your pants so you can watch me kick the crap out of you. Okay? Then I'm going to use your tongue to paint my boat."
31732,145,173,825000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, Smithers, if only you could hear me."
31734,145,175,828000,Waylon Smithers,Tropical Beach,Something tells me Mr. Burns needs me.
31736,145,177,835000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Praise God, I think the thug has finally gone home for the day."
31737,145,178,838000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Now I can make my escape...
31738,145,179,843000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hi, Mr. Burns. Do you want your coffee now?"

31740,145,181,849000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hear that? The percolations are imminent! No need to come in! Cease your ingress!
31741,145,182,860000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Stay back, Homer! Approach no further. Coffee's already made. I stomped the beans myself."
31742,145,183,865000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, can I at least drive you home, Mr. Burns? It's five o'clock."
31743,145,184,868000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No... I thought... I thought, uh, I'd chauffeur myself this evening! Yes, that's what I thought. How difficult can it be? I'm sure the manual will indicate which lever is the velocitator and which the deceleratrix."
31745,145,186,880000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Car,"I can't believe it! All my life I've avoided doing things for myself, but I'm actually enjoying this. Plus I'm making incredible time."

31748,145,189,894000,Chief Wiggum,Street,"Ahh, that's some nice reckless driving, Mr. B!"
31750,145,191,899000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you, sir?"
31751,145,192,903000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Already taken care of.
31752,145,193,906000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Cappuccino, Simpson?"
31753,145,194,909000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ahoy-hoy? No, you have the wrong number. This is 5-2-4-6. I suspect you need more practice working your telephone machine. Not at all. Ahoy."
31754,145,195,921000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Mr. Burns, is there anything at all I can do for you?"
31755,145,196,924000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, Homer. You've already done more for me than any man. Your brutal attack forced me to fend for myself. I realize now that being waited on hand and foot is okay for your average Joe, but it's not for me. I want to thank you."
31756,145,197,940000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
31757,145,198,944000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh my God! I knew I shouldn't have left!
31758,145,199,947000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ah, welcome back, Smithers. Say, do you know Homer Simpson? He pitched in around the office while you were away. Bang up job, Simpson, but I guess it's back to your trusty post in sector 7-G."
31759,145,200,958000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You heard the man, Simpson."
