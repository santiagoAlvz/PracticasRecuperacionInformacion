113312,437,1,87000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Did you unscrew all the Phillips heads?
113313,437,2,88000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Check. Did you unscrew all the flat heads?
113314,437,3,90000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Yep. And now we wait.
113316,437,5,115000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, go hide the evidence while I walk around saying ""What happened? Who would do such a thing?"""
113317,437,6,115000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,I'll return these to the shop room -- what's left of it.
113318,437,7,129000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Skin-ner!
113319,437,8,132000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Shh. Don't tell him I'm here.
113320,437,9,133000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"I know you're there, Skinner! I'd recognize those discolored Hush Puppies anywhere."
113321,437,10,138000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Hear that? He thinks my Try 'N' Save brand Shush Mutts are genuine Hush Puppies.
113323,437,12,148000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"We've got the ""how"" , and we've got the ""who"" , but we don't have the ""why."""
113324,437,13,148000,Groundskeeper Willie,Skinner's Office,Here 'tis.
113325,437,14,156000,Groundskeeper Willie,Skinner's Office,"Hard to believe one lad can cause all this mayhem. Particularly a lad who failed ""Introduction to Unscrewing."""
113326,437,15,159000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"And I don't buy this ""lone prankster"" theory. I think there was a second ""funman."" And if you don't identify him, you're looking at a week's suspension."
113327,437,16,176000,Milhouse Van Houten,Skinner's Office,A nickel?
113328,437,17,176000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Milhouse, you realize, if you're suspended, you'll be missing... taco Wednesday."
113329,437,18,181000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Crunchy shell, ground beef, lettuce, mild sauce... and of course, shredded cheddar cheese!"
113330,437,19,202000,Milhouse Van Houten,Skinner's Office,I'll never tell!
113331,437,20,204000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Consider yourself suspended, mister. Willie, take him to the big house -- where he lives."
113332,437,21,209000,Groundskeeper Willie,Skinner's Office,"Let's go, lad."
113333,437,22,212000,Groundskeeper Willie,Skinner's Office,Suspended boy walkin'!
113335,437,24,227000,Bart Simpson,ALCATRAZ AVENUE,"Thanks for not selling me out, man."
113336,437,25,230000,Milhouse Van Houten,ALCATRAZ AVENUE,"This really sucks, Bart. I'm grounded, and spend all day listening to my Dad yell at ""Mad Money"" with Jim Cramer."
113337,437,26,237000,Kirk Van Houten,ALCATRAZ AVENUE,You said tech stocks were bulletproof!
113338,437,27,241000,Bart Simpson,ALCATRAZ AVENUE,"Look, I gotta go. But don't worry, I'll visit you every day. I promise."
113339,437,28,246000,Milhouse Van Houten,ALCATRAZ AVENUE,Bart -- you're a true friend.
113340,437,29,251000,Milhouse Van Houten,ALCATRAZ AVENUE,Byyyyyye.
113342,437,31,253000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Well, I'm glad they suspended Milhouse. He's a bad influence on you."
113343,437,32,259000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"You know, I think Milhouse is ""El Barto."" Hmmmm."
113344,437,33,265000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"And now, you're gonna visit your Grampa while I park around the corner and take a nap."
113346,437,35,279000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"So Grampa, not like I'm anxious to go, but I've been here ten minutes, which is like seven hours in kid years..."
113348,437,37,288000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,It's her! The little girl who doesn't recoil at the sight of us.
113349,437,38,292000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Huh?
113350,437,39,298000,Jenny,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Hi guys, I brought cookies!"
113351,437,40,301000,Jenny,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Chocolate chip for Donald, low sodium for Abe, ""not made by immigrants"" for Sam, and imaginary for Major Preston..."
113353,437,41,310000,MAJOR PRESTON,Springfield Retirement Castle,With this cookie I can buy back Private O'Malley from the Zulus.
113354,437,42,314000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"I think it is so cool what you are doing. So what's the gag? You put ex-lax in the cookies, then just sit back and watch the fireworks?"
113355,437,43,323000,Jenny,Springfield Retirement Castle,I would never do that!
113356,437,44,324000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, right. Um, I was thinking of other things that are hilarious. Like... things that you think are funny."
113357,437,45,330000,Jenny,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yeah, those are funny."
113358,437,46,332000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Yeah. I'm Bart.
113359,437,47,334000,Jenny,Springfield Retirement Castle,I'm Jenny.
148678,437,48,336000,Bart's Thoughts,Springfield Retirement Castle,"She had more curves than a Hot Wheels track. Well, she didn't yet, but she would after puberty."
113360,437,49,343000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh my God, how long was I zoned out?"
113361,437,50,345000,Jenny,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Bart, this is my Aunt Belle. We dress alike. Isn't that cute?"
113363,437,52,350000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Math, done. Pine cone, collected. Permission slip, signed. Now time for a break -- a little social studies."
113364,437,53,360000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"""What will Springfield be like in fifty years?"" Let's see what the computer says:"
113365,437,54,370000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,That's horrible. What else?
113366,437,55,375000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Oh my God!
113368,437,57,382000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,It just gets worse and worse.
113370,437,59,389000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"So, who's the special someone?"
113371,437,60,391000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Jenny. Fifth grade girl.
113372,437,61,392000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Whoa, she gets to use the real scissors. Nice."
113373,437,62,397000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"When she talks to me, I feel like a better person."
113374,437,63,400000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Powerful stuff. You'd better claim her as your own. Punch her in her arm, or if you're really serious, stick gum in her hair. Here -- I always come prepared."
113375,437,64,411000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Take two. You might get lucky.
113376,437,65,417000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, Jenny."
113377,437,66,419000,Jenny,Springfield Elementary School,"Hi, Bart."
113378,437,67,423000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Boy, you make it look effortless. And that kid's giving you zero pump."
113379,437,68,426000,Jenny,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, you know what a girl likes to hear."
113381,437,69,429000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Seal the deal! Punch her! Punch her!
113382,437,70,434000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Punch herrrr!
113383,437,71,438000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, do you want to go on a picnic tomorrow? You'd love my P.B. and J. The secret is, no P.B., double J."
113384,437,72,445000,Jenny,Springfield Elementary School,It's a date!
113385,437,73,448000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes!!! Willie, I've got a girlfriend!"
113386,437,74,453000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Really? Well, eh, I do too. She's... a bikini model from Sweden."
113387,437,75,459000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, that's great."
113388,437,76,466000,Swedish Woman,Springfield Elementary School,"Willie, darling, come back to bed. Don't you love me?"
113389,437,77,470000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't compete with my job, Inga. You'll never win."
113391,437,79,479000,Miss Hoover,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"And now Ralph Wiggum will read his essay on ""Springfield in fifty years."""
113392,437,80,479000,Ralph Wiggum,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"In fifty years, the vacuum cleaner will be quiet and not scary."
113393,437,81,479000,Miss Hoover,Miss Hoover's Classroom,Next we have Lisa Simpson.
113394,437,82,495000,Lisa Simpson,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"Oh Ralph, how I envy your optimism. There is no Springfield fifty years in the future! With global warming trapping the CO2 inside our poisonous atmosphere, our super-heated oceans will rise, drowning our lowlands, leaving what's left of humanity baking in deserts that once fed the world!"
113395,437,83,516000,Lisa Simpson,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"And in the new Nineveh , darkness falls."
113397,437,85,527000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Lisa, your outburst was either a sign of deep emotional imbalance, or a passionate response to a sobering truth. Luckily, the treatment for both is intensive therapy."
113398,437,86,536000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,What's therapy gonna do for me when the world is in ashes?
113399,437,87,539000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Oh, I don't know. But when you go, could you return this Sports Illustrated for me?"
113400,437,88,543000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Someone must've, uh, put it in my bag. They do that, you know. They're always putting things in my bag!"
113402,437,90,551000,Jenny,Park,"So, you visit old folks. How else do you make the world a better place?"
113403,437,91,555000,Bart Simpson,Park,Uh... I...
113404,437,92,559000,Bart Simpson,Park,"I spend a lot of time working with this mentally-challenged guy. Why, here he is now. Lookin' good, Homer!"
113405,437,93,566000,Homer Simpson,Park,Boy.
113380,437,94,568000,Jenny,Park,He seems pretty high-functioning.
113406,437,95,570000,Bart Simpson,Park,Just wait.
113352,437,96,571000,Homer Simpson,Park,Don't shake your fist at me!
113407,437,97,574000,Homer Simpson,Park,"Look, man, I don't want any trouble. C'mon -- here, here, just take my wallet. Leave me alone, okay?"
113408,437,98,578000,Bart Simpson,Park,"Do you know who else was really into rowboats? Jesus. And he could've turned his rowboat into a jet ski, but he didn't. Good guy."
113409,437,99,590000,Jenny,Park,Cheese and crackers! Look!
113411,437,101,595000,Jimbo Jones,Park,"Oh, you want your duckling back? Here it is. Psych!"
113413,437,103,601000,DOLPH,Park,"That'll teach you to match wits with us, you stupid mother duck!"
113414,437,104,606000,Jenny,Park,Bart! Can't you do something?
113415,437,105,613000,Bart Simpson,Park,Those bullies are gonna kill me! Why am I doing this?
113416,437,106,618000,Bart Simpson,Park,"Oh, yeah."
113417,437,107,622000,Bart Simpson,Park,"Please, guys, give me a break. Can you give me the duckling without beating me up?"
113418,437,108,626000,Jimbo Jones,Park,Well... we'll have to beat you up a little.
113419,437,109,628000,Bart Simpson,Park,"C'mon, I'm trying to impress a girl."
113420,437,110,630000,DOLPH,Park,So are we.
113421,437,111,632000,Sleazy Girl,Park,Either the duck suffers or the kid does. Or none of youse gettin' nothin' from Shauna. I'm Shauna.
113422,437,112,646000,Jenny,Park,"Oh Bart, if those ducklings understood how magnificent you were, they'd stop biting your leg."
113425,437,115,657000,Psychiatrist,Psychiatrist's Office,We believe Lisa is suffering from Environment Related Despair.
113426,437,116,663000,Homer Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Oh, it's even worse when you know it has a name."
113427,437,117,666000,Psychiatrist,Psychiatrist's Office,"Now don't worry, she'll be fine after years of expensive treatment. And, we have a new drug to combat this syndrome: Ignorital."
113428,437,118,674000,Psychiatrist,Psychiatrist's Office,Let me show you how Ignorital works...
113429,437,119,676000,Psychiatrist,Psychiatrist's Office,It turns this... to this!
113431,437,121,680000,Marge Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Lisa is a little young to be taking ""happy pills."""
113432,437,122,680000,Homer Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Marge, we came to an appointment in the middle of the day. That's the most a parent can do."
113433,437,123,689000,Homer Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,We done here?
113434,437,124,690000,Lisa Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Oh, go ahead -- numb me."
113435,437,125,695000,Bart Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Mom, can I get those dishes for you?"
113436,437,126,699000,Marge Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"What's your angle, Mister?"
113437,437,127,701000,Bart Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,No angle.
113438,437,128,703000,Bart Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Um, if this girl I'm seeing comes here, and she might, I wouldn't mind if you told her I was the kind of boy that does the dishes."
113439,437,129,709000,Homer Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Yeah, busboys get all the chicks."
113440,437,130,714000,Lisa Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Well, off to school where they'll prepare our little minds for a future we'll never see."
113442,437,132,730000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,I'm going to Dizzyland!
113445,437,135,759000,Bart Simpson,Dining Room,"So this is setting the table. If I'd known how easy this was, I'd have just done it instead of throwing all those tantrums."
113446,437,136,766000,Marge Simpson,Dining Room,"Oh, Bart, I don't care that this is just an act. You've finally become the boy every mother dreams of: a girl."
113447,437,137,783000,Jenny,Dining Room,"You never told me that the ""special"" man you were working with is your father."
113448,437,138,788000,Bart Simpson,Dining Room,Uh... it's not an easy thing to admit.
113449,437,139,796000,Jenny,Dining Room,Is the rest of your family... okay?
113450,437,140,801000,Bart Simpson,Dining Room,Uh... well...
113451,437,141,803000,Lisa Simpson,Dining Room,"Hello, Smiley Face. Hello, Smiley Face."
113452,437,142,811000,Wiggum Smiley Face,Dining Room,Officer down!
113453,437,143,812000,Marge Simpson,Dining Room,"Jenny, it's amazing what you've done with my son."
113455,437,145,818000,Jenny,Dining Room,"Well, I think Bart is an incredible combination of Habitat For Humanity and the Jonas Brothers."
113456,437,146,818000,Jenny,Dining Room,And nothing can ever change my opinion about him.
113457,437,147,832000,Bart Simpson,Dining Room,"We don't have any money! Go away! May I de-corn your cob, my darling?"
113460,437,150,844000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Why didn't you come to visit me, Bart?"
113461,437,151,847000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I meant to, I've just been sooo busy. My schedule has been all like ."
113462,437,152,850000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,But what could be more important than your best friend?
113463,437,153,855000,Jenny,Simpson Home,"Who's this, Bart?"
113464,437,154,859000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Oh. I see how it is. Actually, I don't. My glasses are fogged."
113466,437,156,872000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Bart, I learned some great new swear words from my uncle! He's got a broken back so he's in constant pain."
113467,437,157,879000,Jenny,Simpson Home,Bart? Would you be interested in swears?
113468,437,158,882000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, because only by knowing them can you prevent bad little kids from saying them."
113469,437,159,888000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What do you want from me?!
113470,437,160,890000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I want to know why my best friend didn't visit me like he said he would.
113471,437,161,893000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Milhouse, real best friends often don't speak for years at a time. Like John Adams and Thomas Jefferson."
113472,437,162,899000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Just because you saw one episode of one mini-series doesn't mean you get to use it as a whip!
113473,437,163,905000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, man. I have to keep my dark past hidden. There's someone new in my life now."
113474,437,164,915000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Oh, I get it. It's love. I guess you found your Abigail Adams."
113475,437,165,921000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,My who?
113476,437,166,922000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,So I'll be on my way. I can see I'm the fifth wheel on this bicycle with training wheels. But the next time I see you two I might not be able to hold my tongue.
113477,437,167,936000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,It's really quite difficult.
113479,437,169,942000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Reverend, care for some of my devils food cake?"
113480,437,170,945000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Is that really devils food?
113481,437,171,948000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"No, it's angels food with chocolate on top."
113482,437,172,950000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,I knew it.
113483,437,173,952000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Sorry I'm late. I didn't realize you had to turn the oven on to bake stuff.
113484,437,174,956000,Milhouse Van Houten,First Church of Springfield,"So, Jenny, I hear you're religious. Know what my favorite book of the Bible is? Revelations."
113485,437,175,963000,Jenny,First Church of Springfield,"Mine too! Bart, we should take Milhouse on our trip to juice country."
113486,437,176,967000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Are you nuts?! Milhouse will spill everything. By which I mean juice, not secrets!"
113487,437,177,972000,Milhouse Van Houten,First Church of Springfield,"Yeah, you guys don't want me there."
113488,437,178,976000,Milhouse Van Houten,First Church of Springfield,But I'm sure we'll see each other soon.
113489,437,179,994000,Jenny,First Church of Springfield,You look tense. Have a cookie.
113493,437,183,1020000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you don't stop smiling, you're gonna get a kiss!"
113496,437,186,1028000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,That's it! We're getting you off the meds!
113498,437,188,1043000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,We should be safe from Milhouse here. Being at sea level gives him nosebleeds.
113499,437,189,1046000,Jenny,South Street Squidport,Milhouse is funny. The way he's always shaking me by the shoulders and saying I don't know the real you. Funny!
113500,437,190,1053000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,I'm tired of talking about Milhouse!
113501,437,191,1056000,Milhouse Van Houten,South Street Squidport,"Hello, Bart. Surprised to see me at sea level? Well, you can't bleed out your nose when your heart's broken."
113502,437,192,1063000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Milhouse, could you stop being creepy for just a minute?"
113503,437,193,1066000,Milhouse Van Houten,South Street Squidport,"No. Jenny, do you see how the dolphin in that tank seems to shy away from Bart? Why might that be?"
113505,437,195,1078000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Jenny, I can't take the pressure anymore. I have to come clean. I'm only pretending to be good..."
113506,437,196,1084000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Before I met you, I was El Barto, Skinner's Bane, the Sultan of Spitwads, the Dean of D-minus, the Ay carumba Kid!"
113507,437,197,1091000,Jenny,South Street Squidport,"No, no, no, no, no!"
113508,437,198,1093000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,But now I'm good because you turned me good. Isn't that all that matters?
113509,437,199,1097000,Jenny,South Street Squidport,Are you saying our entire relationship is based on lies?
113510,437,200,1102000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,Not our entire relationship. Just the stuff I said.
113512,437,202,1112000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe she dumped me!
