37051,166,35,212000,Gerald Ford,Simpson Home,"Oh, well... I'd like to talk about a subject that is very important to me."
37052,166,36,217000,Gerald Ford,Simpson Home,The Boy Scouts of America have molded men for over 100 years a-what are you...?
37053,166,37,225000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Uh, um... How's your wife Nancy?"

37060,166,44,258000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I was just watching Women's Volleyball on ESPN..."
37062,166,46,265000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Come on. There's no need for that baba-ma-bushka.
37063,166,47,269000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,All right... but don't be shocked.
37064,166,48,271000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, There's no way I could --"
37065,166,49,275000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I'm losing my hair."
37066,166,50,278000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now sweetie, don't worry about a thing. I'll teach you to comb it over so no one can tell. Just like my hair!"
37069,166,53,291000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Mrs. Simpson, there's no physical reason why your hair should be falling out. This thing has me buffaloed."

37074,166,58,307000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,I think the problem may be stress.
37076,166,60,312000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I was just with Dr. Hibbert. He said I was under a lot of stress and should get some help.
37077,166,61,317000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, whatever it takes to make you well, we'll do it."
37078,166,62,321000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... I was thinking we could hire a nanny to help me out.
37079,166,63,325000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,A nanny?!
37080,166,64,326000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But how am I supposed to pay for that?
37081,166,65,328000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We'll find a way. Mom has made so many sacrifices for us -- it's time we gave up something for her. I'll stop buying Malibu Stacey clothing.
37082,166,66,336000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And I'll take up smoking and give that up.
37083,166,67,338000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good for you, son. Giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. Have a dollar."
37084,166,68,345000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But he didn't do anything!
37085,166,69,347000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Didn't he Lisa? Didn't he? Hey, wait a minute, he didn't!"
37086,166,70,352000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, please, I never ask for much, but this is something I really need."
37087,166,71,357000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, Marge. I'll get you your nanny, and to pay for it... I'll give up the Civil War Re-creation Society I love so much."
37089,166,73,366000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, Homer's out. We gotta find a new General Ambrose Burnside."
37090,166,74,369000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,And I'm not too crazy about our Stonewall Jackson.

37105,166,89,409000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Simpson Home,"Thanks. Hey, where do you keep the liquor?"
37106,166,90,411000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I hide a bottle of Schnapps in the baby's crib.
37107,166,91,413000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, young man, you're not what we're looking for."
37108,166,92,415000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Simpson Home,"You're telling me, you blue haired witch."
