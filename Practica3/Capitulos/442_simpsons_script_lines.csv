114555,442,134,600000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because I'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments?
114556,442,135,603000,Lyle McCarthy,Simpson Home,Something bad happens and you cope by cramming a donut in your mouth.
114557,442,136,607000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, well you don't always have time to masturbate ."
114558,442,137,609000,Lyle McCarthy,Simpson Home,"I'm gonna teach you healthy emotional alternatives to eating. We don't have much time, so we'll do it in a montage to the song ""Eye of the Tiger."""
114559,442,138,613000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that song's a little on the nose. Can we do it to David Bowie's ""Heroes?"""

114561,442,140,631000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This montage sounds really exhausting. How 'bout I just do a walking around sad montage?
114562,442,141,634000,Lyle McCarthy,Simpson Home,No.
114563,442,142,638000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A montage of me turning a ragtag Little League team into state runners-up?

114565,442,144,642000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Me using funny modes of transportation like a hot air balloon and a camel, and finally a pickup truck full of chickens? Then I get out of the truck and go thank the driver, but then I see the driver is a chicken?"

114578,442,156,716000,Everyman,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,Don't thank me -- thank Captain America...for giving me the patriotism to want to save the President's life. And thank Wonder Woman....for giving me the boobs to distract the guards.
114579,442,157,727000,Director #1,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,And cut!
114580,442,158,728000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,"What'd you think, kids?"
114581,442,159,730000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,That was awesome!
114582,442,160,731000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,Although there were a few holes in the story.
114583,442,161,733000,Director #2,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,"That's the problem when you have seventeen writers. But don't worry, we have two fresh ones working on it."
114585,442,163,743000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie... take your shirt off again."
114586,442,164,747000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"There's less of you to love, but I love you even more."
114587,442,165,753000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What was that?!
114588,442,166,755000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Your other hand.

114593,442,171,784000,Director #1,Springfield,"Oscar! Take a shower! Or a tomato bath, or something. Please!"
114594,442,172,788000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"This life is the greatest. I get paid a fortune, I've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches, and I get to hire my friends."
114595,442,173,796000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield,"At least you get to see my face, unlike Carl."
114596,442,174,799000,Carl Carlson,Springfield,I'm being paid to do what I love!
114597,442,175,804000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,A lot of things come and go in life. But not fame and fitness.
114598,442,176,809000,Lyle McCarthy,Springfield,"Homer? Homer Sapian! Can I have a word with you? I know this is a bad time, but I'm leaving for another gig."
114599,442,177,816000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Is that all this temporary job was to you: a gig?
114600,442,178,821000,Lyle McCarthy,Springfield,"Don't take it personally, Home-team."
114571,442,179,823000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,But how will I keep from overeating?
114601,442,180,825000,Lyle McCarthy,Springfield,Just remember what I taught you.
114602,442,181,828000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,But you taught me the only people who can stay thin are those who can afford five thousand dollar a week nutritional consultants.
114603,442,182,834000,Lyle McCarthy,Springfield,I have taught you well. Goodbye!
114604,442,183,851000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,He's gone.
114605,442,184,857000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,One cheese cube couldn't hurt.
114606,442,185,860000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Oh. This other cheese cube's stuck to the first one. Well, that still technically counts as one."
114607,442,186,867000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,It's bad luck to eat an even number of cheese cubes.
114608,442,187,882000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Don't look at me. Don't look at me!
114609,442,188,887000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,You. You watch.
114611,442,190,893000,Leading Lady,Ballroom,"Avery, I swear, you're the only man in Gothamopolis who's never seen Everyman."
114612,442,191,898000,Homer Simpson,Ballroom,"Well, one thing's for sure: I'm not Everyman."

114614,442,193,909000,Director #1,Ballroom,This is a disaster!
114615,442,194,910000,Director #2,Ballroom,"I'm getting a bad feeling about this film: the star's overweight, we're way over-budget, and the grasshopperaptor we built seems to have developed an evil mind of its own."
114617,442,196,932000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh Marge! I'm ready for some lovin'!
114618,442,197,935000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Come and get me.
114620,442,199,942000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, speak to me."
114621,442,200,943000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I think you may have put on a little weight.
114622,442,201,946000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nag, nag, nag."
114624,442,203,949000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Apu, I have to lose weight now. Do you have anything that'll make me vomit?"
114625,442,204,952000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, I don't know. I might have some milk that has expired."
114626,442,205,959000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Ah, here we are... a delightful buttermilk from nineteen sixty-one."
114627,442,206,964000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, sixty-one. Everyone was twisting again like they did the previous summer."
114628,442,207,973000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Whatever you do, do not chew the chunks."
114629,442,208,976000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Uh-oh.
114630,442,209,978000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Hoo boy. Clean up in aisles three... two... one...
114632,442,211,986000,Director #1,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,And action! Cut! Where's Homer?
114633,442,212,991000,Director #2,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,In his trailer.
114634,442,213,993000,Director #1,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,He won't come out?
114635,442,214,993000,Director #2,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,He can't come out.
114636,442,215,1000000,Comic Book Guy,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,This film is an embarrassment of Jar-Jarrian magnitude!
114637,442,216,1004000,Comic Book Guy,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,"As the writer, I demand to express my opinion!"
114638,442,217,1008000,Security Guard,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.
114639,442,218,1010000,Comic Book Guy,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,"I see. Well, I respect that and... Vulcan death grip!"
114640,442,219,1012000,Security Guard,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,Hollywood ponytail yank!
114642,442,221,1020000,Former Studio Head,SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE,My only sin was believing in George Clooney!
114645,442,224,1034000,Homer Simpson,Aztec Theater,"How ya doin', man?"
114646,442,225,1038000,Female Producer,Aztec Theater,"I think we have a clunker here. And I should know, I produced ""Bad Summer Movie,"" the parody of bad summer movies that was itself a bad summer movie."
114647,442,226,1046000,Director #1,Aztec Theater,"Don't worry, we fixed everything with editing."
114648,442,227,1048000,Director #2,Aztec Theater,Editing solves everything. Except my problems with the I.R.S.
114649,442,228,1051000,Director #1,Aztec Theater,"Yeah, how's that going?"
114650,442,229,1064000,Dr. Reptilicus,Aztec Theater,Everyman! Show yourssself!
114651,442,230,1069000,Homer Simpson,Aztec Theater,I'm right here! I've been here all along!
114652,442,231,1090000,Lenny Leonard,Aztec Theater,"Half the shots he's fat, half the shots he's thin. It's taking me out of the moment. Like when you're kissing a girl and she burps."
114653,442,232,1097000,Carl Carlson,Aztec Theater,Who was in charge of continuity on this picture?
114654,442,233,1099000,Lady,Aztec Theater,I tried to show them the Polaroids -- they wouldn't look!
114655,442,234,1103000,Carl Carlson,Aztec Theater,It's your job to get their attention! Nobody takes responsibility anymore.
114656,442,235,1107000,Lady,Aztec Theater,"Well, I... I just wanted to get back into the business after I had my kids."
114657,442,236,1111000,Moe Szyslak,Aztec Theater,"Yeah, well, now those kids have an embarrassment for a mother."
114659,442,238,1115000,Lyle McCarthy,Theater,Homeboy!
114660,442,239,1117000,Lyle McCarthy,Theater,"What happened, dude? You went from Everyman to Everywhereman."
114661,442,240,1122000,Homer Simpson,Theater,What happened is you left! Who did you leave me for? Tell me. I can take it.
114662,442,241,1130000,Lyle McCarthy,Theater,"Okay. It was Turtle from ""Entourage."""
114663,442,242,1133000,Homer Simpson,Theater,I knew it!
114665,442,243,1137000,Lyle McCarthy,Theater,"Come on, Home Run. It's okay, Home Alone. Look, I'm sorry. Let me make this up to you. I'll train you. Then leave you again. Then come back and train you."
114666,442,244,1148000,Lyle McCarthy,Theater,It's how I make my money.
114667,442,245,1151000,Homer Simpson,Theater,Just you and me?
114668,442,246,1153000,Lyle McCarthy,Theater,"You, me and Turtle."
114669,442,247,1155000,Homer Simpson,Theater,That could work.
114670,442,248,1157000,Lyle McCarthy,Theater,He is a great guy. He's an awful guy.
114671,442,249,1161000,Homer Simpson,Theater,You just said both those things to me.
114672,442,250,1163000,Lyle McCarthy,Theater,I'm sorry. I'm not sorry.
114673,442,251,1166000,Producer,Theater,"Look Comic Book Guy, about the movie... we know it's not great."
114674,442,252,1171000,Director #1,Theater,"Yeah, the projectionist hung himself with the final reel."
114675,442,253,1174000,Director #2,Theater,"But you created ""Everyman."" Your fans will think whatever you tell them."
114676,442,254,1177000,Producer,Theater,"If you put the word out that this movie is good, we'll let you direct the sequel!"
114677,442,255,1181000,Comic Book Guy,Theater,"You would let me direct ""Everyman 2: Rise of the Revenge""?"
114678,442,256,1185000,Producer,Theater,Absolutely -- all you have to do is tell your army of internet dweebs to go see this movie.
114679,442,257,1191000,Comic Book Guy,Theater,Sell my soul for Hollywood lucre or stay true to my lofty ideals.
114681,442,259,1197000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"""Everyman"" the motion picture is the culmination of a lifelong dream. And I was one of the few who saw that dream realized on screen last night. If there is one fault to find with this two hundred million dollar production, it is that this is..."
114682,442,260,1206000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"...the worst. Movie. Ever! And ""send!"""
114683,442,261,1217000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,And sip!
114685,442,263,1219000,Announcer,MOUNTAINTOP,"Though legislation was passed to insure Everyman was never seen on screens again, he remains in the hearts of every man, woman and child looking for justice. Or just hoping to see bad people beaten up."
114686,442,264,1234000,Homer Simpson,MOUNTAINTOP,I'm so cold.
