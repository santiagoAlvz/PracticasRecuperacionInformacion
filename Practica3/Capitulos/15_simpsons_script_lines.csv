153148,15,103,508000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You did! You told me with the way you slump your shoulders, the-the way you talk into your chest, the way you smother yourself in bargain basement lime-green polyester.

153149,15,104,526000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I... I de...

153156,15,112,533000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I AM NATURE'S GREATEST MIRACLE!
153157,15,113,537000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'll need three weeks vacation and moving expenses.
153158,15,114,539000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"YOU GOT IT, BUDDY!"

153162,15,118,550000,Karl,Springfield Mall,"A man's suit should make him feel like a prince. It should cry out to the world, ""Here I am! Don't judge me! Love me!"""

153164,15,120,559000,Karl,Springfield Mall,No!

153172,15,128,583000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What? Our anniversary? Are you sure?
153173,15,129,585000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Homie. This year you have an excuse for not remembering, what with your job and --"

153184,15,140,627000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Proceed, Smithers."
153185,15,141,628000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Our first issue, sir, is our low productivity and record-high worker accident rate."
153186,15,142,633000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Any suggestions?
153187,15,143,635000,Executive #1,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,A round of layoffs might wake up the idiots.
153188,15,144,638000,Executive #1,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,We could put caffeine in the water cooler.
153189,15,145,639000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well those are my ideas! You people don't think, you regurgitate. That's why I promoted someone who's in touch with the workers. You!"
153190,15,146,646000,Executive #3,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I think you mean him, sir."
153191,15,147,648000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You then! How would you improve the worker situation?
153192,15,148,651000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every Tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks."
153193,15,149,657000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Fish sticks? What in blazes are you talking about?
153194,15,150,660000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, sir, they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks, and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them."
153195,15,151,664000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I know what fish sticks are! Get to the point!
153196,15,152,667000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and I always run out."
153197,15,153,672000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Will you stop wasting our time, Simpson?"
153198,15,154,673000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Shut up, Smithers. Can't you see what he's saying? A happy worker is a busy worker. Three cents worth of tartar sauce could save us thousands of man-hours in labor. I like the cut of your jib, Simpson. Let the fools have their tar-tar sauce!"
153199,15,155,688000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! Enjoy! Give me your plates. Don't crowd. Plenty for everybody."
153200,15,156,696000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hmmm. Brilliant. Who could have ever imagined that Simpson's sweeping reforms would pay off so quickly?
153201,15,157,704000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You know, sir, accidents decreased by exactly the number that Simpson himself is known or suspected to have caused last month. And our output level was just as high during Simpson's last vacation."
153202,15,158,713000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"My dear tired old Smithers, do I detect a note of jealousy?"
153203,15,159,719000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It is time. Give Simpson the key.
153204,15,160,724000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Mr. Simpson, don't sit on that filthy thing one second longer! They've given you the key!"
153205,15,161,731000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,The key!
153206,15,162,751000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Stunning. Absolutely stunning.
153207,15,163,757000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, hey ho, men. You know I was watching the DuMont last night and I happened to catch a fascinating documentary on Rommel, the Desert Fox. Now there's a man who could get things done."
153208,15,164,765000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Towel please, Simpson."
153209,15,165,767000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Allow me, sir."
153210,15,166,768000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I said, Simpson!"
153211,15,167,770000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,But...
153212,15,168,770000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sure thing, Mr. Burns."
153213,15,169,773000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well done, Simpson. Now, walk behind me down the hallway."
153214,15,170,776000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Can do, sir."
153215,15,171,809000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"A thousand dollars, Dimoxinil, ""Keep brain from freezing."" Now I've got you, Simpson."
153217,15,173,821000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, between your hair care products and new wardrobe, we're not saving anything for a rainy day?"
153218,15,174,826000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Rainy day. There's never gonna be a be a rainy day, Marge. There's not a cloud in the Simpson sky. And what does my little girl want?"
153219,15,175,834000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,An absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.
153220,15,176,837000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yea... eh... how about a pony?
153221,15,177,839000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay.
153223,15,179,840000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I want you to weave that patented Simpson magic with my executives. A short speech, work work work, you know."
153224,15,180,847000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, well okay, what the hey?"
153225,15,181,848000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Excellent. Set you to your task, Simpson."
153226,15,182,853000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Mr. Burns, it is my sad duty to report that one of your executives has bilked the company insurance plan out of a thousand dollars."
153227,15,183,860000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What! Blast his hide to Hades! And I was going to buy that ivory back scratcher! How did he do it?
153228,15,184,867000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,He charged the company for dimoxinil. It's a baldness cure.
153229,15,185,870000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Thank you very much, Professor Science! I know what dimoxinil is. Now go and make an example of this hooligan."
153230,15,186,877000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"With pleasure, sir."
153231,15,187,879000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Karl, you gotta help me. Mr. Burns wants me to make some speech to his executives and -- what do you want?"
153232,15,188,885000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, just thought I'd drop by to tell you that... you're fired."
153233,15,189,888000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What?
153234,15,190,889000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Our company does not look kindly upon one thousand dollars worth of insurance fraud. Clean out your desk by noon, Simpson."
153235,15,191,895000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Wait! Mr. Smithers, Homer Simpson is innocent. I did this."
153236,15,192,899000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You did?
153237,15,193,899000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What are you talking about?
153238,15,194,901000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Mr. Simpson was unaware of any impropriety. I take full responsibility.
153239,15,195,906000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Really. Oh, well then, you're fired... whoever you are."
153240,15,196,911000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Here's your thousand dollars.
153241,15,197,913000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, what do you care if this guy's bald?"
153242,15,198,917000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,My reasons are my own.
153243,15,199,920000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Karl, you saved me. Why?"
153244,15,200,924000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Have I done something extraordinary here today? No. I did what I was born to do, what any good soldier would have done when a live grenade threatened his commander. I threw myself upon it and bore its terrible brunt."
153245,15,201,939000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, thanks, Karl. I don't know what to say."
153246,15,202,944000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Just walk me to my car.
153247,15,203,947000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Bye, Karl. I'm gonna miss you."
153248,15,204,951000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Bye, Mr. Simpson."
153249,15,205,956000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, Mr. Simpson, did you bring an umbrella today?"
153250,15,206,959000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No.
153251,15,207,961000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Here.
153254,15,210,975000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoa...
153256,15,212,992000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"Hey, what's happenin', hip cats?"
153257,15,213,994000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Yard,No way!
153258,15,214,995000,Lewis Clark,Springfield Elementary School Yard,It's gotta be a fake!
153259,15,215,997000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"It's like, realsville, Daddy-o."
153261,15,217,1005000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, what are you doing?"
153262,15,218,1007000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh.
153263,15,219,1009000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little...
153264,15,220,1010000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh.
153265,15,221,1010000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ahhhh!
153266,15,222,1016000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Boy must die.
153267,15,223,1018000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I love you, Dad."
153268,15,224,1019000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dirty trick. Okay, I'm not gonna kill you, but I'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the rest of your days. You ruined your father. You've crippled your family, and baldness is hereditary."
153127,15,225,1034000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It is.
153269,15,226,1039000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, why don't you just call the pharmacy and --"
153270,15,227,1042000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't have a thousand bucks! But you do, don't you, Marge? You do... you do. You've been squirreling it away, haven't you? Saving it for a rainy day, that's what you said, right? Right? Right?"
153271,15,228,1052000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer!
153272,15,229,1055000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad is taking this in a less than heroic fashion.
153274,15,231,1069000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Homie, I'm so sorry."
153276,15,233,1074000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You've got that big speech in five minutes, Simpson. Huh, you're not gonna hang yourself, are you?"
153278,15,235,1084000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Dear Mr. Simpson: I have taken the liberty of preparing your speech on the enclosed numbered three-by five cards. All the big words are spelled phon-et-ic-al-ly. God bless you. You are one of Springfield's very special creatures. Your obedient servant, Karl. Good luck, sir."
153279,15,236,1104000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Karl! So that wasn't just a sweet voice I heard inside my head. What are you doing here?
153280,15,237,1109000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I just came to say goodbye to the gals in the typing pool.
153281,15,238,1112000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, well, thanks for the speech, Karl, but I can't give it. Look at me!"
153282,15,239,1116000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I guess I haven't taught you anything.
153283,15,240,1118000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What do you mean?
153284,15,241,1119000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Don't you see? The tartar sauce, the bathroom key -- drying your boss's hands. You did it all! It was never the hair. You did it, because you believed you could, and you still can."
153285,15,242,1129000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, I can't. I'm just a big fool."
153286,15,243,1131000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh no, you're not."
153287,15,244,1132000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,How do you know?
153288,15,245,1133000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Because my mother taught me never to kiss a fool.
153289,15,246,1136000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Karl.
153290,15,247,1137000,Karl,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Now go get 'em, tiger."
153292,15,249,1142000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"And now, with some fresh insights, one of the rising young stars of our nuclear family, Homer Simpson."
153293,15,250,1150000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What in blazes? Who is that old geezer? And what has he done with Homer Simpson?
153294,15,251,1156000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"He is Homer Simpson, sir."
153295,15,252,1159000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,A lot of you would think I was crazy if I did this.
153296,15,253,1163000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,He's crazy!
153297,15,254,1164000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day. Bloated inventories, outmoded production methods -- I can save this company millions of dollars a year. How? Through Jiko Kanri, the Japanese art of self-management. You see, in the West... the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost... for a net savings of..."
153298,15,255,1191000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Five thousand two... I mean... Lots of money.
153299,15,256,1201000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Mr. Burns' office. Right now.
153300,15,257,1206000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Dead man comin' through.
153301,15,258,1208000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, well, well! Our dashing young junior executive! You made a hollow mockery of our morning meeting, Simpson. I should fire you on the spot! But I'm not going to."
153302,15,259,1220000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, why?"
153303,15,260,1222000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Simpson, how old do you think I am?"
153304,15,261,1224000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I don't know... a hundred and two?
153305,15,262,1227000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I am only eighty-one. You may find this hard to believe... but in my salad days, my crowning glory was a bright shock of strawberry blond curls."
153306,15,263,1239000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ooh, I was big man on campus until my senior year, when I became as bald as a plucked chicken. You see, Simpson, I too know the sting of male-pattern baldness. That's why I'm giving you your old job back."
153307,15,264,1254000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"What! Oh thank you, thank you, thank you."
153308,15,265,1257000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Now get out of here before I reconsider.
153309,15,266,1260000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, better hurry up."
153311,15,268,1265000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, are you still awake?"
153312,15,269,1267000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've never been more awake in my life.
153313,15,270,1269000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's wrong?
153314,15,271,1270000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Are you kidding? I'm stuck in that dead-end job again. The kids are gonna hate me cause I can't buy them all that stuff I promised 'em, and you're not gonna love me as much cause I'm ugly and bald."
153315,15,272,1285000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer. Your job has always put food on our table, and the kids'll get over it."
153316,15,273,1292000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And... and?! What about loving me?
153317,15,274,1295000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer, honey. Come here."
153318,15,275,1298000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What?!
153319,15,276,1299000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come here. ""YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / CAN'T YOU SEE? / YOU'RE EVERYTHING THAT I HOPED FOR /"
