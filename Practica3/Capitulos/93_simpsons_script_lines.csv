17733,93,20,148000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Not the box factory again, Seymour."
17734,93,21,151000,Martin Prince,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,This may well prove fascinating.

17743,93,30,223000,Box Executive,Box Factory,"The story of how two brothers - and five other men - parlayed a small business loan into a thriving paper goods concern is a long and interesting one.

17744,93,31,242000,Box Executive,Box Factory,Many interesting and important things have been put into boxes over the years. Textiles... other boxes... even children's candy.

17746,93,33,252000,Box Executive,Box Factory,No.
17747,93,34,252000,Milhouse Van Houten,Box Factory,Will they ever?
17748,93,35,254000,Box Executive,Box Factory,No. We only make boxes to ship nails. Any other questions?
17749,93,36,257000,Martin Prince,Box Factory,"When will we be able to see a finished box, sir?"
17750,93,37,261000,Box Executive,Box Factory,"Oh, we don't assemble 'em here. That's done in Flint, Michigan."
17751,93,38,264000,Bart Simpson,Box Factory,Have any of your workers ever had their hands cut off by the machinery?
17752,93,39,264000,Box Executive,Box Factory,No...

17755,93,42,270000,Bart Simpson,Box Factory,Any popped eyeballs?
17756,93,43,273000,Box Executive,Box Factory,I'm not sure what kind of factory you're thinking of. We just make boxes here.
17757,93,44,278000,Box Executive,Box Factory,This room is the most popular part of our tour.
17758,93,45,281000,Milhouse Van Houten,Box Factory,It's just like the other rooms.
17759,93,46,284000,Box Executive,Box Factory,"Yes, but with one important difference. Oh. We took that out. Yes, it is just like the other rooms."
17760,93,47,291000,Milhouse Van Houten,Box Factory,What's that building over there?
17761,93,48,291000,Box Executive,Box Factory,"That's just the TV studio where they film Krusty the Clown and other non-box-related programs. Since it has nothing to do with boxes, I'll just shut these blinds."
17763,93,50,305000,Box Executive,Box Factory,"Now here's my office. If you will direct your eyes to the floor, you'll see a yellow line. Follow it. It will lead you around my desk ...and back out the door."

17806,93,92,477000,Krusty the Clown,TV Studio,Now that's Danish. Where'd you get it?
17807,93,93,482000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,I stole it from Kent Brockman.
17808,93,94,485000,Krusty the Clown,TV Studio,"Great. He didn't touch it, did he?"

17834,93,119,586000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I've got a weekend job helping the poor. And I'm only eight.
17835,93,120,589000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's not a job. It's a waste of time. What can poor people pay ya? Nothin'! What satisfaction do you get from helping 'em? None! Who wants to help poor people anyway? Nobody!

17844,93,130,642000,Bart Simpson,Street Corner,"Dad, I'm asking if I can get a job."
17845,93,131,644000,Homer Simpson,Street Corner,"Gig, son. When you're a musician, a job is called a gig."

17858,93,144,697000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Looks more like ""Brad Storch""."

17861,93,147,709000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's okay, son. Who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? You're doing what you want to do with your life. Nothing else matters."
17862,93,148,719000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks Dad, that's great advice."
17863,93,149,721000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yep, well, that's what got me where I am today."

17885,93,172,808000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,Dead?
17886,93,173,810000,Krusty the Clown,TV Studio,"Or sick. I dunno, I forget. Anyway, all you gotta do is say ""I am waiting for a bus."" Then I hit you with pies for five minutes. Got that?"
17887,93,174,819000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,I am waiting for a bus.
17888,93,175,819000,Krusty the Clown,TV Studio,Makes me laugh. Let's go.

17913,93,200,952000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But inside it's mostly about Ross Perot. And the last two chapters are excerpts from the Oliver North trial.
