45302,196,91,438000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, you don't have to go anywhere today. I've got a surprise for you."

45305,196,94,446000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,A what? With who?
45306,196,95,449000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Hi, Bart. We're gonna be friends! I have a finger trap."

45308,196,97,458000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,Fighting only makes it tighter.
45309,196,98,464000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You want me to hang out with Ralph Wiggum?

45312,196,101,470000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, why don't you show off your new friend around the neighborhood? You two make an adorable pair."
45313,196,102,476000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Someone will be right with you.
45314,196,103,478000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, school has changed a lot since you were a kid. Popularity is very important now."
45315,196,104,483000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But...
45316,196,105,483000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't talk. Listen. The social order of elementary school is densely layered. The coolest kids are at the top.
45317,196,106,492000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, you mean like the ""A"" students?"
45318,196,107,492000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I don't want to play with Ralph."
45319,196,108,494000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"He's just a misunderstood little boy who needs a friend. And, if he hangs around with you, well, everyone will think he's cool."
45321,196,109,504000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I don't know about that... It might help him a little..."
45322,196,110,507000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, great. You kids have fun."
45323,196,111,510000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, wait! I, I didn't agree to..."
45324,196,112,515000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I am not..."
45326,196,114,524000,Ralph Wiggum,Bart's Bedroom,Your toys are fun to touch. Mine are all sticky.
45327,196,115,527000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Ralph, I just got through sorting those."
45328,196,116,530000,Ralph Wiggum,Bart's Bedroom,I dropped my popstickle in your toy chest.
45329,196,117,536000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Ralph, would you just --"
45330,196,118,537000,Ralph Wiggum,Bart's Bedroom,"Look, a rocket ship!"
45331,196,119,539000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,That's not a toy. Hey... Do you know how to play hide and seek?
45334,196,122,548000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,Shh. I've been here two hours. And Bart still hasn't finded me.
45335,196,123,554000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,These syrup stains are the worst.
45336,196,124,556000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, it's too nice a day to leave Ralph in a closet. You boys should go play outside."
45337,196,125,561000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But people will see me paired up with a doofus. You have no idea what that's like.
45338,196,126,568000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh.
45339,196,127,569000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm going.
45341,196,129,571000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield,"Slow down, Bart. My legs don't know how to be as long as yours."
45342,196,130,576000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Well that is your problem, Ralph. This is how I always walk."
45343,196,131,582000,Bullies,Springfield,/ Woo! / All right! / Whoa-ho-ho! / Woww-how-how! / Yeah!
45344,196,132,585000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield,Videotaping this crime spree is the best idea we ever had.
45345,196,133,591000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Quick, Ralph. In the bushes."
45346,196,134,595000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Hi, guys. Hot enough for ya?"
45347,196,135,596000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield,Shut up.
45348,196,136,601000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,That was too close. We gotta stay off the streets.
45349,196,137,604000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield,Bushes are nice 'cause they don't have prickers. Unless they do. This one did. Ouch.
45351,196,139,610000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,This is my swing set. This is my sandbox. I'm not allowed to go in the deep end. That's where I saw the leprechaun.
45352,196,140,617000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,"Right, leprechaun."
45353,196,141,620000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,He told me to burn things.
45320,196,142,620000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,Uh-huh...
45354,196,143,620000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,You wanna play stuffed animal parade?
45355,196,144,629000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,"Maybe later. Come on, Ralph -- your Dad's a cop. There must be some cool stuff around here. Bullets, dead body photos, what have you."
45356,196,145,636000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"He keeps that stuff in his closet, but he says I'm not allowed in there."
45357,196,146,640000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,Did he say I'm not allowed in there?
45358,196,147,643000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,Yes.
45359,196,148,645000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,"Well, I'm going in anyway."
45360,196,149,651000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,"Oh Lord, I thank you for this bounty I'm about to receive..."
45361,196,150,662000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,"Hmmm. Wow! Dad's been in jail six times. Aw, and Mom's only been in twice."
45362,196,151,670000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"Hello, Sarah? Ralphie? It's me, Chief Wiggum."
45363,196,152,675000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,We better hide.
45364,196,153,683000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,"Quick, in here!"
45365,196,154,683000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"Oh. Man, we have got to get an escalator."
45366,196,155,689000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"A 341 in my own bedroom! Okay, Crookie, let's dance."
45367,196,156,695000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"Oh God, my back. Oh! Officer down! Officer down!"
45368,196,157,703000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"Hi, Daddy."
45369,196,158,703000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"Oh, ow, it's just you. Well, help Daddy up."
45370,196,159,708000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,You know you're not supposed to go in there. What is your fascination with my forbidden closet of mystery?
45371,196,160,715000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,"Sorry, Chief. Uhm, we were just playing."
45372,196,161,718000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"Ralphie, you got a friend? That's fantastic. Here, here, have some riot gear, it's on the house."
45373,196,162,733000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"Ah, that takes me back to the sixties."
45374,196,163,738000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,What's that weird key for?
45375,196,164,740000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,That's Daddy's magic key. It opens every door in town.
45376,196,165,746000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,The police master key.
45377,196,166,748000,Bart Simpson,Wiggum Home,"Oh, Ralph, do you realize what we can do with... Get me a towel."
45379,196,168,759000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Hi, this is Jerry Maguire. Show me the message. Show me the message."""

45390,196,179,806000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"G'night, guys."
45391,196,180,807000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,I'm scared.

45411,196,200,907000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Street,"We don't get you, Simpson. Sometimes you seem kinda righteous. But then we see you fraternizing with lamoids."
45412,196,201,911000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Street,Which makes you a lamewad.
45413,196,202,916000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"Oh, yeah? Would a lamewad have the police master key?"

45419,196,208,935000,DOLPH,Springfield Street,Let's use it to key some cars.
45420,196,209,939000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"Those are all moderately cool ideas, but if you really want to walk on the wild side, I know just the place."
45422,196,211,949000,Bart Simpson,Abandoned Prison,Here she is. The Big House. The Stony Lonesome. The Thug Jug. The Mobster Trap. Penn State. The Old Crook Buck--
45423,196,212,957000,Nelson Muntz,Abandoned Prison,Shut up! Let's just open the gate.
45424,196,213,961000,Ralph Wiggum,Abandoned Prison,"I'm scared, Bart. I wanna go home."
45425,196,214,965000,Bart Simpson,Abandoned Prison,"C'mon, Ralph. Don't embarrass me. It's just an abandoned prison. All the murderers are long dead... and I'm sure their ghosts are probably in hell."
45427,196,216,976000,Jimbo Jones,Abandoned Prison,"Let's go, Simpson. Ditch the baby."
45428,196,217,988000,Ralph Wiggum,Abandoned Prison,My key...

45434,196,223,1011000,Bart Simpson,Abandoned Prison,"I can't bail on a friend, even if it is Ralph."
45435,196,224,1014000,Nelson Muntz,Abandoned Prison,"Aw, you wuss."
45436,196,225,1016000,Bart Simpson,Abandoned Prison,"Hey, give it back!"

45439,196,228,1026000,Nelson Muntz,Abandoned Prison,"Yeah well, I hope the irony's not lost on ya, Simpson."
45440,196,229,1036000,DOLPH,Abandoned Prison,This sucks. Let's do something else.

45445,196,234,1052000,Bart Simpson,Abandoned Prison,Wait for me!
45447,196,236,1061000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Prison,Wow! Look at all these toilets. And just inches from your bed. Talk about luxury.
45448,196,237,1068000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Prison,There's the key!
45449,196,238,1073000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Prison,The pointy kitty took it.
45450,196,239,1084000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Danger, eh?"
45452,196,241,1093000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Whoa, momma! The electric chair! Smell that, Ralph? That's the smell of justice."
45453,196,242,1100000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Prison,Smells like hot dogs.
45454,196,243,1102000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Hmm, maybe it still works. Gimme the newlyweds from that cake."

45457,196,246,1113000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Prison,Maybe our key fits in here.
45458,196,247,1120000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Prison,Till death do you part...
45459,196,248,1125000,Elderly Night Watchman,Springfield Prison,Somebody down there?
45460,196,249,1127000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Uh-oh, let's get out of here."
45461,196,250,1132000,Elderly Night Watchman,Springfield Prison,"Why do I always shout first? It just gives them a chance to run away. Well, I'm an idiot."
45463,196,252,1143000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Got any threes?
45464,196,253,1144000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,Go fish!
45465,196,254,1148000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh. See, here's the problem, Ralph. You have several threes."
45466,196,255,1150000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,Go fish!
45467,196,256,1151000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't we watch cartoons? The Justice League is moving into their new building today.
45468,196,257,1156000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Kent Brockman, reporting live from Mayor Quimby's press conference at the abandoned Penitentiary."

45472,196,261,1176000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Simpson Home,"To demonstrate what you're in for, I will now strap myself into this electric chair, which was deactivated over thirty years ago, and I can only assume still is."
45473,196,262,1187000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh. We didn't reset the safety switch.
45474,196,263,1194000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,He's gonna smell like hot dogs!
45475,196,264,1194000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Operator, get me Morningwood Penitentiary. It's an emergency."
45477,196,266,1200000,Elderly Night Watchman,Springfield Prison,"Now, Martha, we've been over this and over this. We're too old to start having children. If you're looking for something to do, why don't you start a new twine ball?"
45479,196,268,1211000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Come on! A man's life is at stake! We need to get a message to the prison!
45480,196,269,1213000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Think! Think!

45482,196,271,1219000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's it! Ralph, you're a genius!"
45484,196,273,1222000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Morningwood Penitentiary,"Now, as I mime the convulsions of a condemned criminal, I remind my staff not to come to my assistance, no matter how realistic my performance may be."
45486,196,275,1234000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,They're getting ready to throw the switch!
45487,196,276,1237000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Lisa! Hurry!"
45488,196,277,1239000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Let's just pray this hits the prison.
45491,196,280,1248000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Smithers, there's a rocket in my pocket."
45492,196,281,1251000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You don't have to tell me, sir."
45494,196,283,1255000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Simpson Home,Turn off the chair! Turn off the chair!
45496,196,285,1262000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"The electric chair is on, eh? Then the old prison has been getting free electricity for thirty years. I'll put a stop to that."
45499,196,288,1280000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Prison,Wow! That was really entertaining! How'd you make that smoke?
45502,196,291,1288000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Way to go, Ralph!"
45503,196,292,1290000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ralph? But the rocket was my idea.
45504,196,293,1292000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But asking you was Ralph's idea.
45505,196,294,1294000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're the man, Ralph!"
45506,196,295,1296000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"But surely, I deserve some credit for..."
45507,196,296,1299000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ralph! Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!
45508,196,297,1300000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, let him have this one, Lis. After all, it's Ralph."
45509,196,298,1304000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ralph! Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!
