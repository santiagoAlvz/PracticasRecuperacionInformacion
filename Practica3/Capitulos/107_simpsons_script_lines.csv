21519,107,26,193000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now wait a minute. I'm not sure about this. Every time we've ever gone on vacation, I end up being horribly embarrassed, we end up in a big fight, and we come home more miserable than when we left. You have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time."
21520,107,27,206000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Embarrassed? What are you talking about?
21521,107,28,208000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, there was our trip to the Amish Country..."

21530,107,37,238000,Marge Simpson,Beach,This year I want us to do things together as a family and get a lot of good exercise outdoors so we'll have a lot of wonderful memories of our vacation.
21531,107,38,246000,Bart Simpson,Beach,"Don't worry, Mom. We'll make you proud of us."
21532,107,39,250000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"Lobster hat... Fishnet Speedo, Jr... Wheelie Shoes... invisible dog leash. Well, I'm packed."
21534,107,41,258000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Driveway,"...and remember, every morning give one bowl of kibble to Santa's Little Helper. Do you want me to write any of this down?"
21535,107,42,264000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Driveway,"No! I ain't senile, dad-blast it!"
21536,107,43,267000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Driveway,"Okay, bye-bye / Bye / Bye, Grampa."

21540,107,47,281000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Okay, let's make a pact. This is gonna be the best vacation ever, or we all agree to disband and join other families."

21542,107,49,290000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Ah, the Interstate. Fasten your seatbelts, kids. We're on our way to Itchy and Scratchy Land!"

21551,107,58,330000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"What's the matter with you, Homer? We don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car."

21564,107,71,374000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,No.
21567,107,73,384000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,We'd better find a motel and stop for the night.
21568,107,74,387000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"We don't need to do that, Marge. I'm not tired. I'm not tired at all."
21571,107,77,397000,Bart Simpson,Motel,Whew. I'm glad that wasn't us.
21573,107,79,400000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"""North."" ""South."" Nuts to this! I'm going to take a shortcut."
21574,107,80,405000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Homer, no. You're going to get lost."
21575,107,81,407000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Trust me, Marge. With today's modern cars you can't get lost. What with all the silicon chips and such."

21585,107,91,467000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land Entrance,One adult and four children.
21586,107,92,469000,Cashier,Itchy & Scratchy Land Entrance,Would you like to buy some Itchy and Scratchy Money?
21587,107,93,471000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land Entrance,What's that?
21588,107,94,472000,Cashier,Itchy & Scratchy Land Entrance,"It's money that's made just for the park. It works just like regular money, but it's um, fun."
21589,107,95,477000,Bart Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land Entrance,"Do it, Dad."
21590,107,96,478000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land Entrance,"Well, okay. If it's fun. Let's see..."

21596,107,102,497000,Marge Simpson,Restaurant,Such a violent motif.
21597,107,103,499000,Bart Simpson,Restaurant,"Yeah, but it's just pretend violence, which is actually beneficial for children."
21598,107,104,503000,Lisa Simpson,Restaurant,Ow!
21599,107,105,507000,Bart Simpson,Restaurant,Ow!
21602,107,107,507000,Engineer,Restaurant,"There's no need to murmur, ma'am. Here at Itchy and Scratchy Land, we're just as concerned about violence as you are. That's why we're always careful to show the consequences of deadly mayhem so that we may educate as well as horrify."
21603,107,108,520000,Marge Simpson,Restaurant,"When do you show the consequences? On TV, that mouse pulled out that cat's lungs and played them like a bagpipe. But in the next scene, the cat was breathing comfortably."
21604,107,109,529000,Engineer,Restaurant,Just like in real life. Hey look over there!
21606,107,111,536000,Bart Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Hotel Restaurant,"I'll have the brain burger with extra pus, please."
21607,107,112,539000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Hotel Restaurant,Bart!
21608,107,113,539000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Hotel Restaurant,Eyeball stew.
21609,107,114,540000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Hotel Restaurant,Homer! We just got here and already I'm mortified beyond belief by your embarrassing behavior.
21610,107,115,545000,Bart Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Hotel Restaurant,"I was just ordering a cheeseburger, Mom. They have violent names for everything here."
21611,107,116,549000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Hotel Restaurant,"Oh, I see. All right. I'll have the baby guts."
21612,107,117,556000,Waiter #1,Itchy & Scratchy Hotel Restaurant,"Lady, you disgust me."
21613,107,118,559000,Lisa Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Hotel Restaurant,"Mom, that's veal."
21614,107,119,561000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Hotel Restaurant,Oh.
21616,107,121,563000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Hotel,You're sure she'll have fun here?
21617,107,122,565000,Childcare Worker,Itchy & Scratchy Hotel,"Oh, of course. Babies love the ball room."

21621,107,126,615000,Bart Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,"Wow, this is so much like my dreams it's scary."
21622,107,127,624000,Lisa Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,"Awww, look at that cute little baby axe."
21623,107,128,629000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,"It's cute, but I'm sure it's very sharp, and probably dirty."
21624,107,129,629000,Engineer,Itchy & Scratchy Land,"Dirty, maybe... dangerous, hardly. These are the latest state-of-the-art animatronic robots. They have sensors that ensure they only attack each other, never the guests."
21625,107,130,659000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,"See all that stuff in there, Homer? That's why your robot never worked."
21626,107,131,672000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,This is just what I was hoping for. Spending the day together as a family.
21501,107,132,692000,Lisa Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,Yayyyyyy!
21627,107,133,694000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,"Ah, you know, part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals."
21628,107,134,701000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,Parents Island?
21629,107,135,702000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,Yuh-huh. I'm sure we'll appreciate each other all the more when we meet up at dinner. Are you kids gonna be alright?
21630,107,136,708000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,Kids?
21633,107,139,718000,Homer Simpson,Itchy's 70's Disco,It is the '70s! Right down to the smallest detail!
21634,107,140,722000,Marge Simpson,Itchy's 70's Disco,"Hey, the bartender even looks like John Travolta."
21635,107,141,725000,Bartender,Itchy's 70's Disco,Yeah. Looks like.

21644,107,150,747000,Bart Simpson,ITCHY & SCRATCHY GIFT SHOP,"Well you're probably too young to remember the short-lived Itchy & Scratchy and Friends Hour. They had to come up with some friends. There's Disgruntled Goat, Uncle Ant, Klu Klux Clam..."
21645,107,151,757000,Lisa Simpson,ITCHY & SCRATCHY GIFT SHOP,Oh yeah. They weren't very funny.
21646,107,152,760000,Bart Simpson,ITCHY & SCRATCHY GIFT SHOP,"I don't know, Disgruntled Goat had his moments."
21648,107,154,778000,Announcer,Club,"Welcome to T.G.I. McScratchy's, where it's constantly New Years Eve. Here we go again - three, two, one..."

21655,107,161,829000,Narrator,Club,"Roger Meyers Sr., the gentle genius behind Itchy and Scratchy, loved and cared about almost all the peoples of the world. And he in return was beloved by the world, except in 1938 when he was criticized for his controversial cartoon ""Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors."""

21665,107,169,929000,Pinitchio,Theater,I promise I will never hurt you.
21666,107,170,932000,Scratchy,Theater,Ouch!
21667,107,171,934000,Lisa Simpson,Theater,I wonder if this kind of violence really does desensitize us?
21668,107,172,942000,Bart Simpson,Theater,Wanna get a snow cone?
21669,107,173,943000,Lisa Simpson,Theater,Okay.

21601,107,196,1035000,Marge Simpson,DETENTION AREA,"Oh, please. It was just a figure of speech."
21693,107,198,1040000,Professor Jonathan Frink,REPAIR ROOM,You've got to listen to me. Elementary chaos theory tells us that all robots will eventually turn against their masters and run amok in an orgy of blood and kicking and the biting with the metal teeth and the hurting and shoving.
21694,107,199,1053000,Scientist,REPAIR ROOM,"How much time do we have, Professor?"
21695,107,200,1056000,Professor Jonathan Frink,REPAIR ROOM,"Well according to my calculations, the robots won't go berserk for at least twenty-four hours."

21698,107,203,1068000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,I have nothing to say to you.
21699,107,204,1070000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,"But Marge, I was a political prisoner."
21700,107,205,1072000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,How were you a political prisoner?
21701,107,206,1074000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,I kicked a giant mouse in the butt. Do I have to draw you a diagram?
21702,107,207,1080000,Marge Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,"Oh for gosh sakes, what now?"
21703,107,208,1090000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Land,"Hey look, this one's coming on to me."

21716,107,221,1149000,Homer Simpson,Park,Back you robots! Nobody ruins my family vacation but me. And maybe the boy.
21717,107,222,1174000,Lisa Simpson,Park,"Dad, the flash must have scrambled their circuits."
