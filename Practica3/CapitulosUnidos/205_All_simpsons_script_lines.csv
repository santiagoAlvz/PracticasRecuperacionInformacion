201,205,"Hey, Springfield, if you're driving, you may want to sit down. Uh-oh! Because it's time for Bill and Marty's Five O'clock News Flush! Ohhh, yeahhh. Our topless story... President Clinton has launched a new website. Uh-oh. Wait, let me guess. W-W-W dot dot ?! Website. O-kay, here's another news flush. Ohhh, yeahhh. Doctors say the life expectancy of the average man is now seventy-six point two years. Seventy-six point two?! But I'm already thirty-eight point one! I've wasted half my life! Ohhh, yeahhh. Half my life gone! And I'm only guaranteed thirty-eight more years. Marge! I've wasted half my life. Sir, do you need a tow truck? What are you talking about, Marge? I don't need a... Okay, send the truck. Oh, honey, don't eat that. Wouldn't you rather have your sugar bag? No, I don't deserve sugar. I'm halfway to my grave, and I haven't accomplished anything. Oh, I am not looking forward to my funeral. No, Homer wasn't a great man, or even an adequate man -- and he certainly never accomplished anything. Uh-- President Lenny, you have anything to say? Nah. All right. Fair enough. Toss him in the hole, boys. There goes a real sack of crap. Indubitably, old chum. Marge, no matter what happens in the future, promise me you won't vote for Lenny. Okay, but you've accomplished a lot. You've made me very happy. Oh yeah, they'll put me on a stamp for that. I've wasted half my life, Marge. Do you know how many memories I have? Three! Standing in line for a movie, having a key made, and sitting here talking to you. Thirty-eight years and that's all I have to show for it. You're thirty-nine. Hi, Dad. How was work? Cold. Come on, let's get you into your favorite shirt. Surprise! Oh. I see you're having a party. I'll come back later. You can't come back later because... Homer Simpson, welcome to your life! Homer Simpson, welcome to your life! The kids and I want to show you all the great things you've done. Oh, all right. Maybe I can pinpoint where my life went wrong. Quiet, Dad, or we'll have to throw you outta here. The pictures... they're coming... alive! There you are in outer space. That's pretty impressive. All we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage Mir. Remember when you almost became heavyweight champ? No. Finish him! Finish him! Well, there's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children. Hike. Oh, I shoulda punted. Turn it off! Turn it off! Hang on, Dad, this next part'll definitely make you feel better about yourself. Hello, Homer, it's me, KITT from TV's ""Knight Rider."" Your family has asked me to take time out from my busy schedule to invite you to a very speciallll... Stupid movies. Who invented these dumb things anyway? Was it you, Bart? It was Thomas Edison, Dad. I thought he invented the light bulb. That, too. He also invented the phonograph, the microphone, and the electric car. No one man can do all that. You're a liar, honey. A dirty, rotten liar. Finish her! Finish her! It's true. I read it on a place mat at a restaurant. Really? A restaurant? Well, now I don't know what to think. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Top of the world, ma! Cut it out, boy! Dad? What are you doin' here? Reading about this Edison character. They won't let me in the big people library downtown. There was some unpleasantness. I can never go back. Ooh, look at all the inventions Edison came up with. The stock ticker, the storage battery, even wax paper. And look at him dance. De de de de de. That's great, Dad. And these Hardy Boys books are great, too. This one is about smugglers. They're all about smugglers. No, not this one. ""The Smugglers of Pirate Cove."" It's about pirates. Excuse me, are you a student at this school? I think it's pretty obvious that I am. Go school! So this broad stands up... in the ocean and this big wave knocks her bathing suit off. Ooh. Yeah. And then what happened? Omit no detail, no matter how small or filthy. So anyway -- and this is the part you'll remember for the rest of your lives... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great story, Lenny. But here's one that's even more spellbinding. Once upon a time there was a man named Thomas Edison. And he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph... ... And he was a firm believer in Fletcherism, and he played the organ, and his favorite flower was the heliotrope -- oh, and his middle name was Alva. And he never, ever, ever wore pajamas. And... Okay, I think we've been polite long enough here. Lenny, what happened with the dame and the bathing suit? Huh? Oh... uh... oh, nuts. I forgot. All I can think of now is Edison. I can't even remember where I work. Well, I remember where Edison worked. It was Menlo Park. That's where he came up with the tasimeter, the ore separator and... Uh, James Watt invented the steam engine. That's boring. You're boring everybody. Quit boring everyone! ... And then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead. Some kind of scary telephone I guess. Or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell. All right, already! Everyone knows the man accomplished a lot. Maybe because he didn't spend every waking moment talking about Thomas Edison! Ohh, that's where you're wrong, Marge. He was a shameless self-promoter. Well, you're not Thomas Edison. Marge, that's it! That's why I haven't done anything with my life! I need to be more like Thomas Edison! Whatever. And I'm starting right now. No more lousy pajamas! From this day forward, I am an inventor! Do us a favor. Invent yourself some underpants. Well, I quit my job just like you said to. I didn't tell you to quit your job. Yes, you did. I remember your exact words. You said I should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house. That doesn't sound like me. Well, I suppose if this doesn't work out you can always go back to the plant. Not the way I quit. Ooh-who. At my age Edison had already invented 203 things. Ohh, I've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him. Let's see now... inventions... inventions... Something electrical might be good. What? Eh. Eh. Let me handle the creative end of this, Marge. You don't understand how the creative mind works like I do. Oh? You look at this table and what do you see? Just a table. Now, a creative person, like me, looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables. Homer, that's not a table, that's our dryer. My files! Uh, this isn't working. I've got to try a different approach. You've started smoking, Dad? Yes. Thomas Edison smoked several cigars a day. Yeah. He invented stuff, too. Shutup. As long as you're here annoying me, let's have a brainstorming session. Now, here's how it works: Lisa, you say one thing, then Bart, you say another. Just toss out things and I'll use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea. Okay. Umm... automatic... Butt. Okay. Fluorescent... Booger. Uh-huh. A-- Wait a minute! These aren't exciting new products! You're not even trying. Okay, that's it. Both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves. Lazy father... Can't even spank his own kids... Homer! You can't punish the children just because you can't come up with an idea. I don't see why not. They're my kids. I own 'em. Okay, we own 'em. Hm. I brought you a tuna sandwich. They say it's brain food. I guess because there's so much dolphin in it, and you know how smart they are. Ohhh, it's no use. I can't work like this, cut off from the scientific community. You stay here and guard the sandwich. And these should give you the grounding you'll need in thermodynamics, hyper-mathematics, and of course microcalifragilistics. Look, I just want to know how to invent things. Tell me. Well, all you have to do is think of things that people need, but which don't exist yet. You mean like an electric blanketmobile? Possibleh. Or you could take something that already exists and find a new use for it, like-- Hamburger earmuffs! Uh, well, well... I suppose that... would... qualify, uh... Thanks, sucker! All right, just stay calm, Frinkie. These babies'll be in the stores while he's still grappling with the pickle matrix. Okay, I have here the four greatest inventions in the history of mankind. First, my All-Purpose Electric Hammer. ""For all your pounding needs."" Ow! Probably needs to be more powerful. I will buy ten of those right now. Now, here's my ""Everything's Okay"" Alarm. This will sound every three seconds unless something isn't okay. Turn it off, Homer. It can't be turned off. But it does break easily. Now this next one's for the ladies. How many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting, only to realize you're not wearing makeup? That's every woman's nightmare. That's why I invented this revolutionary makeup gun. It's for the woman who only has four-fifths of a second to get ready. Close your eyes, Marge. And now you're ready for a night on the town. Homer, you've got it set on ""Whore."" Eh. Oh. Okay, this time try to keep your nostrils closed. Oh, look what you did. Now I have to get my cold cream gun. Dad, women won't like being shot in the face. Women will like what I tell them to like. Now here's something for everyone. In the olden times, if you were watching TV and nature called, you'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom. It was the hardest thing in the world to do. But now, with the Lazy Man Reclining Toilet Chair, you can just lean back and let 'er rip. You expect people to go to the bathroom in their living rooms? Sure! Believe me, every man in America will want to have one. Gangway! Gotta poop. No, Bart. Homer... all these inventions, they're... Yes? They're not very... Yes? Yes? Yes? They're terrible. What? I'm not saying you're a bad inventor. I'm just saying these particular inventions are awful, and no one in their right mind would buy them. Or accept them as gifts. But this is the best I could do. I guess I'm no better at being Thomas Edison than I was at being Homer Simpson. Oh, dear. I hope I wasn't too rough on him. Somebody had to tell him, Mom. In the long run, it's much kinder to-- Do you mind? All week, my life long dream was to be the next Thomas Edison, but now it's over. I guess I'll just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father. Homer! / Dad! / Look out! What happened? You didn't fall. Oh, that. I stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause I kept tipping over when I was trying to invent stuff. They're on hinges. That's really ingenious, Dad. It could save lives! Really? You think it's a good idea? Oh yeah, safety sells. Especially to lame-o's. I'd buy one. Me, too! I did it! I'm gonna be rich! Look, Mr. Edison, I did it. I'm an inventor! And I owe it all to you. See? It's just a regular chair, but I attached a couple of extra legs to the back... kinda like the ones on the back of your... AWDAMMIT! Hey, Dad, heard you swearing. Mind if I join in? Crap. Boobs. Crap. I thought I had a great idea, but I must've seen it on this poster. If Edison thought of that chair, how come it's not on this chart? It's not? Maybe he never told anyone about it. That chair might be the only one he made. So? So, we've got to go to the Edison Museum and smash it! Then I'll be an inventor! But I thought you loved Edison. Aw, to hell with him! Yeah! Hell, damn, fart! Taking-Bart-across-state-lines-Back-soon. I borrowed your wallet! Oh, I just mopped that driveway. Man, I can't wait to smash that chair. Oh, son, you're young and headstrong, just like Thomas Edison, Jr. You know, he started a mushroom farm, and an auto parts company, and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company. Oh, and later, he raised turkeys. That was on his turkey farm. Stop, Homer! By smashing my chair, you're only hurting yourself! I'll get you, you fat lunatic! Uh-oh. All right! The museum's still open. Why don't you like Edison that much? Hey, folks, do you like riddles? O-Okay, then. How many geniuses does it take to invent a light bulb? Just one. Thomas Edison. That's very good. And it's true too. It's funny and true. Now, behind that door, is Edison's actual preserved brain... Ordinarily, folks, tour groups are not allowed to see it... And of course, today will be no exception. Now, no tour would be complete without a visit to Edison's boyhood gift shop. Ohh! / Well, now that I'd like to see. / Yes. Now let's take care of business. Outta the way. This is one invention you're not getting credit for, you inspiration hog! Your electric hammer, maestro? Invent your way out of this, Edison. Look, son. Edison was just like me. You mean the wild mood swings? No! We both lived in another man's shadow. This old-timey nerd and I have suffered the same frustration and heartache. We're not rivals. We're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high. I can't destroy your work, my friend. Can I? No, but we'll stop off at the da Vinci Museum on the way home... Uh, I think that's in Italy, Dad. Oh. Well then, we'll take it out on Eli Whitney. ...Authorities say the phony Pope can be recognized by his high-top sneakers and incredibly foul mouth. In other news, Thomas Edison, the greatest inventor of all time...is apparently still inventing, despite the notable handicap of being dead. That's my Tommy. Two new Edison creations have just been discovered in his museum: A six-legged chair that won't tip over... And even more astounding, an electric hammer! That was your idea! This brilliant innovation is expected to generate millions for Edison's already wealthy heirs. Dad, those should be your millions. I gotta admit, Homer. You're taking this pretty well. Let's just say I'm sitting in the right chair.","Librarian, Carl Carlson, Father, Tour Guide, Marge Simpson, Kent Brockman, Crowd, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Jeckle, Edison's Ghost, Cardinal Flanders, Lenny Leonard, Visitor, Moe Szyslak, Marty, Kids, President Lenny, Female Visitor, Heckle, Professor Jonathan Frink, Emergency Operator, Bart Simpson, Deep Voice, Car, Bill, Passerby",8.2,988.0,2,1998-09-20,1998,10,The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace,7.95,53216.0
