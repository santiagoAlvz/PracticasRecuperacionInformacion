295,299,"Welcome to another episode of Padz, where we go inside the mega-mansions of today's hot young celebrities! This was today? The girl was supposed to call. Let's get this over with. Here's the recliner where Don Adams and Shelley Winters made beautiful music together. It should be in a museum. But museums don't want it. And here's my pool. I don't swim, so that's where I throw my shrimp shells. Krustofsky! Why look! It's my celebrity neighbor, Elliott Gould! Your monkey bit my kid again! Well, if he would stop wearing the banana suntan lotion! Say hello to Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice! Dear Diary... ""I have a crush on Kenny."" Ha! That's me! You would like me, loser! Girls! Don't let this happen to you! Get the Turbo Diary -- from GirlTech! No one can read your secrets -- except you. Unauthorized user! Access denied! Turbo Diary, I love that I bought you. Get your Turbo Diary from GirlTech! GirlTech is a division of BoyTech. Hey, I could really use one of those. No arguments here. Man, I really come off like a jerk in this thing. Mom, Dad, my birthday's coming up, and GirlTech Turbo Diaries are in stores now. Lisa, nobody likes a shill. Just buy me the friggin' toy. I love that little shill. Let's get her that diary. I agree -- a girl should have her own private diary. I had to share mine with my uncle. Oh-my-God-oh-my-God-oh-my-God. Dad, you can't eat all those free samples. We've got to get Lisa's present. Watch and learn. More free samples. Dad, you ate all the free samples. Now you're eating men's slacks. Eh, it's still better than Indian food. One Turbo Diary, please. Trying to keep those crushes secret, eh Romeo? It's not for me. I'm not a girl like you. Well played. I'm sorry sir, but I just sold the last Turbo Diary to that guy. Finally Smithers, a device worthy of storing my top-secret enemies list. I'm ready, sir. Number one, the Kingston Trio. Number two... Unauthorized user! Access denied! Now what am I gonna get Lisa? Sir, I can offer you this Tickle-Me-Krusty... the most popular toy of nineteen ninety-nine. I'm anatomically correct! Go ahead, take a peek. I wonder what mommy's medicine tastes like! Lisa's not gonna want that. Oh, what can I get her? Shop o' the mornin', Homer! Just call me ""Mall"" Flanders. What are you buying? Jerk stuff? You betcha! This kiosk sells personalized movies. I had one made starring little Rod. Kiosk Productions Presents an outer- space adventure...starring you! One day while flying your spaceship, you saw a planet and decided to land. Greetings. I am Commander... ...Rod. Welcome, earthling. What are your hobbies? My hobbies include... ...being quiet during trips, clapping with songs, and diabetes. Sounds like fun! Let's party! Hey, your kid is in the movie -- and the movie knows his name. Maybe Lisa will like this better than the diary. Stupid Flanders, you're a genius! A laser pointer! Thanks, Bart. It's really cool. You can point a red dot at people's crotches from really far away. Hmm, there appears to be a red dot on my trouser fronts. I'd better lower them. The dot also appears to be on my underpants. Well, down they go. Hey buddy. You'd better get that red dot checked out. My uncle died of crotch dot. Okay Lisa, now open the present from your father and me. I wonder what this could be? I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Could it be some kind of book? Well, yes and no. Mostly no. Huh? You were supposed to get her that stupid diary! But it's a personalized video about my favorite little star -- Lisa Simpson. Well... this could be fun. Let's watch it. Howdy pardners, My name is Sheriff... ...Lisa Simpson. I sure am hungry for my favorite food... ...McNuggets. I don't like McNuggets, I'm a vegetarian! Still? Then you're not gonna like your other present. Why it's my best friend... Maggie. Huh? Bad news, Sheriff... ...Lisa Simpson. Some Indians took all the... ...McNuggets. Mmm, McNuggets. I'll get those no good Indians. Just as sure as my favorite book is... ...magazines. Wake up, Dad. Dad! That information is all wrong! Maggie's a baby, not my best friend! You don't know anything about me! Maggie, you're her best friend, go talk to her! Oh, what have I done? Children don't remember bad birthdays, do they? Good morning, honey. Did you cry out all your angries? I don't think so. Oh, Lisa's still mad at me. I'm still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe. I did it for the insurance money. Look Lisa, I'm still trying to get to know you. Who's your favorite Traveling Wilbury? Is it Jeff Lynne? Dad, you've had eight years to get to know me. It's too late. But I'm full of questions. What's your favorite cigar size? Is it Robusto? Is it?! Gee Homer, you sure look sad. Yeah, at least you ain't aging six years for every one 'cause of your cow heart. Oh, my daughter hates me because I don't know anything about her. Ah, well, whenever I gotta know something about a broad, I use this guy. This detective is unbelievable. He can learn more about a chick by digging through one garbage can than you could from years of intimacy. He found out who was cobbling shoes for me at night. Turns out I have severe schizophrenia. Well... if hiring this guy will make Lisa like me again, then I'll do it! Can I get this beer to go? Sure. Maybe some day I'll turn into a swan. Oh, God. Drunk cop? Is that you? No, look lower. Ooh, pie. What can I do for you? My name is Homer Simpson. And I desperately need your help. Let me guess. It's about a girl. How did you know? It's always a dame. Usually with gams that don't quit. Till they get to the shoes. And then they're only napping. Priceless. I need you to find out everything about my daughter, so she'll think I'm a good Dad. Okay, I'll get a line on your kid. I charge fifty bucks a day. Plus expenses. Anything to trick my daughter into liking me. Now, if you need to reach me, my email is chunkylover53 at AOL. Chunky... lover... 53? It's one word. One word. Chunkylover53. At AOL. Dot com. Hey! That's not your locker. You know, you are the spitting image of the Aberdeen Strangler. Movin' on! I need to see Lisa Simpson's permanent record. I'm afraid that information is confidential. These are some nice-looking papers on your desk. It'd be a shame if somebody shuffled them. You wouldn't dare. Oh, wouldn't I? I could easily put them back in their original order. Oh, really? Noooooo! You're late, Muntz. Get bent, Shamus. I got what you're lookin' for. Nice. Very nice. Now give me back what's mine. My picture with Snow White. You know, she's just an actress. Shut up! Some of us prefer illusion to despair. Lisa Simpson is a girl at my school. Yes, yes, you said that already. What else do you know? I once picked my nose till it bleeded. About Lisa! Lisa Simpson is a girl at my school. Someone's already worked this guy over. Ah, the information I've been waiting for. Is that Miles Davis' ""Birth of The Cool?"" You should know. It is your favorite album. So you know one thing about me. Big deal. Wait, wait! I thought you might like to go to an animal rights protest today. Well, maybe. On the way home we could stop and get your favorite treat: ice...cream! What do we want? The gradual phase out of animal testing over the next three years! When do we want it? Over the next three years! Uh, young lady, why are you protesting today? Because this lab is cruelly testing consumer products on animals. Take a look for yourself. They're making monkeys smoke cigarettes... And look at the way they've slathered those pigs with cosmetics! So sad, yet so sexy, yet so delicious. Dad, today was so great. The animal rights protest, a visit to the Museum of Sadness and Oppression... Well, we should get along. I mean after all, I am your... ...father. How'd you think of such perfect things for us to do? Did Mom help you? Mom? Don't you think I could read the report by myself? What report? Uh, report is a daddy word that means ""loves his daughter."" You read the ""loves his daughter"" by yourself? That's right, honey. You did it! Lisa thinks I'm the greatest. I might even put you to work on Bart and Maggie, go superdad on all their asses. I believe there's still the matter of my expenses. Oh yes. Well, let's take a look and see-- a thousand dollars! How did you spend a thousand dollars? It's itemized. A forty dollar steak?! Yeah, but if I'd eaten the whole thing, it would've been free. You've been living like a king on my dollar... Super unleaded gas... Silver bullets? Early on I was working under the theory that your daughter was a werewolf. It didn't pan out. I can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag. You better pay up, Simpson! You'll regret the day you crossed Dexter Colt. You'll regret the day you went to the expensive coffee place! I'm here at the Screaming Monkey Research Labs, where hundreds of test animals have been freed by unknown activists. Chief Wiggum, do you have a statement? Uh, yes. Yes I do, Kent. This is a horrible crime. One that-- Cut it out, Lou. He's makin' funny faces. Sorry, Chief. One of these monkeys has the same name as my ex-wife. Chief, do you have any suspects at this time? Well, we do have several promising clues. Uh, let's see, there's a Malibu Stacy scrunchy, a saxophone reed, and a book report on ""The Secret Garden"" by Lisa Simpson. Well, what does this tell you, Chief? Well apparently, there's a secret garden in all of us. And that Lisa Simpson is guilty! I was framed! You believe me, don't you Dad? Of course I do. It's all my fault for refusing to pay... ... pay attention to you, my sweet little father-loving pile of forgiveness. Yes. Can Lisa come out with her hands up? Chief Wiggum, my daughter is innocent until proven guilty. Would an innocent person flee? No, really. Tell me. I honestly don't know. Chief, no. Even I knew that. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not... I'm not good. Heh, heh, they're trapped. Oh, dammit! Oh, I can't stop worrying about Homer and Lisa. Aw, Mom... This'll take your mind off them. Oh thank you, sweetie. Police are looking for a bald man in blue pants and a fair-haired girl in a red lampshade. Blackening our hair was a great idea, Dad. I look just like a Powerpuff Girl. I look just like Elvis! Names, please. Lady Penelope Ariel-Ponyweather. Uh, Rock Strongo. Your real name? Uh, Lance Uppercut. Thank you. Sign here, Mr. Uppercut. Let me just put on my glasses. You're charging how much for a room? Hello? Hello, this is a phone survey. If the election were held today, would you vote for ""A"" the cops are there, or ""B"" you are free to talk? Uh, ""A."" And I'd like to add that proposition ""Hug Lisa For Me"" has my full support. Oh, Marge. You're not gettin' it, it's me. Homer. Simpson. We got a location, Chief. Good work, Lou. We'll leave right after dinner. Lisa, this is from your Mom. Aw... Life on the lam is really hard, but at least it's with you, Dad. I feel terrible for putting you through this, after what a wonderful father you've been. Lisa, I can't lie to you any longer... this is all my fault. I'm the worst dad in the world. What? Why? The man who framed you is a crooked detective. Who I hired! Why did you do that? To find out everything about you so I'd seem like a good father. How could you? Well, all the childless drunks at Moe's thought it was a great idea. Let's just get some sleep. All right Simpsons, the jig is up! We know you're in there! Okay, I'm coming right out the door. Dammit! These windows are so hard to squeeze through! Cheer up, honey, we're living an all natural existence, the kind you like. Ooh, a trash can. We'll find breakfast in here. I don't wanna eat from the trash. Oh, a banana! It's full of cigarette butts. So is this one... They must have come from over there. Those are the test animals! The detective must have sold them to the circus. We'll just tell the police and then I'm back to being plain old Rock Strongo. You're not telling nobody nothing. Make one move and you'll get a belly full of The Flying Giuseppe. How ya doin'. Dexter Colt. The man who framed my daughter. You should have paid the expenses. In retrospect, yes. Ooh, I think that fixed my back. Oh no, no. It's much worse. I'll just hide here. Now what are you gonna do? You can't shoot all of us. Damn it! You know Simpson, from the moment you walked into my office, I had a feeling I'd kill you in a hall of mirrors. Dad, are you in here? How did she find us? Oh, Lisa has excellent hearing. Once when she was three, I was quietly sobbing in the closet and she found me! Oh Dad, you do remember something about me. Perhaps you also remember this laser Bart gave me earlier! I can't see! How ironic. Now he's blind after a life of enjoying being able to see. Well, it wasn't easy, honey, but I'm glad you love me again. Yeah. But what's gonna happen to the animals? Don't worry, honey. I released them all into the wild. Cletus, if I find pig lipstick on your collar again, I'm not gonna let you sleep in the sty no more. Duly noted. Hey Dad, will you read me a bedtime story? Why certainly son, just hand me that book you've got there... Unauthorized user!
