491,498,"...and that's why I really don't believe there's a God. Thank you, and God bless America. You were only supposed to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance. Well I'm pretty sure it was in there somewhere. Now, let me conclude by thanking Moe the Bartender for hosting this meeting while City Hall is fumigated for bedbugs. Bedbugs? Just why is there a bed in City Hall? Er, uh, meeting adjourned! This is so convenient! I can go straight from doin' my civic duty to having a beer with my best friend Carl! And I can toss back a Duff Sangre de los Muertos with my best friend: Mexican Duffman! Ho-la! Hey Moe, who's your best friend? Uh... Well... uh... well, I just made friends with Pepto-Bismol on Facebook and uh... um... Hey, would ya look at that? There's a spot on the bar! Come on! You know what? I think Moe's best friend is really that bar rag! That's even sadder than being friends with Milhouse! Y'know something, Bart? I'm getting tired of things like that. Tired of what? I dump on you, and you take it -- that's how friendship works. Not anymore. Friendship over. Taxi! What gives? He's not crawlin' back. Even a kid who wears a ""Finding Nemo"" back brace has some pride. You went too far this time, Bart. Hey, Moe! I got a job here for your ""best friend,"" the bar rag. Me too! Witty. Great meeting though. Yes, that's right, everyone laugh at the rag. But I was not always this be-stainèd swatch you see before you. Oh no, gentles. We begin in early medieval France... ...A young peasant wife struggles to feed her family... Maman, we are starving... Listen to the grumbling of our estomacs! That's not your estomacs! It's some men speaking French! Now, I have work to do. Complain to your papa. Papa? He is no help at all. Marguerite, I leave to fight in Flanders! Stupid Flanders. All tremble before the duc de Springfield! That's enough! Madame, I would like you to weave me a tapestry with the following images: Me healing the sick... Me killing the healthy... Me marrying my sister... A long winter where nothing happens... Me relaxing with friends...You know, the standard stuff. For this, I shall pay you two copper coins. You have twenty-five years to complete it. You may have one fifteen-minute déjeuner. Oh, these innocent creatures are blocking my path. I could walk six paces that way... or I could kill them all right now! I am heartily sorry and confess all my sins. Absolved! Allons-y! In their dying fury, those beasts began expelling demon wool. And the restless spirits of those murdered sheep compelled Marguerite to loom ceaselessly, even as her husband went off to fight again and again and again... As the years went by, the images she loomed were not of the Duc, but rather depictions of the adventures that cloth would experience over the centuries. Oh, and by the way... That tapestry was me. Right, and I was the Gutenberg Bible. Maman, we have failed to grow. We've had too little food! Is it too little food or too much complaining? Maman, you are overstressed. You need a vacation. Perhaps to the South of France. We're in the South of France! One day, as rosy-fingered Dawn wiped the morning gunk from her eyes, the Duc came to claim his infernal drapes... What an age for prosthetics we live in. Silence! I have reached my verdict. It's not what I expected... And yet... it's beautiful! But it's also not what I expected. Burn down their house! But Le Duc was about to be called home to the worst kind of hell: medieval hell. Hey, let's show some French courage and beat up the corpse! C'mon, Ralphie, have a try. We're submitting that to France's Funniest Cave Paintings. Even for a tapestry made of demon wool, this was hard to watch. I was moved to a magnificent cathedral...and learned that tapestries were the rock stars of the Middle Ages. I had legions of what you now call groupies. It felt like the good times known as the middle ages would never end. But then cruel fate knocked upon the door... Guys, it ain't working -- the door's too strong. Go Vikings! Ow! Stop it! You just broke your vow of silence. It wasn't a vow. I just didn't want to talk to you. This Viking stuff is too dangerous. I'm going to become a gentleman art thief. Huh? Hm? What the-- Spooky. Hm... hm... That was the first time I knew anguish and fear. Nothing will ever staunch the pain of that memory. Well, that helps. Milhouse! Milhouse! What do you wa-- What is it, Bart? Listen, um... after our fight, I couldn't sleep. Well, I was doing fine. Warm glass of milk, some choice cuts from The Wriggles and I was out. C'mon, man. At least listen to what I have to say. Okayyy... Um... well... this is usually the part where you say you're sorry. Bart, I'm not your puppet. I know, I made you into a real boy last week. And I'll always be grateful. But it's time you started treating me with respect. They're a tough pair, huh? Kir-- If you let me in I'll give you the Heimlich! So to recap: I had been unjustly torn from my lofty perch. I wound up as a barter in Persia... You have taken our gold and jewels and given us this faded cloth?! That's right. And if anyone asked who swindled you, it was Christians. Remember that name: Christians. I found myself in the court of the young Persian King. A cruel king who demanded constant entertainment from his wives. Eh. Throw her in the pit of boring wives! We never go out anymore. / Are you even listening to me? / My sister has a much bigger pit. Dude, you've already discarded, like, five hundred wives. I think it's weird that you're counting. Send in the next one! Good evening, your majesty. May I tell you your slippers are as curly as everyone says? Pit her. Wait, wait, wait... I can, uh, tell you a story! Cease your dragging! Uh... there once was a boy named Ali Baba. He and his elder brother Cassim were the sons of a merchant who traded in camels and spices and-- Okay, just a couple thoughts on your direction so far... One day, while out for a walk, Ali Baba was set upon by a thief. Make that two thieves! A million thieves! Forty thieves. With her inventiveness and wit, the clever wife entertained her king for a thousand and one nights. And while he slept, she freed her imprisoned compatriots. Eh, it was cooler in the pit. ... and that's how the camel got its hump. Another story! For once, couldn't you just take a few minutes to let the previous story sink in? You dare refuse your king? Guards! Uh-oh. My downward spiral continued. Only cowards use blindfolds. I didn't know you were doing that! I was unfit for even the most sordid uses. How's your neck, your Lordship? No splinters or nuffin'? I fear the axe less than that filthy rag. You talk fancy now, but you'll twitch like the rest. All too true I fear. Shut up! Your tongue is even sharper than your-- But then, at my lowest ebb, a moment of hope. I played a pivotal role in creating one of the masterpieces of Western Art! Michelangelo! When will you be finished? Hey, you want a quickie? You go to Raphael, baby. The artist was never satisfied... How 'bout now? No. That's perfect! Now would you like to protect your investment with a clear coat? Let me discuss it with my wife. The masterpiece was finished... and so was the use for me. And then... Y'know, Moe, it might be time to buy a new bar rag. Yeah, yeah, sure thing, I'll get right on it. No way I would abandon you, Raggie. You're my best friend. So, I guess you didn't eat that ""special cheese"" that I gave you yesterday, huh? Milhouse! What do I have to do, besides changing in any way, to get you to forgive me? Gee, Bart. You seem, uh, how can I put it? Milhousey. Really? It's not that bad, is it? Bart, you'll never learn. Milhouse, you're the closest thing I have to a brother. A brother with the wisdom of an older sister. And that's why we squabble, 'cause families always do. But in the end, they're still a family. What do you say... brother? Not bad. Did Lisa write that? Yes I did. Now I'm going to bed. I want something that comes from you, Bart. We're done here. But-but-but... The glasses are off! My degradation continued. An enterprising seamstress turned me into the flag of a fledgling nation. Unfortunately, a nation on the wrong side of history. Like everyone else, I was hit hard by the depression. What's for dinner, ma? Rag soup! Needs flavor. That's better. I was part of an expedition to the top of Mount Everest. One that had the distinction of failing un-heroically. Oxygen... I need oxygen. C'mon, man. A few more balloons and this'll look really awesome. Worst climbing Everest. A Yeti found me and brought me home as a present to his son. And now my thousand-year fall from grace is complete. I guess I should be happy here, with my sad, but predictable... Moe! Moe! Wake up! Oh no, I don't want to find out what's worse than you! Milhouse. I've been out here all night, man. Just let me know what it'll take for you to forgive me. Can I punch you? Sure. Can I... have someone else punch you? Sure, what've you got? Puppy Goo-Goo comin' my way? Ay carumba! I'm glad it's over. I wasn't comfortable having the upper hand. From now on I'll dominate you... in ways you don't realize. That's all I ever wanted. Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Hey, Chief Wiggum! Can you help me find my bar rag? I can't even find my car in the parking lot at the mall. There was half a kilo of heroin and two suspects inside. Can you throw me my house key? Please! It's got a green thingy on it! Stoppp! Hey, there's some Pringles in here. Nope. Tear gas. Haven't forgotten about your rag, Moe! I'm-in-Hell- I'm-in-Hell-I'm-in-Hell-I'm-in-Hell... Perhaps one of you garments would like to narrate for a while. Men's extra large underwear? I'm saving my strength. He's going bike riding today. Come on in! You've got my rag! But how? Well, during the town meeting, which now seems like years ago, I forgot my purse at your bar...and when I came back to get it, I saw how much you love that rag. Num-num-num-num-num- num. It seemed a little... ""ripe"", so I brought it home to clean it for you. Thanks, Marge. That rag is my only friend in the world. Well, that's not true! Everyone in this family is your friend. Your bar is the closest thing this town has to an Algonquin roundtable. What about that Round Table Pizza run by that Algonquin guy? Yeah, yeah, okay, second closest. So yaz all like me? Even you, maestro? Milhouse. Yeah, I, I knew it was something stupid. Well thanks, everybody. I... I'm always gonna remember today as the day that I learned to open my heart to human beings and not old pieces of cloth. Crazy me. Thinkin' I needed a rag for a friend. So, this is how it ends. The once magnificent tapestry tossed aside yet again like a common Kleenex. Goodbye cruel... what the? In all my years, this is a love like I have never felt. Sweet, pure, and forever. Well, all marriages have their ups and downs. I'm in Hell.","Viking Homer, Mayor Joe Quimby, King Nelson, Carl Carlson, Archbishop Smithers, Lise, Bartholomé, Monk #2, Chief Wiggum, Milhouse Van Houten, Mexican Duffman, Scheherazade, Marge Simpson, Duffman, Bar Rag, French Wiggum, SCHERAZADE, Sponge, Homer Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Sadistic Barfly, Servant Jimbo, Michelangelo, Christian Homer, Lenny Leonard, Kirk Van Houten, Moe Szyslak, Ned Flanders, Spanish Man, Monk #3, Homeur, Extra Large Underwear, Nobleman, Marguerite, ARCHBISHOP, Viking Lenny, Le Duc, Executioner, Bart Simpson, Persian Trader, Pope Julius, Luann Van Houten, Shauna Chalmers, Comic Book Guy, Discarded Wives, The Rich Texan",5.7,562.0,12,2012-01-29,2012,23,Moe Goes from Rags to Riches,5.12,39838.0
