307,311,"Okay kids, stay together! I certainly appreciate you helping us out with this field trip. Oh, a mom's work is never done. I thought I was being kicked exceptionally hard lately. If I could be any type of shark, I'd be a tiger shark. How 'bout you, Milhouse? I guess a nurse shark. I mean-- Well, looks like Mr. Walrus and his family are enjoying their Sunday brunch! Shut up! Am I some sort of joke to you people? Now over here is our newest exhibit, ""Wonders of the Gulf Coast."" Oooh... Shut up! It's not that exciting. The Gulf is home to a breathtaking array of sea life. But, oil spills are threatening the delicate eco-system. Hey, without oil, you wouldn't have your fancy four-wheel drives! You wanna go back to two-wheel drive? Well do ya? I didn't mean to steal focus. Antarctic life is a constant struggle. These sea lions survive by eating the leftovers of the various film crews that plague the continent. This tank is for our Pacific Habitat, which is currently being remodeled. Where do you keep the fish 'til it's done? Oh, they're well taken care of, in our storage facility. In this tank, we see some of the most exotic species of the coral reef. Look children, that giant clam appears to be opening. This could be a wonderful journal entry! Look at the size of those flawless pearls! I might have known... but I didn't. Bart, get out of there! My poor boy. Will he be all right? Marge, this kind of injury is surprisingly routine. Bart will be up and underachieving in no time. All I need is your insurance card... My husband has our card... No problem. Now you stay shackled to that radiator until you come up with some insurance. Well, it's eleven a.m. on a workday, so he must be at that stupid bar. Is my husband there? I don't think he's here... hang on, let me check. Nope. Whatcha wearin'? Okay, five more minutes and I'm chewing my hand off. Bart, are you okay? Homie, where have you been? I've been calling all over for you! Hey, take it easy. I went to the video store, to rent a movie for the family... He's got a nose for news, and a diaper full of headlines... Hey Chief! He's Editor-In-Chimp! That monkey's wearin' a hat. Lifetime Films presents, ""Buttercups of Autumn."" I fear I have become a buttercup of winter. Hush up, Nana. That's fool talk. Look, he's misspelling words. Nana... Well from now on, you need to get a cell phone so I can reach you. You can't just ""get"" a cell phone. Lindsay Naegle -- Veriqual Cellular. And I can offer you a whole range of cellular solutions. Can I get a phone that plays the Mexican Hat Dance? I insist on it. I DANCE, I DANCE, I DANCE / AROUND A MEXICAN HAT / I DANCE, I DANCE, I DANCE / AND THAT'S THE END OF THAT / OR IS IT I GUESS I'LL KEEP SINGING / MY CELL PHONE APPEARS TO BE RINGING... Barney, you ever notice how hard it is to drive with your knees? Why don't you get one of those hands-free phones? It's the next best thing to paying attention to the road. Hands-free, eh? Then I could give the brothers the black power salute. Black power! Black power! Was that Al Roker? His exuberance is perplexing. Of course we have headsets. But you would be mad to stop there. Tell me -- what is currently plugged into your car's cigarette lighter? Uh... a lighter. I weep for you. These days, everything from fax machines to coffee makers can be plugged into your ""dash hole."" I'll take 'em. DVD player? Check. Snow-cone machine? Check. Lite Brite? Check. Fog machine? Even I think this is crazy. CHAKA KHAN, LET ME ROCK YOU / LET ME ROCK YOU, CHAKA KHAN / CHAKA KHAN CHAKA KHAN... Whisk the egg whites into the batter mixture while scraping the edges with a stiff rubber spatula. Now let's look in on our hushpuppies. Oh my God! I've got to do something. Come on, transmit. Transmit! Save me Chaka Khan! Chaka Khannnn! I'll never mock the Coast Guard again. You Navy rejects are all right! Mr. Simpson, give me your license. Burn their poop. I am so screwed. I can't drive to work, I can't drive to the store, and I certainly can't drive to the store at work. I guess I'll have to do all your driving chores. That's what a good wife does -- picks up the slack. That reminds me, we gotta pick up my slacks at that dry cleaner in Shelbyville. Why can't you use the local dry cleaner? I didn't want them to know my size. Thanks for picking my friends up from the strip club, Marge. Can we stop for ice cream? Homer always stops for ice cream. We'll see. That always means no. Where is your mother? I've gotta get to Moe's. Dad, mom's been driving everyone everywhere. Why don't you take public transportation? Public transportation is for jerks and lesbians. I guess I'll walk. Stupid walking, thighs chafing horribly, no drink holder. I miss my car so much -- everyone's driving but me! I can't drive fifty-five! 'Cause it only goes thirty-eight. I let go of the parking brake! Ralphie, if you stop the car, I'll let you play with my gun. I did it. I walked all the way to Moe's from my house. Way to go, Dad! You know, I feel pretty good. Maybe I should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar. Get in here, boozy. You're late for your drunkening. No. From now on, walking is my beer. And feeling good is my hangover. Huh. Hey maybe this is a sign. Maybe it's time for me to get out of the alcohol business. Give barber college another try -- and this time I won't join a frat. Who the hell am I talkin' to? You know, all this walking is paying off -- look how healthy I am. You see? I'm finally thin enough to wrap this thing around my arm. Good for you, Dad. Could you get me some syrup? You see? Before, I probably would have driven to the syrup. Kids, hurry up and eat! We have to leave for the dentist five minutes ago! We don't have time for choking! Calm down, Stresserella! I'm stressed because now that you've lost your license, I'm a full-time family chauffeur! Now now, honey. We all appreciate what you do. But real chauffeurs have uniforms and licenses. You could get in a lot of trouble with the Livery Commission. To hell with the Livery Commission! Marge, you don't know what you're saying! What a day for a stroll. Seymour, the two of us could make good use of this time. Indeed. You take this teacher evaluation test. I'll proctor. Read the directions silently as I read them aloud to you. Look at those suckers in their metal coffins. I can go to work any way I want. Psst. Bishop to queen four. We're playing dominoes. I said, ""Bishop to queen four."" All right, all right. Simpson, you're a menace! Oh George, leave the boy be. Martha, I want a divorce. Oh George, you've made me so happy. Why, you're the first one here! Please accept this free ticket to the 1939 World's Fair. Thanks, Mr. Burns. I owe it all to walking. Walking, eh? Let me give it a try. Well, I'd better drag myself to the hospital. Oh dear. Smithers, scoop me up. How could you both miss the bus to school? We touched hands and then we had to wash the cooties off. What's all that rustling? My show and tell project... a Peruvian fighting frog. Hey! I brought a Peruvian fighting frog! When will they stop? Come nightfall. How 'bout we take a family walk around the block? Yay! I wanna amble! I wanna saunter! Amble! Saunter! Amble! Saunter! Stop saying things! Honey, you seem frazzled. Why don't you come with us? Hey, I'd like that. I can't. I have to go pick up Grampa... he proposed to another hooker at the bus station. You sure love driving. Morning, Homer. Lookin' good. Yeah, walking's made a new man out of you. It sure has. You see this bulge back here? Now it actually is a fanny pack. No, wait. It's still my ass. But your point is well taken. You see... I LIKE TO WALK DOWN THE AVENUE / BUST A MOVE WITH DISCO STU... YOU SHAKE ME FROM MY BOOTY TO MY 'FRO... YES, I STRUT DOWN THE BOULEVARD / BURNING OFF MY EXCESS LARD... I RARELY FEEL THE NEED TO UTTER D'OH! Top of the mornin', ladies. Bite us. I CAN WALK FROM SPRINGFIELD TO ALASKA / THEN HOBNOB WITH THE STARS IN MALIBU... Hi Homer. I'm actor Steve Buscemi. The guy who got fed into the wood chipper in ""Fargo""? AND WHEN I HEAR... YOU CAN'T WALK TO TURKMENISTAN! I SAY ""OF COURSE I CAN -- SCREW YOU!"" Hey, would you guys like tickets to the Independent Film Awards? Would we! OH, I LOVE TO PERAMBULATE / IT'S STANDING STILL I REALLY HATE / SO LET ME PLEASE REITERATE / I LOVE TO... My feet are inside me. I am so sorry, Homie. How is your crushed pelvis? Pretty good. Thanks for asking. I don't know what happened. I saw you and I went for the brake but I hit the accelerator! It's okay, Marge. It would have been a lot worse if I hadn't been carrying this Bible in my crotch. Now Marge, while Homer recuperates, I'm afraid you'll pretty much have to do everything for him. That's okay. I can handle it. Homie, why don't you just relax and have a little soup? Too hot! Too hot! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hot! Hot! Hot! Warm, tepid, cool, cold... so cold! Oh, you're really coming along, Homie. Yeah, the doctor says that soon my pelvis will actually be stronger and more beautiful than ever. Gee, everything always works out for you. Oh my God! Let me help you up! Marge, you're trying to hurt me! What? That's crazy. No, it's true. The car, the soup... It's like you hate me... your own husband... That's ridiculous. I don't like you. I mean hate you, hate you, hate you! I hate you! I've heard that from co-workers, strangers on the street, even my own children... but I never thought I'd hear it from you. Maybe we should see a counselor. Who's ""we""? Got a mouse in your purse? Manjula, I'm so glad you have finally forgiven me for having an affair. She used to elbow me in the face! Next, please. I've been married to my husband for ten years and part of me wants to kill him. Perhaps you feel that your husband sees you as less of a partner and more of a doormat. Nothing could be farther from the... You could be on to something there, Doc... Sorry, I got a lot on my mind. That's okay, take your time. All right, before you came in, I asked you each to make a list of the people that are most important to you. Homer, you first. There's Homer... Homer J. Simpson... and Commander Cool, a/k/a me. That's us in a nutshell. I care so much about you, Homer, but I'm not even on your list. Excuse me. We've gotta help her. If Marge isn't happy, I'm not happy. And if I'm not happy Moe is very happy. But for once, this isn't about Moe. What should I do, Dr. Hot Dog? All right. I have an answer. You must perform for her one completely unselfish gesture. You mean... like give her full custody of the kids? Yeah, full custody, that's exactly what I... you're an idiot. You gotta knock her off her feet with something utterly romantic... something that says I care about you. I see. Do you have any suggestions? I do, but the hour is over. Here's a dollar. Romantic dinner. Gotta go. You know what Mom really loves? Julienne potatoes. And for dessert, peach crumble. You wanna know how to make a peach crumble? Kick it in the groin. Ha, anyway, what's goin' on? I'm gonna treat Marge to a romantic dinner, to make up for all my shortcomings. Hey, Homer. If you're havin' a banquet for Marge, I'd like to help. Hey, me too. I could whip up my famous poulet au vin avec champignons à la Carl. You can bring a bag of ice. Lousy Homer... I'll show him... tonight his beloved mock apple pie will have real apples. Wha...?! Oh my God. It's so beautiful. Hey look, everybody, Marge is here! Oh Homie, you got everyone in Springfield here for me! Honey, I couldn't keep 'em away if I tried. Except for Flanders. He was mysteriously called out of town. I got your letter, Jesus and I'm coming as fast as I can. Tonight, we're here to serve you. Sit back and enjoy the finest foods Springfield has to offer. I brought you me finest catch of the day. We lost a dozen good men. But it's worth it just to see you smile. That's it, eh? Twelve men. Well, I've got some families to inform. What? Nothing. Just a curse on your very soul. And now Marge, I bringa you the main course. Electra recording artist slash political activist, Jackson Browne! Ooo, the Pretender! When Homer told me about this special night, I just had to be a part of it. I'm here to serenade you with a song... ...from my latest album. Just kidding. Here's one of my many classics. That I fixed with new words! YOU HOOKED UP IN HIGH SCHOOL / NOW YOU'VE COME SO FAR / THEN YOU STARTED TO HATE HIM / AND HIT HIM WITH YOUR CAR. SO I THREW YOU A FANCY BANQUET / AND NOW YOU CAN'T STAY MAD / HOW 'BOUT A MAKE-UP SNUGGLE? / IT WOULD BE SO RAD. MARGIE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT / YOU WEAR MY RING / WHEN YOU HOLD ME TIGHT / MARGIE THAT'S MY THING... I'm really touched by how much you care. I love you, too. So you don't want to kill me anymore? Only with kisses. Oh, don't be a wuss. WHEN YOU TURN OUT THE LIGHT / I'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO ME / LOOKS LIKE IT'S ME AND YOU AGAIN TONIGHT / MARJORIE. Now I'd like to propose a toast: to a woman who's done so much for us without getting anything in return. Except a place to live and free food. Why you little... Now, let's all raise our wine boxes... to Marge! Hear, hear! To Marge! I'm so full. My control top panel is in shards. I want to thank you all so much. You're welcome. And now Marge, we cooked, you clean. What?! Only teasing. We've flown in the finest busboys from France... I mean, America! Vite! Vite! And now, to all my dear friends, I say... get the Hell out of my yard.","Sweet Old Lady, Ralph Wiggum, Carl Carlson, Woman's Daughter, Chief Wiggum, Turks, Old Jewish Man, Milhouse Van Houten, Marriage Counselor, Tour Guide, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Grouchy Old Man, Male Narrator, Tv Chef, Homer Simpson, Judge Harm, Townspeople, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Woman, Seymour Skinner, Lindsay Naegle, C.
