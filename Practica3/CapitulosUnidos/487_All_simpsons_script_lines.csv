480,487,"Good evening. Tonight we reveal to you the fate of Nedna. I have devoted my summer to a more meaningful task: savaging Mr. Popper's Penguins online. Anyway, the answer to Ned and Edna is carefully hidden in tonight's episode like a breadcrumb lodged inside my stomach crease. Enjoy. QUIET STEPS ARE WHAT I TAKE / SNEAKING IN AT NOON... JUST IN TIME FOR MY LUNCH BREAK / GOT MY FORK AND SPOON TIME THE CAMERAS JUST RIGHT, DUCK IN THE BATHROOM. Hi, Homer! I'M STILL DRUNK FROM LAST NIGHT, / GOT DRIVEN HOME, I DON'T KNOW BY WHOM. SOME MAY SAY / I DON'T DESERVE ANY PAY, BUT HEY / I CAME UP WITH ""SIXTIES DAY"" LAST MAY! While I'm here, I might as well pre-punch out... Hm, we've had a lot of bills lately. Better put in some overtime. Larry, my man! Hey, you're not Larry. How come you're not Larry? I wouldn't know, sir. Uh, listen, if you could indulge me... Larry and I fist-bump every morning. Like that... The warmth of human contact with a manly whiff of violence. Not interested. Wha?! Sheez! Hey, what's with that new security guard? He's acting all aloof. By the way, that's my word of the day: ""he's."" Maybe I was a little hard on him, expecting him to be Larry right away. By the way, where is Larry? Crazy house. Violent ward. Good ol' Larry. Say... Wayne, I couldn't help but notice that your breath doesn't smell like alcohol. You want to go grab a beer after work? I prefer not to have social interaction with coworkers. It, um... hasn't worked out for me in the past. Well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping. Hey, Wayne. As God as my witness, this fist will be bumped. Put that fool thing down! We now return to ""Master Chef -- Extreme Snack Edition."" Marge, your ratio of peanut butter to cracker was spot on. And I loved the addition of the thin slice of apple. This was a great plate of food. Thank you! This is my third favorite reality cooking show! For your prize, you have won a brand new kitchen, which I will now become. Ow! Ow! Ow!... I miss my soul patch. Kids, enjoy your extreme snack! Wait, this tastes different. I put a slice of apple in it! Gross! You know I hate surprises! You tricked us! I like routine. I like routine. Did you have a hard day too? No, a guy at work seems not to like me. I guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay. It's big to you. Would you like a ""get well"" pork chop? I love you so much! Potatoes and gravy on the side, please. Charlie, wanna grab a beer? No, I was tipsy last night when a telephone survey called, so I told them to call back tonight for more accurate answers. Oh. Okay. Wayne! Want a ride? I can walk. All right, Homer. You win. You know, I just got a little chill when you said my name. Every town I go to I run into some guy just like this. Look, I'm not weird or anything, I just like to feel like I'm friends with everybody. Homer, you're a nice guy. I'll have one beer with you. After that, we will have a courteous professional relationship -- and that's it. No secret Santa, we're not trading lunches... ...and I don't want you calling me at home and saying ""turn on channel six""... But what if the weathergirl-- I don't care! Wow -- I can't believe Homer bagged the tiger! Excuse me, I need to use the... Men's room? Oh my god! We're completing each other's... Completing each other's... sen... ten... cesss... Totally surprising entrance! Hand over your cash and jewelry! Pronto! Okay now, don't want no trouble. Let me just get my cash out of my cash drawer here. Just, uh, linin' up all the Presidents nice and neat... ain't tryin' to be no hero ... Here you go. Thanks for the upgrade. Ha-ha! Wayne? Stand back, Homer! I know what I'm doing. Well, we all know what we're doing. The question is, is it an appropriate reaction to the situation? Drunks are sooo boring! My fresco! That's coming out of your stealings! That's comin' out of your stealings! Wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking, but I think you're awesome. I'm just a guy who saw what needed to be done and did it. Oh, speakin' of which, let's get these eggs back in a jar. Wow, that's the farthest that one of my eggs ever made it down someone's throat! It's great to have a home-cooked meal. Well, if anyone saves my Homie's life, they get a free meal. Which actually comes up about once a week. So Wayne, how'd you learn all those cool self-defense moves? I had training. Special training. The kind they're not allowed to give anymore. Sorry. I have to go. Oh c'mon, stay for dessert! Hey Simpson, you wanna hear about the big change in my life? Sure. Why not. I started drinking orange juice with pulp! I asked the Reverend and he said it was okay. Then he hung right up on me. That man is cranky at three in the mornin'. And here he is, this week's Noble Nobody! What the f-- A quiet, unassuming security guard who foiled a robbery at a local tavern as seen in this Taiwanese animated dramatization. As the barflies look on, security guard Wayne dispatches the evil jailbird. The evil Moe takes back his eggs for later consumption. Then the barflies drank too much. The boy came to get his father. And they drove home. Please sir, just let me do my job. Pish tush! Wayne, as a reward for your valiant fisticuffery, I hereby award you the Springfield Nuclear Plant Silver Safety Hat! Thanks to you, Wayne, we did not lose the visible half of the moon. Just doing my job, sir. All too well. I'm afraid that protocol demands that I totally erase your memory. Die, you fascist bastard! Mother, is that you? Wayne, stop! That's Mr. Burns. I expect insolence, but rank insolence? Off with his job! Dammit. Why don't you come stay with us till you can get back on your feet? Really? Are you sure? Of course. I mean, how long could it be? I don't know. I've got no job... no references... can't afford my apartment. It's best to concentrate on what you do have. I have recurring flashbacks to a nightmarish past. That's funny, because I have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future. Un-fair! Un-fair! That robot took our jobs! He said it. Or maybe it was him. Man, this robot really gets me. My nightmares are real. Your voice is so gravelly, just like Lauren Bacall's. If you don't listen to me, Senator, there's not going to be a Fourth of July!... Don't you get it -- he used the governor's eyeball for the retinal scan!... That's ten members of the electoral college dead in one day! If you don't give me those launch codes, you'll never be able to make the ""o.k."" sign again! I know the map is inside your eyelids and I will turn them inside-out if I have to! If you move that little top hat to St. James place, we'll all be blown to kingdom come! Bring me every fish in that aquarium! One of them is lying! I'm sorry I have so many nightmares. I've done unspeakable things, from Buenos Aires to the Ukraine. Well, what brought you to Springfield? Was it our Frito Lay distribution center? I needed somewhere to lie low, and your town appears on no maps or charts. Neh, they couldn't find a Google map photo without me naked or urinating. And when there was a map-maker's convention here, they all got Lou Gehrig's disease. Not the one you're thinking of, there's another one. So Lisa, if you press on Bart's elbow here...he'll tell you anything you want to know. I admit it! I let Milhouse lie down in your bed! Kids, can I talk to Wayne alone a minute? Remember everything they say and tell us later in rattle code. What do you mean ""no?"" I don't know if you should teach our children advanced interrogation techniques. I'm sorry, Marge. Sometimes I forget where I am. Apology accepted. Now could you teach me a couple little driving tricks? We'll see who gets their pick of pizza pockets! Give us your lunch money! What gives, man? Where'd you learn that stuff? If I told you I'd have to kill you. Can I tell ya? No! I won't listen! We can't keep servin' the same thing every day. These kids have mashed potatoes comin' out of their ears. Point taken. Oh my God! That song... I can't live in the real world anymore. This is the real world? Hallelujah, I'm still alive! Ha-ha! And I'll appreciate every moment, except the ones that aren't as good as they used to be, which is all of them. Ooh... someone kill me. Junk, junk, Beyonc√© confirms she will play at my daughter's ""sweet sixteen"" party, humorous YouTubes sent by my brother -- mildly funny at best. Eh, sometimes they are good for giggle. ""Auto-tune disaster victim""... HIDING IN THE BASEMENT / HIDING IN THE BASEMENT / AND I'M LIKE ""WHERE'S THE CAT?"" / WHERE WHERE'S THE CAT? Hmm... ""Crazy man attacks boss?"" Is him! American agent who caused the death of everyone I loved. You want to give it zero stars? No! We will go to ""Springfield America"" and kill this man. But first... HERE KITTY-KITTY-KITTY / HERE KITTY-KITTY-KITTY / OH, YOU'RE AN ANGEL NOW! WASHIN' OUT THE DOG POO / SURE BEATS PICKIN' IT UP / FLANDERS' DRIVEWAY IS MY GOAL... I am looking for a man named Wayne. Oh, he's gone. I don't know where he went. Are you friend of his? He has no friends. Except me! I see you are tight like borscht and beets. Tell me, if we kidnapped a friend of Wayne's, would he attempt to rescue that friend? Well, I suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured... Hey! Wha?! Wha?! Wha?! No, not the middle seat! This just in: a local man has been kidnapped by Ukrainian gangsters. We've received the following video. Death to America! Stick to script! Fine. I am being held somewhere in the Springfield area. Turn the card. Hold up today's newspaper! What will you guys use when there aren't newspapers anymore? Perhaps we'll be living in a world where there'll be no need to kidnap. Oh, well way to make me feel obsolete. Oh look, here's a coupon for scissors that you have to cut out. Think, geniuses. Shut up! Hey, hey! What are you doing? This is no way to treat the talent! Shut up! Oh God. I know that voice. Viktor! Darling, I told you to stay in your room! I told you the bedspread smells funny! Nyeeeet! Marge, I'll get your husband back. How are you going to find him? Homer is implanted with several highly powerful tracking chips. How did that happen? I left them out in a bowl and he ate them. I'd take a moment to enjoy those store names if I didn't have a job to do. Get outta here! I won a silver medal in Nagano! Cold. So cold. So, Wayne, once again you crash my party. So cold. Warm me up. Stop it! Just let me put my hands under your armpits. So much violence on the surface world. I'm going back. Cold. So cold. Now you can see why I can't stay in one place. Not here, not anywhere. How about living on a train that's always moving? You ever eat on a train, Marge? What they call a steak is barely a hamburger. Now Homer, there's one more thing before I go. Aww, that's what I call closure! Goodbye. Yes Maggie, we will have a use for you soon. Stay close to your busy box. Wait! I know a place you can go! A place where a sadistic man with government experience can feel right at home. Sir, this is the wrong form. Can you hold my space while I go get the right one? Nobody held my space when I was in a North Korean prison being forced to write a musical about Kim Jung Il with a car battery hooked up to my nipples! Pardon me, sir, can you tell me where the palace is? What business do you have at the palace? Why someday, I'm gonna be dear leader! You?! You're too benevolent to be dear leader! Let's see what they think. ""K"" IS FOR KOREA JUST THE NORTH PART / ""I"" IS FOR THE INTERNET HE BANS / ""M"" IS FOR THE MILLIONS THAT ARE MISSING / ""J"" IS FOR OUR HUMAN-TASTING JAM / ""O"" IS FOR OH BOY, WE LOVE OUR LEADER / ""N"" IS FOR THE BEST KOREA, NORTH / ""G"" IS FOR GEE WHIZ, WE LOVE OUR LEADER We just wanted to give you all a big thank you from Team Nedna. It's nice to know people still believe in love... Now wait just a minute! How come I wasn't an option in this contest? Typical Seymour, waits till the polls have closed before throwing his hat in the ring. I agree with America! You'll never give me a grandchild. Thank you. Shush me again and I'll take your head clean off.","Security Guard, Carl Carlson, City Slicker, Snake Jailbird, DOLPH, Agnes Skinner, Viktor's Wife, Viktor, Marge Simpson, Kent Brockman, Homer Simpson, FEDEX-TYPE GUY, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Gary Chalmers, Cia Official, Seymour Skinner, C.
