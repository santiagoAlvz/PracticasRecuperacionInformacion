436,442,"Milhouse, watch me make a loser lose it. Customers! How I hate them. Excuse me, I just heard that before Spider-Man was a movie it was a comic book. Is that possible? Suffering Steve Ditko! How can you not know that Spider-Man first appeared in 1962's classic ""Amazing Fantasy Number Fifteen."" Ooh, twelve cents. I'll take eight! What the? You idiot! Mint condition copies are like forty thousand dollars each! Must... lie down... on pile of unsold Hulk hands. Hulk smash! Hulk smash! Hulk smash! Huh. What's this? Everyman? He's not a hero from Marvel, D.C., Image or WildStorm. It was a typical day for delivery man Avery Mann. Until... Help! Bank robbers! Shut your yap! Time for this average man to disappear... Look at that fat guy -- beatin' it like an egg. Yeah, he's scramblin' like an egg. Egg. Laugh while you can. Everyman absorbs the powers of every superhero whose comic book he touches! Power-Absorption Power: absorb! It's just a flyin' fatso -- keep robbin'. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Ha-ha-ha-haaa! Put me in Sing-Sing! It's safer! Hey! Hm... perfect. Plastic Man! Absorb! Everyman will stop every crime every time! And I... am... Everyman! Put my comic down. You made this? Shut up! No one is interested in the critical judgment of a worthless child... Actually, I like it. You what now? Everyman is awesome! Reading it I escaped from my troubles! Now they're back in spades. Have you shown this to anyone? No. If copies got out, it would be ridiculed by the online community -- SonofSonofSpock, TheDorkKnight, and IkilledKenny6475. Don't be afraid of them. They're just Lame-os like yourself. Two of them are me. Very well! I... shall... self-publish! How many issues have you written? Oh, uh, just three hundred and thirty-five, including the controversial number two-eighty-nine, featuring the death of Marmaduke. Comic Book Guy's been writing these for years. Who knew a troubled person could be creative? Yeah, still waters run deep. I'm so rich. I'm so rich. All right, what's our next big summer franchise? Come on. You want an original idea? Yes! Let your imaginations run free! Something that's never been a movie before but feels like it has. Extension cords! / Mixed nuts! / Car keys! We've already made everything that could possibly be a movie into a great movie. There's nothin' left! Dad, can we go? I've watched all the DVDs in the Bentley. Jonah, what's that in your hand? Oh, big surprise that you don't know what this is. It's only ""Everyman"" -- the coolest comic book ever. What are his powers? All of them. That's it! Our next big summer movie will be ""Everyman""! Uh, Marv? Ginormous Pictures bought the rights to Everyman three weeks ago. Dammit! We at Ginormous Pictures are incredible fans and think ""Everyman"" would make a fantastic movie. Oh really? The way you thought ""Stratego"" would make a good movie? You'd expect us to believe that a red scout would date a blue general? Guffaw! Hey, don't blame us -- Brett Ratner had final cut. I'm well aware of who had what cut. Let me get to the point. It is not money I am after. Or women -- I know that is impossible. What I want is to pick the actor who will play Everyman. No can do. Thank you. But we never give-- Thank you. They'll laugh us out of Hollywood. I repeat: Thank you. Fine. You got it. Thank you. I played hardball with Hollywood! The closest I will ever come to playing a sport in my life! ""Wherever there's a crime to be solved, I will be there to solve... ...it!"" And there's more, but my fax machine ran out of ink so I can't read it. Do you know where you can buy ink for an Amiga brand fax machine? Thank you, that was great. You wanna see it any other way? Like sad, or Brooklyn, or ""Richard Nixon voice?"" Pass. But I already bought a boat with the money you were gonna pay me! Come on, Comic Book Guy -- you've gotta pick someone. We've already read three people. Don't you latt√©-sipping leeches understand? I've seen enough of these Hollywood super-hunks -- we need a dumpy, unappealing loser -- an everyman! Can you help me out? I need change for a dollar. Oh, I also need a dollar. You... Are... Acceptable! Great! Do you want to see me naked? Oh, there's no nudity in this movie. What movie? Let's go around the table, and everybody say one amazing thing that happened to them today. Lisa? Well, I qualified for the National Math Bee-- Great. Okay. Marge, go. Guess who the garden club elected president? You? Awesome. Next. No. I lost. Eh, they can go to Hell. Bart? Dr. Hibbert found out my thyroid isn't pumping out enough-- Time's up! Okay, Maggie: ""suck, suck,"" that takes us to... me. Some Hollywood idiots hired me to star in a movie! Homer, we have a problem. Fine. I'll give back the Oscars I stole from the lobby. Do you want the Golden Globe? No. Nooo. But we have a bigger problem. Homer, my brother and I showed this picture of you to a cross-section of typical moviegoers. Not one thought you looked like a superhero. Several people stared at the sun, attempting to blind themselves. Stared at the sun. Against every animal instinct they had. We need you to slim down, muscle up and become the ""Everyman"" people want to be instead of the one they actually are. I don't know if I can. I'm a yo-yo dieter: ""Yo, hot dog man!"" ""Yo, peanuts!"" Why aren't you laughing? Don't you know what ""yo"" means? Maybe...I can help Lyle McCarthy. Finally, the answer to my problem. What do you do? He's the trainer to the stars. Here's what Brad and Angelina looked like before they met me. Hm, they look good with a little meat on their bones. Come with me. Take my hand, Homer. And wave goodbye to fat you. Goodbye, fat me. You sure that guy who created Everyman's gonna like this? Him? He's gone Hollywood. A lot of people have come to this town and changed. But not me. Now excuse me, I have to read a story to my adopted Cambodian baby. Nannies, produce the child and the story! Hello, Prius -- give daddy a kiss. Homer, do you know why you eat? Because I'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments? Something bad happens and you cope by cramming a donut in your mouth. Yeah, well you don't always have time to masturbate . I'm gonna teach you healthy emotional alternatives to eating. We don't have much time, so we'll do it in a montage to the song ""Eye of the Tiger."" Oh, that song's a little on the nose. Can we do it to David Bowie's ""Heroes?"" Yeah, it's your montage. This montage sounds really exhausting. How 'bout I just do a walking around sad montage? No. A montage of me turning a ragtag Little League team into state runners-up? No. Me using funny modes of transportation like a hot air balloon and a camel, and finally a pickup truck full of chickens? Then I get out of the truck and go thank the driver, but then I see the driver is a chicken? Let's just skip ahead a month. Ten thousand one, ten thousand two... aaaand fit. I gotta take this. Tobey! Cider house rules! Total wuss. Seabiscuit, you keepin' off the sugar cubes? I hate this guy. I love this guy! Tobe, Tobe, Tobe, we talked about this -- if the rice ain't brown, don't chow down! Look, I gotta bail, I'm with Everyman right now. No, no, no, no, no don't worry, he totally sucks! I'm only lying to him. Goodbye! Bad-bye. Was that Tobey Maguire? Hey, Home Town Buffet, like I told John Travolta, my client list is private. You know what, enough chitchat. Hit the pole! Stripper up! Fireman down! And sexy! Heroic! Sexy! Heroic! And sexy! Heroic! Earn that money! Found this on the roof. Well, I think we've seen the last of the Purple Pariah. Thanks, Everyman! Don't thank me -- thank Captain America...for giving me the patriotism to want to save the President's life. And thank Wonder Woman....for giving me the boobs to distract the guards. And cut! What'd you think, kids? That was awesome! Although there were a few holes in the story. That's the problem when you have seventeen writers. But don't worry, we have two fresh ones working on it. Oh, Homie... take your shirt off again. There's less of you to love, but I love you even more. What was that?! Your other hand. Ooh. Cut! Terrific. Bring in the next helicopter. Awesome performance, Homer. I smell Oscar. Oscar! Take a shower! Or a tomato bath, or something. Please! This life is the greatest. I get paid a fortune, I've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches, and I get to hire my friends. At least you get to see my face, unlike Carl. I'm being paid to do what I love! A lot of things come and go in life. But not fame and fitness. Homer? Homer Sapian! Can I have a word with you? I know this is a bad time, but I'm leaving for another gig. Is that all this temporary job was to you: a gig? Don't take it personally, Home-team. But how will I keep from overeating? Just remember what I taught you. But you taught me the only people who can stay thin are those who can afford five thousand dollar a week nutritional consultants. I have taught you well. Goodbye! He's gone. One cheese cube couldn't hurt. Oh. This other cheese cube's stuck to the first one. Well, that still technically counts as one. It's bad luck to eat an even number of cheese cubes. Don't look at me. Don't look at me! You. You watch. Avery, I swear, you're the only man in Gothamopolis who's never seen Everyman. Well, one thing's for sure: I'm not Everyman. Cut! This is a disaster! I'm getting a bad feeling about this film: the star's overweight, we're way over-budget, and the grasshopperaptor we built seems to have developed an evil mind of its own. Oh Marge! I'm ready for some lovin'! Come and get me. Marge, speak to me. I think you may have put on a little weight. Nag, nag, nag. Apu, I have to lose weight now. Do you have anything that'll make me vomit? Well, I don't know. I might have some milk that has expired. Ah, here we are... a delightful buttermilk from nineteen sixty-one. Oh, sixty-one. Everyone was twisting again like they did the previous summer. Whatever you do, do not chew the chunks. Uh-oh. Hoo boy. Clean up in aisles three... two... one... And action! Cut! Where's Homer? In his trailer. He won't come out? He can't come out. This film is an embarrassment of Jar-Jarrian magnitude! As the writer, I demand to express my opinion! I'm afraid that's not gonna happen. I see. Well, I respect that and... Vulcan death grip! Hollywood ponytail yank! My only sin was believing in George Clooney! How ya doin', man? I think we have a clunker here. And I should know, I produced ""Bad Summer Movie,"" the parody of bad summer movies that was itself a bad summer movie. Don't worry, we fixed everything with editing. Editing solves everything. Except my problems with the I.R.S. Yeah, how's that going? Everyman! Show yourssself! I'm right here! I've been here all along! Half the shots he's fat, half the shots he's thin. It's taking me out of the moment. Like when you're kissing a girl and she burps. Who was in charge of continuity on this picture? I tried to show them the Polaroids -- they wouldn't look! It's your job to get their attention! Nobody takes responsibility anymore. Well, I... I just wanted to get back into the business after I had my kids. Yeah, well, now those kids have an embarrassment for a mother. Homeboy! What happened, dude? You went from Everyman to Everywhereman. What happened is you left! Who did you leave me for? Tell me. I can take it. Okay. It was Turtle from ""Entourage."" I knew it! Come on, Home Run. It's okay, Home Alone. Look, I'm sorry. Let me make this up to you. I'll train you. Then leave you again. Then come back and train you. It's how I make my money. Just you and me? You, me and Turtle. That could work. He is a great guy. He's an awful guy. You just said both those things to me. I'm sorry. I'm not sorry. Look Comic Book Guy, about the movie... we know it's not great. Yeah, the projectionist hung himself with the final reel. But you created ""Everyman."" Your fans will think whatever you tell them. If you put the word out that this movie is good, we'll let you direct the sequel! You would let me direct ""Everyman 2: Rise of the Revenge""? Absolutely -- all you have to do is tell your army of internet dweebs to go see this movie. Sell my soul for Hollywood lucre or stay true to my lofty ideals. ""Everyman"" the motion picture is the culmination of a lifelong dream. And I was one of the few who saw that dream realized on screen last night. If there is one fault to find with this two hundred million dollar production, it is that this is... ...the worst. Movie. Ever! And ""send!"" And sip! Though legislation was passed to insure Everyman was never seen on screens again, he remains in the hearts of every man, woman and child looking for justice. Or just hoping to see bad people beaten up. I'm so cold.","Producer, Security Guard, Carl Carlson, Former Studio Head, Executives, Director #2, Police Chief, Milhouse Van Houten, Teller, Dr. Reptilicus, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Female Producer, Homer Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Lenny Leonard, Bank Robber #1, Bank Robber #2, Leading Lady, Lyle McCarthy, Moe Szyslak, Male Producer, Announcer, Fiji, Narrator, Everyman, Avery Mann, Older Executive, Lady, Jonah, Bart Simpson, Matt Groening, Boy, Hulk, Comic Book Guy, Director #1",7.1,698.0,1,2009-09-27,2009,21,Homer the Whopper,8.31,39936.0
