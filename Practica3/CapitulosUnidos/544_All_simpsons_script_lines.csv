537,544,"What the-- Oh, urgent notice. If it's not final, who cares? Don-key! If it's important, they'll call back. Mom! Dad! The Retirement Home lost its license and Grampa has nowhere to live! That man can't remember anything except our number! Get in the car, dad. You do know I'm a doctor now. Yeah! M.D.! Major Dummy! Grampa, what happened? This place is unlivable. My contract clearly promised ""barely livable""! Yeah, well, we're closin' down Codger Stadium here until they fix up their violations. And there are a lot of 'em. Mannequin nurses. Like I said, a lotta violations. Oh... I guess Grampa's coming home with us. Unless... what about that nice dog boarding place? The really good one, where they each have their own dog ""partner."" No kennels! You're right. Bad idea, bad idea... Should we just, y'know... drive by and take a look at the place? Bad idea, bad. When are your relatives going to be here? Can I be honest with you? They're not. We're all alone in this world. All I have left is a phone message from my late wife. Pick up the phone, big shot! I know you're there! You're both coming home with us! Ya mean it?! Just let me say goodbye to my girlfriend. Don't get fat! Honey, Grampa is the closest thing I have to a father and I love him. But three octogenocerouses? Homie, Homie, we'll be old someday. Speak for yourself. Glug-glug-glug. Chomp-chomp-chomp. Beeeeep. My lifestyle is my retirement plan. And don't forget my ripple! Without ripple, I never would have had you! Ripple's your real daddy! This is gonna be a swell flophouse, sister. So... where should we park our pills? What pills? Don't worry, Marge. It's childproof. Homer, how are we doing with those cots? Uh... c'mon, boy. Your job is to guide me. Well... I really think you should watch your temper. I mean down the stairs, you stupid kid! ""Stupid kid."" Do you really think that's the way we should communicate? You just wanna see your old man trip and fall! Well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but, what the-- Not what I was hoping for, but it'll do. Okay, boys, shower up. And I'd better hear some towels snapping! Muntz! What is wrong with you? Now, you get undressed in front of everyone who's staring at you! Is that women's underwear? My mom can't afford to buy me clothes, so I wear her hand-me-downs! Muntz! There's a kind of poverty that toughens you up! But this is sad. Hey! Leave him alone. I too know the pain of hand-me-down underwear. My dad buys the underpants gorillas wear during monkey shows. So if you're gonna laugh at Nelson, laugh at me too. Simpson, I won't forget this. From now on, you and I are as tight as whiteys. I've had it up to here with those freeloading wrinkle bags. They pee all night, they cry all day and every time they use the computer the font is huge! Dad, did it ever occur to you that we're learning how to take care of you when you're older by watching the way you treat Grampa? Have you seen how he treats my Grampa? Never visits him. Never even acknowledges his existence. Your Grampa's alive? Oh yeah! O-kay. Well, can you please be nicer to our Grampa? For me? I love Grampa. You may not realize it, but he's a treasure. Keep it down in there, you jabbermouths! I'm trying to watch C-SPAN Two! Please. Okay. You know, I love him too. In a manly way that never shows itself. Now we'll need three hearing aid batteries -- all different and hard to get. And this has to be in the fridge, next to the butter. And the butter has to be open. Oh... I'll see what I can do. I can handle them from now on, Marge. Gentlemen, I've been thinking. My glorious youth and beauty won't last forever. Someday, when the leaves have turned, and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese, I will be old. What's your point, pound cake? I'm hoping we can find a way to coexist. What did he say? He wants us to see if ghosts exist. Ooh... they do. My uncle Bill is here right now. Oh, Bill, Bill, I'm so sorry I wasn't a very good ladder holder. That's alright, enough about that. Did the clock ever get wound? This can only be good. This family has had a lot of hoods put over their heads. Chief, something about that looks fishy. Lou, you've got a suspicious mind, you know? You remind me of that Elvis song. Uh, ""Clambake."" You know, 'cause you open your yap when things get hot. Clambake. Where am I? Now, enter the stolen bicycle graveyard. We've decided to make you an honorary bully. Bestow upon him the necklace of unknown retainers. Um... thanks, but I'm not sure I want to be a bully. It's too late. You've seen our faces. Wow, never had breakfast at six in the morning before. I love yakkin' at the manager while he's trying to unlock the door. Now we'll talk about dead people you never met while we get a little exercise! Oh, when does the exercise start? This is it. Yeah, we're mall walking. Oh my God! This counts as exercise? I'm barely moving and I'm smelling Cinnebun. Sometimes you have to wait till you're thirty-eight to discover who you really are. I'm a seventy-nine-year-old man! Son, welcome to the club. Now say something pathetic. Uh, okay! Um... I can't. That's my boy. I-25! What letter? I! What number? Twenty-five! What game? Bingo! Dammit! Who's the icebox pie, Abe? Your younger brother? My son, but he's taken. Well, I'm not surprised -- the way he tears into corn on the cob. Now Mildred, he's a married man! You can't see the ring because his finger's too fat! Join the party, Abe. There's plenty of room in my bed... once they take the railings down. I said beat it... for the time being! Now Homer, you stay away from those red door hoochies. They're just trying to get a chicken dinner outta ya. Well, thanks for the chicken dinner. How did you know I wanted one? All you gals like chicken dinners, Marge. Don't call me a gal. Makes me feel like I'm your mother. Better turn up the heat. It's eighty-two degrees! Are you wearing sock garters? Young lady, in my day... Your day is my day! We're the same age! You're turning into your father! You won't feel so bolloxed once my social security checks start coming. They're not coming for another twenty-nine years! Did your earlobes get longer? Falsies. Whoa! A tweet from Chester! Who's Chester? ""Who's Chester?"" Just the most legendary bully of all. They say he once wedgied a kid in half. Whoa... He's calling a bully summit for next Saturday night. Hey, isn't that the same night the U.S. Figure Skating finals are? They've been promoting it like hell! Excuse us, we're looking for owls. Screech or hoot? Either one's fine. That was an order! Screech! Screech! / Where's the Lord of the Fries? Actually, Homer got up early to count and sort pills. Then he called the police when a Frisbee landed on our lawn. Then he went to the drugstore for an egg cream, but he only brought a nickel. I didn't mind that he grew bald... I didn't mind that he got fat... I didn't mind that he got fatter. But no one told me he'd get older than me. Say it, honey. You're no longer attracted to him. Maybe. It's on tonight. And everyone who ever took anyone's lunch money is there. All you boppers going to the park tonight make sure you're not packing. We don't want any ""accidents."" Ay carumba. How'd you babies get here? Did your mommy bring you? Yes. Nelson! I might have to move the trailer house while you're gone! Look for me downhill! I ain't got much gas! Smell ya later. Hey, my old Weasels. How's Shelbyville Elementary? Not bad. Not bad. We've ruined picture day three years in a row. Ches-ter! Ches-ter! Ches-ter! They say the day of the bully is over. Popular music condemns us. Documentary filmmakers expose our craft. And cyber bullying has taken away the warmth of human contact. But I say to you the day of the bully has just begun! Can you dig it? Hey, why are you doing this? 'Cause I don't wanna sit around like Prince Charles waiting for the Queen to die. Can you dig it? I can totally dig it! Chester's been shot! This kid did it! His sling is still warm! Get that boy! And his friend, the kid with the ladies underpants. How does everyone know? To all you boppers out there, be on the lookout for a sling-daddy who took down our main man Chester. This is KBLY, your source for bully news, weather and sports. One hundred percent supported by money taken from nerds. I can't believe you did that, Bart. I don't even want to sit on the same side of this car with you. I'm just doin' it for balance. I didn't shoot him! Oh yeah? Well, why'd you bring your slingshot? I don't know. I feel naked without it. Yeah, I get that. That's how I feel about my eyebrow ring. The only way back to Springfield is on the subway. Past everyone else's territory. We'll just have to wait it out here until... We're gonna have to jump for it! Noooo! I lost my flip-flop! Just keep moving! Oh. Well, well, well. Looks like youse and me may be up here for a while, eh? Yeah. Dammit! I just had to get her parkour lessons for her birthday. You'll have to get past the S.A.T. Preppers. Seven-ninety assault, seven-eighty battery. I didn't say to begin! Word on the street is that the S.A.T. Preppers failed the test. The Springfield bullies are still at large. That's right, yeah. So, uh, give yourselves up. Um, if I put on the radio, can I hear myself? Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow, that's-that's-that's crazy-crazy. Woo-woo-woo. Hello-hello Lou-Lou! I only have pennies! One-a, two-a. For Springfield! Save yourselllves! Today we are all Nelson Muntz. Haw-haw. Springfield. We're safe. I'm gonna kiss the ground. Lo-ser! You're gay for the ground. Well you're gay for homophobia. Wow. You just made me gay for tolerance. Bul-lies come out to play-ay! / Bul-lies come out to play-ay! Oh no! He's got three bottles! CLINK CLINK CLINK CLINK... I know a place that serves an early early bird breakfast. Steak and eggs for fifty cents. And it was forty years ago. Oh my God! I know that kid! We've gotta help him! I'd love to, but I'm sure that it's some sort of a holiday for me. Fine. Your generation did its part when it won World War Two and created the Rockford Files. I've got this one. Oh, it is so hard running in sand. No. No. I can't be old yet. I won't let the ravages of time catch up with me till I'm fifty-two! I'm coming at you with all the power of a reverse mortgage! Ow! Ow! No! I've never really been in a fight! Now let's go home, son. How did I get here?! Ooh, what's your hurry? We've got ten minutes between the kids falling asleep and the old guys waking up. Go! Go! Go! I hear smoothin'!","S.a.t. Prepper #2, Uncle Bill, FEMALE D.
