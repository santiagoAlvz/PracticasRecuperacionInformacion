55,56,"These talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on TV. Look Maggie, they have a baby, too. It's like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen. Now kids, I know you're all excited about meeting Aunt Selma's new boyfriend tonight. Pfft. But I think that before he gets here, I should tell you something about him. Something... disturbing. Ewww. Ooooh. Bleuh. You see, Aunt Selma has this crazy obsession about not dying alone, so in desperation, she joined this prison pen-pal program. Her new sweetie's a jailbird. Cool, he can teach us how to kill a man with a lunch tray. Now, now, he's an ex-convict. He's paid his debt to society. Then how come you're not using the good silverware? I'm just not. That's them. Now remember everyone, be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity. Everyone, I'd like you to meet -- Sideshow Bob! What the...? Selma dear, I'm afraid the children's reaction is quite understandable. You see, Bart here is the Shamus in short pants who sent me to prison. That's right, Aunt Selma. Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown for armed robbery. Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton. Lousy snitch. Ahh, Mr. Simpson, you're forgetting the first two noble truths of the Buddha. I am not. Yes, you are. One: existence is suffering. Two: the cause of suffering is desire. In this case, my desire to do high-quality children's programming. When prison put an end to that dream, I became a seething cauldron of rage and recrimination... When I was nominated for best supporting performer in a children's program at the Daytime Emmy Awards, my bitterness ruined what should have been the greatest night of my life. And the nominees are: Droopy Drawers; Colonel Coward; Pepito the Biggest Cat in the Whole Wide World; Sideshow Bob; and Suck-up the Vacuum. And the Emmy goes to... I don't believe this. Sideshow Bob. This is one more Emmy than you'll ever win, you bantering jack-in-the-box! Just don't drop that thing in the shower, Bob. No-talent shill! Second banana! Panderer! Bore! Stop it, stop... release me... . Now, for the highlight of the evening... Best film-to-video transfer... Do you know what prison is like for a life-long conservative Republican? In our over-crowded cell, we became little more than beasts. Who used my chapstick? Oh, I did. Here you go. I don't want it. My only joy came with plotting a horrible revenge against the boy who put me there... Aye-Carumba! Bart, if I wanted to kill you, I'd have choked you like a chicken as soon as I walked in that door. But then what kind of a guest would I have been? Now where was I... Ah yes, my lowest ebb. You can't take my Emmy! Hey, you know the rules. Awards for excellence in entertainment are contraband. No Emmys, no Oscars, not even a Golden Globe. But kismet can be kind as well as cruel. I received an answer to my letter from the prison pen pal program. Dear Number 24601, I need a man and I cannot find one among the law-abiding. I have a steady job, and a lucrative hobby filing nuisance law suits. I share an apartment with my twin sister. Enclosed is a photo of us on a tandem bike. I forget which one I am. Dear Selma, your latest letter set off a riot in the maximum security wing of my heart. Like the lone crocus that pokes through the prison yard, our love bloomed despite all obstacles. Selma, may I? Uh-uh-uh. On the cheek. Inspired by the love of a good woman, I resolved to be the best darned inmate Number 24601 I could be. I bade farewell to my cellmates and left with the woman I loved. Cutter... Ice pick... Snake, I'm going to miss you most of all. What a beautiful story, Sideshow Bob. You're living proof that our revolving door prison system works. Selma, I've never seen you so happy. Giggling like a schoolgirl. I've got to admit it, Selma. He's a once in a lifetime catch. Yes, I hope the police are saying that as well. I can't believe you guys. This man framed Krusty the Clown. Bart! Indeed, I did. And I'd like to thank you for catching me, Bart. You seized the wheel of my slow boat to hell and pointed it straight towards the sunny shores of Selma. Hear hear!. Selma, would you mind if I did something bold and shocking in front of your family? All right, but no tongues. Although kissing you would be like kissing some divine ashtray, that's not what I had in mind. Selma, will you marry me? Don't be a fool, Aunt Selma. That man is scum. Then call me Mrs. Scum! I KNOW I STAND IN LINE UNTIL I THINK YOU HAVE THE TIME TO SPEND AN EVENING WITH ME. AND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE TO DANCE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A CHANCE YOU WON'T BE LEAVIN' WITH ME. THEN AFTERWARDS WE DROP INTO A QUIET LITTLE PLACE AND HAVE A DRINK OR TWO. AND THEN I GO AND SPOIL IT ALL BY SAYIN' SOMETHIN' STUPID LIKE ""I LOVE YOU"". Ahhh... ahhh... Hmmmm... Could you pumice my corns for me? Avec plaisir. A... G... Q... Seven... Close enough. May you drive safely and find true love. We now return to the Twenty-seventh Annual Krusty the Clown Telethon for Motion Sickness. Tiffany! Woo hoo! I love you people! I love my kids! Poor little guys. So tragic. So nauseous. You should see the bus they came to the studio in What's next? Oh yeah. And now, a man who needs no introduction -- the chairman of the company... you know who I'm talking about. Get out here, you goombah! Krusteleh, there's an old friend backstage who wants to say hello. Huh? Whuh? Come here you. Oh... oh... oh, you old clown you. Oh, I missed ya. This guy is a national treasure. That jerk I got to replace you, he isn't fit to hold your slide whistle. All I can be is myself. Krusty, can you ever forgive me for framing you and putting you in jail? Hey, if they ever open the books on this telethon, I'm right back in there. That Sideshow Bob is a no-good showbiz phony. Come on, Bart. If Krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him, surely you can too. Oh Krusty, I can't tell you how much I missed this. Now, about your wedding dress. I'm not sure how to put this... White. White. And what would you like for appetizers? Oooh, appetizers. Well Homer, you seem to be a trencherman. What should we serve? Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup! Well, Selma, he makes a good case. Get whatever you want. It all tastes like styrofoam to me. Selma, dear -- I'm confused. Well, when I was a kid we were playing with bottle rockets, and one shot straight up my nose. I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell. Okay, we've got cocktail wienies and Swedish meatballs. Selma, this wedding is spinning out of control. Can we really afford it? I've already run through eight of the ten dollars they gave me when I left prison. Hey relax, I told ya I got money. I bought stock in a mace company just before society crumbled. Selma, that's wonderful. I just hope people don't think I'm marrying you for your money, instead of your... less tangible qualities. Tomorrow we'll be Mr. and Mrs. Bob Terwilliger. Isn't it grand? Hey, Bob. Give some of that honey this way. Holy frijoles! We've got ten minutes till MacGyver! Driver, here's a fin. Get me home and don't spare the whip. Whatever you say, mum. What did I miss? MacGyver was wearing a tank top. Dang. Why Selma, I thought I was the only man in your life. Sit down and shut up. Thank you, Se√±or MacGyver. You saved our village. Don't thank me. Thank the moon's gravitational pull. That MacGyver's a genius. First of all he's not a genius, he's an actor. And second, he's not much of an actor. You're lying! You're lying! No Selma, this is lying: that was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never made me want to retch. He was so cruel... The things he said, they're just not true. There, there... Oh well, I guess the wedding's off. Fiddle dee dee, tomorrow's another day. Bart! Stop that. No, he's right. We're a package. Love me, love MacGyver. I guess the wedding's off. Selma, I don't know what to say. Just tell me you like MacGyver. Very well. I... I... I can't do it! Even that car chase seemed tacked on. Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why? Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love. Very well, Selma, whenever you watch MacGyver, I'll take a vigorous constitutional and return more in love with you than ever. Oh Bob. Bart no like. Bad medicine. I could've been the flower girl. And I wouldn't keep falling down either. Hey, they chose Maggie, okay? Yeah, well if they want to go for cutesiness instead of competence, fine. Do you Bob, take Selma, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, 'til death do you part? I do. Hey, Wiener Boy... Where do you think you're going? I'm the only single girl left in the family. Well, I guess it could be worse. Oooh, there's Krusty the Clown! Krusty, Krusty, say something funny. Uh... gee, a joke. hmmm, yeah, funny... Okay, this guy walks into a bar and takes out a tiny piano and a twelve inch pianist -- Oh, no wait, I can't tell that one... Oh, oh. Dear friends, forty one years ago, God took one hundred and sixty-eight pounds of clay and he made me a woman. And for this, I thank Him. I just wanted to say, on the advice of my new husband, I've decided to give up smoking. ... Except for after meals and after MacGyver. Why Selma dear, you'll bury us all. Chief Wiggum, you've been around. You don't trust Sideshow Bob, do you? Ahh, lighten up, son. If he was going to commit a crime, would he have invited the No. 1 cop in town? Now, where did I put my gun? Oh, yeah. I set it down when I got a piece of cake... I don't know what to say. Just tell me what you know I want to hear. I'm dying of jealousy. Thank you. That's right dear, enjoy your rest. The wedding was very tough on you, and the honeymoon is going to be... murder. Welcome to our video honeymoon. We're using the video camera Cousin Dot gave us and the video cassette Homer gave us. Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it. There's Shelbyville Falls... Rolling Rock... And here's another breathtaking sight -- my brand new hubby. I wanted a room with a fireplace you brainless luggage monkey! Like the one in your brochure! Oh, Selma dear, I was just chatting with my good friend, Dennis. Now, smile for the camera. That's a good lad. Ah, fire: scourge of Prometheus, toaster of marshmallows, eradicator of deadwood... Oh Selma dear, you and your little camera. What do you say we shut it off for a while? And make love? I suppose so. Ah, that's sweet. Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace? Because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic. Romantic? With Aunt Selma? I guess you're just too young to understand. One of my fillings fell out. Even murder has its ugly side. Bob, would you mind rubbing my feet? Darling, you make it sound like a chore. Hmm, uh, good... Soon I will kill you. Huh? ""Son pied sentis beau"". French, for ""Her foot smells lovely"". Ohhh. Prepare to be murdered. Huh? Be pah de be mudu. That's Sanskrit for your toes are like perfume. Voy a matar a usted. Whaa? That's Spanish for, I'm going to kill you. Say what? Why dear, I do believe it's time for your beloved MacGyver. Oh, hey, you're right. Well, time for my walk. Don't forget to die. Ding dong. I was feeling kind of lonely without Selma. Mind if I watch TV with you? Go ahead, Patty. Tonight on MacGyver... Aunt Selma has one hour to live! Hey, down in front. Good bye. Front desk? There's been a terrible accident in my room. Poor Selma, you were having such a lovely evening AND THEN I WENT AND SPOILED IT ALL BY DOING SOMETHING STUPID LIKE EXPLODE YOU. Sideshow Bob, I'm afraid the only victims here are the good people at Best Western Hotels. Bart! Selma! Ughhh. You tried to kill me. I want a separation. My best laid plans have gang aglay! Chief Wiggum, think you have room in your jail for a two-time loser? Well no, frankly, but that never stopped us before. Bart, I must know. How did you untangle my web? Yeah, Bart. Fill us in. Well, I'd hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do his job. No, no, please. It's the only way I'll learn. All right. Sideshow Bob seemed so desperate to get that fireplace. But why? Then it hit me -- the gas. Surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak -- except Aunt Selma. I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell. She happily watched her MacGyver, unaware that her room was silently filling with natural gas. All it needed to explode was a single spark... say, from a cigarette... I decided to give up smoking... except for after meals, and after MacGyver. Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father. Dad, when Aunt Selma lights up her cigarette at the end of MacGyver, she'll be blown to kingdom come! Come again? After trying four times to explain it to Homer, I explained it to Mom and we were on our way. To the Simpson mobile! Noooo! But wait! If you saved Selma, why did the room explode? I'll field that one. Me and the boys were all celebrating a job well done when I threw my match in the vicinity of the crime scene. Oh, right, the gas. I'll be back! You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever! And when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies! I feel like such a fool. Well, he fooled almost everyone. But there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust. Thanks, Mom. Now. Let's get out of this gas-filled hallway before we all suffocate.","MacGyver, Chief Wiggum, Marge Simpson, Man, Homer Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Sideshow Mel, Krusty the Clown, Rev.
