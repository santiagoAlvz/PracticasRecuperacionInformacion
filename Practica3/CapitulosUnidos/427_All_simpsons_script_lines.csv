422,427,"Ho, ho, ho. OH CHRISTMAS TREE / OH CHRISTMAS TREE / YOU'RE ON THE CURB AND DEAD NOW / YOUR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS ARE IN THE BOX / IN TWO MONTHS WE WILL CHANGE THE CLOCKS / OH CHRISTMAS TREE / OH CHRISTMAS... Gee, they sure give the Christmas spirit the bum's rush around here. And they've already started exploiting the next holiday. So young man, have you judged people by the content of their character this year? Yes, Reverend Doctor. Lunch time! Free at last! Free at last!!! Okay, remember our deal: everyone gets to return one Christmas present with no hurt feelings. I'm returning this kitten calendar. Um... I'm also returning this kitten calendar. Kitten calendar. Hey, those are fifteen month calendars! That gives you three extra kittens! That's the last time I get you guys a Christmas present at the last minute. Man, those are ugly kittens. Mom, Dad! Our mall got a Mapple store! It's so sterile! MyPods... MyPhones... A Brainiac Bar! My question is the following statement: Operating System Four Point Two has sloppier architecture than a Tijuana anthill. Did you get peanut butter in your Ethernet port again? No. I got mayonnaise in the C.D. drive. I see you're admiring our MyCube. It's fueled by dreams and powered by imagination. What does it do? You should ask yourself, ""What can I do for it?"" Okay. What can I do for you? Please, I'm begging you! Sir, it's not even turned on yet. But it's glowing. That light confirms that it's off. I can't afford any of your products, but can I buy some fake white earbuds, so people will think I have a MyPod? Sure -- those are called ""MyPhonies."" Oh, and they cost forty dollars. Oh, I'll never get a Mapple anything. I hate this MyPod! I can't watch movies on a screen this small. And the music today -- don't get me started. I said, don't get me started!! Come on, isn't someone gonna get me started?! Let's go, Teeny. Maybe somebody at Old Navy will get me started. Here kid, you take it. Thank you, Krusty! Don't thank me, thank the Jewish Clown Awards gift basket. I'm a Mapple person! We're all Mapple people. Sorry. Attention, Mapple universe! Prepare for a live announcement from Mapple founder and Chief Imaginative Officer Steve Mobbs. Steve Mobbs?! / He's a genius! He's like a god who knows what we want! Greetings, it is I, your insanely great leader, Steve Mobbs! I'm speaking to you from Mapple headquarters deep below the sea, with an announcement that will completely change the way you look at everything... And that announcement is... You're all losers! You think you're cool because you buy a five hundred dollar phone with a picture of a fruit on it?! Well, guess what? They cost eight bucks to make and I pee on every one! I have made a fortune off you chumps -- and I've invested it all in Microsoft! Now my boyfriend Bill Gates and I kiss each other on a pile of your money! / Noooo! Traitor! Your heart is blacker than your turtleneck! Who dares question the boss we fired ten years ago and then brought back? It was my brother Bart! Flay him with your earbuds! Flay him I say! MyCube! Take me away! Get him! Stupid angry mob... chasing me because I shine a harsh light on modern society. Now I know how Dane Cook feels. Mmm, what's that exotic aroma? It smells like a hamburger cooked at a rug store. Hello. Would you like some lamb? Whoa. All these years I've been petting lambs when I should've been shoving them in my mouth. I'm Bart. I'm Bashir. My family and I just moved here, from Jordan. Jordan. That's on some map somewhere, right? Bashir, introduce me to your new friend. Bashir, you didn't tell me you had a sister. Such a charmer. Would you like to stay for dinner? Hey, I never refuse food from strangers. Okay, you're new to our school, so here's the deal: we call Skinner, ""Skin-rash,"" Mr. Wiener is ""Mr. Whiner,"" and Groundskeeper Willie, ""Grounds-creeper Stupid."" Ah, that's not clever. And I have so many aspects you can mock! I'm poor, I'm dirty, I can't read nor write, I think movies are real... Okay, next, here's the food at the cafeteria that will make you sick: coleslaw, tuna, all chowders and gumbos. The only thing that's safe is the pork chops. My religion says I can never eat pork. A different religion? Do not tell anyone that, because if the bullies around here find out that you're different-- Who's different? What's your name, sweat stain? Uh, Bashir. ""Bash here?"" I love a kid that comes with directions. Okay, ""Bashir"". Tell us where you came from so we can punch you back there. I'm gonna punch you extra hard 'cause I secretly think you're cute. Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't just whale on him because he's... what religion are you anyway? Muslim. Hoo boy. You're the reason I can't carry toothpaste on an airplane! Ow! Look guys, everyone's different. Jimbo, you're Christian. Dolph, you're Jewish. And Kearney, your family's in that cult Moe started. I had to join. My Mom's doin' the savior. I mean, the one true Moe. You're the one true mo. Help me, almighty Moe! Can't. I'm not really a God. I was just acting crazy to get out of jury duty. Look at Lisa Simpson, over there by herself. Not talking to us, her best friends. Do we hate her? Yes. Lisa, we came to tell you that we-- Is that a MyPod? Yeah. I've already downloaded so much incredible music! Check out ""Moon Dreams"" from Miles Davis' ""Birth of the Cool."" Or, check out this MyTunes-exclusive episode of ""Itchy and Scratchy."" Why? Stop! Marge, I installed all the low energy bulbs! What have you done with the old ones? Disposed of them in an environmentally friendly manner! Salaam alaikum. Salaam alaikum! Milhouse is lookin' good -- he's got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... Salaam alaikum! Dad, that's Bashir -- my new friend. Bart forgot this, sir. Sir? That's the kind of respect you'd have to strangle out of an American kid. You know, Bart never told me he had a handsome teenage brother. I'm really thirty-eight. Thirty-eight waist I might believe. Hey Carl, got any idea what direction Mecca's in? Why don'tcha ask Homer? He oughtta know, by dint of his son's new friend. Hey, Bashir's great. If Derek Jeter married Mariah Carey, it wouldn't last, but I bet they'd have a kid like him. Homer, this is serious. This Bashir kid is Muslim, and therefore up to something. Oh, I can't believe that till I see a fictional TV program espousing your point of view. For the last time, Fayed, where did you hide the nerve gas! Under your Statue Of Liberty's dress! And she loved it! Oh my God. What can I do? Well, if you want to stop Bashir and his war on American principles, you could discriminate against his family, in employment and housing. That's pretty patriotic, but I got a better idea -- invite 'em over. A little dinner, a little dessert, then you Jack Bauer 'em into giving you all their secrets. I guess I have no choice. Homie, it's very open-minded of you to have Bart's Muslim friend's Muslim family over. Here's the plan, Marge. You keep 'em talking. I'll be listening... and quietly judging. The doorbell will tell you when they're here. So, how did you two meet? We met while studying at Jordan University of Science and Technology. Ah, interesting. Why just the other day I was reading that science is used to make bombs. Now bait the trap. Why don't I get us dessert? I made us a little cake. Care to cut? Watch this, Lenny. Not now! I got soap in my eyes. No, thank you. What's the matter? Don't like the taste of freedom? Dad! These people are my friends! Don't fear them just because they have a different religion, a different culture, and their last name is Bin Laden! Young man, you do not respect us by disrespecting your father. I like the way you Italians think. Shut up, old man. I think it is time for us to go. That's it! Ruin a perfect evening! You're teaching Bart a terrible lesson of intolerance! I'm sorry -- it's just so fun and easy to judge people based on religion. Well, I want you to go over to their house and apologize! But we're the more powerful country for a few more years. Okay, I'll apologize. Up-bup-bup! Don't eat that, sweetie, it's poison. I am sorry I suspected you of being soulless murderers of innocent children. I hope we can move past this and... Dynamite?! They are terrorists! Must leave quietly. So far so good. Marge! I was right! Everybody is whatever I think they are. I saw them unloading dynamite! Homer, I'm sure you didn't see anything. Go to sleep. All right, sweetie. But if I wake up tomorrow we'll discuss it. Hi, Homer! You rubbed? You must like me. You really, really like me! Good Morrrning, Ramadan! Come to Crazy Fayeddie's! Our prices are Hussein! Heeeeere's Genie! Now do Flanders! No, now I will destroy your decadent Western society. Nooooooo! Hm. Usually that ends the dream. The power of dreaming has convinced me the threat is real! Delivery for Lisa Simpson. It's a gift from Mapple! Oh, such beautiful packaging! I never thought a company could be my soul mate! Oh, it's my first MyBill. Twelve hundred dollars?! But I only downloaded... twelve hundred and twelve songs! Gotta prove the genie was right... Off to work. Sometimes I wish you would quit that awful business. But I love blowing up buildings. Oh my God! Safely and legally, in order to make room for new buildings. Darling, I think you're working much too hard. Yes, I am killing myself. But it is all for the profit. After the explosion I will be in a better place. That corner office with the downtown view! Oh, it's you. What do you want? I want to apologize for being such a jerk at dinner. And I thought the best way to do that would be to come to your house and poke around. Mr. Simpson, I accept your apology. Goodbye. Wait, wait, wait, wait... I read somewhere your people are hospitable to guests. Is that true? Yes. Praise be Oliver. That's Allah! We'll look it up in the Corona. So... now that we're alone, um... death to America, right? Homer, why are you really here? Oh, look at that. We're out of almond paste. Don't get up. I'll grind the almonds myself. A computer! I'm in! Springfield mall?! They're gonna blow it up! Homer? I don't hear almond grinding! Just lis-ten! I'm grinding them now! Ow! My finger! Ooh, here comes the ambulance! My, you're a handsome fellow. Just get in the ambulance, Mr. Simpson. We'll see to your finger. Why thank you. Ow! My finger! Everyone get out! Run for your lives! Run for your-- Uh... stay where you are! Bart? Boy, don't blow up this mall! It has the cookie store that gives free samples! I can't believe your dad gets paid to blow stuff up. Actually, Bart, my job is about math and engineering. Every calculation is to make sure the explosion is safe. Did you factor in one bald idiot? No, I... U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! Dad, it was an empty building. It was supposed to come down! What about the bridge? That was supposed to open tomorrow. Did we really need a bridge there? The Duff brewery is on that island. I'll save you! That banner has really paid for itself over the years. We accept your apology. Lisa, add another name to our Christmas card list. Next to our Jewish friends. Where is Lisa? She said something about ""the bottom of the ocean"" and ""be back in a month."" Welcome to Mapple Headquarters. The cost of this journey will be added to your bill. Come on... Come on... Yes! Sixteen million results! Mr. Mobbs, there's a surface dweller here to see you -- MyTunes user JazzGal62. Oh Lisa Simpson, send her in. Lisa, it's insanely great to see you. Um, Mr. Mobbs... I sort of downloaded too many songs onto my MyPod. And I don't have the money to pay for them. And... do you think you could consider a reduced payment plan? I'm sorry. I know our posters say ""think differently""... But our real slogan is ""no refunds."" Can't you open your Mapple menu and click on the compassion bar? Oh please? Lisa, how would you like to work for Mapple? Would I ever! Think differently... Think differently... Think differently...
