10,11,"Froggie, I'm home. Hi, little fella. Got some nice juicy flies for ya. Jeez, Louise. Look at this mess. I told that boy a billion times to pick up his jun-- I like to play with you. I like to play with you. I like to play with you. My back! There goes my back again! Go get help, boy. Oh, Maggie. My poor back. I like to play with you... I like to play with you... I like to play wit... youuu... I lik... to... pl... wi... youuu. Dad! Homer! What happened? The boy. Bring me the boy. Bart, if you had cleaned up your room when I asked you to, your father's trick back would still be aligned. So you pick up this mess right now. Clumsy Homer... Everything's always my fault... If he'd just watch where he was going... Hello. What have we here? A cherry bomb! I thought I blew all you guys up. People, people, no rough-housing on the monkey bars. You there, tuck in your shirt. Watch it, I saw that. You certainly have done awfully well for yourself, Spanky. Mother, please don't call me Spanky on school grounds. Wow! A cherry bomb! What are you gonna do with it, Bart? Watch out, Bart. It's Skinner. Uh-oh. Good morning, Mr. Skinner. 'Morning, boys. Why haven't you introduced me to any of your students, Spanky? Well? Well Mother, I would like you to meet, Milhouse, Lewis, Richard and... Bart Simpson. This is the Bart Simpson you're always talking about? Mmm-hmm. But he looks so sweet. I am, ma'am. Simpson! Let's move on now, Mother, shall we? 'Bye, Spanky. So, you're gonna flush it? What can I say? I got a weakness for the classics. I think I need to make a stop at the little girl's room. Okay, Mother. This way. So long, sucker. Now, hold it right there you... Spanky... Mother! Oh Marge! I still hurt! Marge! Marge! Oh, Homer. How many times do I have to fluff your pillow? Actually, I was wondering if you could make me a grilled cheese sandwich? Well... okay. Make sure it's squished flat and crunchy on the outside. I know how you like 'em, Homer. And maybe some of those little wieners that come in a can. Oh, and some fruit cocktail... in heavy syrup. Marge! Marge! Marge! Get the door. Principal Skinner! Hello, Mrs. Simpson. I'm afraid there's been a very disturbing incident at school today. I'm outta here, man. Homer, Principal Skinner's here. Oh, hello Principal Skinner. I'd get up but the boy crippled me. Mmm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning, when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory. That old gag. Unfortunately, at the same moment, my mother was in the girls' lavatory making use of the facilities. Oh, dear. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have transcended incorrigible. I don't think suspension or expulsion will do the trick. I think it behooves us all to consider... deportation. Deportation! You mean kick Bart out of the country? Hear him out, Marge. Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib. Let me explain. Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program. Now normally, a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence, but in Bart's case I'm prepared to make a big exception. And, if you're willing to play along, he can spend the next three months studying far, far away. Sounds great, although a kid can't learn much in just three months. Homer! You didn't even ask where Bart would be going. Actually, he'd be staying in France in a lovely chateau in the heart of the wine country. But Bart doesn't speak French. Oh! When he's totally immersed in a foreign language, the average child can become fluent in weeks. Yeah, but what about Bart? I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by. And the whole thing won't cost you a dime as long you're willing to take in a student of your own. Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know some principal over in France isn't pulling the same scam you are? Well, for one thing, you wouldn't be getting a French boy. You would be getting an Albanian. You mean all white with pink eyes? No, no, no, no. A student from Albania. It's a country on the Adriatic Sea. Well, going to France sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but I think Bart should have a say in this. Aah, the life of a frog. That's the life for me. Bart, how would you like to spend the next three months living in France? France? Wow. He makes me crazy twelve months a year. At least you get the summer off. Mmm-hmm. And I'd get to take a plane there, wouldn't I, Mom? Yes, Bart. Wow. And one back? Mmm-hmm. Well, Bart seems very enthusiastic about the idea. Yes! Yes! Way to go! Bon voyage, boy. Goodbye, my special, my special little guy. You will write us, won't you? All the time. What do you know about France? I know I'm going and you're not. I'm gonna miss you, son. And listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. I guess what I'm saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room. Okay, Dad. Is one of you going to be on the charter flight? Yes, sir. Mmm-hmm. Well, come along. Goodbye, Bart. 'Bye, Bart. 'Bye. We miss you. Be good. The life jacket is under the seat. Goodbye, Adil. Write us often. We will miss you, my son. And I will miss you, but now I must go. Hey, man, watch it. Hey, man, it's me, Bart Simpson. Okay, kid, let's go. Hey! LITTLE BREEZE SEEMS TO WHISPER LOUISE / BIRDS IN THE TREES SEEM TO LOUISE / La la la la / La la la la Ooo la la... How much longer, sir? This is where we're going, right? Cha...teau Ma...son. Ah, Maurice. Once the American boy gets here, your days of endless back-breaking labor will be over. Ewww, what a dump. You know, in Albania the unit of currency is called the lek. You gotta be kiddin'. The lek? And the national flag is a two-headed eagle on a red field. Give me the old stars and stripes. And the main export is furious political thought. Political what? Trans Albanian Airlines, Flight Number two, Tirana to Springfield, is now arriving at Gate Nine. Welcome to your new home. Escape is impossible. My name is Cesar. This is my nephew, Ugolin. You may find life here at the Chateau hard. But if you shut up and do exactly what we say, the time will pass more quickly. He's right, you know. Well, okay, sir. Adil? Mother? Well, I guess for the next few months, yes, I'll be your mother. And this must be Lisa and Maggie... and you must be my new father, Homer. Affectionate little Albanian, isn't he? Cesar, look! We are rich! These won't fit us, but we can sell them. And a red hat for you, Maurice. Hey, come on guys. Quit being so grabby. Sorry, man. Be my guest. You may find his accent peculiar. Certain aspects of his culture may seem absurd, perhaps even offensive. But I urge you all to give little Adil the benefit of the doubt. In this way, and only in this way, can we hope to better understand our backward neighbors throughout the world. Thank you, Principal Skinner. Thank you, fellow students. Although I have only been in your country a few days, I have already found Americans to be most... trusting. Although officially I am required to hate you, I want you to know I do not feel it in my heart. Hurry up, boy. My grapes are waiting for their water. How can you defend a country where five percent of the people control ninety-five percent of the wealth? I'm defending a country where people can think and act and worship any way they want. Can not. Can, too. Can not. Can, too. Please, please kids. Stop fighting. Maybe Lisa's right about America being a land of opportunity, and maybe Adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers. Your father is right. We should not fight. Friends? Well, okay. Well, now that that's settled, I'll just clear the dishes. No, no, Mrs. Simpson. You have been oppressed enough for today. I will clear the dishes. Oh. Okay. Did you see that? You know, Marge, this is the way I've always wanted it to be. We've become a fully functioning family unit. We've always blamed ourselves, but I guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing. Homer! Your paper-thin commitment to your children sends shivers down my spine. May I be excused? Lisa! Oh, she's just jealous. She'll get over it, and if she doesn't, we can always exchange her. Homer! Just kidding. Mmm. Good sausage. Yes, pass me the wine. Can I have something to go with my turnip? Quiet! When you work like a man, we will feed you like one. Now, go to sleep. Hey! Hey! Come on. Move it, pal. You leave Maurice alone. The floor is good enough for you. You go to sleep there. Nice and cozy, Adil? Yes, thank you, Father. Look, Adil. You can call me Dad. All right, Dad. Aww. You called me dad. Dad, do you think I could come visit you at the nuclear power plant? You want to see where I work? Oh, yes, very much. None of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work. Then I can go? Well, I'll have to pull a few strings with the boys in Security, but sure, you bet. Excellent. Now watch me. You grab the grape between your thumb and forefinger and gently twist it off and drop it in the bucket. Now you do it. Very good. Now do it a million times. See these? American donuts. Glazed, powdered, and raspberry filled. Now how's that for freedom of choice? Dad, do you think I might see your plutonium isolation module? Uh... maybe. Hold on a second. Hey, Lenny. Does this place have one of those plutonium isolation deals? Yeah, over in Sector Twelve. Sector Twelve? Third floor by the candy machines. Oh, that Sector Twelve. Come along, Adil. Ungrateful swine! We give you food, we give you shelter, and this is how you repay us. You little shutterbug. Cheese! Ugh, ugh, ugh. Stu-pid grapes... Bunch of creeps... I hate France. Ugh! You sure have taken a shine to little Adil. Well, he sure makes life a lot easier around here. You have to admit that. Well, okay, I will. If you admit you love Bart. Okay, okay. I love Bart. Well... What? Well? Oh... Adil's a very sweet boy. Darn tootin'. Sparrow to Nest. Sparrow to Nest. Stand by for transmission. I told you the Sparrow would not fail. Dear Bart, How is France? I don't know why you haven't written. I guess you're just having too much fun. Yeah, right. Silence! Everyone here in the United States is fine. We think Maggie may say her first word any day now. Lisa got an A in Math, which I'm only mentioning as news -- I'm not putting you down. And your father, well... last night he went to sleep talking about how much he loves you. Remember to dress warm and try to be as helpful as you can to your adopted parents. All my love, Mom. This will be our finest vintage ever. But it's only been fermenting for three days. Whenever I find my faith in a higher power shaken, I always think of the miracle of anti-freeze. Too much can be poison. But the right amount gives wine just the right kick. Mais dans les proportions voulues, ca donne du corps au vin.) You put in too much. It may kill someone. Kill someone? Don't be ridiculous. What are you doing? Get out of here. Sorry. On second thought, Bart, Bart, come here. Watch, I bet it won't even blind him. Drink this. Uh, no thanks. Do not worry. This is France. It is customary for children to take a little wine now and then. Yeah, but it's got anti-freeze in there. Drink it! He sees well enough. Now, go buy a case of anti-freeze. But it is raining outside. Let's make the wine tomorrow. We have already waited three days. Then send the boy. Oh, Bart! You're a policeman, aren't you? I am sorry. I do not speak English. But you gotta help me. These two guys I'm staying with, they work me day and night, they don't feed me, they make me sleep on the... Here you go, little boy. Have a piece of candy. Tiens, petit garcon, voila un bonbon.) I don't want a piece of candy, I need your hel-- Come on, mister. Can you help me? I am sorry. Aw, forget it. I'm so stupid. Anybody could have learned this dumb language by now. Here I've listened to nothing but French for the past deux mois, et je ne sais pas un mot. Eh! Mais, je parle francois maintenant. Incroyable! Hey, monsieur. Aidez-moi! Ces deux types chez qui j'habite me fait travailler jour et nuit, ils ne me donnent pas a manger, ils me fait dormir sur la terre, ils mettent d'antigel dans le vin, et ils sont donne mon chapeau rouge a l'ane. Anti-freeze in the wine? That is a very serious crime. Come along, boy. There is nothing for you to fear now. Mon sauveteur! Vous aurez toujours une place dans mon coeur! Honey, I'm home. Hello, Homer. What's that? Oh, just some blueprints Adil wanted. I'm telling you, he's such a curious little dickens. I bet he could build a nuclear power plant if he wanted to. All right, Sparrow. We know you're in there. We'll give you one minute to surrender. Oh, my. Ooh, trouble in the neighborhood. Let's check it out. I'm his neighbor, what'd he do? Well, sir... Well, sir, we've been on the trail of a spy transmitting highly confidential information to an unfriendly nation. Oooo. Mmm-hmm. Through the use of radio triangulation, we tracked him to exactly this point. Wow! That's all I can tell you. Aw! All right. Well, the name of his country starts with the letter ""A"". Hmmm. Time's up, Sparrow. We're coming in after you. Gee whiz. Adil would get a kick out of seeing this. Adil? The Sparrow! Adil! Oh... there you are. Get him! Ouch! Watch it! Hey. Ow, Ouch! From now on you will be doing all your winemaking in prison. Prison? Oh, my. And all because we participated in a student exchange program! Au revoir, suckers. So, he's going to prison? No. We've arranged an exchange for one of our own men caught in Albania. So, Sparrow. We meet again. Yes, sometimes I think I am getting too old for this game. Okay, kids. Let's hurry it up. Goodbye, Simpsons. Thank you for your hospitality. I hope this experience will not sour you on the student exchange program. Goodbye, Adil. It was a pleasure... Goodbye Adil. Have a nice trip. Goodbye, Adil. I'll send you those civil defense plans you wanted. Air France Flight Dix-neuf cent quatre-vingt huit, Paris to Springfield, is now arriving. Look, Mom. There he is. Oh, Bart, my baby boy. Welcome home. Hey, where's the big guy? He needs me. Hey, boy. Hey, Homer. He brought us gifts. His first unselfish act. So, basically, I met one nice French person. Bart, I have something to say that's gonna bother me if I don't say it... It's good to see you. Same here. Homer, I'd love a glass of that wine Bart brought us. Sorry, Marge. Some wiseguy stuck a cork in the bottle. My father. What a buffoon. Did you hear that, Marge? My boy speaks French.","Father, Female Announcer, Milhouse Van Houten, Steward, Agnes Skinner, Marge Simpson, Gendarme, Brad, Military Man, Homer Simpson, Cesar, Male Announcer, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, Krusty Doll, Lenny Leonard, Mother, UGOLIN, Adil Hoxha, Cia Agent #2, MARGE & BART, Lewis Clark, Cia Agent #1, Bart Simpson",7.8,1539.0,11,1990-04-15,1990,1,The Crepes of Wrath,31.2,60458.0
