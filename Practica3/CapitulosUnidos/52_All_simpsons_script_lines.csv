51,52,"Mmm, do - nuts. Hey Homer, slow down. You're gonna choke or somethin'. Don't tell me how to eat donuts -- Hey, Homer's choking again. Hmm. Isn't there a first aid chart around here somewhere? Somebody scare him. That's for hiccups. Hey, look at this. Softball starts this week. Softball? Who's next? What's the matter with you guys? Homer, last year we were two and twenty-eight. Look, I know it wasn't our best season. Actually, it was. Well, this year's gonna be different. Oh yeah. What makes you so damn sure? I have a secret weapon. Hey, he's been holding' out on us. A secret weapon? I wonder what it could be. Come here boy, I want to show you something. What's that? A home-made bat? It's something very special. A home-made bat. It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house... Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find. Something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that I could make a bat out of. I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat. Homie, come to bed. Homer, go back to the garage. And here it is. Wow! How many home runs you gonna hit with that? Let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand. Hit one here, Charlie. Okay, let's go over the ground rules. You can't leave first until you chug a beer. Any man scoring has to chug a beer. You have to chug a beer at the top of all odd numbered innings. Oh, and the fourth inning is the beer inning. Hey, we know how to play softball. Play ball! Attention all units! Attention all units! Armored car being robbed at... Turn off that damn radio! And the next man wants to hit the ball too. And he does. And there he goes off in that direction. And everyone is happy. Uh, Mom, why don't you let me call the game. That's all right dear. I can do it. Hey, stop that! Okay, Homer, bases loaded and you're up. Where's that secret weapon? Check it out, boys. My magic bat. That's it? Yeah, I got a magic bat, too. And I got an enchanted jock strap. Yeah, just watch. Woo hoooooo! Ha ha. Cops can't win! Get his license and registration. Right, Chief. Wow, Dad. Homer, can I get you a beer? No, I want to get him a beer. Kids, kids, kids. You can each get me a beer. But first let's see it again in super slow motion. Such a mighty wallop. Hey, I got my magic bat off a piano. My sister let me use her wooden leg. Good news, sir! The plant's softball team has won again. If we beat Shelbyville next week we capture the pennant. Did you hear that, Ari? My boys need only to thump your tub and the title is ours. Ha!! My gladiators from my power plant will crush your team like nine flabby grapes. I disagree. Would you care to bet a million dollars on that? Oh, if we're going to bet, why don't we make it interesting? What? A million dollars isn't interesting to you? Oh, did you say a million? I'm... I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere. I thought you would start with a small amount, then we would bait each other and... well, you know how it goes. Yes... certainly, a million will be fine. Um-hm. Smithers, I've been thinking. Is it wrong to cheat in order to win a million dollar bet? Yes, sir. Let me rephrase that. Is it wrong if I cheat in order to win a million dollar bet? No, sir! Whom should I kill? No, Smithers. I've decided to bring in a few ringers. Professional baseballers. We'll give them token jobs at the plant and have them play on our softball team. Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, Mordecai ""Three Finger"" Brown... Uh... sir... What is it, Smithers? I'm afraid... all those players have retired and... uh... passed on. In fact, your right fielder has been dead for a hundred and thirty years. Damnation! All right, find me some good players. Living players! Scour the professional ranks. The American League. The National League. The Negro Leagues. I'm on my way, sir. Oh, and Smithers... You have twenty-four hours. I get $50,000 to play one game? That's right, Mr. Canseco. Well, it's a pay cut. But what the hey, it sounds like fun. Ow. Hey, sorry! I thought you were a deer. That's okay, happens all the time. Are you Mike Scioscia? That's me. Uh, how do you like working for the Dodgers? Well, it's okay. But sometimes I wish I had something a little more blue collar. You know, with big machines and cool dials and stuff, like an oil refinery or a hydro-electric plant. We should talk. And this is Elvis' rec room. When the King wasn't rehearsing or exercising, he liked to unwind by watching up to three TVs at once. Man, oh, man, what a lifestyle. Excuse me, are you Ozzie Smith? Yes. I have a proposition for you... Hello, are you Don Mattingly? Yes, yes I am. Come in. Come in. Can I get you something? What's your name? How would you like to be a ringer on a small town company softball team? Would I! And now I'd like to introduce the new members of our happy power plant family. Our new security guard... Roger Clemens... Hello. our new janitor, Wade Boggs... How you doin'? our new lunchroom cashier... Ken Griffey, Jr.... Hey, what's up guys? Our new, well uh, we'll make up jobs for these fellows later... Please say hello to Steve Sax, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry, Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia, and Jose Canseco. Oh, by the way, you new fellows, there's a sign up sheet for the company softball team on the bulletin board over there. Eh, just in case you wish to play. Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Burns. With them on the team, you won't need us! Well... duh. You, Scioscia, sign up... Thanks just the same, but I'm here to run the solid contaminant encapsulator. One more outburst like that and I'll send you back to the big leagues! You're Darryl Strawberry. Yes. You play right field. Yes. I play right field too. So? Well, are you better than me? Well, I've never met you, but... yes. It's not fair. Me and the guys worked so hard to get to the championship game and now we'll be sitting on a bench. You hit so many home runs this year. What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry character is better than you? Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do. You make me sick Homer. You're the one who told me I could do anything if I just put my mind to it. Well now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's a crock. No matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you. Gotcha. Can't win, don't try. As your new manager, I want to say this up front. No one is assured a spot in the starting line-up. I don't care if your name is Steve Sax, Darryl Strawberry, or... Smithers, what's one of the bad players' names? Homer Simpson, sir. Or Homer Simpson. Secondly, instead of beer, from now on you will all be drinking this! It's a brain and nerve tonic. Rich in proteids and electromagnetic juices. It promotes robust health. Of course, it has been known to cause gigantism, but only in rare cases. Try some. Wow! It's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited. Excellent. Now, let's begin our training, shall we? Smithers -- the medicine balls. What are you going to do with your million dollars, sir? Oh, I don't know. Throw it on the pile, I suppose. You are all very good players. We are all very good players. You will beat Shelbyville. We will beat Shelbyville. You will give one hundred and ten percent. That's impossible no one can give more than one hundred percent. By definition that is the most any one can give. I got it! I got it! Yes! Hey, I called for that! Put a lid on it, Simpson. There's no ""I"" in ""team"". Some of these guys have a bad attitude, skip. They sure do, Strawberry. Hey Scioscia, I don't get it. You're a ringer but you're here every night, in the core, bustin' your butt haulin' radioactive waste. Well Carl, it's such a relief from the pressures of playing big league ball. I mean, there you make any kind of mistake and boom, the press is all over you. Uh-oh. Ah, don't worry about it. Oh man, is this ever sweet. Pick me! Pick me! I pick Ken Griffey Jr. Aw geez... okay, I'll take Milhouse. Hey, Mr. Boggs! Will you be on my team? You got yourself a player. Damn! All right, I'll take Lewis. I'll take Jose Canseco. Mattingly! Get rid of those sideburns! What sideburns? You heard me, hippy. Mattingly! Get rid of those sideburns. What sideburns? You heard me, hippie. These guys aren't so tough. I've got ""Wonder Bat."" Take a knee boys. Tomorrow is the biggest day of your lives. The Shelbyville game. So lights out at seven-thirty and abstain from coffee, tea, and cola drinks. Make no mistake, they pack a wallop. Sure do, Skip. Yes. Now, before I post the starting line-up I want to assure those of you whose names are not on the list, that I'm very disappointed in you. Something was lacking, let's call it heart. No hustle either, Skip. That's right, Darryl. Aw, nuts! Please, please, please, I want to make the team. Clemens, did I make the team? You sure did. I did! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry! Wait a minute, are you Ken Griffey Jr.? No. Sorry, I didn't mean to get your hopes up. Smithers, there's no way I can lose this bet. Unless, of course, my nine all-stars fall victim to nine separate misfortunes and are unable to play tomorrow. But that will never happen. Three misfortunes, that's possible. Seven misfortunes, there's an outside chance. But nine misfortunes... I'd like to see that. What a nice little town. Maybe I'll buy a home here when I retire. What seems to be the problem, officers? That's enough out of you, smart guy. Reach for your license... slowly. Well well, Steve Sax from New York City. I heard some guy got killed in New York City, and they never solved the case. But you wouldn't know anything about that -- now would you Steve? But there's hundreds of unsolved murders in New York City. You don't know when to keep your mouth shut, do you Saxy boy? Uh, Mike, try to lift your arm. Can't... lift... arm... or... speak... at... normal... rate. Well, I'm afraid you have a case of acute radiation poisoning, Mr. Scioscia. Will... I... be... able... to... play... softball... tomorrow? No, by tomorrow you'll barely be able to breathe. Oh... man. Dr. Hibbert, Ken Griffey, Jr. needs to see you immediately. We think it's an overdose of nerve tonic. Good Lord! Gigantism! My baby! My baby! Don't worry, ma'am -- I'll save your baby. Oh, thank you, Mr. Conseco. My cat! Never fear, ma'am! I'll save your cat! My player piano! Oh, man. One thing I'm good at and I can't do it anymore. Oh, Homie. You're good at lots of things. Like what? Like snuggling... Yeah, but none of my friends can watch me. And I say, England's greatest Prime Minister was Lord Palmerston. Pit the Elder. Lord Palmerston! Pit the Elder! Okay, you asked for it, Boggs! Yeah, that's showin' him, Barney. Pit the Elder. Lord Palmerston! Nice work, boys. I think we can close the book on just about every unsolved crime in our fair city. Don't I at least get to call my lawyer? You watch too many movies, Sax. How long does it take to see this thing? I'm kind of in a hurry. Well, it's hard to say, my friend. Once you go in, you may never come out. Wow! One please. Where do you think you're going? To the game. No, no, no! I don't want you to see me sitting on my butt. We've seen it, dad. Mattingly, for the last time, get rid of those sideburns! Look, Mr. Burns. I don't know what you think sideburns are, but... Don't argue with me! Just get rid of them. Smithers, it's almost game time. Where the devil are my ringers? Sir, Mike Socioscia may not live through the night. Steve Sax is looking at six consecutive life sentences. And Ozzie Smith seems to have vanished off the face of the earth. Cool! What about Conseco? The dryer goes on the right. Yes ma'am. What about Clemens? Sir... he's in no condition to play. Brock, bock, bock, bock. Brock, bock, bock, bock. That damn hypnotist! You, look what you've done! My starting pitcher thinks he's a chicken! Make no mistake, I'm going to report this to the American Hypnotical Association. But I did a good job... a gooood job. Oh well, I guess it's not your fault... you did a good job. Mattingly, I thought I told you to trim those sideburns. Go home! You're off the team! For good! Fine. I still like him better than Steinbrenner. All right, you rag-tag bunch of misfits. You hate me, and I hate you even more. But without my beloved ringers, you're all I've got. So I want you to remember some inspiring things that someone else may have told you in the course of your lives, and go out there and win! Not so fast, Simpson. The man who plays your position is still here. Hit the pine. You stink Strawberry. We want Home-run Homer! Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl. Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl. Children, that's not very nice. Mom, they're professional athletes. They're used to this sort of thing. It rolls right off their backs. All right, Monty, it's up to you managerial skills. What to do. Smithers, massage my brain. Yes, sir. You! Strawberry, hit a home run. Okay, Skip! I told him to do that. Brilliant strategy, sir. Oh, dear. Children, tell me when your father stops scratching himself. Kids? We'll tell ya, mom. All right, tie game. Bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, Strawberry coming up... They're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me. Wait! You! Strawberry! Good effort today. Take a lap and hit the showers. I'm putting in a right-handed batter to hit for you. What? You're pinch-hitting for me? Yes. You see, you're a left-hander. And so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter, it's called playing the percentages. It's what smart managers do to win ballgames. But I've got nine home runs today. You should be very proud of yourself. Sit down! Simpson! You're batting for Strawberry. I am? Whoo-hoo! Atta boy, Homer. You can do it. Brock, bock, bock, bock, bock! All right, Simpson, let's go over the signals. If I tug the bill of my cap like so... Yes. ...it means the signal is a fake. Uh uh. However, I can take that off by dusting my hands thusly. Got it. If I want you to bunt, I will touch my belt buckle not once, not twice, but thrice... Uh-oh. I don't understand a word he's saying. Why doesn't he just let me bat? I wish I was home with a big bag of potato chips... Mmm potato chips. Got that Simpson? Yes, sir! Now batting for Darryl Strawberry, Homer Simpson. Huh? Oh, dear. No mom, it counts as a hit. Dad just won the game. Ohh, well, I guess he'll be happy when he comes to. We won! We won! All right! WELL MR. BURNS HAD DONE IT / THE POWER PLANT HAD WON IT / WITH ROGER CLEMENS CLUCKING ALL THE WHILE / MIKE SOCIOSCIA'S TRAGIC ILLNESS MADE US SMILE / WHILE WADE BOGGS LAY UNCONSCIOUS ON THE BARROOM TILE / WE'RE TALKIN' SOFTBALL / FROM MAINE TO SAN DIEGO / TALKIN' SOFTBALL / MATTINGLY AND CONSECO / KEN GRIFFEY'S GROTESQUELY SWOLLEN JAW / STEVE SAX AND HIS RUN IN WITH THE LAW / WE'RE TALKIN' HO-MER / OZZIE AND THE STRAW / WE'RE TALKIN' SOFTBALL / FROM MAINE TO SAN DIEGO / TALKIN' SOFTBALL / MATTINGLY AND CONSECO / KEN GRIFFEY'S GROTESQUELY SWOLLEN JAW / STEVE SAX AND HIS RUN IN WITH THE LAW / WE'RE TALKIN' HO-MER / OZZIE AND THE STRAW.....

Oh, here, gimme the map. I'll show you. Like this, Skip? Oh, you're a manager's dream, Strawberry. Smithers, it's almost game time. Where the devil are my ringers? Sir, Mike Scioscia may not live through the night. Steve Sax is looking at six consecutive life sentences. And Ozzie Smith seems to have vanished off the face of the earth.","P.A.
