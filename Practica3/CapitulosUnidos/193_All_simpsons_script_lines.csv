189,193,"Ooo, look! This is a perfect chance to get you kids some nice church shoes. What do we need church shoes for? Jesus wore sandals. Well, maybe if he had better arch support, they wouldn't have caught him. Look, Homer. There's that bird you like to argue with. Well, well, well... If it isn't Professor Know-it-all. 'Scuse me, Marge. They need a good, stiff, all-purpose dress shoe. Something for church, but also for doctors appointments dental check-ups, piano recitals, building dedications, visiting elderly relatives, haircuts and shoe shopping. Well, we have a brown shoe. Did you hear that kids? Brown! Oh rats! Talk about bad luck! I forgot to wear socks today. Guess I can't try those on. Hm, no problem, you can wear the ""Store Sock."" Ewww! Would you mind lacing them up, kid? I have a bad back. Hey, if you didn't wanna tie shoes, you shouldn't a become a shoe salesman. That's where you're wrong, pal! It's not enough to want a cracker. You have to earn it! Mom, these are at least two sizes too big. Perfect. You'll grow into them. When? Ooh, you're both way overdue for a spurt. Excuse me, ma'am. Do you like to laugh? Oh, yes! As long as it's tasteful... And never at someone, or with... And not... Excuse me, sir? Do you like to laugh? Why, yes. Yes I do. Well, then you'll love our comedy festival. It's for a good cause. A rest home for pirates? No, Dad, it's to fight soil erosion. Now that's a fight I wanna be a part of. Hey, somebody screwed up bad! You've got all these big comics lined up for your show, but there's no Krusty. Who? Krusty the Clown! Funniest man alive? Prince of Pies? The Sultan of Seltzer? Excuse me, sir? Do you like to laugh? Well, only if something tickles me just right. . Yeah. Excuse me, I'm looking for someone named, Jay Leno. Somebody want to get this kid a TV? Oh. Gee thanks, mister. Yeah, just jokin. I-I'm Jay Leno. Oh. So what can I do for ya, huh? Well, if you're running the show, how could you leave out, Krusty the Clown? Ah, Krusty the Clown. That takes me back. Didn't he die in a grease fire? No, he's alive. And he is so funny you could plotz. At least according to his press release. Well, if he's half as alive as you say he is, he's in. Charity, eh? What's my cut?... Nothin'?! I make more than that taking a shvitz. Hey hey, happy birthday. Ah, ha. Now get 'em outta here. He seems reluctant. Tell him it'll count towards his community service. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. All right, I'll do it. Boy, you swipe one pair of Haggar slacks and you're payin' for it the rest of your life. I finally got around to reading the dictionary. Turns out the zebra did it. I don't get it. Dad, the zebra didn't do it. It's just a word at the end of the dictionary. I still don't get it. It's just a joke. Oh I get it. I get jokes. Hey, hey! It's Krusty the Clown! Hey, hey! Ha. Ha. It's you. Right? Yeah, ha, ha. And this guy, uh -- with all the jokes he does... You're the reason I went into comedy. If it weren't for you, I-I'd be a doctor. Y-Yeah, right, uh, thanks. I got my period today. Oh good Lord. Plus, I got this new boyfriend. And you know how it is when you're kissing a guy with a tongue stud... Yes! Yes! Oh, God yes! It's time for something special, the man Spencer Tracy called the most promising newcomer of 1959, please put your hands together for, Krusty the Clown! Woo hoo! Yeah! Krust-ee! Hey, hey. So... how 'bout those TV dinners, huh? I try one the other day. Lightning strikes -- the peach cobbler goes out. Cobbler. The other thing about TV dinners -- you don't have leftovers, you have reruns. TV dinner jokes? Oooh. Take that, Swansons. Didn't like that one, huh? Well... Me sooo solly! Ahh, so. What's he gonna do next -- the flapping dickey? Uh-oh, I'm losin' 'em. Time for the ""A"" material. Hey hey! Ah so. Ah so. Me lika da flied lice... Me flappa dickey long time... Hey Krusty, great set. Are you kidding? I stunk up the joint. No! No, I was talkin' to Lisa back there, we both agreed you killed. Really? Lisa, huh? Oh sure, there were a lotta laughs. Y-You probably couldn't hear 'em, the acoustics were so bad. Yeah, the acoustics, that's what it was. Oh, I mean, ""Me so solly""... Yeah, I was great. Did you get a load of Corpsy the Clown? That guy cheapens our whole profession. What do you think of him, Internet Comic? Guys, keep it down. Five minutes, Krusty. Oh, I ain't going back out there. No. Five minutes to get your stuff and get out. Where is that stinkin' monkey? 'Bout time. Gimme those reviews. ""Last night's comedy benefit delivered wall-to-wall laughs without exception."" ""The only exception was the embarrassingly dated humor of Springfield's green-haired, red-nosed hack... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Krusty the Clown."" They say any publicity is good publicity... You, sir, are an idiot. Aw, that's your answer to everything. Look at my life. I'm talkin' to a monkey and a -- I don't know what the hell you are. You can be so cruel when you're sober. Well, I'll fix that. I'm goin' on the bender to end all benders! What'd he say, Lisa? What'd he say? He said there's no shame in their forbidden love. Ooo, Diego's not gonna like that. ""Take me here, under the disco ball."" Clear the couch. It's Krusty time! And now, heeeere's Krusty! Hey, hey. I'm Kent Brockman the Clown, filling in for Krusty the Clown, who didn't come in today. He is presumed dead or on vacation. Today's top joke... It seems a local moron threw his clock out the window. We'll tell you why, right after this... Oh, this sucks. I am outta here. Wow, a clown. Do you think he's evil? He smells evil. Should we tell Daddy? No, let's poke him a little while longer. Hey! Get away from him, you little freaks! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Ooh, it hurts to talk. We'll have to work out a system of blinks. Not you, you imbecile. Oh, pew! What were ya drinkin'? Gasoline? Yes, I was drinking gasoline, Mother. Uh, Krusty... Hang on kid, I got a tack in my head. That's one of your posters. I got all the Krusty stuff. Man, look at all the crap with my face on it. ""Krusty's Personal Swabs?"" What was I thinkin'? All these years I shoulda been workin' on my act, but I was too busy sellin' out. Now I'm just a tired old hack. Ah! Ah! That burns! What the hell's on those things? Here, here, quick! Use my Krusty eyewash! No! Not on your life! Thanks for comin' over, Jay. Krusty really needs help. No question, I gotta freshen up my act. Jay, you're a professional comedian, right? Right? Answer me. Yes! Now stop squirming. I'm trying to get these tangles out. They are just impossible. Well, they are! Anyway, don't you have some advice for Krusty? Well, these days people like observational humor, about things they deal with in everyday life. Oh yeah, you mean like when your lazy butler washes your sock garters and they're still covered with shmutz? Well, kinda... But more universal. And maybe lose the ""me sooo solly"" bit. Hey, whoa, whoa. Let's not tamper with a classic. Shut up, kid. Come on, Leno. Tamper. Teach. Impart. Dad! Woop, sorry son. I didn't know you, Jay Leno, and a monkey were bathing a clown. Well, they are. So make with the loofah or get out. ... And then, of course, there's Mom, who sounds something like this. Eat your vegetables. Take a sweater. I don't think that's a good idea. Take that, Marge! Thank you. Thank you. And now, the all new comedy stylings of... Krrrusty the Clown... Oooh! Oh! Krusty! Wait, where's my water? Oh, here it is. All right. Hello. I'm a real person and as a real person I've made some humorous observations about real life. For example, have you ever noticed how there are two phone books? A white one and a yellow one? What's the deal with that? One's residential, the other is business. Oh. Well, that makes sense. What'll they think of next? Blue pages? They have those. They're government listings. I see. Uhh... what about 2 cent stamps?... pizza pie's very hot these days, uh... can't open pickle jars, no mail on Sunday... out of paper towels... Oh! Oh! Oh! What's the deal with cardboard?... Booo! All right, let's just move on to notebook two... I've really gotta get dinner started... Me too... I also have to go. Booo! Krusty, the acoustics in here are... I appreciate the effort kid, but there's only one thing left for me to do. Thank you for coming. ""Smart lads who slip betimes away / From fields where glory will not stay... Runners whom the race outran / And the name died before the man --"" Krusty, does this have a point? Yes, I'm quitting show business. I was just tryin' to go out with a little class, you jackass. But, Krusty. Why now? Why not twenty years ago? 'Cause comedy ain't funny anymore. Instead of time-tested jokes about women drivers and doctor bills, you got some big-chinned schlub readin' typos from the Palookaville Post. Well here's a headline for ya... ""Nobody Cares!"" Hey, I washed your hair. These comics today... Oh, look at me. I can't set my VCR, I can't open a bag of airline peanuts... I'm a freakin' moron! Krusty's gone nuts... Then you got these ""lady"" comics talkin' about stuff that would embarrass Redd Foxx, God rest his smutty soul. Who they slept with, what time they sit on the can... This is supposed to get you a husband? What the hell are you laughing at? I'm just tellin' the truth! And it's funny! It is? In that case, I'm proud to announce my triumphant return to comedy! Four drink minimum? I'll cover ya, honey. Hi. How you folks doin'? I'm Moe. Or as the ladies like to call me, ""Hey you, behind the bushes."" Uh, is this thing on? No. Sorry, Moe. And now, without further Apu... Woo! I have been zinged and I love it. ...the last angry clown, the man who spews truth from every orifice, ladies and gentlemen... Krusty! Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I'm watchin' TV today... Woo! TV! Yeah! All I keep seein' is dead celebrities hawkin' products! They got poor Vincent Price floatin' around on a toilet cake tellin' me about the ""horrors"" of an unfresh bowl... And I'll tell ya somethin' else, I do not believe Winston Churchill would eat at Der Wienerschnitzel! There's nothing those Madison Avenue grave robbers won't do to get us to buy their crap! Yeah! / Right On, Krusty! / You Tell 'Em! Impeach Churchill! Well, here's one dollar those crooks aren't gonna get their hands on. Ah, isn't that illegal? I don't care if it is illegal. I'm makin' a stand here. Who's with me? I am! I work like a dog for this! Oh, you're burning it all wrong, Seymour. It's my allowance, Mother, and I'll burn it the way I want. Take that, you greedy fat cats. Marge, gimme your purse. Here's $42 -- it's everything I have. Run home and bury it in the yard. I love you, Mom! You tell 'em, Krusty. / Screw everyone! / Etc. Wow, they're hanging on his every word. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I hope so. I thought I made myself clear in Boston. From now on, I'm gonna be just like Krusty and tell it like it is. Marge, you're gettin' a little fat around the old thighs. Dad! You too, Bart. Oh, knock it off, Homer. You're the fattest one in the car... You didn't have to tell it like it is, Marge. I'm proud of you, Krusty. Oh, sure, I've got material success -- my own show, acres of cars, a nice microwave oven. But you're out there on the edge, you're doing it for the sheer thrill. If I wasn't so afraid of clowns, I'd give you a big hug. Excuse me, Krusty. We've been watching you at Moe's all week. And your credibility is just... Wow! Get to the point, Armani. Well, we think you'd be the perfect spokesman for our company's new sports utility vehicle, the Canyonero. I guess you Wall Street weasels didn't get the word. Krusty's not for sale. But you endorse everything! In fact, this endorsement contract comes from your line of legal forms. It's a quality form. But those days are behind me. I don't shill for nobody no more. Are you sure? Because we're prepared to offer you a free, fully-loaded Canyonero. No! Take your corporate bloodwagon and get the hell out! Are you sure? It's free. Stop saying that! I brought a bag of money in case he wants us to burn it again. I hope he tells us to burn our pants. These things are drivin' me nuts! So this afternoon, two suits come up to me and ask me to endorse some new sports utility vehicle. Oooo! / What did you do? / Don't you hate pants? I threw those two creeps out on their ass. Yeah! / Woo! / Go Krusty! / Woo hoo hoo! Then, they followed me home, begging me to take a test drive. And let me tell you, talk about roomy! The Canyonero combines the smooth handling of a European sports car with the rugged driveability of a sturdy 4X4. / Huh? / What? Hey, Krusty, what are you talking about? I, I thought you said those guys were creeps! Yeah, but that was before I got to know 'em. And I'm tellin' ya', the Canyonero is the Cadillac of automobiles. That's Canyonero. Boo! Etc. Wait! Where you goin'? I still got plenty of beefs! Fat-free yogurt! Th-Th-Th-The quality of computer porn! I knew I shoulda gone on first. I don't get it, Krusty. You said you would never be a shill again. I learned something about myself tonight, kid. It ain't comedy that's in my blood. It's selling out. C'mon, I'll give you a ride home. Wow, this is roomy! CAN YOU NAME THE TRUCK WITH FOUR WHEEL DRIVE? / SMELLS LIKE A STEAK AND SEATS 35... / CANYONERO. CANYONERO. WELL IT GOES REAL SLOW WITH THE HAMMER DOWN / IT'S THE COUNTRY-FRIED TRUCK ENDORSED BY A CLOWN. / CANYONERO.... Hey, hey! Federal highway commission has ruled the Canyonero unsafe for highway or city driving. Canyonero! TWELVE YARDS LONG, TWO LANES WIDE. / SIXTY-FIVE TONS OF AMERICAN PRIDE. / CANYONERO CANYONERO TOP OF THE LINE IN UTILITY SPORTS. / UNEXPLAINED FIRES ARE A MATTER FOR THE COURTS. / CANYONERO CANYONERO SHE BLINDS EVERYBODY WITH HER SUPER HIGH BEAM. / SHE'S A SQUIRREL SQUASHING, DEER SMACKIN', DRIVIN' MACHINE. CANYONERO.... CANYONER-OOOO... HYAHH!! CANYONERO! Whoa, Canyonero!
