401,405,"You see, the problem is, we've grown apart. The problem is, you don't share my interest in not being with you. Another thing... I don't know where you go at night. Greetings, Two Forty-One. Why does he always bring up my weight? I want you to eliminate this reporter: Kent Brockman. He found the gully where I dump electricity every summer to jack up prices. Don't worry, sir. I'll handle this cleanly, quietly and Bart! What? Marge, I'm gonna be home late tonight. I'm going to... Midnight Monkey Madness at the zoo. Well I won't be home either. I'm, uh... flipping over wheelbarrows in case it rains. Have fun at your crazy-sounding thing. And you have fun at your ridiculous event. Love ya. Ninth floor -- assassin's perch. Now all I have to do is think of a clever line before I pull the trigger. Oh, that's a perfect one. But I don't need to say it out loud, 'cause I'm by myself. Out of my way, mystery skank! Hey! Now I don't get paid! Hey baby! / How ya doin'?! / Hello! Now I'm mad! Now I'm . Marge is a professional assassin! You just can't get Russian gangster blood out. Must be something they eat. Hey, what's that? Uh... a blender cozy. How was your night? Great, great -- I turned over so many wheelbarrows... Wait, that was your thing. Homie, I made you my ""killer"" lasagna. It's poison! Whatever you do, don't eat it. Okay, you're already eating it, but don't finish it. Okay, you finished it, but don't ask for-- Seconds, please. You moron! Just kill her! I'll kill her after dessert! You're a killer for hire! You ruined that pie! How could you not tell me you were an assassin? How could you not tell me? I told you twenty times! You never listen! Well, they're not as pretty as you, Marge. Listen, I... Okay, here's the deal, I'll do the killing for hire, and you stay home with the kids. I get fifty thousand dollars a hit -- how much do you make? I just get to keep whatever's in the guy's wallet. All those nights I thought you were out getting drunk, you were out killing people?! I was out getting drunk, then killing people! Stop it! That's my favorite couch! Why do you think I'm kicking it? Are you guys fighting over us? Whatever we did, we're sorry. Sweeties, we weren't fighting... It sounded like you were. Hey, who wants ice cream in bed? Ice cream! Ice cream! / Dad's the best! Great. Now they're gonna have tummy aches tomorrow, and where will ""super dad"" be then? At your funeral. We got a complaint from an anonymous ""neighboreeno"" about an elaborately-choreographed high-octane ultra-fight. I would have taken a bribe! Oh, that was so hot! I love watching you do other guys! I'd like to see you do a guy sometime. That can be arranged. Oh, what a wonderful night. ...so, killing people together has really spiced things up in the bedroom. That's terrific, but I called you here to discuss your son's misbehavior on the school bus. Crème brûlée! Crème brûlée! Or in English: Burnt Cream! Burnt Cream! Hold on -- I still have to caramelize. Bart, go out to the shed and get some more butane! Oh my God. An alien... in our butane storage shed! Wow! Is that your space name? No. You hit me in my seven hundred testicles. Why did you come to our world? My friends and I came in peace to find your vulnerabilities and, um, shore them up with more peace. Yes. Then I was accidentally left behind... in a spirit of peace. Whoa. Is that a ray gun? No, it's a... deodorant applicator. I'll just... Smells like a summer breeze. So, this is my Krusty doll, Funzo, Linguo, Iraq War Sergeant Activity with insufficient armor, Phonic Frog, cat skull, Jim Halterman bobble-head doll -- he's a local car dealer... Hm... do all humans have such weak necks? Or just the one you call ""Jim Halterman?"" Oh my God, an alien! I'm gonna blow Rachel Goodman away at show-and-tell! No! If the government finds out he's here, they'll dissect him! I only hope those scientists leave me my mouth, so I may spread my message of peace through song. PEACE, PEACE, PEACE, PEACE FROM SPACE / As this month's rotating president of the Springfield Future Scientists Club, may I say: I'm sorry. And is there anything we can do to help? Well... I would like to phone home. To tell my family I'm okay... To do so, I would need the following items. Fiber-optic cable, Uranium two thirty-five, two tickets to ""Avenue Q"", seven billion body bags... Can I hammer that? No. Can I weld that? No. Can I tighten the-- I said no! I thought we were supposed to do this together. Actually, I do have an important job for you. You can go get the wrench I dropped. I'm helping! I'm helping! Way to get rid of Bart. He can be such a pest. You are very observant, Lisa -- that's why I have a special job for you. Go find out the secret locations of your country's missile defense facilities. They were in yesterday's New York Times! WE'LL BE KILLING EVERY HUMAN IN TWO DAYS / WE'LL BE KILLING EVERY HUMAN IN TWO DAYS / WE WILL COOK THEM / WE WILL EAT THEM / 'CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY TO TREAT THEM... Oh Ma-arge! Want some com-pany? As always, silence means yes. How about a little neck rub, baby? Now, how 'bout the neck of my butt... Oh Marge, your tentacles feel so good. Wait a minute... why am I getting words in edgewise? We can't have a space creature living in our house. Go ahead, say it! It's because I'm Jewish. But some of my best friends are... fine, you can stay. Look! They're coming for-- What's your name? Kodos the Destroyer! Don't worry, son -- I've got a plan to save your space doggy. Who is it? Ma'am, we have reason to believe that you're harboring an alien. Open this door at once! Oh, I'm not decent. Let me throw something on! Can I help you, gentlemen? We know it's you, Mr. Simpson. Now where's the alien? Wow, you guys are good. The alien's right here in the living room. Ha, you missed them! Bart and our alien friend are hundreds of miles away by now. What do you weigh? Like a million pounds? More of me to love! After them! We can fly over them with the power of love, right? We could... or... You killed them. Well done, Columbo. That's right, we watch Columbo. It's on during rainouts of Gleep-Glop games. I'm just gonna take off now. I'm sure you have a lot of calls to make... Foolish biped -- it's not a phone! It's a space portal. Our shock troops will teleport in and eat everyone's heads... all thanks to you! What'd I miss? Hop in, Bart, they're gonna let us kill one! Bart... friend? Homer -- bored! I can't believe that an alien who looked so evil turned out to be bad. I guess you should judge a book by its cover. Definitely -- especially if you count the inside flap as part of the cover. It usually gives you a great idea of what the book's about. Quiet -- we're missing the dissection! Actually, I'm still alive, so technically it's vivisection. No one likes a know-it-all. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh... Trick or treat! Beat it, weirdoes! I don't do Halloween! You're supposed to give us candy. I got yer candy right here. She empty-bagged us! What do we do now? Hear me out. It seems to me we gave her a choice: trick or treat. She didn't give us a treat, so... Bart, where are you heading with this? ""Trick or Treat"" isn't just some phrase you chant mindlessly like ""The Lord's Prayer."" It's an oral contract! You're right -- we've forgotten the old ways. The ways of rotten eggs, and soaped-up windows. I say we trick her! Trick her good! Peer pressure! May I remind you that I'm your principal's mother?! I hope the next people don't give us anything so we can trick them too! Why give 'em the choice? That trick was sweeter than any treat we'll get tonight. I'm concerned we might be heading down a slippery slope. What do you think, Nelson? Can't talk. Lighting poo. Excuse me, but this is not good! Oh, lighten up. It's Halloween -- a night for mischief and merriment. Trick-or-treat! Lick my feet! Your head smells like pig-butt meat! Those monsters must be stopped! Perhaps I can be of some assistance. I've got something that will scare the H-E-double sippy straws out of them. Hold still! I'm trying to eat my way out from the inside! How is this a prank? Give me back my TV! I fed your fish. You over-fed them! You're the worst one of all! Whoa! They turned the church into a haunted house! Scaredy cats not wanted? Then I am wanted! Welcome to Heck House! You're about to discover what a life of sin will get you! Sin gets us something? Awesome! I was just in it for the sin. Just get in there! Welcome to eternal darnation! May I have a clean American newspaper, please, no ""Doonesbury?"" Wouldn't you rather have a bikini magazine? I guess a little peek won't hurt me. Nooo! He died as he lived -- like a dork. No, the lesson here is he's being punished for thinking women are beautiful. Please, Lord, grant me the power to psychologically torture them into loving you. Behold, the las-diddily-ast room of Ned Flanders's hell house! I warned ya. And yet my punishment is no less severe. That's odd. Springfield is rife with the seven deadly sins! Starting with... GLUTTONY! More bread please. Anger! Why won't you work, you stupid piece of junk! I said, why won't you work?! Pride! Oh, why did I take pride in my child's accomplishments? Sloth! Hm, I thought I was killed by that magic spaghetti! And the rest! Lust! Greed! And envy! Oh, how I envy the crotchless. And this is where sinners spend all of eternity! I keep telling you, I'm Hindu! This is what you get for stealing jokes? I regret nothing. Stop lickin' my Junk. It's my junk too! We'll never do any of those sins, I promise! All we'll do from now on is pray and fight in wars. Well then, my work is done. That concludes our Halloween show for this year. I just want to say that for watching this network, you're all going to Hell. And that includes FX, Fox Sports and our newest Devil's portal, The Wall Street Journal!
