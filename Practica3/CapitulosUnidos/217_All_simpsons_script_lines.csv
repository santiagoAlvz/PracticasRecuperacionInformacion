213,217,"And then the handsome prince realized he had to go to the bathroom really bad. But the evil ogre, Barney, had left the men's room in the most wicked condition. So the prince went out back to the enchanted alley... That's not a fairy tale. It's just something that happened to you at Moe's. Sh-sh-sh. Anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years, until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon... And, thank you, God, for the bad things adults do, which distract attention from stuff I'm doing. Amen. He's also thankful for your bounty, Lord. Good save, Mom. 'Night. Sweet dreams, honey. Uh, Mom? Will you help me with my project? I need to make a working model of the digestive system. Of course, honey. Thanks! It's due tomorrow. Tomorrow?! Well, that's too bad, mister. I'm not gonna bail you out this time. You're right, Mom. I understand. All right, I'll get you the materials. But you're building it. Okay. Oh, I'll make the whole thing. Okay, papier-mâché mix... pipe cleaners... pig intestines... and sparkle paint. You're a lifesaver, Apu. All the other stores are closed. At eleven-thirty?! But this is the peak hour for stoned teenagers buying shiny things. Whoooa, it's a living mirror. Cool hat. Well, I'm glad you're always here, but isn't it a little rough on your marriage? You know, Manjula understands. I told her that endless toil is the only true path out of this jerkwater burg. Well, when you have a free night, we'd love to have you two over for dinner. Oh please, do not be insane, you hosted our wedding. The least we can do is have you over for dinner. It is payback time. And this time it's personal. Annnd... now. Wow, that looks great, Mom. Some of your best work. Ohhh, it sounds so real! I didn't turn it on yet. I'm never eatin' chili again. Ooh, chili! Nelson, what are you doing?! I'm solving world hunger. Hey, you're wrecking it! What the?... Look out! It's gonna blow! Eeeewwwwww! I hope you're happy, Nelson. Very. But I can't help wondering where I go from here. Stop worrying, Apu. The Kwik-E-Mart is in good hands. I'm not checking up on you, Sanjay. I am simply asking you how many pennies you have left. Seven?! I'll be right there. No, he won't. Apu's entertaining tonight. If you need pennies, take them from Jerry's Jar. This is why I married you. Oof, what an outfit. You are one Mahat-mama. You think so? Why I could not let you in the store like that -- because you are smoking. Oh, Apu. Maybe we should not answer it, huh? Door's unlocked. Oh! Marge, Homer, welcome! Yes, welcome. What a lovely home! Oh, you are too kind, Marge. I am sure you have noticed the many small imperfections that fill me with shame. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! If anything, your home makes me ashamed of my home! Well, let us just say we both feel bad. Deal! Who is your favorite Indian pop singer? Oh, don't make me choose. Oh, sorry. YOU MAKE ME FEEL SO YOUNG / YOU MAKE ME FEEL SO SPRING HAS SPRUNG... Good rice, good curry. Good Gandhi, let's hurry. Mmm, oh, this is delicious. What's in it? Chick peas, lentils and rice. And what's in this? Chick peas and lentils. Try it with rice. Oh, I'm so glad we were able to get together. Well, you know how hard it is to pry these two away from work. Oh, yeah, Homer's a real go-getter. Yeah, I'm going right to the top. Hmm, what's an ""eltdown?"" Eh. I don't understand, Marge. Doesn't Homer work a standard eighteen-hour day? Eighteen hours? Nobody works that hard. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. But he does work every day, right? Well, pretty much. Except weekends. Wee... kends? Uh, say, who's up for a game of Ganesh-Gnop? You told me it was an American tradition to work all the time and never see your wife. Yes, perhaps I stretched the truth a bit, but the Kwik-E-Mart, she is a harsh mistress. I think you just don't want to see me! Ah-- Maybe we should just close the door. Kaminé, méri sumuj mé nahi ata ki tumné mujhsé jhooth kyokaha. Manjula, toe isliyé ki mé tumharé liyé acchee cheezé khareed saku. Maybe we should leave. Uh-uh, no way. I don't want to miss a word. You don't know what they're saying. I'm picking it up. ""Sala"" seems to mean jerk. And I think ""Manjula"" means some kind of spaceship. Uh, this could take a while, folks. Thank you, come again. Oh, I hope we didn't get Apu in too much trouble. Oh, they're newlyweds. They'll just talk things out and top it off with some lovin'. Oh dear. Either put that book down or let me drive. Hey, they stole our idea! See, look! Ooo. ""I Cherish You, My Precious."" Mm, nah. ""To a heckuva blacksmith."" Nah, I already got him one. ""You're A-peeling. Let's Never Split."" That's funny 'cause they're monkeys. So long, rejects. Stupid cards. Mornin', Apu. Still in hot water with the squaw? Worse than ever I am afraid. My shameful neglect has made her feel unloved. Now, I fear she will leave me. Oh, she's not gonna leave you right before Valentine's Day. That'd be like going to an air show and leaving before the plane crash. Ooh, ooh, you are right, there's still seven days before Valentine's. Ah, seven chances to prove my love for sweet Manjula. Sweet mint julep... I'll be at Moe's. C'mon, boy. C'mon! Dad, the vet says we shouldn't make him fetch the Sunday paper. Goood dog! Good doggie! ""Tax Hike Approved""? Bad dog. Bad, bad dog. Now to trim away the fat. ""Outlook."" ""Vista."" No. ""Spotlight."" ""Mosaic."" Nah. I'd love to look at SculleryWeek -- if you're through with it. Oh, sorry, Marge, that's in my stockpile. You can have this. This is about investment opportunities in Yemen. Gimme that! All right, the Personals! Hmm. Hm-hm-hm. ""Successful mayor-type seeks open-minded, discreet cheerleader-type."" Oh, that's sweet. Oh, here's one, ""Desperately Seeking Suction--"" Hey, look at this one. It's a poem. From Apu! Well, don't just gasp, read it. My darling bride Manjula / I hereby mend my ways / I'll shower you with Valentines / For seven love-filled days! Oh, how romantic! I used to take out ads like that when we were newlyweds. The only ad you took out was to sell our lawnmower. We sold it, didn't we? Until last night, I never knew Apu could be so romantic. I can't believe it. He covered your whole bed with wildflowers? Oh, I'm sure Homer has done that for you. Hmmm... sometimes I find pickle slices in the sheets. And he says I've got six more surprises coming. I feel like the luckiest woman in Springfield. HE LOVES THE NIGHT LIFE / HE LOVES MANJULA / THE MAN THEY CALL APUUU / OH YEAH... He has trained a bird to sing to me. Limo out front. Tickets to opera. Front row loge. Oh... Just once, I'd like a parrot to say that to me. Then the bird sang ""I Love The Night Life""... with clever new lyrics. Yeah, I hate that song. I do too. But it was sweet. Women really like that sort of thing, Homie. Don't worry, honey. I got something really special planned for Valentine's Day. It's not that monkey card I found in the car, is it? Wouldn't you like to know? A chocolate husband! Oh, how darling. Help! I can't breathe! Oh! Apu! Oh, you are the sweetest filling of all. Air... need... air. Oh, Apu. Oh God, my ears are filled with nougat. Oh dear. Oh you are-- There's a nut in my eye! ...So then the second salesman says, ""That's okay, I just ate all the hot buttered corn!"" You like that one, baby? Sarah, what's wrong? Usually after two or three Truly Tasteless Jokes, you're all over me. Manjula got to see ""La Boheme."" Sarah, please. Sarah, it's ten dollars a pill. ...And so, with Valentine's Day one day away, all eyes are on the local Romeo whose seven-day gift-a-thon has been delighting his wife and in-troubul-ating the rest of us. Reverend Timothy Lovejoy says he's counseled a number of disenchanted wives, including Maude Flanders. Everybody's marriage is falling apart except ours. See the problem's communication. Too much communication. Homer, I've gone through seven years of receipts, and you've spent less on gifts for me than you have on temporary tattoos. But Marge, it's worth it. Look, the Taco Bell dog. Yo quiero Ta... Hey, where'd it go? Here boy! You just don't get it. This Valentine's crap has gone too far. Yeah. / Yeah. You got that right! Edna won't even let me clap her erasers. My Barbara will no longer pleasure me with the French arts. The gal I'm stalking had me bumped back to two hundred feet. / That's too bad. Oh, Moe. And ask yourselves, people, who's to blame for all this? Well, I guess we are. I suppose I do take Maude for granted. I got some of that myself. / Oh, screw myself. Will you stop it?! It's easy to blame ourselves, but it's even easier to blame Apu. He's makin' us look bad! / Yeah! / Yeah, you're right! / Hey! / Yeah! Hey. What's goin' on out there? Aw, geez, he's got everything but the Shriners. Hey, watch it! You're all over the road! We've gotta stop that traitor Apu. Right after Happy Hour! Drinking will help us plan. C'mon, Apu. Make your move. Maybe he's run out of romantic ideas. Nah, no, not our lover boy. If I know his MO, he saved the biggest one for today. Aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. How can we sabotage his labor of love? I'unno. Gasoline? Axes? I got some stuff in the trunk. Hey, there he goes! Let's roll. Uh, Homer, you're drivin'. Not yet, I'm not. You'll know when I'm driving. And it'll... Tiffany's, eh? Looks like Smoochy's gonna seal the deal with a diamond the size of a doll's head. Ah man, he's makin' us look like a bunch of cheapskates. Whoa whoa. My rope came loose. There he is. Behind that shopping bag... A croissant? What the...? Oh, that's right. They have breakfast at Tiffany's now. Only till eleven. So that's it. The crazy nut. He went and bought her a sloop. Well, this is one Love Boat that won't delight and amuse... Wait, Chief! He's not purchasing a boat... Arr, it's kind of ya to deliver these copies of ""Juggs."" They'll keep my men from resorting to homosexuality... for about ten minutes. Look who's talkin'. Harr. Well, this is turning out to be a total waste of time. Not entirely. Aw geez, we been following him for hours. You know, with all the energy we're puttin' into this sabotage thing, we coulda written sonnets for our wives, or learned to tango, or lovingly restored one of those antique... Whew, well, at least I got a hunk of Moe's hair. Man, that smarts! Oh, baby. We got him now. There's no escape from the airport. Oh nuts! We lost him. I told you we shouldn't have gone for long-term parking. Hey, look! It's Elton John! We had to make an emergency landing. It's that damn chandelier again. What's he doing in Springfield? I got it. I got it. Apu musta hired him to sing for Manjula. Not if I can help it. And help it I might. Mr. John. I'm your biggest fan. I've tape recorded all your songs off the radio. Oh, that's very sweet. Have a Grammy. Uhhhh. Sir Elton, my noble friends and I would like to dub you a Knight of the... Grand Concourse. Yeah, it's for all your charity work and, uh, for, ah, you know, teaching us um... to love again. Really? I did that? How the hell should I know? Just get in this cage. Oh, hazing the new guy, eh? Hmp. You know, when I was dubbed Sir Elton, the Queen paddled me silly. Hey, Apu's talkin' to a skywriter! So that was his plan all along. If he writes a message of love over Springfield, we're all screwed. Hello? Lads? Don't forget your old pal, Elton. Can anyone hear me? Skycap? Okay, here is the message, and please don't skimp on the... Sarin?! Don't be frightened. That tank's just Peace Corps surplus. Not so fast, Apu! Homer! What a delightful coincidence. We're putting an end to your insane Valentine's rampage. Never again will good, lazy men have to... What the--? Oh no you don't! Hey, you with the scarf! Stop skywriting! I have to deliver a message! It's the skywriter's code. I am so sick of that damn code! If you won't stop, then I'll stop you! What are you doing? Don't do that! Oh, isn't that sweet. That must be for Manjula. Just once I'd like a love note in the sky. Lousy message. Stop, you crazy fool, you'll kill us all! Correction. Kill us both. ""I Love You..."" It's an angel! Ooh, that's Neddy's pet name for me! ""I Love You... Poppin' Fresh."" Oh, Clancy. ""I Love You... Edna K!"" It's a little run-together, but that's what it says! ""I Love You... Cactus? Blobby? Upsilon?"" Oh, who am I kidding? Homer would never surprise me like that. Daggonit! You ruined my message. What's the matter with you crazy old... / Get off me! / You're making me mad! Oh me. My humble love note is turning into a Valentine's Day massacre. You think you've got problems. I just chewed my way out of a dog carrier. Whew. Elton John! That's my name. Well, not really. I hate to sound like a screaming fan, but . That maniac nearly killed us! Shall I ""take you to the pilot?"" Huh? You see? Because that is your song. I heard you. Yes, because ""someone saved your life tonight!"" Cut it out! Well, well, ""the bitch is back."" Oh, galldurnit! Why won't you die?! Ow! Prickers! Owwww! Homer? What in the world? Roses. So many roses. Just when I think I have you figured out, you fall from the sky with roses. Roses. Oh, Homie. Oh, they're beautiful. Oh, I'm gonna snuggle your brains out. Well, I think I have a collapsed lung, but okay! ""If I was a sculptor, ha, but then again, nooo / Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show / I know it's not much but it's the best I can do / My gift is my song and, this one's from Apu."" Oh, oh, I can't believe it. You closed the Kwik-E-Mart just for me. Well, you and the health inspector. Champagne Squishee? Oh, thank you. It should get you pretty darned hammered.","Gulliver Dark, Chief Wiggum, Old Jewish Man, Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Crewman, Kent Brockman, Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon, Homer Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, Sideshow Mel, MACAW, Lenny Leonard, Moe Szyslak, Ned Flanders, Kids, Maude Flanders, Barney Gumble, Captain Horatio McCallister, Fantastic Dan, Elton John, Sarah Wiggum, Otto Mann, Jimbo Jones, Bart Simpson, Edna Krabappel-Flanders, Bernice Hibbert, Men",7.3,815.0,14,1999-02-14,1999,10,I'm with Cupid,7.7,46822.0
