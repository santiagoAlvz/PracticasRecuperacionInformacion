255,259,"Mmm, good pancakes, Mom. Thank you, honey. They come in a squeeze bottle now. I'd better put on the silencer. You know what'd be good with these, is some Ms. Butterworth. Let's have a breakfast meeting. Eww, how long has this baking soda been in here? I don't know. It came with the house. Hey Dad, bet you five bucks you can't eat the whole box. Five? Why don't we make it fifty? You're gonna regret this. I'll call poison control. Fran, it's me. Just a heads-up. Wow, the absorbed odors of a million meals... So many flavors! All those tasty memories flooding back! If it doesn't fit, you must acquit... Therefore, I shall resign the presidency... That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind... Uh-oh. Dad's having an antacid trip. And I won fifty bucks! Can I see the fifty, Bart? Can I? Huh? Milhouse, my friend, you and I are going on a spending spree. My doctor says I'm not supposed to go on sprees. What about jags? Jags are fine. Wonderful. A fifty dollar bill! Gentlemen, let us shop. Our wide variety of gum comes in both stick and ball. I'm not really about gum. But I like the whole chewing thing... Are you averse to crispy centers, sir? Not at all. Then we have much to discuss. Too much raw bacon. C'mon Bart, we can't stop spending now. There's one thing I've always wanted to do. My mom doesn't believe in fabric softener. But she's not around! I'm picking the next thing. Looks like we're down to our last ten bucks Hello. Radioactive Man #1000, please. Ten dollars? I laugh at you. Please to note: This is no ordinary comic book. It is in perma-mint condition. If you spill soda on it, the drops fly off harmlessly onto lesser comics. Whooaa. Yes, you are quite correct to gasp. Also, note the price: twenty-five dollars. We had to buy lunch for that homeless guy. While my son's at fat camp, I cleaned out his room. How much will you give me for this? Probably nothing. But let us see... Oh, handwritten script for ""Star Wars"" by George Lucas... Princess Leia's anti-jiggle breast tape... Film reel labeled ""Alternate Ending: Luke's Father is Chewbacca"". I'll give you five dollars for the box. Sold. Don't do it, lady. That stuff's worth thousands. Yeah, he's rippin' you off. Well, if this is valuable, then back to the leaky basement it goes! Smile, please. Thank you. Son, I know it hurts. I still remember my first lifetime banning... Hey, where's my melon? And you are banned for life from all of my performances and TV specials. I can still see your movies, right? ...And I never saw Gallagher again. Ooh, it says here that special effects whiz Tom Savini is gonna be appearing at the comic book store tonight! Tom Savini? Yes, it says here he's the movie magician behind ""Creepshow,"" ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Dawn of the Dead."" I can't believe I'm gonna miss that! Don't worry your spiky little head. I've got it all planned out. How could you have it planned out? You just heard about the problem. You're right. Gimme a minute. Hmmm. Mister Simpson, it hurts! Yeah. And why did we have to do this all the way from home? For once in my life I'm tall. Don't take that away from me. Hell-o, I'm Shaquille O'Neal. Let us in, please. You two are not welcome. Sorry, son. Thanks for the tip-off. No problem. Appearing exclusively here at the Android's Dungeon -- take that, Messrs. Barnes and Noble -- the King of Splatter, Tom Savini. Good evening. Sorry... I-I had a really big dinner... Woo! Dinner! But, I'm sure one more French fry wouldn't hurt. Oh, we missed the gutbuster! Yeah. That should be us covered with blood! Sure, computer technology is here to stay. But there'll always be a place for the practical special effects wizard. I love the theater. Oh, please. I saw Paul Lynde do that same hackneyed trick on Bewitched. Try to explode this out of my belly. That's not a cookie. That's a time-release blood pack. You, sir, are a perfect patsy. Let me shake your hand. Uhh, to the gag I will give a D-plus. As for the workmanship on the hand... Ooh, ooh, oooh! That's not right! You mocking me?! Oh, that is rich! Stop your laughing! You're all banned! Banned, I tell you! Breath... short! Left arm... numb! Can't go on... describing symptoms much longer! I think he's had a heart attack. Young man, you've had what we call a cardiac episode. Worst... episode... ever. Ohh, not even close. If these boys hadn't called 911 , I'd be wearing that watch right now. Just kidding. But you would be dead. You saved my life? Yeah. After you were so mean to us. So, now we're even. My prognosis -- or is it ""diagnosis""? Whichever, you need to avoid stress. What kind of work do you do? I run a comic book store. Oh, dear Lord! We call that profession ""The Widowmaker!"" Or we would, if any of the proprietors were married. You should close down the store for a while. But I'd lose all my business to Frodo's of Shelbyville. Well then get a friend to run it for you. You do have friends, don't you? Well, Superfriends... You should get some friends who aren't printed on paper. You mean action figures? We'll run the store for ya. Two ten-year-olds running my store... What is this? Bizarro World?! Calm down. Don't make me put a dog heart in there. Can you believe it, Bart? We're actually running a comic book store. Looks like our lifetime ban just expired. Sorry, sorry. Okay, here's Comic Book Guy's instructions: ""A carton of malted milk balls, one box confectioner's sugar, a can of chocolate frosting..."" That's just his shopping list. No, it's his instructions. Well, we're gonna make some changes around here. This store's gonna be run by kids and for kids. You said it, partner! Ah, nice to see ya'... Hey, how 'bout that Bloodzilla? Vampire Dinosaur, ohh, you can't make that stuff up... ""The Death of Sad Sack."" This better not be another fake-out. Uh-uh, you gotta be forty inches tall for the adult section. Pleeeease? Okay, but get on your tippy-toes. Everybody's hugging! Hey Bart, I finished organizing the stock room. Mark down the Poochie crap. And then unstick all the Supergirls. You know, if we're partners, maybe you should do some of the work. Less barking, more marking. Yes sir, partner. Now, when you've got a bum ticker like we do, you need all the friends you can get. And Moe's is the friendliest place in the Rum District. Get out and take your Sacajawea dollars with you. I'll give ya till ""three."" One... Hey Homer, who's the manatee? Aw, now, be nice, Moe. This guy just got out of the hospital. Ooh, sorry. Ah, lemme buy ya a drink. Very well. I will have a shot of cranberry schnapps. Ah, these, aah, they're just painted on, there. Your choices are beer and, ah... egg soakin's. I'll pass. Beer is the nectar of the nitwit. Hey, you knockin' beer? Nobody badmouths Duff! Uh, piece o' crap. C'mon, you're here to make friends. Oh, please. If I wanted to hear mindless droning, I'd befriend an air conditioner. Oh, now he's raggin' on air conditioners. Hey, they keep us cool in the summer, pal! Get him! And stay out! Is there a word in Klingon for ""Loneliness""? Oh, yes. Milhouse, I'm impressed. The store is so busy. You and Bart are really great businessmen. Well I'm really the brains. Bart's just the eye candy. Hi, Eric Reynolds, Plan Nine Comics. Is, uh, the manager here? Well, I'm kinda the co-manager... Tough break, toots. I need a man who answers to no one. A full manager. Hatchi-matchi. I can help you, sir. And I answer to no one. Well, then you'll want to stock up on our new superhero. Would you say he's the ultimate superhero? Oh, very ultimate, indeed. Point your peepers at Biclops! A superhero with glasses! Oh yeah, thick glasses. Hm, kinda like yours. So, how many ya need? Five hundred? Six hundred? Six hundred sounds good. Aw, that's too bad. There's a price break at a thousand. Oh, man... I'll take two thousand. Human contact - the final frontier. Outta the way, Tubby! Oh, pardon me, Oldie Hawn. Why, you ill-mannered sack-a crap. Oh, goody. Now I know whatever happened to Baby Jane. You are the rudest man who ever... bought me dinner. Correction. I do not believe I have ever bought you... Ohh. So, how many issues of Biclops would you like? Biclops? Who's his girlfriend, Lois Lame? He's kinda afraid of girls. It doesn't even smack good. How could you spend all our money on a comic published by Lens Crafters? We'll never sell these. Birds won't even use them in their nests. Okay, so I made one bad decision. It's my fault for leaving you in charge. Sometimes I forget how young you are. I'm only three months younger than you. Oh, look, you're gettin' cranky. You haven't had your juice. Well, my straw broke off in the carton. That's not the point! We're supposed to be partners, and you're pushing me around like a Playskool Corn Popper. It's a vacuum cleaner, Milhouse. Whatever. I demand respect! I have feelings! I'm a human boy, just like you! Shhhh. Use your indoor voice. Okay, that's it! Aieeeeeee! En garde! Eat watering can, partner! Whoa... Comic Book Guy's secret stash! Look at all these bootleg videos! ""Alien Autopsy"" ""Illegal Alien Autopsy"", ""Godfather III -- Good Version""... He's got the tape of Kent Brockman picking his nose! Look, he's picking his nose! I'll be right down! I'm just putting on my witch hazel. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! So, uh, your mother tells me you go to Springfield Elementary. Exactly what is your interest in my mother? She makes me laugh. Here I co-ome... Good Lord, Mother! I can see your... figure! Oh, you see a lot more when you do my daily mole check. What I do for my allowance money is nobody's business. He's not nobody. He might even be your new daddy... ""Police informant tape?"" These are never supposed to leave the station! I really hate to be a snitch. Don't worry. Your yellow-bellied ratting will be held in the strictest confidence. Well, in that case... My neighbor Homer released a radioactive ape in my house. It's ah, it's taken over the whole top floor. It wasn't dad's fault. The ape tricked him. What's next? Mister Rodgers drunk. Well, whaddaya mean I can't take off my sweater? I'm hot! You know, I'll bet kids would pay to see this stuff. We could have a midnight screening right here in the store. That's actually a great idea, Milhouse. Really? Well, I was due. I'll say... Partner. So many restaurants... I can't decide. I throw myself on the mercy of the food court. Umm... I guess I'll, I'll have the chicken Tandoori. And I'll have the beef Wellington. Oh, look at you two. You look so ""couple-y."" Yes, we're a perfect match. Her sneer just lights up my day. And we're always finishing each other's insults. That does my heart good. Sunsets. Thank God there's only one of these a day. Could it be any more orange? I must warn you that once this next tape starts, it will not stop. Because that button is broken. Let's watch. If you are watching this tape, you are the President of the United States. Hello Sir, or Ma'am... hopefully Sir. Got that right. Yes! The town of Springfield has been classified N.W.B., or ""Nuclear Whipping Boy."" In the first moments of a nuclear war, Springfield will be bombed at will by all friendly nations, to calibrate their missiles. Now, for total security, I will terminate the cameraman. Thanks a lot, Steve. Awright, this is a raid! Well, well, well... This place has got more pirated tapes than, uh... A Chinese K-Mart? Well, that'll have to do. Uh, these yours, son? No, sir. We're just exhibiting them for profit without permission. Fair enough. But the owner is in more hot water than... A Japanese tea bag? Why don't you lay off the Asians, Lou. Well, you've changed me, Agnes. Maybe there is room in my store for romance comics. Nobody'll buy those. Your store smells. Now kiss me, Funny Face. All ri-- Oh, oh, dear God. Cover your eyes, boys. That's okay, man. If it doesn't affect you, you're not human. Comic Book Guy, you're under arrest for the possession of illegal videos. But we'll reduce the sentence if you put your pants on. Fast. Come on, Romeo. They can't lock me up for long, Agnes. Will you wait for me? Are you crazy? My bones are half dust. Well, we may not have the store, but at least we're friends again. Yep. And we haven't been to school in days and days and days. Oh, well. Looks like everything's back to normal. Look, if you want me to turn, just point. That w... Ow! It's one-way! Ow! Now what was that for? Ow!
