242,246,"""The Cyborganizer."" A high-tech robocop created for one purpose only... to help the NYPD tackle its tedious paperwork. Good work, Cyborganizer. I can streamline any procedure, except this thing you call ""love."" Poor Cyborganizer Homer, sitting that close to the TV can't be good for you. Talking while the TV's on can't be good for you. You should get your eyes checked. I'm taking Bart to the mall to buy camping supplies -- why don't you come along? Nah. I want to enjoy this show before the network retools it. How can I organize this modeling agency and still be a good single father? I love you, Daddy. Too late. We need something quick. My husband's eyes are really shot. Whee! Touch the sky, Maggie! Whee! Touch the sky! Dad, I've got Maggie. Who said that? Come on, Bart. While your dad gets his glasses, we'll go shop for your trip. I hate shopping. Just get me a deck of cards, and I'll win whatever I need from the other kids. But you need to try things on! Every brand has a different idea of ""Husky."" I'm in tantrum position. T-minus five... four... three... remembering dead cat for real tears, and... Fine, you win. I'll do your shopping for you. Tantrum averted. But now I can't forget the cat. Okay, let's get started. Hey, wake up. Sorry. Now, read the first line. I... 8... P.P. Why you little... Better or worse? Worse. Better or worse? Much better. Dad! That pair is popular with celebrities like Val Kilmer... Oo, my favorite Door. And Yoko Ono... Ew. She ruined the Plastic Ono Band. Maybe you're a candidate for laser eye surgery. Would it get me out of having to choose glasses? Well yes, but I must warn you, it's an experimental procedure and we still don't know the long-term effects... Less yappin', more zappin'. Well, looks like we got everything for Bart's camping trip: Blair Witch Repellent, antler saw and Deep Woods Scrabble. Ooh, ""Tango de la Muerte."" I've been dying to see that movie! It got rave reviews from both the Entertainment Radio Network and the Radio Entertainment Network. Let's go! Wait! You've gotta use these drops. They prevent your eyes from crusting over. Oh, here we go with the add ons. No thanks. Now that my severed foot has been reattached, I must win back the coveted dance title: Loco Legs! As your wise but alcoholic dance coach, I know that somewhere, your father is looking down on you and smiling. Oh, there he is. And now, I must choose a beautiful partner for the big dance contest. No. Oh, he'll never dance with her. She'll have to settle for some Mexican Milhouse. I demand to know your name. My name is... Lisabella. That's my name with bella on the end of it. Ask her, oh God, please ask her to dance. I shall dance with her. Que malo! Once again, I must sugar my own churro. But I am just a simple librarian. I have only read about dancing in books. I will show you something that is in no book. She's not plain, she's beautiful! There is just one dance that will beat them: the Tango de la Muerte. Only one man was crazy enough to dance that dance, and he is dead! My twin brother, Freduardo. But where he died, I shall live. In his apartment. You are now carrying my child. But how? It is the mystery of the dance. Oh, Mom. I want to be a dancer! That's wonderful, honey. We should ask your father, though. Where is he, anyway? Now Homie, when we get to the liquor store, buy me some Jack Daniels and a carton of smokes. Yes, dear. I remember Little Vicki Valentine! Her perky smile and dancing brought America right out of the depression. Well, I think World War II helped a little, Mom. Don't smart mouth, Lisa. A great big sunshine hello to you! Hi, Little Vicki. Oh, that was such a long time ago. I'm just plain Vicki now. All right. I'd like to sign my daughter up for lessons, Vicki. Little Vicki. But you just said that... So, what dance style were you interested in? We have ever so many. There's ballroom... Ow! You stepped on my toes again! If you would just let me lead... You're not a leader, Seymour. Never have been. Never will be. There's square dancing... Put the birdie in the cage, odd lady in the center / Now the birdie is purdy / and the crows hop in / Pluck the feather all together / Hell bent for leather / Put your honey in the saddle...! Or, there's the dance that made me famous: tap. But I want to learn a dance I can use in real life, like the Tango de la Muerte. Aw, bless your heart. Let's get you some tap shoes. Ah, Little Vicki, I really think she had her heart set on... Little advice: don't live through your child. Okay. Camp is gonna be great! Seven days without parents, homework or ear medicine. Yes sir, this is gonna be the best week of our young lives. I'm gonna pound you two all week. What'd we do? Nothin'. But I gotta pound somebody. Haw haw. Now where do we go? I don't wanna go home. My grandma's sleeping in my bed, and she has skin like a basketball. Wait a minute. Everybody thinks we're at camp this week. We can stay wherever we want. Yeah, like the Four Seasons. Each room has its own safe! I've got a better place. The mall? Yeah. It's just like my dad always says... For an evening or a week, there's no place like the mall. Food, fun and fashion -- the mall has it all! What? What did he say? Now, the key to great dancing is one word: Tap-a-tap-a-tap-a. Tap-a-tap-a-tap-a... Teacher, my shoes are making noise. You must be Ralph. My daddy shoots people! Good... Good... Wait a minute, somebody's off the beat. Let me hear you two. Okay. Now you. Children, stop it! For all you know, she has a medical condition. Nope. I see. This is way better than camp. No mosquitoes, no stupid camp songs... IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT, SHOP AT STAN'S. GIANT DISCOUNTS ON YOUR FAVORITE MAJOR BRANDS... Attention shoppers, the mall is now closed. Okay, folks. You heard the recording. Clear out. Quick. Up here. Where are we going? Quiet. Just keep scurrying. Worms! Gold! Wait, this is just chocolate. Chocolate! And these are Gummy Worms! Gummy! War Heads? Jelly Bellies? We're like two kids in a candy store! Yes! Flavor's gone. Flavor's gone. Shoe fight! Ow! No golf shoes! Ready, Milhouse? Gimme a sec... Whoa! We're lumberjacks! Oh, my God! Look at this place. How could this happen? Candy chewed, wigs pulled from stands, cheese packages poked and repoked... Every sign points to one obvious culprit... A giant rat. You'll have to shut down the mall. On Presidents' Day weekend? Are you crazy? Crazy with concern for the public, yes. Now shut this place down before the old folks come in for their morning walk. Open! Tap-a-tap-a-tap-a. Tap-a-tap-a-tap-a... Ow! Sorry. The floor's kind of at an angle here. I'm gonna move over there. Okay, from tap-a-tap-a-tap-a. Lisa's bad dancing makes my feet sad. Let's take five. What am I doing wrong, Little Vicki? Well, you're falling a lot... Maybe you should work on that. Yeah, well, no offense, but maybe I need a little more instruction than just tap-a-tap-a-tap-a. Why, back when I was your age, I had 43 movies under my belt and I had to do it without tap-a-tap-a-tap-a. I would have killed for tap-a-tap-a-tap-a. Sorry. I'm just frustrated. Well, you'll never save grandpa's farm with that attitude. You've just got to turn that frown upside down. That's a smile, not an upside-down-frown! Work on that, too. Hey, we got a postcard from Bart. ""Dear Mom and Homer. I'm having fun."" Aw, sounds like he's having fun. Why does it have a picture of Vitamin Barn? Didn't you ever go to camp? The ol' Vitamin Barn... There's our Broadway Baby! Hey, dig that crazy rhythm. I'm just walking. Listen, I know I said I wanted to be a dancer, but... And you will be a dancer. Look at you, all sugar and spice instead of equations and test tubes. You're Daddy's precious dancing queen! And you look adorable. Now honey, what were you trying to say before we kept interrupting you with our loving proudness? Yes, our tiny tapper. What was it you were going to say after ""I wanted to be a dancer, but..."" But I just... need more practice. See ya! Oh! What's that awful sound? The furnace? It's me! Awww... Why is you so down, Little Miss Vicki? My kitty cat's sick and I'd be ever so sad if she should die. Ooh, well, I'm no animal doctah or nothin', but whenever I'm feelin' poorly, you know what fixes me up? Dancin'! Dancin'? Dancin'! But I don't know how to dance. Oh, I'll show ya how. There. Now you're gettin' it! Look at me, Powder Puff. I'm dancin'! The cat dances better than I do. We'll catch that mall rat. Sure hope this ACME kit works. Gosh, that cheese looks good. Think I could grab it before that anvil hits? Uh, I dunno, Chief. It's a million to one. I like those odds. My mistake was grabbing the cheese. Professor Frink, will that spaceship be ready for the recital? I have visited the future, and yes it will. Okay, kids, tonight's the big night. Now remember, the important thing is to just dance flawlessly. Excuse me... Why isn't my name in the program? It is, silly. You've got the most important part of all. Curtain puller?! No one can see the show if the curtain isn't open! But my parents are counting on seeing me dance! And I've worked ever so hard. I'm sorry, Lisa. But giving everyone an equal part when they're clearly not equal, is called what again, class? Communism. That's right. And I didn't tap all those Morse code messages to the allies 'til my shoes filled with blood just to roll out the welcome mat for the Reds. All right, I'll be the stupid curtain puller. Smoothly. Pull-a-pull-a-pull-a... I get your pull-a-pull-a-pull-a... Excuse me, Lisa, but I couldn't help but overhear your nerdly predicament. Maybe I can be of assistance with the dancing and the twisting and the kung fu fiiigh-ting. I first observed this technology at the airport gift shop. As you see, it responds to any percussive sound with an exuberant shaking of its groove thing. Yeah, yeah. Most entertaining, but how does that help me? Observe. Ohhhhhh. That's brilliant, Professor! What will you think of next? Well, I also found this at the gift shop. Isn't it cute? I'm hoping to turn it into a weapon. Kill ya. I've gotta go now. Okay, Mister Rat... We've got a little playmate for you. Should I get the backup lion, Chief? Would you? Can you see the lion anywhere? Well, do you see him or not? Are you saying he's right on the other side of that plant? Okay. Run!!! This way! Bart, you're a genius! You okay, Milhouse? Nothing that a handful of gummy bears can't fix. Well, well, looks like the cat got the rat. And that's the end of that ""tail."" Uh, Chief? Should we try and get the mountain lion back in its crate? I repeat... Okay, everyone. We need big smiles out there, so line up for dimpling. Now this may hurt a lot. What am I saying, ""may""? Ow! Now, that's a happy face. Little Vicki, I figured out how to dance. I can be in the show now! I'm sorry, Lisa. People go to a children's dance recital expecting a certain level of professionalism. But, but you don't understand... I ate too much plastic candy. Heavens to Betsy, the star of the show is sick! Whatever will we do? There's only one person who can get us out of this pickle. Lisa? Yes?! Help me into Ralph's costume. Showtime, children! Let's go. Okay, curtain puller, this is your moment to shine. Oh, it's too important. I'll do it for you. Lean, muscular children of Mars, we bring you candy. Let's walk over to them. Why walk, when you can dance? Where's Lisa? Shh! This plot is hard enough to follow as it is. ON THE SPACESHIP LOLLIPOP / GINGERBREAD MEN LIKE TO DO HIP HOP. AND CHOCOLATE CHIPS / MAKE A ROCKIN' FUEL FOR ROCKET SHIPS / WE JUST LOVE TO DANCE ON MARS / WHERE EVERYTHING'S MADE FROM CANDY BARS. There she is! Hi, honey! Wow, look at her go. Yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off! What are you doing? I can't help it! It's the shoes! Nobody upstages Little Vicki! Oh, please stop! I'm just getting started! Stop clapping! Go, Lisa! C'mon, everybody, give it up for my little girl! Stop with the clapping! You'll kill us all! Lisa's gone berserk! Do something, Homer! Do something! Oh, thanks, Dad. I didn't think, I just acted. Self-tapping shoes?! I'm ever so pissed! I'm sorry, Vicki. I just wanted to be a dancer so badly. I understand. We all do crazy things when we're desperate. I once destroyed Buddy Ebsen's credit rating. Why? He knows why. Jesus, Mary and glayvin! These shoes are in the ""Off"" position. You mean I danced all by myself? See, honey? All you needed was to believe in... What are you talking about, Professor Frink? They're clearly in the ""On"" position. See? ""On."" I was merely trying to spare the girl's feelings, you insensitive clod. Oh. Ohhhhh. Well, now that I look even closer... Forget it, Dad. I guess I'm never gonna be your Broadway Baby. That's not true, honey. You can always write a depressing Broadway play of some kind. You think so? Sure. It could be a story about people coming to terms with things. Hey, yeah. You could load it up with lots of swears. That's what David Mamet does. Oh, I love you guys. Uh-oh. It's out of its matrix. Nobody move. Why? It's just a cute little weasel. Hello there, Mister weasel.
