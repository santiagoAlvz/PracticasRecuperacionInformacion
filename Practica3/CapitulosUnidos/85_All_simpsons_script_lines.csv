84,85,"O-wee-o. We-Oooo. O-wee-o. We-Oooo. Shhh. O-wee-o. We-Oooo. O-wee-o. We-Oooo. Tra-la-la-la-la-la! Tra-la-la-la-la. I am the happiest boy there is! Aren't I Bobo? Happy! Come here, Happy! Yes, Momsie? Happy, would you like to continue living with us, your loving natural parents? Or would you rather live with this twisted loveless billionaire? Let's roll. Wait! You forgot your bear! A symbol of your lost youth and innocence! Oh well. At least we still have his little brother George. Ba-ba-ba-ba. Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home. Ba-ba-ba-ba trust me, it'll be funny when I'm an old man. I want my teddy! Bobo! Bo-Bo! Oh, it's you. The bedpan's under my pillow. Who's Bobo, sir? Bobo? I meant Lobo. Sheriff Lobo. They never should have canceled that show. I see. On another topic, the preparations for your birthday have begun. I won't get what I really want No one does. Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers. Lobo! Lobo! Bring back Sheriff Lobo! Lobo! Lobo! What? Homie! Oh no! Burns' Birthday! What's wrong? Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job. Where is that dreaded pi√±ata? Ow. Ow. Ow. Missed me. Ow! Not funny. And the one in my pants really hurt. That man who's getting all those laughs, Smithers. Who is he? Homer Simpson, sir. One of the carbon blobs from Sector 7G. But I don't think... I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party. I must harness his fractured take on modern life. Fine, sir. I'll get him started on some snappy Sinbad-esq material. Hee hee! I'm so funny! This is gonna be great. What are you doin'? I'm writing a delicious send up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poo poo one word or two? I don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday. Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr. Burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn Dad a special place in the old man's heart. Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. I paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants. Now I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent... Incontinent... Too rich. Does either of you know what incontinent means? Lisa, don't spoil our fun! Come on dear. It's time to go. Okay, stupid! Homer! You've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss. Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. Hey Flanders, you smell like Manure! Uh-oh. Better cancel that dinner party tonight. Thanks for the nose-news, neighbor. Hey, no one-termers. You too, huh? Hey, I know a good yogurt place. Get away from me, loser. Ladies and gentlemen: I give you Montgomery Burns: the life. Bobo! Here are several fine young men, who I'm sure are gonna go far. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Ramones. Ahh, these minstrels will soothe my jangled nerves. I'd just like to say this gig sucks. Hey, up Yours, Springfield. One-two-three-four! Go to hell, you old bastard. Hey, I think they liked us. Have the Rolling Stones killed. Sir, those aren't... Do as I say! This stinks... piffle... dust buster? Eych. Sir, I've arranged for the people of Australia to join hands tonight and spell out your name with candles. There's a satellite hookup on that monitor if you'll just turn your head slightly. Eh, no time. Next! I have some sad news to report. A small puppy, not unlike Lassie was just run over in the parking lot. And now it's time for the comedy stylings of Homer Simpson! Are you ready to laugh? Oh... That poor dog. I said are you ready to laugh?! Quiet, you awful man! You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap... What! I mean... you know... Mr. Burns... is so... old... How dare you! Oooh, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find... a little cheeky. I'm Mr. Burns. Blah, blah, blah. Do this. Do that. Blah, blah, blah. I think I'm so big. Blah, blah, blah. Destroy him. Blah, bla... Unghhhh! This party is over. Oh, where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again. I'd like to believe that this time. I really would. Bart, run down to the store and get a big bag of ice for your father. Yes'm. Dad, I know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can. Don't worry, boy. He'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday. I knew it. Look at all the wonderful things you have, Mr. Burns. King Arthur's Excalibur. The only existing nude photo of Mark Twain, and that rare first draft of the constitution with the word ""suckers"" in it. Yes, yes, yes. So what? You want your bear, Bobo, don't you? Liar! I'll give you the thrashing of a lifetime! Resistance is futile. Oh God, how I only want my bear. But he's gone. Gone forever. I'd give anything to know what happened to him. Put some grease in your garter, Lindy! You're late. This is all your fault! You've got to start selling this for more than a dollar a bag. We lost four more men on this expedition. If you can think of a better way to get ice, I'd like to hear it. Hey, Apu, this bag of ice has a head in it. Oooh! A head bag! Those are chock full of... heady goodness. Hey, it's a Teddy bear! Ew! Gross! It's probably diseased or something. Here, Maggie. Here's something that should cheer you up, sir. It's me sir. Bobo. Hug me. Squeeze me. Tug at my fur. Enough. Stop this grotesque charade. Now find my Teddy. Oh, and uh... leave the costume. The Burns Bear, perhaps the most valuable widdle bear in the world, could be anywhere. It could be in your house. You could be looking at it right now. It could be right in front of your face as I'm saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps being held up by a loved one. Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down. Moldy!?! Old!?!... I'm gonna get something to eat! Well, it's not your original bear, of course. But it Is programmed to be just as cuddly. Oh dog gone it... It's supposed to be doing a little dance. Get this bear off... I'm trying to turn it off. No, bear want to live. How long have we had these fish? Wait! The bear! Burns' bear! ""Bobo"". It's Mr. Burns' bear all right. Well, Burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, I'll tell you that. He's going to have to give me... my own recording studio. Two all-beef patties, special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun... Homer, you're drooling on the mic again. I think we should just give him the bear that he cherishes so much. Hmm, better sew that eye back on. No. Let's send Burns the eye in the mail. He'll pay more money if he thinks the bear is in danger. Yes. We'll send the eye. I'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward. And then we'll make him double it. Well why can't I be greedy once in awhile? Bobo! My beautiful Bobo! I promise I'll never leave you behind again. Ah, yes. Naturally I can't pay you much of a reward because... I'm strapped for cash. As you can see, this old place is falling apart. But I'm sure we can come to an understanding. Yes sir. Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer. May I offer you a drink? Sorry, Burns. No deal. Don't worry, Smithers, he's playing hard ball now. But it won't take him long to crack. I gotta call Burns! I gotta call Burns. Maybe I can still get that drink! Dad, the longer he has to wait, the more he'll pay. Right. That makes sense. No! Lemme go! I knew you'd come crawling back. How much do you want? A million dollars and three Hawaiian Islands. Good ones, not the leper ones. Done. Now, give me that bear. Woo hoo! I'm rich! Rich I tells ya. Here you go. It seems to be stuck. Bad baby! Bad Maggie! Give me the bear! The bear! The bear! Here you go, Maggie. The deal's off, Mr. Burns. The bear stays here. You've made a mistake, Simpson. Ah, big deal. Who needs his money? We're gettin' by okay. Son! You've gotta help me! I hit three people on the way over here, and I don't have any insurance. So, hows 'bout you? Excellent shot, Smithers. I'll be squeezing my Bobo in no time. Howdy gents. What can I diddily do you for? Remember, Smithers. In and out in eighteen seconds. More cocoa, Mr. Burns? Yes. Hmmm. Sixty-four slices of American cheese. Sixty four... sixty three... Have you been up all night eating cheese? I think I'm blind. Good day to you. Excuse me wanted to see the guy who valued the happiness of his children over money. Right here. Aw, you said his head was the size of a baseball. My life can't get any worse. Homer Simpson, report for much worse duties. After lunch can I whip you? Nope. Aw, no fair. Hm... I wonder what makes it turn? Who cares? Maggie, I know you like the bear... but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with... this box! See Maggie? See the fun box! Do do do do doo do... Do do do do doo... No! My box! My box! I think we need a new hairdryer. Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns' money. I don't hate you, I'm proud of you. You came through for your daughter when she needed you the most. Aw thanks, Marge. But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul. Box... Gimme that. TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR / TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR.... / TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR.... I can see why this is so popular. Give me my bear, Simpson. It's the Soulll Mass Transit System. Give it to me. Es yo-yo is grande. Aye Chihuahua. As you can see, Simpson, I've taken over all seventy-eight channels. And you won't see any of your favorite shows again until you give in. Whoa, that bites. Holy crap. What's that you say? You can live without television as long as you have beer? That's right. Wrong. All beer trucks heading towards Springfield have been diverted. This town will be as dry as a bone. And if the rest of you beer swilling tube jockeys out there have a problem with this, talk to Homer Simpson. Homer, give him what he wants. Oh, Barney, leave me alone. Oops! Uh-oh. My old man can't get a beer because his old man won't give a bear to another old man. Let's get him. Wait, why are we gettin' him? Look, fellas. The first snapdragon of the season. Never mind. Let's just get him. Yeah! Smithers, I'm home! What, already? Yes. Is it my imagination or is TV getting worse? Eh, it's about the same. Uh-oh! Look out, Smithers! I love this show Well well, look whose come to apologize. C'mon. Let's go in there and get the bear! I got it! Aw jeez, will you look at that? What have we become? We've given the word mob a bad name! She's gonna break a lot of hearts, Homer. I love what you've done with the house, Marge, etc... What should we do now? Hey, everybody. Let's go sing at the hospital! FOR WE'VE GOT... HI-GH HOPES / WE'VE GOT HI-GH HOPES. Simpson, look what you've reduced me to. Please... please. But Mr. Burns, it's not my bear. It's Maggie's. So, good sand today, hm. Well, I don't usually... well, just this once. Ugh. Damn you, paparazzo! Well, Maggie, I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement. Beaten by an infant. What could be more humiliating? Okay, Maggie, you win. But I want you to do something for me. Hang on to that bear. Don't make the same mistake I made. For me? Bobo? Smithers, I'm so happy. Something amazing has happened. I'm actually happy. Take a note. From now on, I'm only going to be good and kind to everyone. Sorry, sir, I don't have a pencil. Eh, don't worry, I'm sure I'll remember it. Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending? It's an ending, that's enough. There you go. Ah, Bobo reunited at last. But I can't help but wonder what the future holds for you. Ah, yes. Wonder... Bobo I know I say this every century, but I'll never leave you behind again.
