67,68,"Live from Hawaii's beautiful Molokai Island: ""We're not just for lepers anymore!"" It's Carnival of the Stars! I'm your host, Troy McClure! You may remember me from such films as ""The Erotic Adventures of Hercules"" and ""Dial 'M' For Murderousness."" Tonight, we'll see Angela Lansbury walk on hot coals! Excitement, She Wrote! How someone someone abuse their body that way? Moe! Don't throw out that brine! But first -- a man whose inspiring battle with Percodan addiction is soon to be a movie of the week -- Krusty the Klown! I'll be played by Jimmy Smits! Now he faces his toughest audience -- three Siberian tigers! Simba! On the ball! Not the face! Eh, they'll be chewin' on him for a while. Ai yi yi -- La Policia! Hey, Homer, phone call. Hi, Homie. It's really starting to snow. I think you should come home. But Marge, Alan Thicke is throwing knives at Ricardo Montalban. Ow! Sorry, Ricardo. Take it easy, folks... it's ""snow"" picnic out there. I ""snow"" what you mean. You're dead weight, Marty. Ohh. Well, I got him as good as he got me. Now, before I give you the check, one more question: Uh, this place ""Moe's"" you left just before the accident: this is a business of some kind? Don't tell him you were at a bar! But what else is open at night? It's a pornography store. I was buying pornography. I would'a never thought of that. 'Fraid old Zeke, he rides up here with me. Can't trust a pig with watermelons, ya know. She'll go 300 hectares on a single tank of kerosene. What country is this car from? It no longer exists. But take her for a test drive and you'll agree, ""Dazgreb ebn zloty gdev!"". Put it in H! Kids! If we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free. Do you come with the car? Oh, you! Do you come with the car? Oh, you! Bart! That car belonged to Bonnie and Clyde! Show a little respect. Our tireless safety engineers crash- test over one thousand cars a year. Hey, wait... that's not a dummy! This exhibit is closed. The Batmobile! Adam West! Hey kids, Batman! Dad, that's not the real Batman. Of course I'm Batman! See? Here's a picture of me with Robin. Who the hell is Robin? Oh. I guess you're only familiar with the new ""Batman"" movies. Michelle Pfeiffer... ha! The only true ""Catwoman"" is Julie Newmar, Lee Merriwether or Eartha Kitt. And I didn't need molded plastic to improve my physique. Pure West. And how come Batman doesn't dance anymore? Remember the Batusi? Nice meetin' ya! Just keep moving. Don't make eye contact. Wow! Just think what I could do with that plow. Homer, I've got to sneak these viable artworks out of the White House. But I can't get out of my driveway because of those protesters. Mr. President, those young people are about to get a dose of reality. Eh, I can't afford it. Pally, this doesn't cost money, it makes money! You make the payments by plowing driveways on the side. Well... I really should discuss this with my wife. Your wife? What? You think I'm going to buy a twenty thousand dollar truck just because you make that noise? I'll take it! I can't believe you bought that plow. We can't afford it. If you're gonna get mad at me every time I do something stupid, then I guess I'll just have to stop doing stupid things. Good. Fine. I'll never ever do another stupid thing. Good night! Oh, Homie, didn't that hurt? No. Marge didn't reckon with these fliers and this flashy jacket. Forget it, Homer! People don't read these things. Watch. Twenty percent off at Lullabuys. Just tell 'em ""Big Baby"" sent you. I know you can hear me! I'm talkin' to you! You sicken me. I guess guys like us just can't get a break. Well, at least I can't sink any lower. Come back, diaper! Come back! Hi, ma. And now, to read from the Epistles of St. Paul, Homer Simpson. Dear Lord, in your infinite wisdom, you know the number to call when you need a plow is KLONDIKE 5-3226. Homer, this is really low. Not as low as my low, low prices. Uh, huh, that's Mr. Plow. I'm gonna lose my plow. Dad, have you considered buying commercial time on channel ninety-two? Check it out. Arr! Ninety sea chanteys on three compact discs. BLOW THE MAN DOWN MATIES / BLOW THE MAN DOWN... ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT / IN THE NAVY COME ON AND JOIN YOUR FELLOW MAN... Act now and get a bonus CD: ""Hornpipe Fever."" Arrgh. Hmmm. Almost time for our commercial. Dad, who's watching TV at 3:17 a.m.? Alcoholics, the unemployable, angry loners... Look! There we are! It may be on a lousy channel but the Simpsons are on TV! Our driveway's snowed in! Old Man Winter! That's right! I fill your driveways with ice and snow! What are you gonna do about it? Nuthin', that's what. Stop! Mr. Plow! Get out of here, you lousy... season! All right... I'm goin'... My head hurts. I have to lie down for a while. Hello, I'm Mr. Plow. Are you tired of having your hands cut off by snow blowers, and the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow? Uh-huh. Then call KLONDIKE 5-3226. Call now and receive a free T-shirt. He could still surprise ya! But I'm a real tightwad. Can I afford this remarkable system? Absolutely! My prices are so low, you'll think I've suffered brain damage. You are fully bonded and licensed by the city, aren't you Mr. Plow? Shut up, boy. So remember... CALL MISTER PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME! THAT NAME AGAIN IS MISTER PLOW! Well, John Q Driveway has our number. Now we play the waiting game. The waiting game sucks. Let's play ""Hungry, Hungry Hippos."" Thank you, Mr. Plow. Now my store can remain open. Let's do it. We're not prisoners anymore! We're free! We can go anywhere we want. I'm cold and frightened. Well, I'm afraid classes may be canceled today. Look! We won't miss a minute of school, thanks to your father. Say your prayers, Plow Boy! Mr. Plow, for making it possible for people to get where they're going without resorting to public transportation or car pooling, I give you the key to the city. Here you go, Mr. Plow. A beer on the house. Wow, Moe, you didn't even give a beer to those freed Iranian hostages. Ah, they shouldn't have been there in the first place. But Homer is a real hero. I wish I was a hero. Well wishing won't make it so. You've got to pull up your diaper, get out there, and be the best damn Barney you can be. Here I come world! How do you think he'll do, Moe? I think he'll do just fine. I was wrong about you buying that truck. I'm very proud of you, Mr. Plow. . This might sound silly, but just for a change, would you mind... Cutting my nails? Brushing my teeth? No. No. Could you wear the Mr. Plow jacket. Just uh... for fun. Oooh. Heh heh heh. CALL MR. PLOW / THAT'S MY NAME / THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW. Ah, white gold. What the... What happ... uh... oh no... Hi ya, Homer! Say hello to the Plow King! Barney, you stole my idea! Don't worry Homer. There's nothing wrong with a little healthy competition. Well, well, if it isn't Mr. Plow. Hey, Plow King, save some for me. Wow! Linda Ronstadt! Linda Ronstadt? How'd you get her? Eh, we've been lookin' for a project to do together for a while. WHEN THE SNOW STARTS A FALLIN'... THERE'S A MAN YOU SHOULD BE CALLIN'... THAT'S KL5-4796 -- LET IT RING; /MR. PLOW IS A LOSER AND / I THINK HE IS A BOOZER... SO YOU BETTER MAKE THAT CALL TO THE PLOW KING. How could you, Barney? After all I've done for you. Lachrymose is to dyspeptic as ebullient is to... effervescent! All right! Harvard here I come! Psst, Barney! My Dad's asleep. Want a beer? I don't know. The SAT's are tomorrow. I've got two words for you. Mellow out, man. Hmm? Hmm? All right. Just one -- if it'll get you off my back. Hey, where have been all my life? Thank you, Plow King-a-lee-ding. Flanders, I thought I was your plow man. Ah, Homer, why don't you plow it again? Forget it pal. I don't need your phoney baloney job. I'll take your money but I'm not gonna plow your driveway. Mr. West! You said there was a job for me! There was, when I called you, forty-five minutes ago. So long Superman. Your secret identity is safe with me. Ring, damn you. Ring! Mister Plow... that name again is Mr. Plow. Hello, I'm calling from Delinquent Accounts at Kumatsu Motors -- Oh, you want the Mister Plow who plows driveways. This is Tony Plow. You know... from ""Leave It To Beaver""? Yeah, they were gay. Oh, what am I gonna do? I think you should do a new ad. One that's fresh and original. I know! I'll do a rap. I'M MR. PLOW AND I'M HERE TO SAY: I'M THE PLOWINGEST GUY IN THE USA / I GOT A BIG PLOW AND I MOVE A LOT OF THINGS / LIKE YOUR COW IT YOU HAVE ONE. Ooh / Meow / Dad, stop you're embarrassing us / Stop please. Stop it right now. Promise you'll never do that again. All right. Mr. Simpson, I guarantee you we'll come up with a commercial that can save your business. You know those radio ads where two people with annoying voices yammer back and forth? I invented those. / Yeow! Happens all the time. Dad, was that your commercial? I don't know. The torch has been passed to a new generation of, uh, snow plow people... Come on, give me the key. These look like teeth marks. I thought there was chocolate inside. Well, why was it wrapped in foil? It was never wrapped in foil! Hardest hit by the blizzard is Springfield's forbidding Widow's Peak. Our own Arnie Pie is on the scene. Everything's snowed in. All I can see is white! Arnie please... the ski conditions! Mayday! Mayday! I think I'm flying into a mountain! Tell my wife I love-- That's great Arnie. Hmm... Hello... Plow King? I was wondering if you could plow my driveway on top of forbidding Widow's Peak. I don't know. I'd be up there all day... I wouldn't be able to plow any other driveways... There's a $10,000 bill in it for you. Oh yeah? Which president's on it? Uh... all of them. They're having a party. Jimmy Carter's passed out on the couch. Wow! I'll be right there. Barney, I'd like to put a Spanish version of your jingle on my next album. SEÑOR PLOW NO ES MACHO / ES SOLAMENTE UN BORRACHO... Yeah, you do that. Well, I guess you can plow my driveway. But I wonder what happened to the Plow King. Well, I guess he just doesn't respect his customers. Oh, could you make sure not to scrape my asphalt? Kiss my asphalt. So I says, ""Kiss my asphalt."" Hmm? Hmm? Springfield's beloved Plow King is trapped. Barney Gumble, shown here donating $50,000 to the Shelbyville Dance Theater... was caught in a sudden avalanche on Widow's Peak earlier today. It was captured on film by a camera crew making the upcoming Fox special, ""In Search of Bigfoot."" Hold it, Bob, we can see your wristwatch. Oh, dammit! Hey, what's that? This is all my fault. I've gotta save him. Homie, please don't go. Hey, this old girl's as sure-footed as a mountain goat. Baaaaaaaaa! Baaaa! Baaaa... Baaa... Easy... easy... Ah, dying's not so bad. I'll be reunited with my loved ones. My dad... and that plant I never watered. Barney! Homer, you saved my life and I'm not gonna forget it. From now on, we'll be partners. Barney, that's great. When two best friends work together, not even God, Himself, can stop them. Oh no? The snow's melted! We can go outside again. I don't like the looks of those teenagers. Could this record-breaking heat wave be the result of the dreaded greenhouse effect? Well, if 70-degree days in the middle of winter are the ""price"" of car pollution, you'll forgive me if I keep my old Pontiac. Y'ello. Hello, this is the Repo Depot. I'm just calling to distract you while we repossess your plow. Oh yeah? How dumb do you think I -- Ohh, now Homie, you have your health, you have your best friend back, and you do have that certain special something. You mean... MR. PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME. THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW. Our forecast calls for flurries of passion followed by extended periods of gettin' it on.","Farmer, Mayor Joe Quimby, Troy McClure, Salesman, Adjuster, Homer's Brain, RICARDO, Bumblebee Man, ""Just Stamp the Ticket"" Man, Marge Simpson, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Man, Nelson Muntz, Arnie Pye, Cameraman, German Engineer, Teenage Barney, Kent Brockman, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Woman, Seymour Skinner, President Bush, Groundskeeper Willie, Mountain Goat, Krusty the Clown, Rev.
