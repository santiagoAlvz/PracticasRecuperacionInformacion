226,230,"I still can't believe we escaped from those horrible vampires. But it was worth it to get back our super Sugar Crisp cereal. Can't get enough of that Sugar Crisp... I'm having a hard time seeing. Homer, did you remember to put the fog lights in? Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in... I better pull over and play it safe. Please be a dog. Oh, no! Ned Flanders! He's dead! He's definitely dead! Oh my God, we killed Ned Flanders! You mean you killed Ned Flanders. Oh, it was an accident! An accident! We've got to go to the police. They'll never believe a Simpson killed a Flanders by accident. Even I have my doubts. Don't worry. I've got a plan. Okay, Ned, the first thing we have to do is... To make sure that no one knows that you're dead. And if anyone asks... you're not dead. Hey Maude! Look who's helping me clean the chimney. Neddy? Where have you been? Hi, Maude. Diddily. I've been having fun with my pal Homer. Diddily. Oh, I'm so relieved. Whenever you go on one of your late night fog walks, I get so worried. Relax, I'm fine. But when I do die, I don't want any autopsies. Well, come on down, you goofy roofy. Wow, it sure is slippery up here. My pies are done! Aww, she missed it. Hey Maude, I'm home. Uh-oh. I think I'm having a heart attack. And that's the end of that chapter. Try not to look too sad -- it'll seem suspicious. ... And now Ned's best friend will say a few words. Homer? When I think about Ned, I can't help but remember the look on his face when Marge drove over... Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Oh, wait... What I'd like to say is, we're still looking for the real killers. Anyway, in conclusion, a man cannot be forced to testify against his wife. Stop winking. We'll miss you, buddy. Hey, we just got away with murder. And it was so easy. You know, I've never liked that little wiener Milhouse. No more murders. But you got to kill... No. Someone saw us. But who? Homer! Stop that! Who could be calling at this hour? Y'ello? I know you're alone. Who is this? Is this Maude Flanders? No, it's Homer. Oh, hey Homer, it's Moe. I must have dialed the wrong number. Dear God, it's Homer. If you really love me, you'll save my life now. He's getting closer! Okay, Marge, you hide in the abandoned amusement park. Lisa, the pet cemetery. Bart, spooky roller disco. And I'll go skinny dipping in that lake where the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago tonight. Now, Flanders, I want you to... It's impossible. I killed you. You can't kill the undead, silly. He's undead, all right. Are you a zombie? Oh, I wish. You see, that night when you hit me with your car... I'm making record time on this fog walk! Ooo, better pick up the pace. Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in... I better pull over and play it safe. So you were going to kill us. Yeah... Hey, Foamy, I want the news, not the weather. Marge, did you hear me zing Werewolf Flanders? Flanders, stop that. Eyes bigger than your stomach, eh, wolfie? Well, well, well, if it isn't the cutest police officer in Springfield. Hey, you know, we got feelin's too, Chief. Just dump your candy on the X-ray belt, Ralphie. There's a good boy. Safe... safe... razor blade... syringe... ooh, white chocolate! Check it out, Lisa. I'm Radioactive Man. I don't think the real Radioactive Man wears a plastic smock with a picture of himself on it. He would on Halloween. Get in there, you stupid pillowcase. Stop it! You'll jam the machine! Uh-oh. Radiation! Duck and cover! Cool... Bart! Oh, my God! Lisa! She's been crushed! And so have the hopes of our mathletics team. Hold the funeral, Poindexter. Poindexter?! Whoa, Lis, those X-rays must've given you super strength. I wonder if I got any powers... Nope, looks normal... Wait a minute. I can stretch! Look at me! Ow! Hot-hot-hot! I must only use this power to annoy. Now, who could that be at this hour? Yes, yes... Up, down... Side-to-side... What's your point? Ow! Gotcha. Bart, with these powers, we can become superheroes! Okay, so do it already! STRETCH DUDE AND CLOBBER GIRL / HE'S A HUMAN RUBBER BAND AND SHE'S THE HULK IN PEARLS! HE'S A LIMBER LAD... SHE'S A POWERFUL LASS... HE'LL WRING YOUR NECK, AND SHE'LL KICK YOUR ASS! THEY'RE STRETCH DUDE! AND CLOBBER GIRL! / STRETCH DUDE! CLOBBER GIRL! / STRETCH DUDE! CLOBBER GIRL! Tonight's episode: ""Enter the Collector."" ... But I'm sure that once girls get to know the real you, you'll get plenty of dates. Next question. Yes, over here. In episode BF12 you were battling barbarians while riding a wing-ed Appaloosa. Yet in the very next scene, my dear, you're clearly atop a wing-ed Arabian. Please to explain it. Uhh, yeah, whenever you notice something like that, a wizard did it. I see, all right, yes. But in episode AG4... Wizard. Oh, for glayvin out loud. Behold! I am the Collector... and I'm here to add you to my collection! Must remove... my breastplate... Maybe later. Care for a Rollo, sweet Xena? All right, ""Collector,"" stick this in your tweezers! I'm not Xena! I'm an actress, you lunatic. Oh, please. I'm not insane. I simply wish to take you back to my lair and make you my bride. Oh, dear God! Clobber Girl? Help! It's Xena! She's been kidnapped! Come on! Remember, you're vulnerable to Kryptonite! Geez, Marge, tell the neighborhood. Fear not, my syndicated sweetie. You'll be preserved in this Mylar pouch. Forever remaining in near-mint condition between Dr. Who and, of course, Yasmine Bleeth. I don't think so! I don't think so, either. Your collecting days are over, Collector... Stop right there! I have here the only working phaser ever built. It was fired only once -- to keep William Shatner from making another album. Stretch Dude! Help! Just a sec. Whoa! Hey, phaser, phaser, phaser -- zing! Goodnight, Retch Dude and Slobber Girl. Sweet screams. I'm unbelievably rude. Soon, those bratty buttinskis will be encased in Lucite for all eternity. While we're waiting, here are some names you may call me on our wedding night: Obi-Wan, Iron Man, Mr. Mxyzptlk, and, of course, Big Papa Smurf. What do you need me for? You could have your choice of any of the women in these bags. You would think so, but no. Really? Well, I mean, maybe we are meant for each other. Growing up, I was always tall for my age, and the other kids made fun of me. I... I always hoped for another misunderstood soul to share my pain and... you could be that soul, Collector. Come here, you. Xena needs xex. Got your lips! You tricked me with a ruse so hackneyed it would make Stan Lee blush. Shut up. Ooh! Ow! Oh, that hurts! Bart, just let me drop and save yourself! What d'you think I've been tryin' to do? Aha! Not even Xena is a match for the limited-edition, double-edged light saber from ""Star Wars -- Episode 1... The Phantom Menace"". You removed it from its original packaging! Nooo! It's no longer a collectible! What a nerd. Lucite hardening... Must end life in classic Lorne Greene pose from ""Battlestar Galactica""... Best... death... ever. Wow, thanks for saving us. No problem. Now let's get you kids home. Wait a minute, Xena can't fly. I told you. I'm not Xena. I'm Lucy Lawless. Oh. STRETCH DUDE! AND CLOBBER GIRL! This is Dick Clark, rockin' down to the year 2000... and that was Whitesnake! We're not Whitesnake, dude, we're Poison. I thought we were Quiet Riot. Well, it says here we're Ratt. Man alive, what a stinko thousand years! Blimp wrecks, teen-agers... then again, we had two TV shows with Andy Griffith. And eleven with Robert Urich. SUPER FREAK! SUPER FREAK! I'M SUPER FREAKIN'! YOWWWL! Aw, man. What'd I do now? Wonderful. Now that song is dedicated to all you super geeks who rocked around the clock to exterminate America's Y2K bugs. Slammin'! Hey, Homer. Weren't you the plant's Y2K Compliance Officer? Absolutely. It musta been hard debugging all those computers, huh Homer? Doin' what now? You did fix them, right Dad? Because even a single faulty unit could corrupt every other computer in the world. That can't be true, honey. If it were, I'd be terrified. ... EIGHT... SEVEN... SIX... we wanna thank Dixie Brand Mayonnaise... Whoo Lawdy, what a mayonnaise! THREE... TWO... That's Homer Simpson's computer. Oh God! It's spreading! Happy New-- Wha?! Oh, no. It's happening. Uh-oh. Ha... ... Wha?! Who's going to clean up all those jets? There goes the clothesline. Well, those ivory tower eggheads have screwed us again. Let's just have some milk and go to bed... Hey, this milk's broken. It's got a computer chip in it. Everything does. Stop! Ow! ... Judgment Day is upon us. I warned you the Lord wouldn't stand for your mini-dresses, and Beatle boots... I resisted these for thirty-five years! Why did I wear them today? But it's not too late to repent your sins and be embraced by the Almighty -- Hey, everybody! They're looting the mall. Hurry! I got nine shoe buffers! I'm caught on something! I don't want you looting! But I was gonna loot you a present! Oh, all right. Oh, thank you, Homie. A Lady Remington. Well, look at the wonders of the computer age now. Wonders, Lisa? Or blunders? I think that was implied by what I said. Implied, Lisa? Or implode? Mom, make him stop. Oh, no! Krusty! My pacemaker... it's stuck on hummingbird! Nectar! Nectar! I need to drink my weight in nectar! Krus-tyyyyyy! Hey, a note. You have been selected for Operation Exodus... They're evacuating the Earth! We're saved! Thank you, sweet clown. In death you saved us all. I'm not dead! I can still hear his voice on the wind. There it is! Just like the dead clown promised. Wow, there's Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, Paul McCartney, Michael Jordan, Michelle Kwan... They must be starting a new civilization on Mars with our best and brightest. That's us! Name please. Certainly. I am... the, ah, piano genius from the movie ""Shine."" Uh-huh. And your name is? Uh... Shiny McShine? Actually, he's Homer Simpson. That's Bart. I'm Lisa... Lisa Simpson? Ah, you're the ship's proofreader. Welcome aboard! Now before you enter, you're going to have to make a very difficult choice. You're only allowed to take one parent with you-- Mom. Love ya lots! Good-bye Lisa, remember me as I am... filled with murderous rage. Well, son. I guess this is the end. But we've both had long, full lives. Oh, right. Hey, look, another spaceship! And there's nobody guarding it. Let's go! I can't believe I destroyed the Earth. Are you still talking about the Earth? You're right. I gotta let it go. All that counts is we're alive and rubbing elbows with the greats. Ooh, there's Ross Perot, Dr. Laura, Spike Lee... Wait a minute. They're not so great. Okay, but there's... Dan Quayle and Courtney Love... Tanya Harding... Al Sharpton...? Tom Arnold?! What the hell's going on?! Wait. Only that ship is going to Mars. Our's is headed for the sun. Yeah, ain't that a kick in the teeth? I mean, my shows weren't great, but I never tied people up and forced 'em to watch. And I could've. 'Cause I'm a big guy. And I'm good with knots. So we're all gonna die? 'Fraid so. But hey, the grub's pretty good, huh? The sun? That's the hottest place on Earth! Gonna work on my tannage, buuuh-ddy. Pauly Shore? Wow! Hey, we should do a show together, man. That's a sure cure for the blues! Hey, turn those frowns around! Oh no, Rosie O'Donnell. C'mon everybody, sing along! ""CLANG CLANG CLANG WENT THE TROLLEY!""
