347,351,"Hey, hey, hey, no enjoyin' it! Kent Brockman here with Stormwatch Six. Professor Frink, what's the scientific explanation for this unusually severe thunderstorm? Well Kent, we are uh exploring two theories at this point: a) either we have a supercell of high pressure fronts or b) God is bowl-ing! With the balls and the pins and the rental shoes and the very bad cheese pizza that comes in squares. Krusty, what's your light-hearted take on our recent bad weather? Sorry Kent, I sold all my ""bad weather"" jokes to Jay Mohr. But I can make funny sounds in your microphone. Fine. There you have it. Homer, do something about this leak! Don't worry, Marge -- Hot Wheels to the rescue! The water flows down here, through the straightaway, a couple of wicked S-turns... Around the loop of death...And out the mail slot! Then it's the yard's problem. My hamster! You know Homer, I let a lot of things slide, but when you can't keep a roof over your family's head, you're just not much of a father. I was gonna have my classmates over for a homework party, but now my refreshments are ruined. Goodbye, college! He was supposed to be in a show-and-tell this week. That's not gonna happen! That teddy bear survived three safety recalls, but it couldn't survive you! Aw, that's it. I'm going to Moe's! It's raining outside. It's raining inside! Lousy cat. Stupid Homer-hating family. At least there's one place I'm always welcome. FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW... Aw, guys. This is just what I needed. This ain't for you, sweat stain. It's a surprise party for Lenny, thrown by his closest friends. So what's Stephen Hawking doing here? I live here now. You're looking at the new owner of the Little Caesar's down the street. Pizza, pizza. Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza. Sorry. That button sticks. So why didn't you invite me? We couldn't tell you ahead of time, because you'd spill the beans. I wouldn't ruin a surprise for Lenny. Surprise? What surprise? Way to go Six years' planning down the drain! I'm sorry. I'll just sit over here until you stop being mad at me. Oh great, Homer! I bake a cake shaped like Lenny's favorite barstool, and you wreck it. Well, I can see I'm not wanted here. Wait, Homer! Don't go. Okay, beat it. Who wants ass frosting? No thanks, I'm on Atkins. My family hates me... my stupid friends kick me out of their stupid party! They'll all be sorry when I invent the world's best-tasting cola... and share it with no one! A sign! Finally, a bar for men who like to drink and look at sexy women. Welcome to Knockers, hon. Let me know if you see anything you like. Read the sign, pre-vert. I'd like a beer and a sympathetic ear. I got my own problems. I just lost this eye last night. How did it ever come to this? I'm the first man ever to feel depressed in a bar. I don't have a friend in the world. Look at the size of that nacho plate! I haven't seen this much melted cheese since I left my Billy Joel albums out in the sun. The sun. Hey, you wanna split this? Wow, it's been so long since I've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig I am. Mine. Oh, move your hand. I get this! Hey, my name's Ray -- Ray Magini. Ray, you know me better than anyone. How can I get my wife to love me again? Beats me -- I'm no marriage counselor. Just a licensed and bonded roofer. Ray, will you help me fix my roof? Sure, I'll help ya, under one condition -- you gotta help me finish this pitcher of beer. Wait, did I add that right? Now, for my first act as President... Deal! To my new buddy. Now all we need is an awesome theme song. Whatever plays next on the jukebox. Deal. DO THAT TO ME ONE MORE TIME / ONCE IS NEVER ENOUGH / WITH A MAN LIKE YOU... Next song. / That's what I meant. / Absolutely. Homer! I woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me. I think that means six more weeks of Autumn. It means you have to fix the roof! Don't worry, honey. I found us a roofer last night, and you'll never guess where. Knockers on route 98. How did you know? I'm psychic. Look, I don't know if I want a roofer who hangs out in bars. You're right, Marge -- I guess I should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats. High-five! Eh, I got standards. I don't hand out high-fives like Chiclets. Ray would high-five me. Well, he better high-five our roof! Yay, Mom! Zing! Come on, kids! We're gonna visit Grampa. Then we're gonna take the dog to the V-E-T... ...then take Bart to get C-I-R-C-U-M-C-I-S-E-D. I'll tell you what it means when it's over. Hey, Homer. Oh Ray! You came at the agreed-upon time. That's what I like about you, Homer. Everything impresses you. ""Impresses."" What a big word! I'm gonna look that up. Ah, this is gonna take some work. Tell me, was the roof in good condition when you bought the house? I didn't really check. I mainly bought this house for the view. Some day that bowl will overflow, and I'll be there. Okay kids, we only have time for a quick visit to Grampa, so as soon as he feels loved, we're outta there. Oh, he must smell leftovers. Please, we call them ""senior citizens."" A dog? What a nice surprise! I'm gonna pet you raw! Can we keep your dog? Please? Keep my dog? Till when? Not too long, just till we die. Well, he does seem happy here... Also, gerontological studies have demonstrated that animal companions can slow the inevitable decline of-- Yeah, okay, thank you. Why don't you go find a parade and rain on it? Sorry about that, pal. No problem. Accidents happen. One, two, three, four -- I declare a nail war! This is why I got into roofing! Hey Homer! Ned, are you okay? Yes... but my mower can't get much lower! I was wrong! That's Ned Flanders. There's one in every neighborhood. Oh sorry man, I gotta go. This says my kid attempted something. I hate the way these things cut off. Goodbye, Ray! Bye! Oh, he turned the corner. Ooh! Now I see him again! Homer! You're drooling on my Goodwill pile! And why is the hole in the roof even bigger? Don't worry -- Ray'll be back any minute. It's after six -- he's not coming back. He's a lousy roofer and a flake! Hey, watch what you say about him. I think Ray could be the one. The one what? My new best friend. We think alike, we act alike, we finish each other's sandwiches... I don't want to hear any more about Ray. Tomorrow morning you buy some shingles and fix that roof yourself. Ray's not gonna like that. You're not married to Ray! Well if I was, we'd have taller kids! I'm sure everyone's happier with Santa's Little Helper here to love them. Yeah, I bet the old people will be acting like young people, like in those cell phone ads everyone hates. He's become one of them! Hey boy, want a treat? We better get you home. Come on, Lisa. Right after Pat Sajak. Geez Louise... You know it's too bad. We've had that dog as long as I can remember. What dog? Who the hell are you? I wish I knew. You know son, my dad used to take me down to Johnson's Hardware. Old man Johnson knew everything about fixin' stuff. When they built this place, he hung himself. Oh sorry, son. I wanted you to bring me the stack of tiles from the top shelf. Hey, Ray's here! Hey Homer! Look, I just came down with a case of shingles. What's in the box? Hey, I'm real sorry I never made it back yesterday. I hope we're still friends? Of course we are! If you wanna be. Well, I wanna be if you wanna be. I tell you what, let me get a few more supplies, then I'll come right over and finish your roof. Hey Dad, remember when you said if I used a chainsaw unsupervised I'd hurt myself? Well, you were wrong. I hurt someone else. I have forty-five minutes to get ready for the prom. What are you doing? Why aren't you fixing the roof? I don't have to -- Ray's gonna be here any minute. I'm so sick of hearing about that stupid, unreliable Ray! Who, by the way, I've never even met! All right, then you can just look at the portrait I painted of him. Homer, how did you think I'd feel when I saw that? Something like that. Homer, come down for dinner. Did you make enough for Ray? Ray's not coming! He is too! His truck's gonna come around the corner riiight now. Right now. Right now. Now. Now. Nnnnnnnnow. Now. Now. Now. Nnnow. Homer, I know where Ray is. Oh thank God. Where is he? Tell me! Sweetheart, your friend Ray is in your head. Ray wouldn't fit in my head -- he's a human man. You have to understand -- Ray doesn't exist. Yes he does. He's on his way and when he gets here, we'll have ever so much fun! You'll see! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, how we'll laugh! Homer! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha... What's going on? Where are my shoes? Struggle all you want, Homer. There's nothing you can do. Excuse us for a moment. What am I doing here? Let me go! We'll let you go when you admit there is no Ray Magini. Fine, I admit it. Help me, Ray! Appear and strike them down! Homer, no one has ever seen Ray but you. But that's not true, Bart saw him at the Builder's Barn. No I didn't, Dad. I saw you talking to yourself. Flanders, you saw Ray on the roof with me! Sorry, Homer. You'll have to call me a Ray-theist, 'cause I don't believe I saw him. Ned, are you okay? There has to be someone who saw him -- someone who doesn't hate me like Flanders and Bart... Wait! The bartender at Knockers. I called that bosom bar. The bartender said you were there alone. Ray's a figment of your imagination, Homer. You felt lonely and unappreciated, so you made him up. And here's the clincher... Ray Magini is an anagram for ""imaginary."" Wow. My subconscious is a genius. Well, that's all very convincing, and... I'm afraid this calls for electro-shock. Electro-shock? Actually, the technical term is electroconvulsive therapy. Well, that's a world of difference. Light me up, doc! When you're gettin' juiced, can you hold my turtle? I wanna bring him back to life. Aw, what did he die of? I'unno. He was dead when I found him. Homer, that's just to bite on, not to eat-- Sorry. Give me one that doesn't taste so good. That was rubber covered in Vaseline! Marge, write that down so we can have it at home. We can't begin this treatment soon enough. How you feeling, sweetie? Much better. Do you see anyone here who isn't here? Nope, just you, Marge and Yogi Bear. Kidding! Well, I see your sense of humor's not affected. That's a very bad sign. Real. Not real. Real. Real. Oh sorry, Homer. But recent historical evidence indicates that Robin Hood did not actually exist. Fascinating! You kids can relax. Your father is fine now. Fine and dandy? Well, his dandiness will slowly return, with time. Dad! Oh kids, I heart you, too! Man, I'm glad to be off that electro-shock table. Although to be honest, I did enjoy lying down. Hello, Homer. It's Ray! I see him again! Monster! You don't exist. Hey, no one calls me a monster and questions my existence! The awesome power of the human mind. I see Ray too. So do I. Uh-oh. Well, I'm not worried. You've already agreed not to sue me for anything. When did I agree to that? You did when I validated your parking. You didn't validate my parking. Check and mate. So, Ray does exist?! That's right. Now let's explore the improbable series of events that led to this amusing, yet tragic farce. On account of my eye patch, I couldn't see Ray sitting at the bar. All I saw was you, eatin' and drinkin' and talkin' to yourself. And Ned, you didn't see me because I was hiding behind the chimney. Gee, I thought my vision was perfect. And here I was, worshiping false eyeballs. Wait, wait, wait, wait. How come at Builder's Barn I saw Homer talking to thin air? Well, that... hm. I can answer that. I've been tracking a tear in the fabric of space-time, which combined with airborne pieces of metal at Builder's Barn, to create a miniature black hole. This anomaly interposed itself between Homer and Bart, causing a gravitational lens which absorbed the light reflected from Ray the roofer. That seems... feasible. Wait, there's still one last thing that doesn't make sense. Why did you start fixing our roof and then just disappear? That's easy -- I'm a contractor. That's right -- you're all crooks! Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're all crooks. It's true. Wait a minute. I went through a lot of pain and suffering because of this little misunderstanding. Somebody owes me big! Well, Homer, I could make it up to you... maybe a free eye-scraping. That's a given! There's something else. Something much more else. Homer, can I please knock off? I've got surgery in the morning. Not if those gutters aren't clean, you don't. So as I was saying, Homer, Mondays, nine o'clock, CBS. They say everybody loves that guy, but I don't get it. What are you talking about? Hey, I'm just sayin', catch it while you still can. What time's the show on? It's Monday, nine o'clock, CBS. And what's the network? CBS. At what time? Nine o'clock. And if I wanna watch it, what day? Monday. Monday, nine o'clock. And this is on the radio? No, television. Mondays at nine. On CBS. And if I wanna see it, what time should I watch it? Nine o'clock. On what channel? CBS. What day? Monday. On the radio? Television. Turn the television to what channel? CBS. At what time? Nine o'clock on Monday. Now if I wanted to see it on a certain day, what would be the best day to see it? It's only on on Monday. And what time? Would be a good time to see it? Nine o'clock. It's from nine to nine thirty. So if I turn my radio on at nine o'clock... Not the radio, television. So it's Mondays at nine, on NBC. CBS. CBS. Nine o'clock. On the radio. Television. Television at three o'clock. And we are done.","President Homer, Carl Carlson, Old Jewish Man, Marge Simpson, Man, Kent Brockman, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Squeaky-Voiced Teen, Lisa Simpson, Ray Magini, Record, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Knockers Waitress, Nurse, Lenny Leonard, Krusty the Clown, Moe Szyslak, Bartender, Ned Flanders, Jasper Beardly, Barflies, Barney Gumble, Dr. Stephen Hawking, Professor Jonathan Frink, Bart Simpson",7.4,661.0,16,2005-05-01,2005,16,Don't Fear the Roofer,11.92,41620.0
