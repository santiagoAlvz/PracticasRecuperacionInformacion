112,113,"Please, Marge. How often can I see a movie of this caliber on late-night TV? Is there something wrong, Homie? No. It's just that I've only seen this movie twice before, and I've seen you every night for the last eleven ye-- What I meant to say is... we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie. I promise. Enchiladas. Mom!! Dad!! Don't turn on the light! Don't turn on the light! There's a U.F.O. outside my window!! Seriously! Oh, Bart. It's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree. C-c-can I sleep in there with you guys tonight? No! Can I sit on the roof with a baseball bat in case a U.F.O. does come? Yes, yes, yes. That's fine. Good, good. I hope you kept the Homie fires burning... Homer. Huh? Homer! Wake up! Wake up! Whaa? We need to talk about the... marital difficulties we've been having lately. Marge, there's just too much pressure... what with my job, the kids, traffic snarls, political strife at home and abroad... but I promise you, the second all those things go away, we'll have sex. I simply can't wait that long. Maybe we should get some help... How 'bout a book? Ooooookay. A tasteful book. Oh. All right. Hey, Marge! This guy looks like Apu! Shh. I don't want people to see us looking at these books. Hi, guys. Whatcha lookin' at? Oh, I'm just reading up on, artillery. Yes. And I am pursuing my interest in... This one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty. It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey, you know, that nice Midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of Grampa. Oooh. ""Mr. and Mrs. Erotic American."" Mom! Dad! Look, this biography of Peter Uebberoth is only ninety-nine cents! And I found the new Al Gore book! ""Sane Planning: Sensible Tomorrow"". Yeah, I hope it's as exciting as his other book ""Rational Thinking: Reasonable Future!"" I'm getting this book on U.F.O.s. Did you know they're real, but there's a huge government conspiracy to cover it up? Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy. Mr. Vice President! Someone finally bought a copy of your book, sir! Well, This calls for a celebration. CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES / C'MON! / LET'S CELEBRATE... I will! Hello Americans, Paul Harvey here. Did you know every good American is, at heart, an erotic American? Iiiit's true. A famous couple -- I don't need to tell you it was Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower -- offered this advice: double your pleasure with a bath, together! HomeIE, I can't quite... Faucet's jammed into my back... I'm stuck. So am I. Kids? Kids? A romantic vacation can provide... titillation. Sensual, sanitary seclusion awaits you at any of America's fine Triple-A Approved motor lodges. The Arabian Nights Room looks nice... Ooh, the Pharaoh's Chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus. Uh, sorry there Fred and Ethel. Shoulda made a reservation. We only got uh, one room left. The uh... toilet is overflowing in the uh Caveman Room! Oh, here we are. The ""Utility Room."" This isn't very erotic. I think it's an actual utility room. No, honey, it's a romantic fantasy. I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're... the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room. Don't mind me, folks. Just need to get the ol' Wet-Dry Vac. By now, your new, improved love-life should have you flinging woo like nobody's business. So, to you, Mr. and Mrs. Erotic American, I bid... Gooood day. Welcome home, Son. I broke two lamps and lost all your mail. What's wrong with your wife? Never mind. You wouldn't understand. Flu? No. Protein deficiency? No. Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcano-coniosis? No. Unsatisfying sex life? N -- -- yes. But please don't you say that word. What? ""Sex?"" What's so unappealing about hearin' yer elderly father talk about sex? I had sex. You're home safe. Done my duty. See ya the next time we need your signature. Aw, you never wanna spend any time with me. But I can help you with your lovin' problem. I got a home remedy that will put the zowsers back in your trousers. Legend has it, my Great-Grandpappy stumbled upon this recipe when he was tryin' to invent a cheap substitute for holy water. Here ya g -- Hey! Here ya go, ya ingrate! Think of me when you're having the best sex of your life! Drink it! Kids-here's-fifty-dollars-Why-not-go-to-the-movies-then-take-a-cab-to-your-Aunts'-house-Stay-there-Phone-call-you-later-Now-Now-Now. Oh, Homey, what's-- Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards. What do you think Mom and Dad are doing right now? I'unno. Here he is, Rex Harrison and Paul Anka rolled into one! That tonic really works! You and Grampa should bottle it and go into business together. You want me to spend more time with dad? What about my New Year's resolution? You could make a lot of money. Yeah... Where are my pants? You threw them out the window in a fit of passion. You said you were never going to need them again. Oh, hurry, Neddie! They're awful. You just be ready with that garbage bag. Hoo mama! This is finally really happening. After years of disappointments with get-rich-quick-schemes, I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme! And quick! Sir! Hello, Sir! Yes, you look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife! Ow. I guess people have some sort of ""moral objection"" to our sex-drug. Lemme sell it, you idjit. Step right up, folks, and witness the magnificent medicinal miracle of Simpson & Son's Patented Revitalizing Tonic! Put some ardor in your larder with our energizing, moisturizing, tantalizing, romanticizing, sur-prising, her-prizing, revitalizing tonic! I doubt very highly that one elixir could boast so many fantastic properties. What say we amscray outta here and have a wild wing-ding at the cyclotron, Doctor? Anything you say, Professor! Tonight we'll push the twin beds together. And I found something for Milhouse down at the mall, too! A pup tent! Oh, boy! Now I can sleep out in the yard! Yeah! Every single night! I've discovered that the ""rejuvenating"" effect people feel is actually a mild form of poisoning, no doubt a result of the unsanitary conditions in Grampa Simpson's bathtub. Nonetheless... What's goin' on? Where are the grown-ups? Who cares? With no adults around, I run this city! Er, carry on. Listen to this. ""Unexplainable Behavior. Individuals acting in a secretive fashion are often involved with UFOs, or other paranormal phenomena, e.g. telephone explosions."" Geez! If it's in a book, it's gotta be true! Scary, no? And this guy's head of the Spaceology Department at the Correspondence College of Tampa! Will you cook my dinner for me? My parents aren't around and I'm not allowed to turn on the stove. Hurry up! We got a lotta tonic to sell and a lotta towns to visit: Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom, Lake Flaccid... Great. I'm gonna be stuck in the car all weekend with that wheezy windbag. ...and that's what's wrong with Bart's generation. Now, as for your generation... And for the minimal outlay of one dollar, you can take home a bottle of Liquid Lothario! Distilled Don Juan! Catalytically-Carbonated Casanova! Lock old Rover in the shed, 'cause man has a new best friend in Simpson and Son's Revitalizing Tonic! I'm not convinced. I've had bad luck with aphrodisiacs. All questions will be answered, all fears will be allayed, with one incontrovertible demonstration! May I have a volunteer from the audience? Yes, you, sir! Now, sir, you have never seen me before. Is that correct? That is correct. Well then how come his face is on the bottle? Umm... umm... You're the worst shill I ever seen! You're a disgrace to the medicine show business! They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music. Okay. It's now painfully clear. The adults are definitely paving the way for an invasion by the saucer people. You fool! Can't you see it's a massive government conspiracy? Or have they gotten to you, too? Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it! Why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions? Haven't you heard of Occam's Razor? ""The simplest explanation is probably the correct one."" So what's the simplest explanation? I don't know. Maybe they're all reverse vampires, and they have to get home before dark. Reverse vampires! / Etc. Hey, wait a minute. That's Amos Pierson's Moose Farm. Make a right, here. Ewww, why're we stopping at this dump? That's the house you grew up in, Son. Wow. Let's go find that hot dog tree I planted. Yeah, we lived here till the bank foreclosed in sixty-three. Farm went bust after the cows started givin' sour milk. Somethin' musta spooked 'em good. Oh, memories. If this old place could talk, it'd say... Yah! Ooh! Ow! Wah! Ow! There she is, the old Radiation King. You'd park yourself right there and watch for hours on end. If uh, I may, Helen, I'd like to respond to that question with yet another flip remark... Wow! Look at me, er uh, Mom! I am, 'er uh, President Kennedy! Oh, Abe, maybe our Homer could grow up to be president some day! You, president? This is the greatest country in the world. We got a whole system set up to keep people like you from ever becomin' president. Quitcher daydreamin', melonhead. Quitcher daydreamin', melonhead. Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? Maybe I could've been something more than I am, like a travel agent to a great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm. Who are you to complain? You lock me up in a home and give me the same damn shower safety seat every Christmas! Your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me. That's 'cause you're a screw-up. You're the screw-up! Why you little...! All right! That's it. We're goin' home. I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic! If I hadn't taken that stupid tonic 38 years ago, you'da never been born and I'da been happy! You were an accident!! Get out. I'm sorry I said that. Out. I'm gonna get out of the car, and I hope you'll find it in your heart not to drive awa-- Well, I'll be all right as long as I can remember my Army training... Dang. I'm sorry. Hi? Homie, are you really going to ignore Grampa for the rest of your life? Of course not Marge, just for the rest of his life. He said I was an accident. He didn't want to have me! You didn't want to have Bart. I know, but you're never supposed to tell the child. You tell Bart all the time. You told him this morning. But when I do it, it's cute. So, finally, we're all in agreement about what's going on with the adults. Milhouse? Okay, here's what we've got. The Rand Corporation, in conjunction with the saucer people... Thank you. Under the supervision of the reverse vampires... ... are forcing our parents to go to bed early in a fiendish plot to eliminate the meal of DINNER! We're through the looking glass here, people! Kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky... nutty... chewy... chocolatey... Put it away, boy... situation. And your daddy has realized something very important: a father should always make his kids feel wanted. Starting right now, I promise to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you deserve. And just feast your ears on this tantalizing testimonial from my own flesh and blood, the son who puts the fun in ""Simpson & Son"" -- my son, Barney! I used to be a fat, disgusting slob. That medicine seems to be givin' your son a lotta gas. I assure you his belching is the result of an unrelated alcohol problem. It just ain't the same without Homer. He knew how to drive a car. Son! My dear Son. From now on I'm going to be a good and attentive father. And for starters your ""old man"" is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike! Dad, number one: I know how to ride a bike. Number two: I already own a bike. And number three: that is a girl's bike. You're no girl, you're a boy. A good boy. You can be president. Scratch that. You will be president. Dad! I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing. No, Dad. I want to get down. This tire is filthy, and the steel belts are poking me. Wheeee! Wheeee!!! No! No! No! No!!! No offense, Homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting. B-But I'm using my whole ass. Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary. Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! But now, I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking. I'm sure he meant to say ""serious drinking."" That's what I assumed. Here's where it all started to go wrong. How'm I supposed to be a good dad when I never had one myself? Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I actually got to meet Santa Claus. Some father... Wait a minute. Dad? This photo is a blessing. It eases my pain. This tonic's caused me nothin' but trouble. You've done all the damage you're gonna do! Aw, nuts. Dad! Son! I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house. No, I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house. You know what? What? We're both screw-ups. It doesn't matter. What matters is you were right when you told me I never said anything nice about you. So are you gonna say something nice now? Well, I hadn't thought that far ahead. Okay, here it goes... I'm not sorry I had you, Son. And I was always proud that you weren't a short man. Aw, Dad. Whaddya say we roll on the grass, son? I'm with you, Dad.","Ralph Wiggum, Mayor Joe Quimby, Kool & the Gang, Paul Harvey, Milhouse Van Houten, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Young Homer, Goony-looking Man, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Onlooker, Kirk Van Houten, Ned Flanders, Vice President Gore, Kids, Maude Flanders, Barney Gumble, Mona Simpson, Colonel Leslie Hapablap, Desk Clerk, Professor Jonathan Frink, John F.
