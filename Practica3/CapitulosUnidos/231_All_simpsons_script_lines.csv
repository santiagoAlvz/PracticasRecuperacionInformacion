227,231,"Oh my, war is terrible. Ahhh... Buzz Cola, the taste you'll kill for. Available in ze lobby! Do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda? I have to go to ze lobby! I'm sorry, but we're not supposed to put butter on the Milk Duds. You're not supposed to go to the bathroom without washing your hands, either. Touch√©. To the top please. Swim, my pretties. Sacre bleu! The deadly poke of Zorro! What? ""N""? What does ""N"" stand for? No, no, it's a ""Z""! I am Zorro! ""Z"" for Zorro! I have come to return King Arthur to the throne! It's a history lesson come to life. No it isn't. It's totally inaccurate-- Quiet, here come the Ninjas. What part of ""stop cutting my dress off"" don't you understand? Ha, ha, ah-- ""S. P.?"" The Scarlet Pimpernel!? We're just, uh, friends. She's lying! Slice her head off! Your honor has been insulted! This will not stand. Ooo, you don't want to get Zorro mad. You're pouring hot butter on my leg! Sh-sh-shh! Sir, I demand satisfaction! I challenge you to a duel. Do you accept, or are you a coward? I... am a coward! Woo! You go, Zorro! I, King Arthur, declare Zorro the new King of England! Yes! From the 'Z' to the 'O' to the double 'R' 'O' / He's the dude in the mask from the bar-ri-o / With his horse and his mask and his big ol' sword / He'll cut your butt from a '52 Ford... Ho, move it, Q-tip. Ha. Why that little... He insulted your honor! Sir, I demand satisfaction. Are you crazy, dude? I challenge you to a duel. The dude is crazy! Will you duel, or are you a coward?! Would a coward do this? Bye! My hero! Uh, uh. ""H"" is for Homer. Thanks, Homer. I told you not to drink all those Frescas before we got in the car. Mother, please! You're embarrassing me. No, I'm not. Seymour needs the toilet! His bladder's full. Full of urine! Yeah, thanks. It's just past the end of the bar, next to the heavyset guy. Heavyset? What's that supposed to mean? All right, take it easy. Take it easy. I'm just saying you ain't no, uh, Tommy Tune. No Tommy Tune, eh? Oh, that's it. You insulted my honor. I-- Your what now? I demand satisfaction! I challenge you to a duel. Hey, a duel? I, ah-- Isn't that a little extreme? Here, here, have a free beer. Really? But you've never given anyone a free beer. Yeah, I ain't never been slapped with no duelin' glove before, either. Wow, a free beer! And I owe it all to a little glove slap. GLOVE SLAP... BABY, GLOVE SLAP... A GLOVE SLAP TO A LITTLE OLD FACE WILL / GET YOU SAT-IS-FAC-TION / GLOVE SLAP BABY... GLOVE SLAP / BABY GLOVE SLAP / GLOVE SLAP / I DON'T TAKE CRAP / GLOVE SLAP / SHUT YOUR BIG YAP...! Coming through... challenge... duel... Hi Lenny... how dare you... demand satisfaction... Suh, your challenge is accepted. Huh? I agree to the duel, suh. I choose pistols at dawn. Pistols at dawn?! Oh, why did I have to slap a guy who says ""suh""? You'll need a will and headstone, aisle six. Aisle six? Duelling at dawn? How did it ever come to this? The National Weather Service says dawn is still scheduled for six-twenty tomorrow, and to please stop calling. Oh, Homer, I bet that southern colonel doesn't even show up. Yeah, he's probably just a big blowhard like you. Sir, that is an insult! I challenge you... What? Oh. Oh, honey, I had the worst nightmare. This glove kept slapping people and I was getting blamed. Suh! I say, suh! The time has come! Oh, no! He's out there, isn't he? I'm afraid so. And his wife's with him. Homer... Hey, I'm not dead yet. Save me, Marge. I saved you! Why don't you have the colonel's wife save you? Oh Marge, that's in the past. Just let it go. Suh, I say, suh, the hour is upon us, suh. Hello, my husband will be right with you. We're just taking this old Christmas tree to the dump. Ah, well now, I wouldn't be much of a southern gentleman if I didn't help you carry that tree... No, no, no, no, you'll get sap on your duelling blouse. Well, at least let me shoot it into smaller pieces for you, madam. Well, it's worth a try don't you-- We're fine, Colonel. Good day. Looks like you were saved by a Christmas tree. And somebody wanted to get rid of it in April. Flanders, you gotta help me. Is there a southern couple parked in front of my house? Oooh, yes indeedy, Homer. Looks like they're settling in for a long stay. I was afraid of that. Well, goodbye, my gentle neighbor. You know, I've always wanted to tell you how mu... To continue talking, please deposit ten cents. Ah, screw it. We can't go back home? Where are we gonna live? Ooh! How 'bout that house? That has people living in it. You can see them through the windows. Lousy show-offs. Look! It's Jimmy Carter! Could you build us a house, President Carter? We can't go back to ours. I'm sorry, these are for the truly needy. Yeah, git yer own habitat. Come on, Carter, build us a house, you lazy bum. You have offended me, suh. I challenge you to-- Come back here! Why, you yellow belly... Come on, move it! Where are we going, Dad? How should I know? Then why are you driving so fast? 'Cause I'm trying to think! What would Zorro do? Zo-rrooo! ""Rural route 9?"" That's it! We can hide out at the farm where I grew up! You mean Grampa's old farm? Yeah, it'll be fun. Fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides... What a dump! Race ya to the swimmin' hole! Com'on, Maw. Bring the young 'uns! There's no leeches! Lots of snakes, though. Holy moly, we can't stay here. It's full of raccoons. Just think of 'em as cats with rabies. Hello, kitty. You little scamp. Are we really gonna live here and grow crops? Absolutely. This is our big chance. The Simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins. I'll dig an outhouse. I'll weed the floor. I'll repress the rage I'm feeling. That's my girl. Let the agriculture begin! All right, let's see what the old girl can do. It doesn't sound very tractor-y. Hang on. And... there. Now we're talkin'! Dad! Go get Lassie. Lassie? I mean Lisa. Oh, you poor little sheep! No one's sheared you for years! All right. Almost done, my little friend. Soon you'll be a nice, cool... RAT?! Well, well, look at the city slicker pullin' up in his fancy German car. This car was made in Guatemala. Well pardon us, Mr. Gucci loafers. I bought these shoes from a hobo. Well la-dee-da, Mr. Park-Avenue manicure. I'm sorry, I believe in good grooming. You're not gonna grow nothin' on the old Simpson place. That's why your daddy abandoned it. Aw, what do you know? Well, I know your soil pH is up around 9.6, and you need it seven to eight, max. Oh, that's just superstition. You watch me. I'll grow something out there. Not if you're plantin' Gummi Bears. Wow, Dad, this is the juiciest watermelon I ever tasted. Yeah, I hope I can grow some like that. What are you planting? Oh, a little bit of everything. Something will thrive in this harsh, merciless soil. And for those who face nature unafraid, it is they who reap the... ah... I'm down. Paw! Move the handbrake... Ohhh, that's heaven. Oh, it's been a month. Why won't anything grow? Maybe it needs more fertilizer. I'm only one man, Marge. Well, it's probably just a bad growing season. Hot diggity! It's up to her eye. Time to harvest, boys! Nice work, Petunia. Here you go. Oh, who am I kidding? I'm no farmer. Well, if it isn't Mr. Salad Fork. You couldn't grow stink on a monkey. Leave me alone, you big bully. Oh, I'm just razzin' ya. It's my way. Here, have an ear on me. More tumbleweed, Lisa? No thanks. I'm still finishing my thistles. Dad, if we leave for town right now, we can catch the dinner special at Krusty-Burger. Sorry, boy. Going back to Springfield would be a coward's way out. Wasn't skipping town in the first place a coward's way out? Oh, you're right. I'm a coward. I've made such a mess of things. If only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow... Wait a minute. Plutonium?! Gee, Homer, isn't that kinda risky?... Yeah, I guess you're right. It's not. Hey Lenny, you sendin' some outgoing mail? You know it. I'll probably send some tomorrow. I hear that. Easy... careful... steady... Time to give Mother Nature a little goose. Well, Marge, have you ever seen a field glow like that? It's eerily beautiful, but are you sure this is safe? Of course not. But you know something? Sometimes you have to break the rules to free your heart. You got that from a movie poster! Well, when there's nothing left to believe in, believe in hope. Where'd you get that? From the producers of ""Waiting to Exhale."" Is that plutonium on your gums? Shut up and kiss me. Wake up, honey! It's time to harvest our radioactive supercrop! But it's only been one night. That's all it takes. If we learned one thing from ""The Amazing Colossal Man,"" and ""Grasshopperus,"" it's that radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast. Yeah, but didn't Grasshopperus kill Chad Everett? Only 'cause he tried to reason with him. Oh. Brace yourselves, everybody. You're about to see the hugest, juiciest, possibly super-intelligent vegetables man has ever known. You might want to crane your necks upward now to save time. Ta-da! All right, now don't panic. It's possible the giant vegetables are invisible. Ah-ha! Oh... Where are you? Oh, honey, give it up. Oh, you're right. This farm's hopeless. Why didn't I listen to those inbred hicks? I guess I'll just go hang myself in the barn. Homer, no! Let 'im go, Mom. Wait, Dad, you don't have to kill yourself. This better be good. Something's growing. A sprout! And there's some more! What is it? Carrots? Peas? Maybe it's okra. Who cares what it is? It's growing! I've saved the farm! Look at my babies. This tomato will be Heinz ketchup. And this to-mah-to will be Hunt's catsup. Bup, no fighting, boys. Bleh! Tastes like cigarette butts. That's odd. The outside looks like a tomato, but the inside is brown. Maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds. Oh, great. I got a field full of mutants. Gimme! I want more! I thought you said it tasted terrible. It does. But it's smooth and mild. And refreshingly addictive. Addictive, eh? ""ToMacco?"" That's pretty clever, Dad. I mean, for a product that's evil and deadly. Aw, thanks honey. Well, I'm not crazy about the plutonium or nicotine, but it is very nice to see Bart eating his vegetables. Excuse me, Mr. Farmer man. I promised my son he could tip over his first cow, and I... ""ToMacco?"" Yes, it's the latest craze. Try some, won't you? Go ahead, Ralphie. The stranger is offering you a treat. Mmm... Oh Daddy, this tastes like Grandma. Holy Moses, it does taste like Grandma. I want more. Yeah, me too. We'll take a bushel or a peck or just, just give it to me. Can I interest you in a mincemeat pie? There very... Does it have tomacco in it? No, but I use only the fre... Pass. I was here first! / C'mon, c'mon people! Don't push. There's plenty of tomacco for everyone. Have your cash or food stamps ready! Don't forget your mincemeat pie! You're scaring the customers, honey. Hello, folks. Would you and your family like to take a ride with us? Okay. Meet the Laramie cigarette team. This is Mindy, J.P. and Emile. Homer, we're in a bit of a pickle. Kids are crazy about tobacco, but the politicians won't let us sell it to them. Those dirty rotten... Tell me about it. But there's no law against selling kids tomacco. That little ""M"" is worth a lot of money to us... and to you. How much? Well, let's say a hundred... ... and fifty... ... million dollars. One hundred and... May I speak to my family for a moment? Did you see the way Emile's lookin' at Mindy? Hoo-hoo, I think something's going on there. Shouldn't we be talking about the hundred and fifty million dollar offer? Oh, yeah. Let's take it. Dad, it's a tobacco company. They make billions off the suffering and deaths of others. She's right, Dad. They can afford a lot more. No, I... I'm with Lisa. Let's take 'em to the cleaners. We all agree that a hundred and fifty million is an insult. The least we can accept is a hundred and fifty billion. They'll be back. We control the world's supply of tomacco and no one can take that away from... Stop eating our future! Get the... get outta... bad animals! Go home! Thank God, there's one left! Look, a flying saucer! There, there. We had quite a scare today. But you're gonna make us millions. Yes you are. You're about to launch a terrible evil on the world. You've gotta destroy this plant. I know, honey. But what can I do, as an individual? I wouldn't know where to begin. Just burn that plant right now and end this madness. I wish I could make a difference, Lisa, but I'm just one man. I agree, but how? They're after the tomacco! Now you can't tell me nicotine's not addictive. Lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is... Tomaaaccohhhh! Give them the plant, Homer! No, I'd rather die! Take it! Well! What a lovely gift. Gotta run! So, Mindy? How did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million? Cash'll be okay! Or stock? Does your company have stock? Mindy? Mindy and I are just hammering out a payment plan. We'll talk Monday! Hey, props to Mindy on the grab. Booya! Guys, we seem to be carrying a little extra weight. Don't look at me, I'm on Sugar Busters. I've never been so glad to be home. I don't know why we ever left in the first place. Five! Six! Seven! Eight, I say, eight! Nine! Aaannnd ten-- What is that intoxicatin' aroma? Could that be, I say, could that be mincemeat pie? It certainly is. Why don't you put down your gun and have a slice? I don't mind if I do. Hey, are we duellin' or what? Oh, where are my manners? You okay, Dad? I think so. The bone stopped the bullet. Dad, this might be one of those things you should go to the hospital for. After pie.
