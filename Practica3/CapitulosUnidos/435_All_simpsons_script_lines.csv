430,435,"...And so, in summary...There are only two real commandments, and the other eight are just ""filler"". And now, I have some exciting news. Tomorrow we'll be blessed with a visit from the highest ranking clergyman of our Presby-Lutheran faith, His Holiness... the Parson. The Parson?! He's coming here? Oh my God, she fainted! Let's go get smelling salts! Suckers! Springfielders have camped out all night to get a glimpse of the most saintly person to visit our town since Mother Teresa stopped here to gas up her Vespa. And I'm sellin' all sorts of faith-based knick-knacks. Let's take a look. I'd commit arson for the Parson, clergymen can kiss my apse, all kindsa gems. Surprisingly, none of them have sold. Except for this one. There you have it -- news has never been softer. What's that? The parson is here! Oh, my God! It's him! The earthly embodiment of the Elected Chair of the National Congress of Deacons! Well, well, well, hello, everybody. Oh, I hope you didn't go to all this trouble for little ol' me. Parson! Parson! Give us a quick official church position on family. Well, in these modern times, family is more important than ever. You just made my moustache tingle! Settle. Settle down. Now, now, I am just a man like any other that has been chosen by God. I have come here from our world spiritual headquarters in Michigan City, Indiana to say: keep up the good work! And now if you'll excuse me, I'll do a little speakin' with your deacon. I LOVE TO GO TO CHURCH / IT'S WHERE I LIKE TO BE / I GET A DAY-IN OF PRAY-IN' / AND STILL TEE OFF BY THREE... Oh, calm down, Tim. He's just your old roommate from Texas Christian. He's like the Pope of this thing! This would be like Mary Kay visiting you when you were selling her cosmetics. That is, if you had stuck with it. You asked me to quit because I was making more than you! Not now, he's here. Welcome, Your Holiness. You'll love what we've done with the church. There's fresh wax on all the pews. Oh, sounds to me like somebody put on more than just one coat. Maybe. Tim, um... is there somewhere that we can talk? Of course, my office. Perfect. WALKIN' TO YOUR OFFICE / IS WHAT I LIKE TO DO / MAYBE WHILE WE'RE AT IT / WE'LL PEEK IN AT YOUR PEWS... 'Nilla wafer? I'll take two if you don't mind. Tim, I'm here because of a problem with your last re-certification. When we tried to charge the filing fee to your credit card, it was declined. Oh, yeah, the bank put on a security hold after they saw a charge from an ""Offshore Poker Club."" Helen had bought a fireplace poker from Nova Scotia. She says it shifts logs better than American pokers, but I disagree. We'll get through it. We always do. Well, love conquers all, huh? I remember when she was Helen Schwarzbaum. In fact, I remember when she was Harold Schwarzbaum. You what? I've said too much. But, for the three months it took your card to go through, you weren't certified. Anything you officiated during that time: funerals, baptisms, even bingo... well, it just didn't count. Oh, well, I'm sure the Lord is understanding... No he's not. I'll notify those affected right away. Tea time! What's going on? Helen, I was briefly uncertified. So all those ""Graces"" you said were... a lie?! That food might as well have been regurgitated by Satan himself. REGURGITATED BY SATAN / HE COULDN'T KEEP IT DOWN / OL' SIX-SIX-SIX, HE GOT SICK, SICK, SICK / AND THAT'S HOW VOLCANOES WERE BORN... Due to a bureaucratic snafu, I wasn't an official minister when we laid your dear Estelle to rest. So... she's still alive? I'm afraid not. Good. 'Cause I left her ashes on the bus. So, Captain. When I blessed your vessel, it didn't count. Maybe the next one. ...So I'm afraid I wasn't a minister when I blessed your tin-roof shanty. So that's why that ghost keeps a-comin' to the winder! Afternoon. Fly away, ghosty! Go back to your haunted cornfield! Reverend Lovejoy? You deliver pizza now? But we didn't order a pizza. But you forgot the pizza anyway. Marge, the pizza place screwed up again. Do you remember when I remarried you two after Homer got that divorce? Like it was yesterday... Kirk and Luann split up... So Homer, fearing we would do the same, preemptively filed for divorce... But then you remarried us, and we were as solid as ever. And I think Apu got lucky with my sister. Well, I'm afraid that joyous occasion fell during a time when I wasn't actually a minister. Uh, since that time, you two have not been legally wed. You don't get it, Padre. My old lady and I have a thing goin' on. We don't need a piece of paper to keep it real. Who are you calling an old lady? I need that paper quick! So you and Mom aren't married? Does that mean I'm a bastard? You were born while they were married so legally, no. But in the sense someone calls you one when they're angry, yes. It's not a big deal. We'll just go to City Hall and get married there. I think it's romantic. You can pretend you're newlyweds starting a life together. Yeah, instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock. Why you little bastard... That's the angry one. This isn't the most romantic place to get married. Sweetie, any place I'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world. Watch your back! Half a corpse comin' through! Marge, this time I'm going to give you the wedding you deserve. Let's get out of here! Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's the line to get out. Hello? Hello. It's me, Lance Romance. Your first mission is to look out the window. Whatever you say, ""Lance."" This is Bill and Marty saying ""Marge, go down to the basement""! Homer, what's going on? The violin, pants with a crease, why? Marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. So -- will you marry me -- in style? Oh yes, Homer! Yes! Did you hear that, Santa? She said yes! Yes! Now, back to your cold, airless tomb. Ho-ho-ho. Oh, it's beautiful. But that's an awful lot to pay for a dress I'll only wear once. Marge, a woman only gets one chance at a second re-marriage. The choice is yours: you can look like a fairy princess, or a pig wrapped in rags. Uh... a princess? Fine. We'll do it your way. This one's a little gay, isn't it? Well, the last time I checked, pirates weren't gay. How'd you check?! Check out this rocket ship cake, Marge. That's for a child's birthday. We're going to get this one. Maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake. And that would be a big surprise because I'd forget about it pretty quick. No rockets! You can pick the frosting. Chocolate. We'll take lemon. Okay, I want white roses at the altar, red roses along the aisle, and blue roses in the centerpieces. There are no blue roses. I want to talk to Howard. Howard died ten years ago. Well, did he take all the blue roses with him? My father was a lovely man. He took very good care of my mother and me. All right, people, I want every table to have two baskets of bread but only one plate of butter -- that will stimulate conversation. What if we... There is no ""we"" in wedding! But there is, Marge! The first two letters... I can't believe you're ruining the second Thursday before the wedding! I can't believe you told Lenny and Carl they could bring dates! 'Cause they're not even coming to the wedding! Why not? Because their R.S.V.P. cards arrived one day after the deadline! Marge, uh, maybe you should take a break from wedding planning. I think you're becoming a... Bridezilla. Bridezilla? A combination of bride and Godzilla? How could you say that? More like you're a... King Wrong! No matter what I do, Marge yells at me. If she's like this now, what will she be like after we get married? Okay, okay, everyone back off! I want to see myself. A pimple! Not on my day you don't! Okay, it's go time. Dim the lights. Cue the band. And... release the groom. Homer, that's you! We are now eleven seconds behind schedule! Homie? I can't believe Homer left me at the altar. Oh, Marge, have a shrimp puff... Wipe your tears with a monogrammed napkin... I know it is hard, but smile for the cameraman from Gary's Magic Moments. You have my deepest sympathy. What's going on? What's with all the darkness? Hello? Marge! Where am I? What the? I'm chained up like a common bicycle! Who would do this to me?! It would have to be someone who could afford a chain. You're going to be here a while. But I have to marry Marge! As of now, your pathetic little life means nothing. Just so you know, you're making a pretty bad first impression. It's all my fault: Homer wanted to serve those little cocktail hot dogs. But no. I had to have spring rolls! They taste like nothing! I don't understand. Dad would never miss an open bar with chicken wings. Plus he loves Mom, and us, yada, yada, yada. Hey, I found something! Sideshow Bob! He ruined the wedding -- getting his revenge on us at last! Because he knows that if Mom and Dad don't get married, I'll never be born! I got some wedding registry items for Mrs. Simpson. I'm afraid I'm just... Ms. Simpson now. Interesting nuance. I'd like to hear more about it, but uh, company policy forbids chitchat. I miss you so much. To remove that chain, you need the key to the lock. You idiot! How am I ever going to find the key to the... ooh, here it is! To get the key I have to lick through a lollipop? Oh, how awful. What the? The lollipop is made of hot sauce. Whose side are you on? Sideshow Bob! Drop that knife and give back our Dad! I'm working on a bust of Krusty and using this knife to aerate the clay. Anyone for peppermint tea? Not for me, but the monkey needs to keep his strength up. We're gonna drop him out of a blimp tomorrow and see what happens. Oh, don't worry. Nothing's gonna happen to you, Mr. Teeny Number Seven. Bob, did you take any breaks yesterday... to kidnap our dad? Impossible. I was with Bob the whole day. Then we watched the deluxe DVD of ""The House of Sand and Fog."" At night we slept in the same bed for warmth. Then we woke up, had a little nosh, watched ""The House of Sand and Fog"" again with commentary... The director was an ass. Fine. But how do you explain this? Nice of you to think of me. However, ""SB"" could be anyone -- Scott Baio, the Sultan of Brunei, the former Polish secret police, the Służba Bezpieczeństwa... Or... Malge! Ahmiss oo. Ahmiss oo so mug... Wait'll he finds out the key isn't a key, but just a hotter sauce. I'm gonna say this for the last time: Bart, if this is one of your pranks, very funny. Maybe we should let him out soon. Not till Marge dumps him for good. Hey, Lame-o! Ready for some... ...fun with fire ants? What's fun about fire ants? They're-- Oh, you're being sarcastic. Wow, you're the smartest guy in that room. Thank you, that's very... More sarcasm. Just see that my fiancée Marge gets this -- my wedding vows. Marge, I hope this day is as perfect for you, as the day we met was for me. You always find the one grain of sugar in the salt shaker that is I. With each marriage I get a little better -- maybe after a thousand, I'll be worthy of you. I miss you. I miss the kids. God help me, I even miss your sisters. Poor guy! / He loves her so much! Excuse me! But, I have been waiting forty-five minutes for you to slide my license over to me. Closed! Okay, you are hereby banned from my store. You will have to shop at the Kwik-E-Mart across the street from me. You know, the much nicer, much newer one. Good day to you! Mom! Mom! We know where Dad is! He's right here. I'm not sure what happened. I was kidnapped, then tortured, then I fell into a surprisingly sound sleep. When I awoke, I felt refreshed. Then I was blindfolded, and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn. I'm just happy you're back. Now let's get that chain off you. Won't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath? Oh, I've missed your nonsense. Now there's no evidence to tie us to the kidnapping. And we've got a one-year lease on that torture room, so maybe we can put a tanning bed in there. We know it was you Selma Bouvier. Would you kids like cookies? Let your Auntie Patty make some cookies. We don't want your cookies. What she means is, we'll eat your cookies later. If you don't want us to tell our Mom what you did, you're gonna have to pay. Pay? Pay for what? Ask her, she's the brains. I'm the thing that's not brains. And with the inking and application of this stamp, you are officially married. Next! I'm sorry, honey. I wanted so badly to give you a fancy wedding. Homer, one thing I've learned is that you don't need a fancy wedding when you're marrying the man you love. Just what I always wanted. A rocket ship wedding cake -- just what I always wanted! We emptied our 401Ks for this?! Blue roses! Yes. It took a lot of frantic genetic engineering, but enjoy. No. You're a plant now.","Santa Claus, Security Guard, City Clerk, Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon, Coroner, Marge Simpson, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Kent Brockman, Helen Lovejoy, Homer Simpson, Tux Salesman, Lisa Simpson, Parson, Florist, Cookie Kwan, Lenny Leonard, Videographer, Rev.
