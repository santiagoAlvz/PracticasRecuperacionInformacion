263,267,"Ice cream at church? I'm intrigued, yet suspicious. Wow, look at all these flavors: Blessed Virgin Berry... Command-Mint... Biblegum... Or, if you prefer, we also have Unitarian ice cream. There's nothing here. Exactly. One Tower of Babel, and build it to Heaven. To Heaven! Christ be with you. Mmm, hi, mm... I've created the first intra-bovine ice cream maker. It makes use of all four stomachs, the first being filled with rock salt, then sugar, cream and of course, freon, so cold it burns me. I'll have the darkety kind. Ah, one chocolate, Mootilda! Could I have a swirl of chocolate and vanilla? Oh, nonsense. You can do it. Ivan Reitman! I've never seen a brain freeze this bad! Give me fifty CC's of hot fudge, stat. Hold still. You're gonna feel a slight chocolatey sensation. All right. Let's welcome this evening's entertainment. They call her the Christian Madonna... Rachel Jordan. JESUS LOVES ME, THIS I'M SURE / I'M A GROUPIE ON HIS TOUR / I FOLLOW HIM FROM GIG TO GIG / I KNOW SOMEDAY WE'LL MAKE IT BIG. Rachel Jordan? Isn't that the woman you had a crush on, Ned? I didn't have a ""crush"" on her. Are you blushing, Mr. Flanders? No, I'm not! Leave Ned alone. Thank you, Homer. He can't admit he likes her till he's sure she likes him back. And there's only one way to find out. Does -- Rachel -- like -- Ned? It says I have cooties. Flanders has cooties, Flanders has cooties. That was great. I can't believe she found a rhyme for Hezekiah. Hey, she's coming this way! I thought you didn't like her. Ned Flanders? Now where have you been hi-diddily hiding? Uh, uh, huh, oh, hey, Rachel. W-Well what do you know? We both like plain vanilla with nothing on it. Actually, all the toppings were gone. Ants are crawling in my mouth and I don't care. So, uh, uh, where's your band? They switched from Christian music to regular pop. All you do is change ""Jesus"" to ""baby."" Oh, how horrible! Eh, they'll all go to hell. Say how's your life going? Ooh, she wants to know how your life is going. Well, my wife's passing was rough, but I think I'm finally ready to move on. That's great. Maybe we could have coffee sometime. Ohh, she wants to have coffee sometime. I can hear her, Homer. He can hear you, Rachel. I'd love to get together, but tomorrow I've got lifeguard duty at the baptismal pool. Okay, well maybe another time. You know, I better go check into my hotel. Hotel? Why don't you just stay at Ned's place? My place? What would the neighbors think? We're the neighbors, and we don't think. Ned, I understand if you feel uncomfortable. You're still getting over your wife. Now wait just a Maude-gone minute, here. I'm through living in the past, and you can see for yourself. Well, you've certainly got a theme going. All right, I'll take the couch and you can have my room. Oh, ah, c-c-could you sleep on my side? I-I'm trying to preserve Maude's indentation. Sorry. Ohh, no problem. A little starch will fix her right up. Cold, huh? This should keep you toasty. How 'bout that? It says Maude. Mmm... I love chenille, don't you? I don't love it, I don't hate it. Mm. Well, goodnight, Maude. I mean, Maude. I mean, Rachel. I mean, Maude. Oh my God! You're trying to make me look like your dead wife! No, n-n-no I know this is a-a-a tad unseemly, but if you'd just let me even out the back... I'm calling a cab. Goodbye, Ned. Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not over Maude at all. Yeah, maybe it was too soon. Well, aren't you gonna invite me in? I sure appreciate you folks offering to go through Maude's things. If it were up to me, I wouldn't throw anything away. Oh, don't you worry. We'll make all the hard decisions so you don't have to. We can take whatever we want, right? Yea-- What? Don't listen to him. You just have a good time at the eye doctor. Always do. Say bye, Mr. Flanders. Bye, Mr. Flanders. Poor Ned. He can't look anywhere without being reminded of Maude. Yeah, a lifetime of memories. Homer, don't you have any respect? Sure, of course I do, but life goes on, ashes to ashes, turn, turn, turn, long live rock, and so forth. Don't throw this away. It's Rod's first tooth. You're right. We could use this for witchcraft. Wow, three pairs of shoes. Someone had a fetish. Man, this is taking forever. I know how to speed things up. Her pillow's stuck. Oh my. The room looks so bare. Are you okay, Ned? Yeah, just a little shocked. What's that? Some kinda sorting machine? Kinda. Now for the awkward part. We gotta talk about money. You said we were doing this out of friendship. What? That doesn't sound like me. Hey, Dad, something didn't get, um, ""sorted"". Maude's old sketch book. She was quite the little artist, you know. Ahh... Is that a fact? And you think you know someone. Here's our house... a rainbow... a white hand shaking a black hand... Praiseland? Rides, food, a tithing pond. It looks like an amusement park. You're right. Maude designed a Christian amusement park. Oh, it must have been her final dream. Hey, how 'bout that? Let's build it for her, Daddy. Ohhh, that's a nice thought, Toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles... But Mommy wanted it. But where do you put something that big? You could fix up the old Storytime Village. They've been out of business ever since that kid got his head cut off. Mm. That sounds perfect! Well, what the heck. Who's ready to build an amusement park? Sell Storytime Village?! Why, you gotta be off your tuffet! Well, it's been closed for so long... and-and I thought I could turn it into a Christian theme park. Christian, eh? Wellll, that's different. Now the thing is, I don't have a lot of money... Then what the hell good are you?! Beat it, ya hippie! But I... You're right, that was harsh. Tell you what, maybe I could donate the park, as a tax write-off. If you could do that, I'd make this place a shining beacon for the Lord. Oh, you are so full of it! God's grace, that is. It's really sickening...there aren't more people like you. Now get out...your pen and we'll make it official. Oh, bless you, sir. Ah, Gipetto's workshop will make a great stable for the nativity scene. You're doing that the sucker way. Try a little vitamin G. Are you nuts? Relax. It's a ""controlled burn""... Uh-oh. Darn teenagers with their beer bottles. Uh, yeah, teenagers. Ned, I'm worried about you. You've been working non-stop for the past week. Well, it's been a tad harder than I thought, but I'm not complaining 'cause I work for a sweet, sweet, boss. You're our foreman, Maude. She's still bossing you around from beyond the grave? Can they do that? Oh, I don't mind, but my greenback stack's gettin' kinda slack. How about asking the community for donations? Ohhh, I'm not very good at begging people for stuff. I am. I'd be glad to spearhead the entire begging initiative. Well thanks, Homer. No problem. I'll need a sack and something sharp. Well, I guess I could donate these costumes. They're from my Last Supper Pie Throwing sketch. You can have these, ah, fireworks I confiscated. Some Chinese people claimed they were celebrating New Year's in February. Oh yeah, those guys and their crazy scams. Good food though. This sawdust will soak up the puke from the rooller-cooster. It's Willie's special blend. Do I detect a hint of cinnamon? Oh, I'll never tell. Praiseland Amusement Park has its Grand Opening today. We now go live to its founder, Mr. Nedward Flanders. Morning, Kent. Our volunteers have done an amazing job getting the park ready here. We're gonna show Springfield that faith and devotion are the wildest thrill rides of all. All right, I hear the Mayor's arriving for the ribbon-cutting. It is with uh great pride that I dedicate this new school, sports arena or attraction. Well, Maude, your dream has finally come true. Halt! Who dares to disturb King David? Silence! You have invaded the chamber where I wrote all of my one hundred fifty psalms. I hope you enjoy hearing them all. Number one: ""Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked..."" What do you hit 'em with? There's no mallet! You can stop Satan with your faith. My face? You callin' me ugly? No, no, no, no, no, I think you're beautiful. Oh, that's it. Ohh, what can I get you, little Christian? How 'bout a Noah's Ark of Jellies? Oh, are there two of every flavor? Nope, they're all the same. Plain. How 'bout a Maude mask? I'm Maude. God is super! Can I sit in the car? Let's both sit in the car. Bye bye. A Bible park without beer? Now I've seen everything. And this candy is sub-par. Any religion that embraces carob is, uh, not for Carl Carlson. Oh, hey, get outta the way, pal. You're blocking the exit. Ohhh, you want me to stamp your hand so you can get back in? Don't you dare! Bye, everybody! What a rip-off! It ain't even worth torchin'! Whoa! Where's everyone going? What's wrong? This place is the height of tedium. Yarrr, she blows. Oh, Maude, I turned your dream of a Christian amusement park into a bemusement park. Don't say that, Ned! It is! It's a bemusement park! I'm sorry, sweetheart. Oh, please don't look at me like that. It's a miracle! It's almost like she's alive again. What's that, floating mask? Y-You want me to shoot everyone? Naw, I'm just screwin' with ya. I-It's a miracle. This is fantastic. I've never been so close to rubbing my eyes in disbelief. Oh, what the heck. Huh? Huh? I think it's a sign from God that we should all go nuts. What is wrong with you? Go get that! Yes, ma'am. Well, looks like our phenomenon is actually a phenomenot. Because when you look at it rationally... Hakala makta towhoo abowhoo. He's speaking in tongues! Oh, knock it off, Seymour! Go find that boy with my purse. It was incredible, I saw heaven! But it wasn't clouds and angels playing harps like at the end of so many Three Stooges shorts. It was a golden elementary school, with a teacher's lounge that stretched as far as the eye could see. And no one was ever tardy. Was I there? No! It was heaven! My vision of heaven! / Oh, really? Oh, truly this was the will of Maude. Hey, I want the Maude statue to give me a vision. Yeah, I wanna hallucinate too! I'm sorry, the ticket price doesn't cover visions, miracles, or other Godly hoo-hah. Yeah, folks, the power of Christ compels you to give Ned an extra ten bucks. Homer, no! I can't exploit a divine manifestation. Oh, why not? Everybody's doin' it. You could give the money to the orphanage. I hear they need a new wall. Thwee is not enough. Maude, it's Disco Stu. Lay some heaven on me, foxy dead chick. Oh, Disco Stu! Right this way. But, hey, Saint Peter. You said, like, you was full. Oh yeah. Aw jeez. Frank Sinatra! For me, dis is hell. Ya dig, pally? Who's next? That would be me. Thank you, sonny. Ooh... My chair! It's got... a mind... of its own! Help me, Mister Spock! Shazbot! My Captain is in peril! You saved the Captain's life. I want to make out with you. And so do Catwoman and Agent 99. How come everybody's having visions, Daddy? Oh, there's no explaining God's will, Roddy. That's like explaining how an airplane flies. Stupid grill! Why won't you light? The gas is on full blast! You better stick your head in and see what's going on. Good idea. No, Dad! I think there's a leak in the line. Leak in the line? Oh, no! This isn't a devine miracle. Everyone's just gettin' goofy from the gas. Ah, ah, folks, I've just discovered something about this statue that uh, may disappoint you. You see... What is it, Mr. Fwanders? Is something wrong with the miracle? Will there still be money for the orphans? Hello, Gas Company? How poisonous is your gas?... Wow. But-- Eh, but I'm talkin', you know, about outdoors with plenty of ventilation that... How could that be worse?... Okay, permanent brain damage, or just temporary?... I see. I've gotta close Praiseland down. Someone could get hurt. Could get hurt. Could. There's a chance they won't. Ned, Praiseland has touched an entire town with its inspiring message and toxic super-freakouts. Look at those smiling faces. Rich laughing with poor... Bullies breaking bread with nerds... Orphans lighting candles over a leaking gas line... Lighting candles! Nooo!!! I can't feel my wegs. I taste blood. Adults attacking orphans? I don't think Maude Flanders would approve of that! Absolutely not! / Never! / No friggin' way! Yeah, this place is more like Craze-land! Instead of Praise-land. Ohh. / I see. / It's a play on words. May the Lord have mercy on your gas sniffin', orphan beatin', soul. Christ be with you. Hey, Ned! I just read about your park in that horrible Triple-A magazine. Ooo, Ned, look who's here. It's that girl you don't like... not! That man is so childish. Hey, your hair's grown back real nice. It's a wig. And lets never speak of it again. So what happened here? How 'bout I explain it to you over a cup of coffee. That is, if you're willing to give me another shot. Are you sure you want to do this, Ned? I'm sure. So, how 'bout a movie tomorrow night? Sounds great. I think Ned is gonna be all right...","Ralph Wiggum, Mayor Joe Quimby, Carl Carlson, Uhura, Chief Wiggum, Rachel Jordan, Frank Sinatra, Milhouse Van Houten, John Travolta, Agnes Skinner, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Captain Kirk, Kent Brockman, Crowd, Homer Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Gary Chalmers, Seymour Skinner, Sideshow Mel, Groundskeeper Willie, Krusty the Clown, Lenny Leonard, Rev.
