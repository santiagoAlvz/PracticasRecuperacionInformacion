277,281,"Aha! A free baseball. A shiny new dime! A shinier new dime! Excuse me, my refrigeration unit is broken. Could you possibly eat some free ice cream? What flavor? Why, super chocolate, of course. Oh yes. This day just keeps getting better and better. And here's a new four-legged friend for me. Hiya boy. Haven't seen you around here before. Mom, a dog ate my clothes! Nice try. But we're still going to ""Riverdance"". You know that new baby brother Ralph's been bragging about? It's just a pinecone. Let's go where it's quiet. Help! Isn't that your brother? I said ""let's go"". Eh, I'm sick of this Tarzan movie. Dad, it's a documentary on the homeless. Oh, right. A crazy dog's trying to kill me! Really? Ooh, this I gotta see. Oh, he just wants to make friends. Ooh, who's a good dog? What a goody doggie! Oh what dee de bobo! Echee chee googie! So Bart, when does the killing start? He's a good doggie! Ooh it-it ooh googie googie! Look Bart, sometimes dogs, or people, hate you for no reason. Bart's a goner. Anyone want to be my new best friend? I will. Great. Finally, I'll be the dominant one. Be quiet. Yes, sir. Ha ha! Bart's family is poor! Hurry up, Bart, or you'll be late to be killed by the dog. What? I said you'll be late for school. Eat my short stories! Whew. Safe at last. Now I'll just turn around and confirm that safety. Hey, wait a minute. These animals are stuffed. Ow! Except that one. Don't worry about these critters. They're just props from my movies. This one's from ""Gunfight at the Museum of Natural History."" You were in movies? Hold onto your hat, son. You're talkin' to Buck McCoy. Who? Yeah, that's right. Buck McCoy. The most famous movie cowboy in the world. No kiddin'. Anyway, I climbed over your gate. A dog was after me. I'll show you a trick that you can use on dogs. Also worked on David O. Selznick. Who? Yeah, that's right. The David O. Selznick. Keep him away from me. Trust me, son. You'll be fine. Now, lean down and put your arms across his neck. Whoa, it worked! Where did you learn that? Ah, you pick things up. Do you know how to catch a wild boar with a teaspoon? No. Well what do you kids do all day? Well, right now, I'm supposed to be in school. School? Huh, why bother? I quit after fourth grade and I ain't not no un-dummy. It's like you're living in a steakhouse! Why thank you! Most people just mutter that. Is that horse vacuuming? If you can call it that. He soils as much as he cleans. Frank the Wonder Horse was in twenty-four of my pictures. And directed one. And he got the ""film by"" credit. Five o'clock? I better get home for dinner. Well, come back anytime, pardner. To the laundry room! Yee-ha. Here we are. Hi, honey. Where's that vicious dog? I made him a biscuit. Oh, he's not bothering me any more. Buck McCoy helped me. Buck McCoy? He was the greatest of them all. He was bigger than opium! I met one of my heroes today. She started the f-- Buck McCoy! I still carry this. Junior Buckaroo 2nd Class. Little Grampa Simpson. Cool. After that, I starred in ""Wyatt Earp Meets the Mummy,"" then ""Six Brides for Seven Brothers..."" They were pictures that the whole family could enjoy. No drugs, no nudity, no cussin'. Just drinkin', fightin' and trippin' horses with wires. What's this lunchbox made of? Well back in my day we had a thing called metal. Everything was made of it. Lunchboxes, cars, you name it. Met-tal. Hey, can you still do cowboy tricks? Here's one I did in ""The Wild Lunch"". Everything tastes better when it's lassoed. Would you lasso me a banana? Now how the hell would I do that? I guess you're not going to have an adventure this week. Just you wait! Hey boy, where'd you get that hat? Buck gave it to me. He's just about the greatest guy who ever lived. I wanna grow up to be just like him. No kidding? Hey, speaking of achievers, they're thinking of spraying your old man's work space for ticks. That's great, champ. I know you've been wantin' that. Well, gotta mosey. Homer. Ma'am. Bart sure is fond of that cow gentleman. It's just not fair. This Buck fella's had all the advantages --horse-riding lessons, the finest makeup, delicious studio food... Aw, Homie, you'll always be my western hero. Swell. I can't wait till I get good. Buck's here! Dad, why are you wearing that? Because I want to be your hero. On top of which I don't look bald. Thanks for coming, Mr. McCoy. We cooked your favorites: rattleJailbird meat, varmint kabobs, and refried whiskey. I like the sound of that last one. Don't listen to 'em, Buck. It's an ambush. They're trying to jump your claim! Take him outside. I love you, Buuuck! Gee Buck, your old films are as violent as today's! One of the wheels broke off my chair today. But I didn't make a movie about it. In the '50s, I did a TV show. It only lasted a year, but we did three hundred and sixty episodes. All of them great. I did the commercials myself. Remember kids, Drunken Cowboy Brand Whiskey is smooth as milk. I'm not sure I approve of selling whiskey to children. Well, that ad was aimed at children who were already heavy drinkers. Oh. Tonight's episode: ""'Scuse Me While I Kill The Sky."" Why are you driving a car? Yeah, in the seventies, westerns were out and detective shows were in. It seems like all I did was shoot hippies. They wrote me out of the show and it became Room 222. So that's how you ended your career? Yeah, well what can you do? The western went the way of the evening newspaper and polio. Well, I think westerns are due for a comeback. Yeah, we can have showdowns at the schoolyard and use nerds as Indians! Bart, you look so cool. I was thinkin' this could be A new fad. What about Hawaiian shirts? Hey, you're not fun, you're fat. Now, listen up. When I come back tomorrow you'd better have cowboy suits. And they'd better be adorable. This is Kent Brockman, here at Springfield Elementary where a new Western ""craze"" is sweeping the campus. I'm Annie Oakley! I'm Kevin Costner in one of his western roles! I'm a gulch! So I guess you could say this barely qualifies as news. I'm Kent Brockman. OH, GIVE ME LAND, LOTS OF LAND / UNDER STARRY SKIES ABOVE... DON'T FENCE ME IN... SIR YOU CANNOT PEE / UNLESS YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE... CAN'T KEEP IT IN... Krusty, how do you feel about putting Buck McCoy on your show? Pass. We also represent Billy Joel. Who's the first one again? Buck McCoy. Forget it. I'm not putting some western star on, just 'cause it's the flavor of the month. I want my show to have a timeless quality. Here's your hanging chad sketch, Krusty. Oh, good, you worked in Judge Ito. Please put Buck on. He's my hero. Plus he'll work for scale. Scale minus ten. I ain't going on some clown show. I'm retired. No one expects you to do anything difficult. They understand you're too old. Listen, missy. The last two city-slickers who used reverse psychology on me are pushing up daisies. They're dead? No, they've just got lousy jobs. You know what? I bet he can't even fit into his old costume. I can't, eh? You two wait right here. Let's see, Texas or Massachusetts? Texas. I like the way you think. Boy, that's some fancy shootin'. I've seen fancier. Oooh, right in the Panhandle! Write that down. Buck, this is a real honor. I grew up watching your horse operas down at the Bijou. Yeah, things sure have changed since the '50s. I don't care. You know, it's been a long time since I performed live. You'll do fine. Just remember there'll be millions of people watching you. Millions! And TV Guide's ""Cheers and Jeers"" editor. And he's already given out all his ""Cheers."" Live, from the corner of Zany Avenue and Martin Luther King Boulevard, it's the Krusty the Clown show. With special guest Buck McCoy. And now, here's Krusty! We've got such a great show tonight. I won't be doing a monologue, because my feet hurt. And now, our opening sketch. We don't take kindly to transvestite chimpanzees here in Pine Corners. No one can save you now. I said, ""no one can save you now."" Shut up, I'm comin'. Oh, like you're so perfect with your plastic mane and your painted-on spot. What's real on you? Nothin'! He's drunk! I've seen drunker. Oh right, yeah, the guns. We're free! These hilarious health professionals will cut me out of my clothes after this commercial. What happened, Buck? Did I forget to mention I'm an alcoholic? For shame! Oh, this is horrible. My spit-takes all have blood in 'em. Look, I'm really sorry. Sorry don't suture my colon. And you're off my show forever! Bart, I couldn't help noticing Buck is a total fraud. So I took the liberty of creating a new hero for your wall. That is just grotesque. Well, I thought if you were looking to worship someone, maybe it could be your old man? Eh, we could try it. Yes! My son lost his hero. This should be the greatest night of my life. How come I'm not happy? You care about Bart's feelings. Stop saying that. I think we should try to restore Bart's faith in Buck. And we could start by getting Buck to quit drinking. I'm sorry I let your son down, but I'm too old to change. Oh, listen to you. ""Ooh, ooh, I'm too old to change. "" How old are you? Seventy-six. Nice old man. Don't break a hip. Have we gotten all the liquor? That painting is made of liquor. I was drinking so much I forgot what life was about -- gold! He does a crazy dance. Gold! Beautiful gold! Nuggets as big as your fist! You guys are sick. I don't belong here. Buck, if you walk out that door, you'll be branded a quitter forever. Mmmm, something smells delicious. Well, that's it. This place ain't for me. Well, we're not giving up. We're going to cure you of drinking. Look, I worked long and hard, got rich, and now I'm retired. Why shouldn't I be able to drink all I want? Well, I don't know. I just naturally assumed it was some of my business. Well, I don't see how it is. Nobody's even told me your name yet. I'm still not givin' up on Buck. There must be some hare-brained half-assed way... This just in: a robbery is in progress at the National Bank of Springfield. The robbers are equipped with the latest in high-tech weaponry and body armor. Stay back coppers! Ah, please, everyone, stay away. We don't want anyone to be a hero. A hero. A hero! Get me Buck McCoy. Dad, I'm on the LINE. Here you go. Just stop this bank robbery and you'll be a hero again. I'll wait in the car. Are you crazy? I'm a movie cowboy. And you're no Howard Hawks. That hurts. But I just have one question: do you want my son to be disappointed in you? Fine. You don't need that. Way to go, Buck. I feel my faith growing anew. Better get rid of this too. Not to mention this. Whoa. There's nothing wrong with a little hey-hey! Fun's over, boys. Now drop the hardware and mosey. I'm firing at the lasso, but the bullets just go through the middle. It's the ultimate weapon! Wow, that sure made us look bad. Slink away, boys. Slink away. Buck, you're my hero again. Aren't you forgettin' someone? Well, there's Krusty, Itchy, Scratchy, Poochie, America's firefighters and then you, Dad. And don't you forget it. Goodbye Bart! Never bother me again!
