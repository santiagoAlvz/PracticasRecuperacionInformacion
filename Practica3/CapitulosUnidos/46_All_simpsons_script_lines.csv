45,46,"It's a breakthrough product, sir: scientifically formulated to rinse clean with no oily deposits. Hot dog! And it's mild enough to use every day. Isn't life grand? What's wrong sir, did I get some in your eyes? The shampoo specifically said ""No More Tears"". A lovely promise, but one beyond the powers of a mere shampoo. Sir, I feel there is something you're not telling me? Perhaps, you'd feel more comfortable talking to Snappy the Alligator. Maybe. Hello, Mr. Burns. Snappy, do you it's hard to imagine, but I was once a barefoot boy with cheek of tan. I dreamed of grand slam homeruns and wiping out nations with the stroke of a pen. Well there's still time for all those things, sir. Is there? Controlled nuclear fission is a demanding mistress, Snappy. So you feel resentful towards the plant. Yes, yes, exactly! You know, maybe it's time I sold the old girl. Oh, what do they want! Maybe a nap will boost my spirits. I'll get that whale song cassette that you like, sir. It's not fair! I know how you feel, Simpson. I've never seen Mr. Burns so depressed. Uh-huh. People think that because he's rich and powerful and cruel, he doesn't have feelings like other men. But he does. And you know what? I bet he wouldn't sell the plant for a hundred million dollars. Ooh, that's a lot of money. Uh, Mr. Smithers, do you have change for a dollar? Good, good. Try to eat something. Homer Simpson here. Homer, it's your stockbroker. Your stock in the power plant just went up for the first time in ten years. I own stock? Yes, all the employees got some in exchange for waiving certain constitutional rights. So uh, how much did it go up? Wait a minute. Let's not do that yet. The book says we have to make a little small talk before you get down to business. Everybody alive? Yeah... Like any sports? Sure... Ever go dancing? Not any more... We should get together sometime. That'd be great. There. Now we trust each other. Well... how are you? Near death. I'm renewing my notary license on a weekly basis. Uh-huh. So what's my stock up to? Let me punch that up on the computer. Twenty five cents a share. What should I do? Well, let me put it this way. You'll get twenty-five dollars if you sell now. Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars! Ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer... Bart! Bart! Turn to the financial channel! Aunt Patty says our stock is skyrocketing! Unconfirmed takeover rumors have pushed Burns Worldwide from one eighth to fifty-two and a quarter... Your father's stock is worth fifty-two hundred dollars! Wow, fifty-two hundred smackers. Hey, Homer. Wanna Duff? No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve. Are you sure? Cuz once I open the bottle there's no refund. For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that's my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy. Have a Duff, boys! Oh, thank you. My English is not perfect, but I have to tell you your beer is like swill to us. Do I have that right? I am saying that only a swine would drink this beer. Yeah, but thank you anyway. Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you? Ech, nein. We are from Germany. He is from the East. I am from the West. I had a big company and he had a big company. Now we have a very big company. We are interested in buying the power plant. Do you think the owner would ever sell it? Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars. A hundred million? Oh, don't worry! We'll still have enough left to buy the Cleveland Browns. It's the miracle we've been waiting for. What are we going to spend it on? Homer's probably buying some magic beans with it right now. We'll have a savings account. We've never had one. Kids, I think everything is going to be okay from now on. Hey... hey! Oh, Homer! You heard? We heard! Isn't it wonderful? We have some great plans for that money. Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans, too. What do you mean? I spent it on beer. Surprise surprise. You spent fifty-two hundred dollars on beer? Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talking about? What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks. Ow! Come on everybody. It makes you feel better. Hey, Homer. Did you buy this car with your stock money? Sure did. And the great thing about it is everybody got rich. For once, all us working stiffs got a break. Hey, wait till you see Lenny. He just got back from the plastic surgeon. Jeez Lenny, looks like you got the works. Well it started out as an eye tuck, but the stock kept going up. Hey, come here, Mr. Burns is on TV. Mr. Burns, we've heard that a German consortium has offered to purchase the plant. Any comment? You'll see the Statue of Liberty wearing lederhosen before you see Germans running my plant! Well then, sir, why are you meeting with them? So I can look Uncle Fritz square in the monocle and say nein. Ah, you never cease to amaze me, sir. Whoo! oooh, oooh, Whooo hoo hoo! I grudgingly accept. Now, don't worry. I think you'll find that these two gentlemen are as American as apple pie! Hans and Fritz, well that's just John and Frank! Ich bin ein Springfielder! We could all lose our jobs. Look at all those worried faces -- except for Lenny. He looks great. This is the worst day of my life. Those lousy Germans can't fire me. I'm the only one who knows how to unjam the rod bottom dissociator. Well, they can't fire me. I'm the only one certified to run the gaseous contaminant particularfier. Well, they can't fire me. Why? Cuz... I... Guten morgen, I am Horst. The new owners have elected me to speak with you because I am the most nonthreatening. Perhaps I remind you of the lovable Sergeant Schultz on Hogan's Heroes. Yeah, he does. What is the best way to an efficient plant? Happy workers who feel secure at their jobs. So let's get to know each other better. Do we have any alcoholics among us? You'll be given a six-week treatment at our drying out facility in Hawaii, after which you'll return at full pay. Lucky drunks. Also, we cannot uber-emphasize the importance of employee safety. We plan to have some frank discussions with your safety inspector. Yeah! Sock it to him, Horst! Hey, Homer, aren't you the safety inspector? That's one big check. You look sharp today, sir. You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr. You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr. That was a gutsy decision, sir. Ein wassen das gutsy decisionen, mein herr. Ein wassen das... Smithers! Come here, I want you. I wanted to give you something to remember me by. I know you've always had your eye on this photo of Elvis and me. He was so good to his mother, sir. Yes, but I couldn't understand a word that man said. Misht Burnsh, dajna boo mafrn friszner... er hound-dog. Stop it, you're killing me sir. Oh sir, what will you do next? Well, first I'll get that new hip I've been hankering for. Then, who knows? Bee keeping, boxing, bache ball?... The world is my oyster, Smithers. Farewell! Lisa, your father needs your help. Do you know anything about Germany? Well, it's a country in Europe -- Good, good, I'm learning. One of the economic powers of the world-- Because we send them money? No. Because they're efficient and punctual, with a strong work ethic. Oh, woa is me. Homie, come to bed. Oh, Marge, I'm gonna be fired. I know it. Don't worry. Whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow. Marge, it's not the money. My job is my identity. If I'm not a safety whatchamajigger, I'm nothing. Well, if you can't sleep, why don't you do something constructive? Ooh, Battlestar Galactica. Fit, damn you! Fit! There. Yo, Homer. You gotta get ready for work. Huh? What? Oh, what am I gonna... Hey, you! top being so unsafe! Smitty -- safen-up! Homer, could we have a word with you? No. I must have phrased that badly. My English is, how you say... inelegant. I meant to say, may we have a brief, friendly chat? No! Once again, I have failed. We request the pleasure of your company for a free exchange of ideas. Auugghh! You've been safety inspector for two years. What initiatives have you spearheaded in that time? Uh... all of them? I see. Then you must have some good ideas for the future as well. I sure do! Such as... Well, ah, I wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy. We understand Homer. After all, we are from the land of chocolate. Mmm. The land of chocolate... Wow. Chocolate -- half price! La la la la la... Mr. Simpson... La la la la la la... Mr. Simpson... Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. We were talking about chocolate? That was ten minutes ago! I think I did pretty good in there. Yeah, you know those Germans aren't so bad. Sure, they've made mistakes in the past, but that's why pencils have erasers. Attention workers. We have completed our evaluation of the plant. We regret to announce the following lay-offs, which I will read in alphabetical order. Simpson, Homer. That is all. Aye carumba! Now, Bart, Lisa did a wonderful job on my hair and we saved forty dollars for the family. We all have to pull together 'til your father gets a new job. I made a new bar of soap by squeezing all our little soap slivers together. That's very clever. And today, instead of buying comic books, I just read 'em and left 'em in the store. Hmmm, you shouldn't do that. My jump rope broke, but I just tied it back together. That's good, Lisa. I didn't take a bath today and I may not take one tomorrow. I want you to take baths, Bart. Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh what's the matter with this thing. No problems here. That's right, Burnsie... keep your wrist supple... throw it, don't aim it... This is my park! Get out! It was worth it. This place has really gone to hell, Mr. Burns. It's obscene what they did to your office. Listen, Smithers, you caught me at a bad time but my folk guitar class has been canceled for tonight. Would you like to get together for a drink? Would I! Fine. I gotta go. See you at six. You're going down, my friend. Yes sir, Mr. Burns. That shouldn't be. Raccoons! That's right... gather the nectar, my little drones, and make the honey. Honey for your children. Fools! Ready for that drink, sir? Just a second, Smithers. Let me introduce you to the gang. That's Buzz. That's Honey. And you see that queen over there? Her name is ""Smithers."" Ha, ha. That's very flattering, sir. But we should go. Several bees are stinging me. Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking. Uh yes, I'm looking for a Mrs. O'Problem. First name... Bee. Ah, yeah. Just a minute, I'll check. Uh, Bee O'Problem. Bee O'Problem. C'mon, guys. Do I have an O'Problem here? You sure do! Awwww. It's you, isn't it? Listen you, when I get a hold of you, I'm gonna use your head for a bucket and paint my house with your brains! Bart, I want you to go down to Moe's Tavern. I need you to bring your father home. Excuse me, I'm looking for -- Wait a minute. I know that voice. If it isn't little Bart Simpson! I haven't seen you in years. That's right. That's my pop! Ah, little Bart... we hear all about your monkeyshines. Bet you get into all kinds of trouble he don't even know about. Am I right? Huh? Am I right? Yeah, well, I make some crank phone calls. That's great! Hey, would you sing that old song you used to sing for me? Moe, for you... anything? Look! A blue-collar bar! Oh, Smithers, let's go slumming! EVERY TEDDY BEAR WHO'S BEEN GOOD IS SURE OF A TREAT TODAY/ THERE'S LOTS OF MARVELOUS THINGS TO EAT, AND WONDERFUL GAMES TO PLAY/ BENEATH THE TREES, WHERE NOBODY SEES/ THEY'LL HIDE AND SEEK AS LONG AS THEY PLEASE/ TODAY'S THE DAY THE TEDDY BEARS HAVE THEIR PICNIC! He's a pip, this one is! Ah, the mirthless laugh of the damned. Hold your nose, Smithers, we're going in! Watch me blend in. Barkeep, some cheap domestic beer for me and my ""buddy"" here. I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile! Smithers, who is this saucy fellow? Homer Simpson, sir. Sector Sieben-gruben -- I mean, Sector 7G. Recently terminated. That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars. Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue? Yes. Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night? Why, no. And does it ever say, ""I love you?"" No, it doesn't. Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea! Nobody loves you... Good heavens, Smithers! They're not afraid of me anymore! Hey Mr. Burns, did you get that letter I sent? Letter? I don't recall any letter... That's because I forgot to stamp it. Ah, that kid slays me. That was no accident. Let's get out of here. Na na na na / Na na na na / Hey hey hey / Goodbye -- Na na na na / na na na na / hey hey hey / goodbye... What good is money if you can't inspire terror in your fellow man? I've got to get my plant back! Gott in himmel! Who'd have thought a nuclear plant could be such a deathtrap. It will cost us another hundred million just to bring it up to code. Please sell me my plant back! I'll pay anything. Isn't this a happy coincidence? You are desperate to buy, and we are desperate to sell. Desperate, eh? Advantage, Burns. This is my offer. I think you'll find it's most unfair, but those are the breaks. But Mr. Burns, this is half of what we paid you. That's my final offer, take it or leave it. All right, Mr. Burns. You win. But beware. We Germans aren't all smiles and sunshine. Ooh, the Germans are mad at me. I'm so scared. Ooh, the Germans. Uh-oh, the Germans are comin' to get me. Oh, don't let the Germans come after me... Oh no, the Germans are coming after me. Oh, no, they're so big and strong... Get out! This is my office now! Get out! You too. This is a place of business, not a Peewee flop house! Your orders, sir? Restore my office. Cancel all repairs. And rehire that chap who sassed me in the bar. Homer Simpson, but why? Smithers. I keep my friends close and my enemies even closer. He'll slowly regain his confidence as the months and years drift by, blissfully unaware that the sword of Damocles is dangling just above his head. And then one day... when he least expects it -- Woo-hoo! I got my job back!","Mayor Joe Quimby, Carl Carlson, Waylon Smithers, Worker, Marge Simpson, Horst, Kent Brockman, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Snappy, C.
