440,446,"FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOOOOOWWWWW!...WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY! EXCEPT HIS EX-WIFE... So, what are you gonna do without us numbskulls to supervise? I plan to fill the void with gardening, early dining, and I've been learning to speak Mandarin Chinese. That's garbage. That's total garbage. I'm gonna miss Ted. He was a good supervisor. Definitely hands-off. He didn't mind if we punched in a little late, or not at all... Or that we made a few adjustments to the soda machine... Here's to us: ""The Unsupervisables!"" Ah, I expect you're all anxiously awaiting my choice for your new supervisor. Can't we just all supervise ourselves? I win! In any event, much as what formerly was my kidney is now my heart, I've decided to promote from within. One of you will get the job. But which one?... Congratulations! I dub thee King of the Morons, also known as Supervisor for Sector Seven-G. Here is your key to the executive washroom. Hmm... Woo-hoo! Our boss is our best buddy! The nitwits are runnin' the goofhouse! Yeah! Hey Carl, why aren't you high-fiving? Y'know... I'd rather save my arm-lifting for tapping gauges or filling out employee evaluations. We can celebrate at Moe's. After work. And the first beer's on me. You see, he hasn't changed! Yes I have. In ways you're only beginning to suspect! I call to order this meeting of the ""Springfield Charity Chicks."" As you all know, last year's cake and cookie sale raised one hundred twelve dollars to fight childhood obesity. Thank you, Charity Chicks! Now who has ideas for this year's fundraiser? Well, the police department raised money by selling these beefcake calendars. I have a great idea -- let's do what they did, but with us! We are a good-lookin' bunch. We just need a theme. How 'bout history? Then it's set. We'll do it on the twenty-fifth of... ...Wiggum. Okay, Betsy Ross, bring history to life! Ooo, I love it! Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop! Okay, stop. We got plenty. All right, who's my next sexy historical lady? I am! The female Tiger Woods of the nineteen-thirties, Babe Didrikson Zaharias. Oh, you know Marge, if you want to sell calendars, I'm going to need to see more ""Babe"" and less ""Didrikson Zaharias."" Fine. I'll take off one glove. Hmm... you know what would look super-good? If you held this glass of red wine. Mmmm, I love this wine. Yeah, it's Andalusian! Well, it seems real to me. Okay, more wine for you. Ooo, that's caliente, baby! Oh, oh, pop goes the Chupacabra! Yum, yum, yum! Whoops! Hey Carl, look how I messed with the names on the softball sign-up sheet. It's delicious! You know how Smitty's name is Smitty? Well, not anymore -- I changed the ""m"" to a-- That'll do, Homer. ...to a ""p"". Spitty... 'cause he spits when he talks. He had to have part of his tongue removed. That's real funny. Oh, well... I didn't know that. Well, now you know. Quit dragging me. When I grow up, I'm gonna drag you around and buy you clothes. Oh, that's wonderful! What's all the hubbub-aloo? I've been pin-upped! And every month is me! I don't remember doing this! I certainly don't remember doing August! Hey, calendar lady! You gonna take your clothes off? No! Well, I got the next best thing. Great safety report, Homer -- no meltdowns all week. I'm making you my new executive assistant. Why can't I keep the job I have now, whatever it is? Not an option, big fella. Either you're my assistant, or you find a job elsewhere -- and in this economy, elsewhere ain't hirin'! Oh fine, I guess I'm at your beck. And call. Nooooooo! Yeah. Oh no, it's a big turnout at church today. And the whole congregation has seen my ""Scandinavian regions."" Here comes the woman who made February the hottest month of the year. Her shapely gams have finally persuaded me to switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian! Marge, girl, I just heard your pants ain't hiring -- because your butt won't quit! Homie, everyone loved my calendar... but only you get to flip the pages. Calendar! Oh my God! I forgot to move Carl's twelve-thirty to two-thirty. His astrologist will show up at the same time as his astronomer! This is not good! This is not good! How 'bout a little Marge Madness? Who am I kidding? Marge, would you mind if we just cuddle? Cuddling's for after. Tomorrow, my love. Stupid Carl... ""Update the phone list, Homer!"" ""You put my contact lenses in backwards, Homer!"" I'm sorry, honey. Maybe this will take your mind off work. Wash my car. Re-foam my latte. Book me a massage. Shiatsu or better! Leave me alone, you two! Class, today we're going to talk about Washington crossing the Delaware. I'd like to watch Bart's Mom washing her underwear. The British were led by General Howe. I'd give Bart's Mom a General wow! Knock it off! That's my Mom you're talkin' about. Keep-away with Bart's Mom! Mrs. S., you can tuck me in any time... Okay, buddy. Lower the eyebrows. Nice and easy. It's stuck! I'll have a quizzical expression for the rest of my life! I'd like to get quizzical with Bart's Mom! Shut up! Standing up for yourself to an older boy? We're gonna have to set up an appointment with your parents. Let me, uh, check my calendar. I'm suddenly feeling, uh, un-administrative feelings. Homie? Honey, I know it's been a rough couple of weeks. But I booked us a night this Saturday, at a very romantic hotel. Garden view? Ocean view, obstructed. All right, I put in a hundred-hour work week, but I took a power-nap while I was driving us here and now I'm rarin' to go! Well, I brought a few items to make our night extra-special. Massage oil... Some lingerie from ""The Horny Hubby""... and ""snuggle"" dice. This one has an action, and this one has a body part. See? ""NUZZLE... NECK"". With pleasure! Lemme try. ""LICK... EYES."" Um, I'll try again. ""SPANK... HAIR."" What the? ""WHISPER INTO... ASS."" This game sucks! Why don't you just roll me? We're gonna be snore in the morning... Dammit, why won't you touch me? Okay. Kiss me, baby! Kiss me like a frog in a fairytale! Great news, Homer! I've been invited to the annual nuclear-power expo in Paris, France. That's right -- we're going to Fission Week! I need you to book me a room at the Ritz, with a view of Jim Morrison's grave, and book me dinner at that place... you know the one, the one Lenny's mom read about two years ago. I'll make it up to you, Marge, I swear. Last night was the making it up to me! The most intimate moment we shared this week was my ironing your shirts! Actually, those were Carl's shirts. I can't believe you're gonna spend another weekend with him. Hey, it's not like I want to go. Go, go, go! Diddily... Okay, Fission Week kicks off on Monday with a reception by the International Proton Council. Word is, protons are the new electrons. You know Homer, when I was your age, it was the future, ""cause I'm younger than you. Just something to think about. I will! Edamame? I don't have time for peeling. Squirt 'em in. Well boys, Daddy's back on the beam, thanks to Christian prayer and Doctor Sheldon Lowenstein! We thought you were gonna die. And then Uncle Kevin would have to raise us. With his funny friend David. Oh, I'd put rocks into your pockets and walk you out to sea before that happened. Yayyy! Ned, to make up for what happened, I want to invite you and the boys over to dinner tomorrow night. Okily-dokily. But I'm warning you, you're gonna see America's number-one dishwashing crew! I wash! And I dry! Then I give 'em the squeak test and into the dishwasher they go! Carl Carlson, it is good to meet you! Thank you, um... French Nuclear Commissioner Etienne Ducharme. ...Commissioner Ducharme. I trust that your wife is, uh...still dead? Yes. Thank you for asking. Monsieur Carlson, what have you enjoyed most about Paris? Oh, I really love, uh...The Louvre. Everything about it is so, uh...closed on Mondays. You are clearly a man of the world. May I have your card? My assistant will give you that. Can we meet for lunch? My assistant will set that up. I want to make love -- now! My assistant... will do a sensual dance for your arousal. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, sensual dance, chop, chop. I love Paris. The women, the wine -- everything except their lame-o version of rock and roll. ROCK AND ROLL! ROCK AND ROLL! ROCK AND ROLL! When we get back to the hotel, I want you to extend our stay... indefinitely. But I have to get back to Marge. Homer, we are this close to selling our power in Paris, Milan, Dubai -- everywhere people know good electricity. But we gotta focus! Monsieur Carl! Let us stroll down Main Street Euro-Disney! LE SEXY ROCK AND ROLL / THE FILMS OF CLAUDE CHABROL / OOO LA LA, C'EST DOMMAGE / EVERYBODY EAT FROMAGE! HO-MIE... HO-MIE... HO-MIE... HO-MIE... HO-MIE... HO-... You two are going out? I thought I told you the Flanderses were coming over to dinner. Sorry -- I have a tea party at Janey's. And I'm having a stink bomb party at the house next to Janey's. No connection. I guess it'll just be dinner for four. Hi Ned. Where are the boys? oh, they're grounded. I found out Rod watched a commercial for ""Grey's Anatomy,"" and Todd took a full day to tell me. It's fun to cook dinner together. Homer and I never do it anymore. Cook together, that is. What's the next task on the old i-dinnerary? You could wash this iceberg lettuce. Gosh, what a hunk! I'm not thinkin' straight! Why did I drink that wine cooler last month? Dinner's ready! Dinner's ready! Saved by the bell from eternity in Hell! Bonjour. Homer, there is a moth in my room! Where are you!? Where I should've been all along... In Springfield. What?! Homer! Return to the immortal City of Light at once! Or you're fired! Oh I don't think so! You know that woman you've been playing ""hide the baguette"" with? She's the first lady of France, Carla Bruni! If you fire me, I'll call President Sarkozy and he'll be all over you like Truffaut on Hitchcock. You wouldn't dare! Oh wouldn't I? Just listen. Allo, you are getting cozy with Sarkozy. Okay, Okay, you win! Give my best to Marge. I sure will -- but only after I give her mine. Nuclear secrets... pictures of Lenny... everything I need for my plan! Marge, that dinner was a winner! What's for dessert? Oh, nothing fancy... Strawberries and whipped cream. Ned, you got whipped cream in your mustache! Your perfectly-trimmed mustache... Ned, there's only one man I should be eating whipped cream with. I never thought otherwise. Well, see ya 'round the mailbox, Marge. My wife? And my worst friend? Could it be? Naw. Homie, you're back! Hey Ned. Marge, I believe we have a little unfinished business. Come with me! Boy, that was worth the wait. Now, it's my turn to roll the dice! Wanna kiss them for me?
