278,282,"I'm really gonna miss him. It's Grampa's smell. ""Old Old Spice."" Oh, my Dad never even knew how I felt about him. But you were very open with your feelings. Sure, I said I loved him. But never that I was ""in love"" with him. What are you cryin' about? You don't have to live here! Dad! Grampa! Stop it. You're stretching out my skin! What's got into you punks? The home told us you were dead. Me? I ain't dead. It was Stimson down the hall. So much for Mister ""I can button my own shirt."" Aw, Dad... We've got what people never get, a second chance. Yeah, there's so many things we can... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll call you. Or send you some fruit. Look Grampa, you're already getting a new neighbor. Hi, I'm Zelda. I put the ""ass"" in assisted living. Holy mac... Abe Simpson's the name, and now that you're here, I'm changing my instructions to ""do resuscitate."" Now, let me show you around. Over there are the preppies. And over there's the comatose... And the cool comatose... Hey, who's the tall drink of Maalox? Are you young ladies here to visit your mothers? That's Zack. He's as smooth as a fifty-year-old behind. Who wants to go get some sweet corn in my minivan? It's got a wheelchair lift. If you can drive, they're all over ya. I used to drive, but they pulled my license. Is this the Dairy Queen? But Zelda, if you're lookin' for somethin' with a big back seat and a lotta gas, I'm your man. You've never heard Garrison Keillor till you've heard him through five speakers. Tramp. B-6. You sunk my Scrabbleship! This game makes no sense. Tell that to the good men who just lost their lives. Semper fi. I wanna drive again! You? No way. It's too dangerous. Well, you're no angel behind the wheel. What about your D.U.I.? That was a D.W.I. Give Grampa a chance. Statistics show that old people drive at least as well as sleep-deprived apes. Please, son. Driving is my last chance to feel alive. Well, you brought me into this world, so no. Fine, I'm dead. Dad, get up. No, I'm dead. Grampa, come on. Dead. Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead... All right, Grampa. I'll help you get your license back. Woo hoo! And I want driving gloves! No way. Dead, dead, dead, dead... First of all, I'd like to ask if anyone has any questions. Yeah where's the men's room? It's down the hall. Okay, now let's pretend that we're going for a drive. Leo, slow down! That looks like a nice place to eat! Carla's daughter works in that building! You know, it's kind of ironic. These old people are being kept alive by the organs of the young people they ran over. Makes you think, eh Chief? Not really. Next. Grampa's here to get his driver's license. Okay, look at the eye chart and cover your left eye. That's my seein' eye. The right one's my winkin' eye. I'll give you your license if you never do that again. Everything's the last time I do everything. Can't you just use this recent photo? Eh, all right. Here ya go. Woo hoo! Who's laughing now? Shut up! What's the scoop, milkshakes? I got me a date with Zelda, so I need the car. Oh, no. I'm not giving you my car. You'll probably drive it. You don't trust your old man? You ungrateful milkshake. Why don't we double date? Then the restaurant will have to give us that booth. Wow, a booth. If I'm tired, I can just lie down! Cut it out. I can work the brakes myself. No you can't. You're slow to react, Dad. Baloney. Woo! This is the best party of my life! Bro, you tapped the septic tank! Dude sure got his comeuppance. In real life he would die. Oh, Abe. Oh, Zelda. Hey, watch the movie. Movies were better in our day. For a nickel you got two movies, a cartoon, a bag of popcorn, and a whuppin'. Kept your mind on your business. Hop in, beautiful. Now, there's a few things I wanna say to you, Zelda. Save your breath. Seriously. Well, I gotta do something before the Viagra kicks in. I know, I'll suck my teeth. Whoa, here we go. Give me those keys. Do you have any idea what you put us through? I called the police, the hospital, my bookie, the kennel... Okay, this isn't about who I called. See you later, I'm going to the library. Lisa gets to do what she wants and you don't yell at her. Hey, I've earned their trust. Oh, everybody trusts Lisa. Precious little Lisa, apple of her Daddy's eye. Lisa doesn't borrow my car and stay out all night with some... hoochie. She's no hoochie. Her name is Zelda and she understands me. Grampa, I gotta tell ya, she's a stone-cold hoochie. Straight up, Marge. That hoochie only likes you because you can drive. Shut up! You don't know her! Zelda loves me! I HATE THIS HOUSE! Turn that down! You call that music? I-- I just don't know what to do. He used to be such an angel. Maybe you should give him another chance. No, he's gotta learn, Marge. The way my dad made me learn. He is your dad. Cosmic. Hey, Abe, what are you doing here? We heard you lost your driving privileges. Well for your information, I can still drive to the store. But I have to be back in five minutes with these things for the baby. Oh, gentlemen! The new scratch-and-win tickets are out today. I'll take one, Achoo. Not ""Choo,"" ""Pu."" I got trouble with both. Finally, the shakes are workin' for me! Pardon me, sir... Your scrapings have landed on my jacket from Planet Hollywood, Orlando. So what if it did? So, it is very thoughtless. I should cut you like I cut sodium out of my diet. You don't scare me with your dignity and your subtle cologne. Then perhaps you should be taught a lesson by us, Los Souvenir Jacquitos. Bring it on. Please gentlemen, violence is not the answer. Then what is? Some sort of death race? That's what I would do. Very well, viejo. You shall have your death race. Death race? And another thing: no death races! Aw, I better not. Cheek-a, cheek-a, cheek-a... Cheek-a, cheek-a, cheek-a... Cheek-a, cheek-a, cheek-a... Fine. I'll meet you at the abandoned aqueduct! For the death race! Yes, the death race. All right, seniors and señors. Whichever car makes it through that tunnel first is the winner. But it's only big enough for one car. What are you scared of, old man? Everything. Dogs, Dutchmen, the gathering darkness... All right, when I yank down my girlfriend's tube top, the race will begin. What? I'm just trying to bring you into my world. Just go. Aieee! Zapata del Diablo! Ich vinch eich gezunt! Old friend, your jacket, she burns! Then I burn with her. For I would rather die than have people not know what stores I have been to. Woo hoo! We're the baddest punks in our age bracket! My beard! I broke my beard! Oh my God! We can't let Homer know! Huh? Oh, that is it! Abraham J. Simpson, you are never driving again! Ever! I can't believe I cracked up my only set of wheels. Go home. Put on a smile, high-pants. I've got a surprise for you. I've booked us a room for the weekend in Branson, Missoura. The Grits Carlton Hotel! Oh, that's great, uh... but there's a slight hitch. Ya see, ah, I'm temporarily between cars... But we don't need anything to have fun but ourselves. GIMME THAT OLD TIME FUN / GIMME THAT OLD TIME FUN / GIMME THAT OLD TIME FUN / THE KIND WHERE WE STAY HOME... Zelda, may I offer you a lift? Don't feel bad, Abe. I'll always think of you as my friend without a car. Don't go, Zelda! I love you! Zelda, I'm gonna make you forget about your grandchildren. What'll I do? Hey, Grampa. Stealing Mom's car? Yeah, it's the only way to win back Zelda. And if I go to prison, I'll get better food and more hugs. Uh, it's actually blue wire to yellow wire. It is? Hot diggity dodge. Next stop, Branson, Missoura. Can I tag along? Sure, why not? School ain't helpin' ya. Ah, I hate this hippie crap. And now W-O-M-B, warm and safe radio, takes you back to the golden age of radio theater... It's the ""Itchy and Scratchy Hour."" Presented by Hansen's Mustache Wax. The mustache wax Hitler doesn't use. As we join tonight's adventure, we find Itchy at the counter of his butcher shop. Heya, Scratchy. Aggh! Aggh! Aggh! You're grinding my head! During the war, Eleanor Roosevelt was the voice of Scratchy. The lady knows funny. First he wrecks your car, then he steals mine. Your father's out of control. Oh sure, when he does something bad, he's my father. He must have dropped this. So You've Settled for Branson. We've gotta go after them. But how? Branson is a thousand miles away and we've got no car. Oh, that was lucky. Come on, boys. Yay! Uh, we'll wait for the next one. What are those, Grampa? These are hobo signs. They're to tell other hobos if a place is friendly or not. That one means good vittles... Sexy daughter... Mass hobo grave in cellar... Here we are: Branson, Missouri! No pally, This is Bronson, Missouri. Well, how do we get to Branson? Number ten bus. Hey ma, how 'bout some cookies? No dice. This ain't over. There it is! That's the glitziest ""Welcome To"" sign ever. Okay, keep an eye peeled for Zelda. Is that her? No. Is that her? No. Is that her? No. Is that her? No! Wait, it was the second one. Zelda, baby, it's me! Two seniors, please. Oh no, he's takin' her to the hottest matinée in town. C'mon, boy After 'em. ""REMEMBER THE STARS YOU LOVED YESTERDAY / WHERE DID THEY GO, DID THEY ALL PASS AWAY? WAS IT DRUGS OR A CAR CRASH OR FACE LIFT GONE WRONG? NO, THEY'RE RIGHT HERE IN BRANSON AND SINGING THIS SONG...""

Now I know you're dead. No, you just think I'm dead. No, you're dead. I was your biggest fan. Look, I clipped your obituary. Let's take a quick gambling break. A little action will really sharpen our senses. Mom, there's no gambling in Branson. It was designed as a family destination. Oh, no. There's gambling. We just have to find it. Look Mom, it's your car. Grampa and Bart must be in that theater! Betcha they're not! Three to one. How much you got? Mom, you're hurting me. Grampa, look over there. It's Captain Bringdown and the Buzzkillers. If you're gonna make your move, you better do it quick. Wait! Stop the music! I've driven hundreds of miles to say something very special to someone in this audience tonight. Awww... Zelda, will you come up here? Drive me, Abe. Drive me! I just wanna say... we're through! Nobody dumps Abe Simpson! You're nothin' but a hoochie! Hoochie, hoochie, hoochie! Hoochie! Hoochie! Hoochie! Hoochie! Hoochie! Hoochie! Now, I'd like my son to come up here.
