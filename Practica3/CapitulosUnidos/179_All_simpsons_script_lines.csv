175,179,"Wha-- Uh-oh. Here comes the evening rush. Clear out, fellas. What a day. / Let's get started. / Some serious drinkin'. / 'Evening, Moe. 'Morning, Moe. Yeah, all right. Listen up, guys. The Springfield Police have told me that 91 per cent of all traffic accidents are caused by you six guys. Yeah, I know, I know. But the bad news is we gotta start having designated drivers. We'll choose the same way they pick the Pope. Everybody reach in and draw a pickled egg. Whoever gets the black egg stays sober tonight. NOOOOOOOOOO! You got the black one. Hey everybody, I'm Peter Pantsless! I can't take this much longer. I gotta have a beer. Oh, no. Oh, no. Not tonight. Not tonight! Are you ready to get Duffed? Hey, it's Duffman! The guy in a costume that creates awareness of Duff! Duffman wants to party down with the man who sent in ten thousand Duff labels to bring me here today. I've got a bottomless mug of new ""Duff Extra Cold"" for... BARNEY GUMBEL! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! I can't! I'm the designated driver! Ehhh... That's swell. Duff wholeheartedly supports the designated driver program... Now, who wants to party?! Please, I'm trying to drive. Hey, let's go to the girls' college! No, the Playboy Mansion! Playboy Mansion! Shut up! It's my car, and I say we're going to the lost city of gold! Oh, that's just drunk talk. Sweet, beautiful drunk talk... Goodnight, Barney. Don't forget to bring back my car back tomorrow. Just slide it under the door. Yes. Tomorrow. Face it, Homer, the car is gone. Barney ain't never comin' back. Here we are, Mr. Gumbel. Thanks for the lift! Barney, where's my car?!! All I remember about the last two months is giving a guest lecture at Villanova. Or maybe it was a streetcorner. So you lost my car, eh? Well, that's just grand. I ought to punch you in the nose, but I have to pick up my kids at school. Homer, I don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself. Marge, you can stand there finding fault, or you can knit me some seat belts. Sorry, sorry. Dad, you got a letter from the City of New York! Throw it away! Nothing good has ever come out of New York City! ""Dear motorist, your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of Manhattan..."" My vehicle! ""...If you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours, your car will be thrown into the East River at your expense."" Oh, I don't want to go to New York City. Why not? New York is a hellhole, and you know how I feel about hellholes. Dad, you can't judge a place you've never been to. Yeah! That's what people do in Russia! It's time I told you about a chapter of my life I hoped would be closed forever. I was on my way to the Harrisburg Coat Outlet to buy an irregular coat. But it required a stopover in New York City. All I had to do was walk a few blocks from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to my train at Penn Station... Anyhow, I must have looked at somebody the wrong way...because the next thing I knew, I was running for my life. And that's when the CHUDs came at me. Oh, Homer. Of course you'll have a bad impression of New York if you only focus on the pimps and the CHUDs. Aw, I'd love to see New York. We could all go with the bus company's special Supersitter Fare! Nine bucks?! This one's on me. Great! We're all going to New York! Lousy Bart... his money... All right, New York, I'm coming back. But you're not getting this! Dad, our baby pictures were in there! Don't you start. Wake up, everyone. We're almost there. That took too long! How come we had to transfer in Atlanta twice? I just think we should have paid the extra dollar-fifty and gotten a bus with restrooms. Marge, I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs! Homer! Homer, those legs belong to the man behind you. Oh. Hi. We're here! Wow! I feel like such a nobody. It's wall-to-wall landmarks -- the Williamsburg Bridge! Fourth Avenue! Governor's Island! Look, it's ZZ Top! You guys rock! Eh, maybe a little. Now remember, criminals prey on small-town folk like us. So if anyone asks, we're sophisticated millionaires from the Ozarks. Homer, you're scaring the children. Good. I don't want to spend one extra second in this urban death-maze. You wait here at the bus station while I get the car. The bus station is just one of the sights we came to see. We'll meet you in Central Park at five o'clock. Oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy. I'm on to you! ""Your vehicle is illegally parked at One World Trade Plaza."" Hmmm... Ooohh... Wow, Governor's Island looks so insignificant from up here. Hey immigrants, beat it! Country's full! Okay folks, you heard the lady. Back into the hold. We'll try Canada. Stupid city! What the hell is this thing? Come off! Come off! Oh, all right, you! Ow. Hey, when you're done with that, I got something up here you can bite on! Hey, why don't ya be polite, ya stinkin' pus-bag! Pal, ya gotta call that number on the boot. Sorry about that guy. They stick all the jerks in Tower One. That's it! I'm comin' over there! Shaddup, the both of youse! Thank you for calling the Parking Violations Bureau. To plead not guilty, press ""one"" now. Thank you! Your plea has been -- REJECTED. You will be assessed the full fine plus a small -- -- LARGE LATENESS PENALTY. Please wait by your vehicle between nine a.m. and five p.m. for parking officer Steve -- -- GRABOWSKI. They expect me to sit here from nine to five?! That's how many hours? Ten, eleven, denominator... Oh, where's Lisa when you need her? Here's a better idea -- you give me your address, and I'll write to you. Uh, okay. Uh, just send it to Jesus, uh, care of the Pentagon. I'm so glad we took the subway. ""Laser Wart Removal"". Wow, the future is here! Hey, where's Bart? Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm sorry to disturb your pleasant ride, but unlike yourselves, I was born without taste buds. Let me demonstrate. I'm in over my head here. Thank you for your time. Come on! Pick up the pace! Hey! I'm not a bum... Thanks, but I don't need... Okay, if you insist, but... Spare change, lady? Lousy cheapskate... So hungry... can't leave car... Huh... Getting closer... closer...almost there... Ow! Fresh Khlav Kalash! Get your Khlav Kalash! Hey, uh, could you go across the street and get me a slice of pizza? No pizza. Only Khlav Kalash. Aw, shoot. All right, all right. Give me one bowl. No bowl -- stick. Stick. Geez! That's just... awful! Mmmm. Now, what do you have to wash that awful taste out of my mouth? Mountain Dew or crab juice. Blech! Eww! Geesh! I'll take a crab juice. Uh-oh. Uhh... You got a men's room in there? Only Khlav Kalash. Men's room in tower -- tower! Observation deck. But I can't leave my car until the parking guy gets here. Oh, why did I drink all that crab juice? Mmmmm. Don't even think about it, pal. Are we still in Little Italy? Actually, I think we're in Chinatown now. Only in New York! Mom, are those rabbits dead? No. No Lisa, they're just... sleeping. Upside down. And inside out. Bart, no fireworks! Put that back! You're the boss. Oh, no!! Chinese Fire Drill! Serious this time!! Come on, boot guy! Flushing Meadows... Oh, I can't take it anymore. All right, I'll only be gone for a second. Frontsies... Backsies... I'm with them... V.I.P... Coming through... Very important person... They gave me frontsies... How frightfully rude. I certainly hope someone stabs him in the eye. AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH. Oh, yes. Oh. What? ""Failure to wait by vehicle: $250."" Oh no, it's getting dark. Well, that's it. I'm getting out of this town alive if it kills me! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Look at all those beautiful shoes! I know they're made from animals, but wow! If only I didn't already have a pair of shoes. Speaking of shoes, I don't care about shoes. I'll meet you ladies back here in half an hour. Okay, Dad... Stay where I can see you, honey... Excuse me, is this MAD Magazine? No, it's ""Mademoiselle."" We're buying our sign on the installment plan. Uh, seriously, though -- my name is Bart Simpson. My father has a subscription. I'd like the grand tour, please. Listen, kid. You probably think lots of crazy stuff goes on in there , but this is just a place of business. Oh. Okay. Get me Kaputnik and Fonebone! I wanna see their drawings for the ""New Kids on the Blecch"". And where's my furshlugginer pastrami sandwiches?! Woooooow. I will never wash these eyes again. Get off the road, ya freakin' maniac! Yeah, ya jackass! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
