493,500,"All right, everybody in! All right, who's the wisenheimer that's been eating the powdered food? Not me. Two can play at that game. I can do this... I can do this... Boy, I told you an hour ago. Stop that! But Bunkerball is keeping us sane! Do we really have to sit here the whole time? I mean, if we went out now, it might be cool to see the town empty. Yeah! I could sneak into the school and write whatever I want on the chalkboard! I could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana! And I can drive drunk while I'm actually sober! It's fun, but not as fun. That's odd. Why are all those cars parked at City Hall? Ay carumba! If I didn't know better, I'd say it was a town meeting. Not without us, it isn't! Pull over. Welcome to this secret meeting, made possible by the fake disaster drill. And a special thanks for the hard work of the Mystery And Secrecy Committee. We have names, you know! Quit complaining! You only meet once a month! Yes, but the meetings last eight hours! Shut up! Shut up! This is the most fun I have! And now for the reason we are here. What's going on? Why is there a picture of us? This isn't good. Oh honey, why must you always assume that a huge picture of us, at a secret meeting we weren't told about, is a bad thing? The results are in: this town has voted unanimously to get rid of Springfield's unending nightmare: the Simpsons. They're here! The monsters are here! Moe, it's me, Marge! I'm your friend! The monster queen is comin' on to me! Why would you want to banish us from Springfield? Yeah. We're like family to you. I'm talking to you, headphone-bus driver guy. I'll have you know I'm also a hair donor! Salma Hayek wore me to the Oscars! This is not about who wore whose hair where. We are here to banish the Simpsons, although we are not pleased to be doing so. I am! Me too. I feel like a kid at Christmas! I believe you know my position. I know we're all happy-- I'm just trying to spare their feelings. Those freaks have no feelings! Even baby never cry! What baby does that?! Why would an entire town go to all this fuss to get rid of one family? What have we done that's so terrible? I'm glad you asked. The simple fact is, the city is going broke cleaning up after Homer's drunken shenanigans... We won! Woo hoo! Homer! That is not banishment-hearing behavior! Bart's pranks, which dwindle in humor as they rise in destruction... And Liser's environmental initiatives... If I may speak. Um-hm. We're not monsters. We're just people. People who love each other and love this town. The only place we've ever called home. Thank you. Marge, you are a sweet woman and you make us see your family in a more forgiving light. Thank you. Which is why you're the worst Simpson of all! Now, now, now just a second here! Now, I know we're not perfect. But, uh, I believe it was Sammy Hagar who said-- Silence! That was an ""inside me"" bone! Make way for Captain Coolerhead! Now, I like a good old-fashioned witch trial as much as the next person, but I do not think we should be so quick to judge our long-time neighbors... Not so fast, Flanders. We knew you'd be the voice of mercy. And we're prepared to answer your concerns. Any other objections? I withdraw my... diddily... I always thought ""tarred and feathered"" was just a figure of speech. Good luck patching potholes and stuffing pillows now! Simpsons, in accordance with article six, section two of the town charter... Wait! If you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought. I mean a thousand-year flood! I mean a thousand years of perfect weather. Just get out! I'M A ROLLING STONE / ALL ALONE AND LOST... FOR A LIFE OF SIN / I HAVE PAID THE COST... That was the last Springfield radio station. Now we just get Shelbyville talk radio. If you see a Simpson, do not try to reason with it. Just kill it and turn in the pelt for a free soda. Soda, eh? Dad, where are we going? Do we have a plan? Oh, let's face it. I'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. And there's only one way out: I've gotta man up. Okay, manning up... manning up. Mannning-- Girling down! Girling down! Hey, Henrietta Hippo, I've got to drain the inchworm. Fine. Please. Put that down. I just got started! Not you! Him! You best get back where you belong! Please sir, we've been thrown out of a place we've always called home. We just wanna live out our lives in peace. Rejected by society, huh? Well, why didn't you say so? Welcome to the off-the-grid, unincorporated settlement we proudly call ""The Outlands!"" We found a new home! When God shuts a door, he opens a window. Oh, I wouldn't be openin' no windows. Coyotes will take your baby. THE OUT-LANDS! Eh, I'm sick of watching Fox. Let's get some fresh air. I got the ATV's right out back. Should I get my helmet? Helmet? That's Springfield talk. Is there gas in these? Springfield talk! Well how are we supposed to get fuel? Private plane crashes. Ahhh, smell that unpolluted air! Y'know, I'm glad we're in exile. Yep, I never realized how much I hated every single one of my friends and relatives. I don't think this place is so great. I'm trying to make the best of things, but I'm worried Maggie is falling in with a bad crowd. I miss our home and I want to go back. It's not perfect here, but it is close to nature and if you have an axe to grind, Wikileaks is right over there. How're you doin', Mr. Assange? That's my personal information and you have no right to know about it. Hey, but we're neighbors... would you like to come over for a movie sometime? Is it Iraqi journalists being murdered? Don't be ridiculous. It's an Afghan wedding being bombed. Well I've got a really big secret for you... I'm not wearing any underwear. You know, you should really get out less. He's no Ned Flanders. And I miss the Springfield sign and how every street is a dead end. God help me, I even miss Helen Lovejoy criticizing my brownies. Hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes. Yes it does. Pipe down, boy. I'm sneaking you back into Springfield. Oh, ""Smithers""! Homie, these disguises won't fool anyone. Pish tosh, Smithers, and fiddle-dee-dee! Nailed it! Hold it right there! Mr. Burns! You might catch a cold out this late. You want my jacket? Here, lemme warm my gun up for ya. Excellent. Yeah, it wouldn't be you if you didn't say ""excellent."" You know what's great about you, Marge? After all these years you can still shinny up the donut, and then pull me up after you. Look! A shooting star! Do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets? On a night like tonight I have to believe there are. Strike! Woo hoo! Wanna make out over the foul line? Ever since the day we met. The old homestead. Remember when we moved in and I talked like this? There's no sex like fugitive sex. Home sweet squat. Yeah, this place is awesome, but it's not puppy safe, and my little guy's coming tomorrow. Someone's downstairs! I think I heard a pair of underpants being picked up off the ground. Big ones! It's them! Bart's mom and the fat guy! Let's turn 'em in. Not so fast. This case was already cracked...by the last person you'd expect -- the Chief of Police! You really thought you could fool me with that Burns and Smithers getup? I mean, I'm not the sharpest pencil in the pencil thing, but I'm at least as smart as a cat. Right, Lou? What breed, Chief? I mean, I saw an Abyssinian once who could change channels. That is pretty smart. All right! You caught us. What are you gonna do about it? Throw us out of town again? Crucify them! And screw the boulder in tight! Make 'em write monologue jokes! Cancel their subscription to the opera! We hate opera! Then get them a subscription to the opera! Nooo! I say shoot 'em! Now hold on just a minute. Nobody said anything about shooting. I did. Just now. Ah, that's right, you did. Well, all right. Don't even bother shooting us. We've found a new place that we love. A place that may not have indoor plumbing, but it's got something we treasure more... Yeah. Non-jerks! Maybe he's right. We are jerks. You want I should spray some of my ""Jerk Off"" on ya? Eh -- it's okay. In our new community, people accept others for who they are. I thought I wanted to come back to my house, but instead, I'm going to go back to my home. Well, bah to them. Let's go, Smithers. Getting a little clingy, aren't we? Oh, all right. That's all it took? I just had to ask? Well, I've tightened the bolt! I think we're good! You sure this is a good idea? This is the outlands, boy. Ideas aren't good or bad, they're just free! Power on! I was wrong, there are bad ideas! There are terrible ideas! Now I'm over here! I'm on it. Lenny Lenford. You're a long way from your barstool. I'm-I'm-I'm here as a friend, looking for a better way of life! Hey Lenny, welcome aboard. Now, I gotta warn you, if you find a little black thing on your pillow, it won't be a mint. I don't mind. I want a fresh start... and so does Carl. Get her off! Get her off! Let her slice off the tip of your ear, and she'll go right to sleep. No! That's not a choice you get to make. This is pretty tasty. Yep. And I like how it's dissolving a hole in the cup. Hey! Guys! What can I getcha? Forget it. We don't need some big city bartender chargin' us an arm and a leg for something we can do ourselves. Sure, sure. I understand. But if you change your minds, I'll be here in this cave. I got a funny feeling our paradise is about to get ruined by unwanted guests. I probably shouldn't have given this place five stars on Yelp. Well, I rented that plane. Oh, that tears it! I am not comfortable being this close to medical care. I'm outta here. What are you doing here? I, uh, heard everything was goin' great in your new Eden, with one flaw: you lack a corrupt city government. True, true. And a school system that teaches to the test, sneaks the kids the answers and still fails. Stop! Stop! This is everything we put behind us! You can't leave civilization, Marge. Humanity is an inexorable upward march. Or was till the year two thousand. Well, I did miss a few things about the grid... like everything! Maureen Dowd, we've got a lot of catching up to do. I'm sure someone will come back to tell me where they went. If I go inside they might not find me. Come on, man, we wouldn't leave you behind. Bless you, boy! Ow! Accident! Here comes another one! Ow! Ow! It's nice to be wanted.
