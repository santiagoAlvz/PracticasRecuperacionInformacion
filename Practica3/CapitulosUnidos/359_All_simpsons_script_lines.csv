355,359,"Haw haw! And now let us bow our heads in silent prayer... Maggie! That's not what you do with a hymnal. Homer! I forgot to floss this morning! Something's wrong with Maggie. We should get her to Dr. Hibbert. But I don't see him anywhere. The Hibberts now attend a more ""boisterous"" house of worship. This is awesome! Black God rules! SHINE ON / OH LET IT SHINE ON Dr. Hibbert? Mm-hmm? I hate to interrupt while you're rejoicing, but Maggie is terribly itchy. Mm-hmm! Oh. This looks to be the initial stages of chicken pox. Say amen! Amen! Coat Maggie with this Calamine lotion and the scabbing will heal. The scabbing will heal! The scabbing will heal! Heal my scabs, Lord! Praise the Lord, I can walk again! What, my foot fell asleep. Sweetie, I know it itches, but you've gotta stop scratching! No! No!!! Here, here play with your teddy bear. Oh, sugar-booger! Aw, poor Maggie. Homer, don't touch her! You've never had chicken pox. I know, and you did, and you're great. Oh, I'm just saying it's very dangerous if you get it as an adult! It could leave you sterile down there. Oh. You always gotta work blue, don't ya Marge? You're better than that. Can't even go in my own kitchen... Bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters. Mmm. Don't worry, Dad. I'm saving one for you. I'll just leave it here in the dog's mouth. Noooo! Bart, that's a really bad storage area! Hey Homer, why the sour puss? Didja chugalug a skunky Snapple? I dunno, maybe. Plus my wife won't let me inside because the baby's got chicken pox. Really? Do you mind if I bring my boys over so she can infect Rod and Todd? Then there'll be a pox on both our houses! Why would you do that? Are you a bad parent? Au contraire, man with no hair! You see, Rod and Todd can only get the chicken pox once, and childhood's the safest time! So you want Maggie to infect your kids? You betcha! In fact, some parents have been known to hold ""pox parties,"" so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please. And would they pay handsomely for the privilege? Well, they might. But you'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors... ...Fifteen dollars to infect your kids! Now featuring the Pox Box! Pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. Like any disease box, results may vary. Pox box! Welcome to our pox party. Save room for punch -- Maggie's bathing in the bowl! Uh, hi. Luann'll pick Milhouse up when the party's over. I'll just read in the car till then. Oh Kirk, come join the parents in the kitchen. We're having alcohol drinks, and dishing on the parents who aren't here. ...normally I'm not one to laugh at a man's urinary blockage, but, you shoulda seen it... oh, there he is. Ladies and gentlemen, presenting... the sister with the blisters... the tot with all the spots... Maggie! I feel like a chicken already. I just made an egg in my pants! Hey Marge. Hit me with a little more of that silly slush. Chief, don't you think you've had enough? I'm fine. Watch, I can even touch my gun to my nose. Oh don't worry, I'm the Pief of Cholice. I mean I'm uh, beef with no cheese. Why doesn't Lou like me? Why? Knock, knock! Luann, what are you doing here? I thought you were just dropping Milhouse off. I could get some coffee and come back... No, no, no, you stay. I'll just drive home. Uh, who's gonna let me siphon? Look, why don't you both stay and have one of my Marge-aritas? All right! I never drank one of these without a cigarette in it! Now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome Mr. Krusty the Clown! Hey, hey, kids! This putz only paid for twenty seconds, so listen fast. Moishe caught the chicken pox, he scratched all night and day / He asked the rabbi what to do, and he said Time! I'm outta here! Kirk, you look good. Have you been working out? Well, dogs have been chasing me... No one's been chasing me lately. What happened to your last boyfriend? The one who'd always go to the gym after visiting you, then have lunch at that place downtown? You know his taillight's broken. I'm not seeing him anymore. Well, does that mean there might be a chance for me? Almost anyone's got a chance now. Goodbye, thanks for coming. If my party made you sick, tell your friends! Sweet Lizzie McGuire! You think that's traumatic. Mr. Stomach, are you hungry? I'm always hungry. Now make with the pizza, Fatso. You're the stomach! I have to do this for work. So Milhouse walks into the bedroom, and there's his Mom and Dad going... Oh, Mr. Van Houten, I love when you kiss me! Yeah, yeah, kissing ladies is the best. Oh baby, kiss my mouth. Kiss me like we're in a fancy hotel. All right, we get it! Marge, what's happening to me? Oh Homie, you got chicken pox. But how? I don't know. I kept away from Maggie all day. I'm so itchy! Oh yeah. Son, we want to talk about what you saw in the Simpsons' house. Well, I didn't see anything to get my hopes up, if that's what you mean. Well, maybe you should get your hopes up a little. They're already up! They're sky-high! Your father and I are going through what's called a ""trial un-separation."" And son, I wanna make one thing clear. Unlike the breakup, this is not your fault. I can't believe it! Our family might get back together again! I haven't daydreamed in color in so long. Oh, thank God. We were afraid we lost you, son. You sit in this oatmeal awhile, and it'll send your itchies packing! Homer! Mmm... Homer-oats. Stop eating the oatmeal! That's the third tub you've eaten! Y'ello? No, I'm not coming into work. I have chicken pox. I know I said that last month, but I was lying. Right... right... right... right... okay... right. I love you, bye! I just got fired. Better check the ""Want Ads."" Ooh! ""Truck drivers needed in Iraq."" Trucks are like big cars. Okay, Luann. For honesty's sake, we should probably talk about everyone we dated while we were separated. Well, the Sea Captain and I... Yeah, okay, I don't wanna know! I don't wanna know! I don't wanna know! So what are we going to do as a family today? Mini-golf? Pedal boats? Indoor rock wall? Um, Milly... Botanical garden? Build-A-Bear Workshop? Arena Football with the Springfield Stun? Not today, big guy. Your Dad and I need more time to get... reacquainted. Why are you laughing? Tell me! Private jokes are rude. Uh son, here's ten bucks. Why don't you go to the bowling alley and throw some solo balls? But it's league night! This trial un-separation stinks. My parents used to compete for my love, and I cashed in every time. And I always got the spillover. Drive-in movies, two Christmases, soda with dinner -- we lived like kings! Remember when you told my Dad to go to bed and he did? That was some New Years. Now listen. I think we should consider breaking your parents up again. I don't know, Bart. I've wanted them back together for so long. Look, you know they're gonna separate again. So why don't we just speed up the process? You know, Bart, my imaginary friend never made me do things I thought were wrong. That's why he had to go away forever. I thought you were gonna let him come back! I'm afraid he has to spend another year searching for his brain. Luann, I'm moving my stuff back in! Uh, Dad... Mom says you're stinky and gross. Your mother said that? This is so great! I mean, she used to keep her criticisms all bottled up... until they destroyed our marriage. And I guess I am a little funky. Well, this is what cologne samples are for! Mom, I don't wanna get Dad in trouble... but he just let me drink a beer. Hm. Looks like we have a problem here. The problem being that you are addicted to fibbing. I am drunk -- I'll prove it! Watch me... kiss this picture of Nana. I can't do it. She's so mean to me. She wouldn't let me eat Fruit Loops! Maybe my Mom and Dad are meant to be together, Bart. You'd better hope not, 'cause you know what comes next? Your worst nightmare: a baby sister. Hi, Bart. I baked you some cookies. Skanks for nothing, Lamerella. If you two don't mind, I'd like to watch that cool Fox show about teenagers in Orange County. Austin, I was looking for my belly ring in your recording studio and I found this! Does this, or does this not, belong to Feather? Sorry, Jade. That's how we light it up in the O.C. You cheated on me! Our mixed-race fling is so over! Whatever. Let's score some jam at Knott's Berry Farm. For sure, dog. We'll be kickin' it old-school at Bigfoot Rapids. Gonna get my flume on... log style! I bet that bra was planted by Sterling, to break them up. That's a brilliant idea. Those TV writers are geniuses! Whatever they're paid, it's not enough. This bra is really gonna lift and separate: lift your mother's suspicions and separate your parents! Milhouse! I need slender fingers to get me a pickle! This isn't mine. I have a message for your wife: stop sleeping with my husband! Okey-doke. And you are... The wife of your wife's lover! Will she know what this is regarding? You moron! Marge is having an affair with Kirk! That's ridiculous! No woman would want to have sex with that loser! And, uh, congratulations on snagging him back. Good stuff. Never mind about those two. Just answer me one question. How did your wife's bra end up in my husband's bed? This-this is Marge's bra. I bought it for her boobs! Of all the people for Marge to cheat on, why did it have to be me? Oh boy, am I beat! If you wanna return a melon to the grocery store, clear your day! Well, that answers the mystery of the missing melon, but I have one more question: did you sleep with Kirk Van Houten? How could you ask me that? I repeat: did you sleep with Kirk? Homer, you're crazy! You're not saying no. Fine... No! I'm still not hearing no. No, no, no! Well, methinks the lady doth protest too much! You don't trust me? After I salved every chicken pock on your ungrateful body! How dare you! Get out of this house! Gladly. We tried to break up your parents and we broke up mine! Wanna call my therapist and tell her how you feel? Hello, Dr. Wexler? Stop calling me! I'm on my honeymoon! Yeah, it's that weird kid again. Dad, I thought Mom kicked you out of the house. I came to get my mail. Resident... occupant... I can't open these. Ooh, a traffic ticket! I'd do anything to get your mother and that donut back. Okay look, you and Mom can fix this. What exactly happened between the two of you? Lisa, we don't need to know how. It's just a natural thing that happens, like a hurricane or going to war. Well, I'd better go. Where are you staying? You know the Four Seasons? Well, I'm experiencing them first hand, because I'm living in the park. Bart, I think you're behind this whole thing. Yeah, I can see how you'd think that. But on the other hand... I can read you like a book. Ha, ha, you read books. If you don't tell Mom what you did, I will. Oh come on, wouldn't it be easier if our parents divorced and you compensated by marrying much older men? Meanwhile, I'll be one of those weird guys who's thirty-five and shows up at high school basketball games. Why did I marry that selfish jerk? I've asked him to flip the mattress a thousand times, and he never does! Uh, Mom? Hi, sweetie. Uh... you know that bra that broke up our family? Uh-hmm. Well, I looked into it, and it turns out I was responsible. Really? Well, just for that I'm gonna erase all the saved games on your PlayStation. What?! How do you know about things like that? I learned about it in here. But now Dad can come home, right? No. But he's innocent. Innocent?! After all I do for your father, he still doesn't trust me. I'm finished with him. Does this mean you and Dad might get a D-A-V-U-R-S? Young man, you go work on your spelling... or I'll delete all the custom ring tones from your cell phone! Nooo!!!!! Milhouse, our reverse parent trap just made everything worse. Maybe we should use a different movie as our guide. Like ""Oklahoma."" OH THE FARMER AND THE COWMAN SHOULD BE FRIENDS / OH, THE FARMER AND THE COWMAN SHOULD BE FRIENDS ONE MAN LIKES TO PUSH A PLOUGH THE OTHER LIKES TO CHASE A COW BUT THAT'S NO REASON WHY THEY CAIN'T BE FRIENDS. What do you think, Bart? A hoedown could solve all our problems. I just need your chap size. It's two more than your pant size. How many times do I have to tell you: no Rodgers and Hammerstein! Rodgers and Hart? No! Well, what will trick your parents into getting back together? Enough with the tricks! Stupid movie schemes do not work in real life. Mom and Dad have a marriage on the rocks and they need to work through it in therapy to make sure it doesn't shatter. Rocks... shatter... jagged cliff... Lis, you've just given me an idea for the most insane, hair-brained, fool-proof scheme ever! Okay. When Mom and Dad see this dummy fall in the river, they'll think it's me, and they'll realize what really matters: each other. Do you like the dummy, Bart? I even made it smell like you. Now, to make sure Homer and Marge are in proper viewing position... So, I got your note saying you wanted to meet here to apologize. Well, I got your note saying you were gonna bring me a bucket of potato salad. Where's my apology? Where's my bucket? Now, I'll get my Mom and Dad's attention, and you shove the dummy in the water. Any questions? Yeah. What are you going as for Halloween? Pile of dog doo. Let's roll. Mom, Dad! I'm playing on a dangerous cliff -- because you're too busy arguing to pay attention to me! Bart! We're all disappointed there's no potato salad! But for God's sake, don't jump! Now! I can't tell which is which. Oh no! I'm already running! I did it, Bart! Bart? I'm a-comin', boy! This is all my fault! I planted Mom's bra in Milhouse's parents' bed! Why you little... Homer! I can save you both! Just let go of the rock! Just do it! Trust me! Okay. Mom... Dad. I'd give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together. Make it two kajillion. Homer! We'll lose the first kajillion to taxes. Well, I guess you showed you do trust me after all. Of course I do. The only thing I can't believe is that a woman as great as you would be married to me. Oh, Homie... I don't want to live in a world without Bart! Can he swim?
