107,108,"NO SPORTS, NO ROCK, NO INFORMATION / FOR MINDLESS CHATTER, WE'RE YOUR STATION! KBBL Talk Radio. And now, Springfield's favorite conservative, and author of the well-selling book ""Only Turkeys Have Left Wings,"" ladies and gentlemen, Birch Barlow! Ugh. That Barlow's a right-wing crackpot! He said Ted Kennedy lacked integrity. Can you believe that?! Yeah, switch the station. I consider myself politically correct, and his views make me uncomfortable. Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, guys. Now, I'm not very political -- I usually think people who vote are a bit ""fruit-y"" -- but, for some reason, this Birch Barlow really speaks to me... Good morning, fellow freedom-likers. Birch Barlow, the fourth branch of government, the fifty-first state. You know, there are three things we're never gonna get rid of here in Springfield. One: the bats in the Public Library... Two: Mrs. McFearly's compost heap. And three: our six-term mayor, the illiterate, tax-cheating, wife-swapping, pot-smoking Spend-o-crat -- Diamond Joe Quimby! Hey, I am no longer illiterate. Now why are we doomed to this Quimby quagmire, you ask, o reasonable listener? Because this town is under the stranglehold of a few tie-dyed tree huggers who would rather play hackey-sack than lock up the homeless. This sounds awfully controversial. Lisa, you know I don't like controversy in this house. I don't like him either Mom, but I'm doing a report on local politics for my school project. You think you're so big 'cause your class always gets to do projects. Well, um... I'm doing a school project on, uh, fireworks! Bart, I wish you wouldn't lie like that. Now, as a special send-off and a way to say ""Gung hay fat choy"" to our visiting Chinese principals, Bart Simpson has promised us a fireworks display! All week he promise big firework display! Bad student. Bad principal. ...so my friends, let's just junk those Dumb-o-crats and their bleeding heart smell-fare program! Dad, I had to listen to this jerk all morning. Can we listen to something else? When I'm driving the car, I get to choose the radio station. When you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station. I can't take this anymore. Let's switch back. Alright my friends, now let's go to the phones. First up is Bob, from South Springfield. Welcome to you, sir. Hello, Birch. Long-time listener, first-time caller. Kudos for bringing the ""public"" back to the Re""public""an party! It's high time people realized we conservatives aren't all Johnny Hate-mongers and Charlie Bible-thumps, or even -- God forbid -- George Bushes! That sounds like Sideshow Bob! Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob. Yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box. Dad, I'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who Sideshow Bob is. Phew. Sideshow Bob used to be Krusty the Clown's sidekick. But in 1990, he framed Krusty for armed robbery and Bart got him put in jail. Uh-huh. When he got out, he married Aunt Selma and tried to murder her. Oh, Sideshow Bob. Bart! Your mortal enemy is on the radio! It's time for more deeee-mentia with Dr. Demento! And now the ""Funny Five..."" I meant your other mortal enemy, Sideshow Bob. Sideshow Bob! I'm only ten and I already got two mortal enemies. ...and uh this proposed expressway will bring increased commerce to our local merchants. What's in it for us? Yeah, give us something we like, or we'll ride ya out of town on a rail! Well uh, what do you, er, people like? Sleep. Sexy dames, and plenty of 'em! Matlock!! Well, uh, I suppose I could name it the uh, ""Matlock Expressway."" ...but it would be terribly myopic of me to blame all my current woes on one spikey-haired little simpleton. Mm hm. Myopic, or to say the least, intransigent. Now, you mentioned some ""woes"" there... Well -- you see, Birch, I'm presently incarcerated. Convicted of a crime I didn't even commit. ""Attempted"" murder. Now, honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for ""Attempted"" Chemistry? Do they -- Oh really, now! This is a personal call! Now, m-m-my Friends, isn't this just typical? Another intelligent conservative here railroaded by our liberal justice system -- just like Colonel Oliver North, Officer Stacey Koon, and cartoon smokesperson Joe Camel. Well, I've had it!! I am gonna make it my mission to see that our friend Bob is set free! Nooooo!! Well, despite Bart's objections, the people of South Africa can now vote in free Democratic elections. My friends, Bob is a political prisoner. I want every loyal listener to do everything they can to get him out of jail! All right, you heard the man. One grenade each. Moe, I think he meant through non-violent grass-roots political action. Aw, geez... really ya think so? All right, give 'em back. Come on, everybody give 'em back. Hey, hey, who pulled the pin on this one? Free Bob! Free Bob! Very well. If that is the way the winds are blowing, let no one say I don't also blow. By special order of the Mayor of Springfield, you are hereby granted a full and complete pardon. Congratulations, Robert Onderdonk Terwilliger. Boat's on the other side. Yes! Thank you! Hail, brothers! Quoronon cillairia ozu mahoq! Mahoq! Mahoq! Now, then. Gentlemen, the mayoral campaign is upon us and if we hope to defeat this Joe Quimby we need a candidate with name recognition and media savvy. A true leader who will do exactly as he's told. Monty, I'm way ahead of you. If you'll just open that door you'll see the next mayor of Springfield. Whu'd it say? No, no. Bob! Bob, come in! A fine ""Mahoq"" to you all. Why, he's even better. I agree. I like the human touch. Now, students, I want you to be on your best behavior for this carefully-choreographed media event. Now this means there is to be no wising-off, no face-making, and no grass-eating. This means you, Ralph. Yes, sir. Hello, children. Hello, Bart. Eep. Young friends, my opponent Joe Quimby is confused about your school system. Do you know what he does? He flip-flops. Sometimes he doesn't know whether he's coming or going. He wants to sell your future short! Hmm. Bart, we can't let Bob steal the spotlight. We're gonna have to stoop to the lowest common denominator. I can do that. Ack! Help! I'm being attacked by uh things! Uncle Mayor was just saying that us kids are the most important natural resource we have! More important than coal? Er, uh, er yes. Ohh, that was a big mistake, Bart! No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it! Stay out of Riverdale! WITHOUT A MAYOR QUIMBY / OUR TOWN WOULD REALLY STINK! / WE WOULDN'T HAVE A TIRE YARD / OR A MID-SIZE ROLLER RINK! / WE WOULDN'T HAVE OUR GALLOWS / OR OUR SHINY BIGFOOT TRAPS! / IT'S NOT THE MAYOR'S FAULT / THAT THE STADIUM COLLAPSED. Quimby. If you were running for Mayor, he'd vote for you. Paid for by the Mayor Quimby for Mayor Mayoral Committee. Hey, Four-eyes! Vote Quimby! Hey, Beard-o! Vote Quimby! This time, he's the lesser of two evils. Uh, yeah, yeah. I love Grimby. Uh, could I have some more bumper stickers, please dude? All right! The mummy's ready for his mystical journey! What's haaappening?! That Quimby fella promised to build us a Matlock Expressway! How you gonna top that, smart guy? Hmm. Oh how's this? I'll not only build the Expressway, I will spend the remainder of this afternoon patiently listening to your interminable anecdotes. Hot ziggity zam! Me first! Not many people know I owned the first radio in Springfield. Warn't much on the air then, just Edison reciting the alphabet over and over. ""A"" he'd say, then ""B""; ""C"" would usually follow... Mayor Quimby supports revolving-door prisons. Mayor Quimby even released Sideshow Bob, a man twice convicted of attempted murder. Can you trust a man like Mayor Quimby? Vote Sideshow Bob for Mayor. The League of Uninformed Voters presents the Springfield Mayoral Debates. I'm your moderator, Larry King. Now, a word to our audience: Even though we're being broadcast on Fox, there is no need for obnoxious hooting and hollering. I shouldn't have shaken hands with those old people. I hope that flu doesn't affect his performance out there. Don't worry. He's taken a million of these capsules. Sideshow Bob: Councilman Les Wynan says that you're not experienced enough to be mayor. Sir, what do you have to say about that? I'd say that Les Wynan ought to do more thinkin' and less whinin'! There's no Councilman Les Wynan. Good line, though. Mayor Quimby, you are well-known, sir, for your lenient stance on crime. But suppose for a second that your house was ransacked by thugs, your family tied up in the basement with socks in their mouths. You try to open the door -- but there's too much blood on the knob-- What is your question? My question is about the budget, sir... Hmm. I don't agree with his Bart-killing policy, but I do approve of his Selma-killing policy. Well, he framed me for armed robbery, but man, I'm achin' for that upper-class tax cut. Shh! And the results are in. For Sideshow Bob -- one hundred per cent. For Joe Quimby -- one per cent. And we remind you there is a one per cent margin of error. All right let's go, live, to Bob Headquarters now, for Mayor Terwilliger's victory speech. And just look how happy he is! It's the Rapture! Quick, get Bart out of the house before God comes! So sorry, Mr. Simpson. Your house is blocking construction of our new Matlock Expressway. Now, I am a fair man. You will have seventy-two hours to vacate. At that time, we will blow up your house and any remaining Simpsons. Homer, we've got to stop them. I know what you're up to, Mayor Terwigajer. And no one in my family's gonna stand for it! Move your god darned house, Son! Bart, by special request of the Mayor's office, you are going to be left back. You mean I have to repeat the fourth grade? Well, yes... but, not for four or five years. Bart, you're going to kindergarten. Kindergarten? Ha! Now boys and girls, who knows what this is? Triangle. Very good, Bart. You have first choice of toys for free play. Cool! I call the Flintstone Phone! Yabba dabba doo! I like talking to you! We're gonna lose our house and end up living under a bridge like common trolls. I don't think Bob won that election legally. I can't believe a convicted felon would get so many votes and another convicted felon would get so few. Here you go. The results of last month's mayoral election. All forty-eight thousand voters and who each one of them voted for. I thought this was a secret ballot. Meh. Okay, Aaron A. Aaronson voted for... Bob. Aaron L. Aaronson voted for... Bob. Arthur B. Ablabab voted for... Bob. Hey! So whoever it is who wrote that note wants to meet us here tonight? This is so cool, Bart. We're just like Woodward and Bernstein! Yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading Archie comics. Stuck-up Riverdale punks. Think they're too good for me. You're on the right track. Follow the names. How the hell do you know? I can't tell you who I am, but I worked on the campaign. Hey, Mr. Smithers! Well, you might as well give me a ride home now! I've never gone behind Mr. Burns' back before, but Sideshow Bob's ultra-conservative views conflict with my, choice of lifestyle. All I can do is give you one name. Edgar Neubauer. Find him and you'll find your answer. No Edgar Neubauer. This is hopeless. They're gonna demolish our house for sure. We're gonna have to move into a Motel 6. But dad can't afford six dollars a night. Heyyy... Lis! Lis! C'mere! I found him! I found Edgar Neubauer! Oh my God! The dead have risen and they're voting Republican! No, Bart, don't you see? Dead people can't vote! Look! Prudence Goodwyfe, died 1641. She voted for Bob, too! So did Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, and the Big Bopper! Even the pet cemetery voted for Bob! Look! Mr. and Mrs. Bananas! Humphrey Boa-gart! Oh, my poor dead kitty! Please, not you too! All right, Bob! Now it's personal!! Hey, uh, he did try to kill me... Mr. Mayor, is it true you rigged the election? No, I did not. Kids, help. Oh, I don't mind. We want these children to feel justice has been served. That way, they can sleep soundly tonight on their hard, feculent motel pillows. Well, Bart, Lisa, here I am. I have a plan. I think we can trap him. You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you when you say you're innocent... Indeed I am. Because we all know you're a naive pawn, puppet, if you will, of the most diabolical political genius Springfield has ever known -- Birchibald T. Barlow! You don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do you? You were just Barlow's lackey! You were Ronnie to his Nancy! Sonny to his Cher! Ringo to his rest of the Beatles! Enough! Lies, lies, lies! I did it! I did it all! There! Is that what you want, you smarmy little bastards?! We want the truth! You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! No truth-handler, you! Bah! I deride your truth-handling abilities! Would you get to the point? Yes. Only I could have executed such a masterpiece of electoral fraud. And I have the records to prove it! Here, just look at these! Each one a work of Machiavellian art! But why? Because you need me, Springfield! Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside, you secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! That's why I did this -- to protect you from yourselves! Now, if you don't mind, I have a city to run. Bailiffs! Place the Mayor under arrest! What? Oh, yes. All that stuff I did... Bart! We did it! Now we get to keep our house, and you get to go back to fourth grade! Aww. Tomorrow we were gonna find out who the dish ran away with. The spoon, Bart. Of course! Someday, I'll have my vengeance. Someday, when I find my way out of this savage, roach-ridden cesspool... Say, Terwilliger's a Yalie. Bob, come along! We need an eighth to row against the Princeton alums! Princeton? Row. Row.
