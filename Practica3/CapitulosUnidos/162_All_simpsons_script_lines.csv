159,162,"Oh, why do they have to put all this crud in my newspaper? ""World""... ""The Arts""... ""Religion"" Aha! Here it is: ""Kickin' Back!"" Hey, who cut something out of my paper? Not me. Not me. I'm more of a mail-tamperer. Well, don't look at me... just because I'm holding a pair of scissors. Scissors which I need... to uh... to gussy-up these curtains. Hello? Oh, hi, Lenny... No. Why would I need a ride this afternoon? Where? To the big annual what? Lenny? Aw, well. If it was big and annual I'm sure they'd have mentioned it in the newspaper. Yeah, it's a lazy dog-dangling afternoon. But something's a little off... Hey, Marge, you don't smoke! Well, I just felt like filling the house with the rich, satisfying smell of tobacco. You're nuts. I gotta get some fresh air. No, Homie, wait! What's wrong with you? What are you trying to hide from m-- What's that smell? Onions... Chili powder... Cumin... Juicy ground chuck... It's chili! Oh my God, I'm missing the Chili Cook-Off! I'm missing the Cook-Off! It's going on right now and I'm missin' it! All right, I was trying to keep it from you, but I had a good reason. Every time you go to that cook-off, you get drunk as a poet on payday. Remember last year? Look at me! I'm a puffy pink cloud! Oh, well, of course... everything looks bad if you remember it. Now where are my chili boots? Ah! Okay, we'll go to the Chili Cook-Off. But I want you to promise me you won't have any beer. Okay, quit naggin' me. I won't have any beer. Geez, why don't you have a cigarette or something? Mmm, I suppose I could... I'm gonna go get some vegetarian chili before they get desperate and add meat. I'm gonna go claim some valuables at the Lost and Found. Ooh, look at that adorable spice rack! Eight spices! Oh, some must be doubles. ""Or-uh-GAHN-o?"" What the hell...? Marge, we're missing the chili! Less artsy, more fartsy! Homer, I happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my face. Fine. I'll come find you when I'm ready to stop having fun. Remember your promise: no drinking. Stupor Pooper. Howdy howdy, Marge and Hom-- oh, my mistake, Homer's not even with you! Probably just knocking back a few ""refreshments."" Thank you for your concern, Helen. Homer isn't drinking today. Oh. I think it's lovely that he said that... and that you believed him! Now, Helen, let us not glory in Homer's binge-drinking. There but for the grace of God goes Marge herself. Oh, man, he's here! The dude with the fireproof stomach! The spoon! They say he carved it himself, from a bigger spoon. Five-alarm chili, eh? Um-hm. One... two... Hey, what's the big idea? Oh, I admit it! It's only two-alarm -- two-and-a-half tops! I just wanted to be a big man in front of the kids. Daddy, are you going to jail? We'll see, son. We'll see. Evenin', little lady. Do you reckon a square could get a dance? It looks so complicated... Do you know how? Ma'am, I wouldn't honk the honk if I couldn't tonk the tonk. Woo-woo! Hmmm. A bland, timid entry -- suitable, perhaps, for patients recovering from surgery. Heh, heh, heh. That Simpson, he thinks he's the Pope of Chilitown. Well, this year I am ready for him! Hello, Chief. Afternoon, Homer. Care for some chili? I've added an extra ingredient just for you. The merciless peppers of Quetzlzacatenango! Grown deep in the jungle primeval by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum. Uh, Wiggy...? My chili's gettin' cold. Hot! Hot! Beer! Gimme some beer! Homer! You promised you wouldn't drink! But I need it! Aw, lousy Wiggum. Now the whole town thinks I'm a chili wuss... Wait, mister! You're drinking a candle! You don't wanna get wax in your mouth, do you? Maybe I do, son. Maybe I do. Outstanding. Hey, everybody, look who's back! It's the biiig baby! Oh, this porridge is too hot! Oh, waah waah waah! Want some more, do ya? Well, sure! Heck, it's not my job to talk people outta killin' themselves... More, please. Good Lord! This can't be happening! By all medical logic, steam should be shootin' out of his ears! His ears if we're lucky! Well, Chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is. Heh, heh! My finest hour! And Marge wasn't even here to see it. Ooh. I don't feel so good. Flanders! You gotta help me! Sure, buddy, I'd be happy to... ...help out. What can I do-diddily-do...diddily-doodily-diddily-hoobily-hobbily-hibbily-gooble-gobble-gooble-gooble-gabba-gabba-hey? Goo-goo-ga-joob? Haw! Haw!... Haw! Haw! Hey, mister, do you need some hel-- Let him go, Ralph. He knows what he's doing. What's happening to me? Okay, retrace your steps... woke up, fought with Marge, ate Guatemalan insanity peppers. Then I -- Ohhhh. Where am I? Shelbyville? Man, this is crazy. I hope I didn't brain my damage. I'd better check my pupils... Oh... kay. I think I'm gonna be leaving now. Huh? Sunrise, sunset... Sunrise, sunset... SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET... Note to self: stop doing anything. Has anyone seen Homer? Marge, better you hear it from me than some gossipy neighbor -- Homer made a total jackass of himself. Oh, Helen, that's enough. Call off your dogs. Oh, but someone had to tell her. And I got here first! Helen, zip it! Zip! Oh, please... Tim!... Ziparoo! No beer, huh? I guess I know what a promise from Homer J. Simpson is worth. Hey buddy! Get back there with the other rocks! Huh? A tortoise? Follow... the... This must be why I'm here! Follow the what? Follow the what? Hurry up! Get moving, you stupid... When I'm kicking you, that means ""hurry up"". Come on! Oh. You want me to climb that, huh? No problemo. This is 'cause I kicked you, isn't it? Lis, check it out. Time for chili. I saw it, Bart. You're just mad cause there's no clock in your hat. What hat? Aw, this baby's wasted on an idiot like you. Where's Homer? Your father decided he'd rather come home in a taxi. Or a police car. Marge! Thank God you're here! Where's the car? Marge? Marge? Oh, now what? If you're still mad at me, I'm gonna be really mad. Come on, Marge! Will you... Fight fair! I never do this to you! Talk to me!! Aw, I hate this place! Why am I here?! You are on a quest for knowledge. Who said that? Fear not, Homer. I am your spirit guide. Hiya. There is a lesson you must learn. If it's about laying off the insanity peppers, I'm way ahead of you. No, I speak of a deeper wisdom. The problem, Homer, is that the mind is always chattering away, with a thousand thoughts at once. Yeah, that's me all right. Clarity is the path to inner peace. But what should I do? Should I meditate? Should I get rid of all my possessions? Are you kidding? If anything, you should get more possessions. You don't even have a computer! You know, I have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and I would -- Hey!! Knock it off! Sorry. I am a coyote... Look, just gimme some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with ya. Good. Your mind is in a state of readiness. So listen well: To make yourself complete, you must find your soul mate. Soul mate? Your kindred spirit. The one with whom you share an unspoken bond... a profound, mystical understanding. That's it? Well, that's Marge. Big deal. Great spiritual quest, wolfie. My soul mate is Marge. Is it? Hey, wait! Come back!... A ghost train! And so little time to get out of the way!... Now less!... Now none! Hey, get off the course, you bum! Security! Wha? Golf course? Did I dream that whole thing? Maybe the desert was just this sand trap... Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid was just the Pro Shop! And that talking coyote was really just a talking dog. Hi, Homer. Find your soul mate. Hey, wait a minute. There's no such thing as a talking dog. Damn straight. So then I says to Mabel, I says... Hi, kids. I'll finish this later. Hi, Dad. Where's your mother? Out back. So anyway, I says to Mabel, I says... Hi, honey. Uh-oh. I guess you're cranky because I didn't come home last night... I'm ""cranky"" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town. You broke your promise, Homer. Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk. I just went to a strange fantasy world. C'mon, you gotta believe me. You're my soul mate. Don't ""soul mate"" me! Okay. That coyote said my soul mate would understand me, but Marge doesn't understand me at all. Maybe we're not kindred spirits. We don't have anything in common... Look at these records! Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, the Doodletown Pipers! Now look at her records... They stink! Maybe I had that crazy dream for a reason... Wherever my soul mate is, it's not here. ...I always just figured my wife was my soul mate. But if it's not Marge, then who is it? Where do I begin looking? This really goes beyond my training as a furniture salesman, sir. Now if you don't want the sofa, I'll have to ask you to leave. Hey, Barney! Soul mate! Let me buy you a beer. Okay, but I'm not your soul mate. I'm really more of a chum. Well what about you, Lenny? I'm a crony. Carl? I'd say acquaintance. Call me sympathizer. Compadre. Associate. Contemporary. I'm a well-wisher, in that I don't wish you any specific harm. Hello? Is this G-B-M? Uh, yeah. I read in the personals you were seeking a soul mate and, well, I also like rainy days and movies. Uh huh... uh, no, I don't like that. Or that. No, it's not that I'm afraid. I'm gonna hang up now. Bye-bye. Oh, I give up. Find your soul mate, Homer. Find your soul mate. Where? Where?! This is just your memory. I can't give you any new information. Huh. What's that blinking light? The lighthouse keeper! The loneliest man in the world! He'll understand me! Earl. My new friend's name is Earl! Here I come, buddy! No more loneliness for Homer and Earl.... A machine? Earl's a machine. Oh, that's just perfect! Homer's desperate search for a soul mate has yielded a lighthouse-keeping robot! Oh, wow! Hey, look! Is that Dad? Either that or Batman has really let himself go. Alone! I'm alone! I'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun! A ship! A ship with people! I know... I'll bring them to me! And then they'll have to be my friends! Come here, people! Arr, Matey, nary a warning light to be seen. 'Tis clear sailing ahead for our precious cargo. Uh... would that be the hotpants, sir? Aye... the hotpants. Well, I won't be lonely for long.... Oh, Homer, thank goodness you're safe! Marge? I woke up and you weren't there, and I was so worried... Really? You were? But how did you find me? Well, I was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public transportation is for losers. And I was sure you'd head west, because Springfield slopes down that way. And then I saw the lighthouse, and I remembered how you love blinking lights... like the one on the waffle iron... Or that little guy on the ""Don't Walk"" sign. Yeah. Wow, Marge, you really do understand me. See, I thought we weren't soul mates because... ...we had a fight? Right, and we don't like the same things. It's like you're from Venus... ...and you're from Mars. Oh, sure. Give me the one with all the monsters. Homer, don't you see? Our differences are only skin-deep... ...But our sames go right down to the bone. Maybe we do have a... ...a profound mystical understanding? Hey... we do! Oh, Marge! We're number one! We're number one! In your face, space coyote! Space coyote? Omigod! The ship! We'll all be killed! The light! We gotta get the light back on! Jonathan Livingston Seagull! We're on a collision course! Hard a-starboard! Um, port. Aye, port. They see us! They're starting to turn! We did it! We sure did... soul mate. Look at all them hot pants! Hey! Who likes short shorts? We like short shorts!","Ralph Wiggum, Mayor Joe Quimby, Carl Carlson, Waylon Smithers, Chief Wiggum, Furniture Salesman, Bumblebee Man, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Helen Lovejoy, Kent Brockman, Crowd, Homer Simpson, Coyote, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Sam, Krusty the Clown, Lenny Leonard, Rev.
