514,521,"No, you're watching Baby Poindexter, the most educational DVD available at the checkout aisle at the grocery store! Finally, a kids' show that isn't trying to sell you something. Which reminds me, we need to order more rectangles. Friends? Friends. Colleagues. Don't watch that DVD! I threw that away because studies show it doesn't do any good! Look at me! Maybe instead of watching TV with the kids, you could take them outside and... what are you doing? This so-called educational DVD may have even stunted the development of the kids who watched it! Wait a minute. Didn't Bart and I both watch this thing when we were little? I'm afraid so. Well, the obvious question is... why did I turn out so... academically superior... while Bart-- While Bart turned out so wonderful in his own way! That's the way people talk about Ralph! Ralph, whose favorite color is peanut butter! I wish I knew what happened... Aooga... aooga... aooga... And now that I know better, no DVDs for you kids. Just educational television. We return to ""Ice-road Hand-fishing."" This has been our way of life since we were pitched the idea by reality show producers. Welcome to ""Thievin' Bear Chopper Hunt."" Okay, no TV at all. What?! Honey, this sounds like a noble experiment, but like prohibition, it will end in a hail of bullets. Fine, no TV for twenty-four hours. Twenty-four hours? Where'd you pull that crazy number? We can do without TV for a day! We're taking Maggie to a children's bookstore, where she can learn the old-fashioned way -- the way children did from nineteen-ten to two thousand and two. Homer, a little help? I'm on it. If I buy you, why do I need all these books? Shut up, shut up, shut up! Instead of watching TV, we can read children's books written by TV stars! Who's Milli Vanilli? I don't know, kid. I didn't write this. No refunds. Look, Maggie! They have a story lady! One day Silly Sally said ""Let's have a sloppy gloppy supper."" First they slurped their soup. Slurp, slurp, slurp! Then they chewed their bread. Chew, chew, chew! ""More soup?"" ""I could slurp this soup forever!"" Slurp, slurp... Sorry, folks. She doesn't even work here. Spot the Hidden Objects. Boy, you're pretty pushy for a book I just met. Gotcha! Candy cane in the umbrella stand -- oldest trick in the book... okay, let's see... Have you seen Lisa and Maggie? If they're not a trumpet or a rolling pin, then ""no."" Homie, help me find them. Okay, now to see if I can apply my book knowledge to the real world. Got 'em! Wow, no TV for twenty-four hours. I couldn't get through a day without Doctors Oz, Phil, and Gupta. You're right, I'm bored. Epoxy fight! What the hell is an Epoxy fight?! Don't worry, I'll clean it up. Get me some whipped cream and a safety scissors. Don't worry, all I need is a cigarette lighter and some sandpaper. All right, let's just use a razor. Oh my God, you look just like your dad! Let's see how far we can take this... And finally, the tie. I always wanted to wear a necktie. Mom says they make you more-- --of a man. Now sing the alphabet song! A-B-C-D-E-F-G- H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O What if we... Van Houten to the max? Whoa! That's a little too tight! Oh yeah! Nah. Back to the sweet spot. Milhouse, if people believe you're a grownup, we could do anything. Like we go to a movie theater and pay full price! That would be awesome!!! Okay, first, tone it down. Time to teach you to be a man. What? Now I'm not pulling it off? ...and put the gas bill on... autopay. Nice. Time for your final test. Oh great, another invasive Skype from Mil-- huh? Hello, Lisa. This is my Daddy... I mean, um, Kirk Van Houten. May I speak to your father, please? He's right here. Homer, Bart would like to spend the night at our house, and he has my permission. Sure, what do I care? Not so fast! I also want to say that Bart is a remarkable boy, and I disapprove of your fathering and of your fat stomach. Give him anything he wants -- bigger allowance, a new bike -- just do it. Whatever you say, sir. Dad, why are you kowtowing to Mr. Van Houten? Sometimes it's just so nice to have a man take charge. And in ten years, make Lisa go to the prom with Milhouse. Dad?! Grownups have their reasons! Now I want you to eat a gallon of ice cream in under two minutes. But I just did that! You now have one minute, fifty-five seconds. I'm gonna like being an adult. Now you're the same height as your Dad. I can reach the poisons now! Each with an inviting skull and crossbones. Kirk? You're wearing that shirt I bought you. I thought you didn't like it. I love when you buy me clothes! You know what's itchy and what's not. Oh Kirk Evelyn Van Houten! I wish my Dad could've been here to see my parents kiss. Now, did you get Kirk's license? Uh-huh! Ay carumba! I rented a truck! I'm driving a truck! I crashed a truck! I rented another truck! Hey Simpson! Don't you have a lame Dad of your own? I'd give you all money but my wallet is velcroed too tight! You're the wussiest adult I've ever seen. An adult! He's buyin' it! ""Kirk,"" remember you have the super-powers of a middle-aged man. Hello, Mr. Kirk. I want to buy this beer, uh, cigarettes, magazines with boobs, and three pairs of sunglasses... Polarized! I suspect you are buying for underage bullies. But as that is ninety-eight percent of my business, I say thank you, sir! Come again! Yo, Bart, your grown man friend is all right. We should start threatening more adults. Wouldn't that make us criminals instead of bullies? Let's beat up a philosopher till he gives us the answer. I made my Mom happy and got through the bullies without a punch. Being an adult is super easy! You dope. It says those are for her pleasure. Now it's time for me to live my fantasy with mature themes. I'll go behind that curtain a boy, but come out a man. Hm... more money for schools? That could translate into more homework. I know this is highly illegal, but you're not leaving this booth till you punch ""yes."" Don't bother screaming for help... this is a municipal, off-cycle election. There's no one for miles. Don't forget your sticker. Hey bartender. We'd like two milks and then you can tell us where babies come from. Well, in my case my Mom was hit with a voodoo curse, I gestated for five years, then I popped out backwards and on fire. Really? Keep my tail right here in this jar. Good times. Mom, I think Maggie misses TV. You know Mom, I was thinking we could take Maggie downtown. ""The Jazz Hole"" is featuring a Dizzy Gillespie tribute band. Their trumpeter has the puffiest cheeks... I don't think so. The U.S. Embassy has warned people not to go to downtown Springfield. I get it. Middle child. Never do what I want. Okay, I also know of a puppet show... Long before the Teutonic slaughters visited upon our people, there was the massacre by Mstislov of Kiev in 1132. Maybe we should go. Nobody leave till every puppet dead! Bart? You wanted to show me something? Just one sec: Nelson gave me some notes on a prank I'm doing. Now, I asked you here because I know a cool grownup who will take you to that club in the city. Really? Who? Hello, Lisa. Milhouse? Milhouse? Who's Milhouse? I mean, he's my son. Well, Milhouse, you might get past the bouncer at the jazz club because they're in no position to turn anyone away. But it doesn't matter, 'cause we can't pay for the gas and the cover fee anyway. Au contraire, starfish hair! The Baby Poindexter Company is being forced to pay a settlement to any parent who had enough misguided love to buy their videos. They're not gonna write a check to a couple of kids. Then I will be your guys' dad! Thanks, but lowering your voice and standing on paint cans doesn't make you man enough to be my dad. Marge, can I get a subscription to Highlights Magazine? Homer, that's for children! Where does it say that? Read the rest of the title! ""Highlights..."" ""for..."" Oh, dang it! I lost my other earring. Leave it to me... Earring! ...thimble from Monopoly game... Wondered where that was. ...twenty-five dollar casino chip... ...the smallest nesting doll! Can you find anything you like in this bed? Just my honey pie. Wanna split it while we snuggle? Mm-hmm! Now what are you doing? Licking the wrapper. There you go, one adult and two children, one-way downtown. Um, as adults, what do we do now? Shake hands? If you like. And that's how you do it. Now remember, I can't sit backwards or I get sick. Well, if I look at your face, I get sick. Young man, apologize to your sister. Make me, baldy. Why you little... My adulthood! I never thought I'd say this, but that is conduct unbecoming of a bus station. Where'd your babies go? Your intellect-deadening DVDs turned my brother's brain to jelly. Pretty shapes tell me to kill everybody. Looks like you're entitled to the full rebate of nineteen ninety-five. That's all you pay for screwing up a child for life? Kids, let me handle this. Uh, we'd like it in singles and nickels, please. Terrific. Just need your signature. In cursive? X is fine. In cursive? It's just enough to get home. I'm hungry now. Hey, I'm walkin' on paint cans all day. Give me a break. Guys, look! Free breakfast if we sit through a sales pitch. Just remember, Milhouse, do not buy the condo. But what if we can't afford not to buy it? Waldo. Waldo. Waldo. Homer, Bart said the kids were going to the Van Houtens, but Luann just told me they're supposed to be here. They've disappeared! We'll get those kids back. Because we just bought them new shoes! Waldo. Waldo. Do you think Lisa went to that jazz club I wouldn't take her to? How many kids will jazz corrupt? ...lap pool and fully-equipped gym with eucalyptus towels. Now, let me give you the fourteen different apartment configurations: The Hacienda, The Urban Oasis, Castle in the Sky, Connecticut Sunset... Lady, my stomach's full and I wanna go. That's how it works in this country. If you try to leave, you'll find the doors are locked. Well, before our dad signs any contracts, he has a surprise for you... Oh, I hope it's that he's single. Oh, I'm single. Though some days I have a girl buddy on field trips. You're a bit of freak. I like that. You're the adult. ""Kirk?"" Don't you have something to tell her? Just looking for a casual hookup? Yeah. For my Thomas the Tank engines. Ooh. I love how I don't exactly understand what you're saying. Homie, do you see anything? No. I'm sorry. It's... wait a minute. When I said you needed a software update, it was not a criticism. We've found what we're looking for. The kids? Sure, they could be here. Who knows? I love how your arms are too short and thin for your legs. Just like a crocodile. I'm feeling a strange, refreshing brew of emotions. Oh yeah! Milhouse?! How did you know it was me? The top of your head has a five o'clock shadow. Your hair is growing back! Tell me your secret! He's ten years old! There's always a catch. Is anyone here gonna buy a condo?! It's gonna be ""yes,"" but don't rush me. ...And worst of all you cast my vote! Who did you vote for in the non-partisan judicial election? Williamson. No, no, no! I'm really sorry, Dad. But I have to say it was pretty cool having your life. You mean that? I'd be happy to wind up just like you. I hope you remember that when I can't pay for your college. Now how would you like to go to your own parent-teacher interview while I see a movie? I'd like that. Son, promise you will never look like me. I sure hope not. Why you little! That's not a heartwarming thing to end on!","Security Guard, Milhouse Van Houten, DOLPH, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Homer Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Gary Chalmers, Seymour Skinner, DUFFMAN VOICE MILHOUSE, Bus Vendor, Sensitive Female Voice, Krusty the Clown, Bus Station Guy, Kirk Voice Milhouse, P.R.
