53,54,"Pfft, the lottery. Exploiter of the poor and ignorant. You know, I heard the jackpot's up to one hundred and thirty million dollars. One hundred and thirty million dollars! Did you say one hundred and thirty million dollars? Yeah! Wow! Yes, yes, here's your lottery ticket. Thank you for knocking over my inventory. Please come again. Bart, I need some lucky numbers, fast! How old are you? Uh-huh, and what's your birthday? No kidding. And what's Lisa's birthday?... What? You don't know your sister's birthday? What kind of brother are you? Strap on your bullet proof vest, Sanjay. It's time for another bank run. All right, but if I don't make it, promise you won't sleep with my wife. I promise nothing. You'll never guess what happened Marge! Are you ready? I... have... a feeling... that we may win... the lottery! But we never ever... I know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. Go-get-all-your-money... I buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. We each play our birthday. And that's enough excitement for me. You don't understand, Marge. The lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. Uh, the lottery and you. Homer, we're on a tight budget here. Promise me you won't get carried away. Yes, Money... I mean Honey. Ooooh! Here comes a news report about the lottery! Hey, down in front. The whole state is suddenly in the grip of lottery fever. And Springfield is no exception. In fact, every copy of Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" has been checked out from the Springfield Public Library. Of course, the book does not contain any hints on how to win the lottery. It is, rather, a chilling tale of conformity gone mad. But there's already one big winner. Our state's school system, which gets fully half the profits from the lottery. Just think what we can buy with that money. History books that know how the Korean War came out. Math books that don't have that Base six crap in them. And a state of the art detention hall, where children are held in place with magnets. Magnets. Always with the magnets. I've never been so sure of anything in my life. I am going to win this lottery. Homer, the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one. Correction. Three hundred and eighty million to fifty. So what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids? Put it in the bank. Give it to the poor. What do kids know about spending money? What are you gonna do, Homer? Hmm... Hey Homer, what'd you do? Get a haircut or something? Look closer, Lenny! Oh I know what it is. You're the biggest man in the world now. And you're covered in gold. Fourteen carat gold! Take a hike boss, I'm running things now. All hail king Homer! We now take you to the drawing live -- I hope you've got your tickets. I've got mine. They're about to start, Chief. No, you've got the wrong number. This is nine one two. We'll be with you in a minute, kids. This could be our ticket outta here, Mel. I will now draw the first winning number. I've got so many tickets I can't lose! The first number is... seventeen. You can still win some money if you have five out of six. Whoo-hoo! And the second number is... three. Receipts, ugh. Yeah, I knew we wouldn't win. Well why didn't you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret??? If you were seventeen, we'd be rich! But no! You had to be ""10."" And the final number is... forty-nine. Thirty-eight... forty-nine... Ohmigod! I won! I won! Recapping our day's top story -- the winner of today's state lottery is me, Kent Brockman! Can we get a shot of me? There you go. In other news... uh... a tragic mix-up today in Cleveland... many people killed... uh... Goodbye. Oh well... we lost the money, but at least we've still got each other. Hey, the dog's dead. Grampa, he's not dead! Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not. It's not fair to toy with people's emotions like that. He is dead! I'll get a shovel. Well, he's not dead, but he is awfully sick. Oh, sure! The old man's off his rocker. If Grampa says he's dead he must be alive. He is alive. He's wagging his tail. That don't mean nothin'! Dogs wag their tails for hours after they die. I'm tired of this conversation. Let's talk about something else. I'm going home. Clear! Ugh... Clear! Doctor... he's gone. This is the part of the job I hate. Hey, you did the best you could. I love animals. I spend my life saving them and they can't thank me. Well... the parrots can -- but, anyway let's see what's wrong with this little fella. I'm afraid that your dog has a twisted stomach. He needs an operation to correct it or he'll die. Hmm, how much will it cost? Seven hundred and fifty dollars. Oh dear! This is never an easy decision. It's an awful lot of money. Well... I guess we'll have to talk it over. Talk what over? What's there to talk about? What are we going to talk over? Mr. Teeny needs a refill of his nicotine gum. I can't help but notice we're leaving the hospital. When's the dog going to get his operation? Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven. In Doggie Heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and... Is there a Doggie Hell? Well... of course. There couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell. Who's in there? Uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester. Checkers. Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy. Hey! Wait a minute, does this have anything to do with Santa's Little Helper? Oh, honey. Seven-hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money. We really can't afford this operation. You're gonna just let him die? I know you're upset -- Darn right I'm upset! Bart, watch your language. Oh. You did. Sorry. We are not going to let our dog die! And that's IT! Lousy dog-killing sonsa... But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach... Oh, come on! I'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. Marge, make him stop. All right. All right. We'll find a way. Lousy manipulative dog. Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money. Please, do go on... I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick... Oh, please, continue... I thought maybe you... Oh. Well, thanks for your time. What makes a man endanger his job, and yes, even his life, by asking me for money? People like dogs, Mr. Burns. Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say? Uh... if YOU did it, sir?... Exactly! You'd be fit to be tied! Dogs! No. What? You are NOT going to perform that operation yourself. But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey. Maybe you're right, Marge. I've found a way we can pay for the operation. Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam? No. I'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices. Homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while. Bart, from now on you'll have to get your hair cut for free at Springfield Barber College. No problemo. I'm going to give up buying my weekly lottery ticket, and I found a way to stretch the food budget. Fried chicken night will now be organ meat night. Ham night will be Spam night. And porkchop night... ... will now be chub night. Chub? I don't even know what that is! Lisa, I'm afraid we'll have to stop getting you those volumes of Encyclopedia Generica from the grocery store. But, Mom, next week is volume four: Copernicus through Elephantiasis. We all have to make sacrifices, dear. Maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer... Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats... I don't think you've thought this through. Good news, Mr. Danielson, we saved your gamecock. But I'm afraid he'll never fight again. That's what you think. He'll fight and he'll win! Clamp. Wipe... No! No! Come to the light, boy. Come into the light. Come on now. There's a good boy. Come on. Come on. Um... Simpson? It's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of dental school. Lousy chub night. Hey, how come he gets meat and we don't? You wouldn't want what he's eating. It's mostly just snouts and entrails. Mmm... snouts. Yes, I'm back. Kent Brockman is not the kind of a man who would leave a $500,000 a year job just because he won a lottery. Hey, I'm a journalist. Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy. What's that? A dinosaur. Of course I'm not the only one who benefited from last week's big payoff. Our state's schools got their share too. Here, lottery officials present Springfield Elementary with a brand new eraser. One eraser? Oh, I'm used to my government betraying me. I was in Nam. I served for three -- And speaking of lotteries, here are the winning numbers for this week's forty-thousand dollar ""jackpot"": 3 - 6 - 17 - 18 - 22 and 29. Oh no! Those are my numbers! If it wasn't for that dog, I would've won! Class, for tomorrow, I want you to write a report on Copernicus. C'mon boozehound! You want the twenty five cents, don't you? Keep singin'! BUFFALO GALS WON'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT... OH BUFFALO GALS... Who's that old rummy? Before his dog got sick, that ""old rummy"" used to be my best customer. AND DANCE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOONNNNNNNN! Go get it, pal. My quarter!!! Okay, I'll just even this out and. Mr. Laswell! I've done it again. I know you can't understand me, but you're a lousy dog and I hate you. Not now. Can't you see I'm reading a third-rate biography of Copernicus I found at the bus station? Dumb dog. Homie, did you close the gate? Yes. Oh, you mean tonight. The dog will get out! Bart! Close the gate. Lisa! Close the gate. Close the gate, Maggie. Here boy! Here Santa's Little Helper! It's all my fault. I called him a dumb dog. Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait! There he is. No... that's a horse. Have you found a picture yet? Not one that I want the public to see. ... So recycling is our way of giving Mother Earth a great big hug. Yes, well, it does sound like fun. I can't wait to start pawing through my garbage like some starving raccoon. Release the hounds. Well, neighbor I see you've got your running shoes on. That's a good thing. What's wrong with Crippler? He's getting on, sir. He's been here since the late sixties. Ah yes, I'll never forget the day he bagged his first hippie. That young man didn't think it was too ""groovy."" I'm looking for something in an attack dog. One who likes the sweet gamy tang of human flesh. Why here's the fellow! Wiry... fast... firm proud buttocks. Reminds me of me. Uh...the last one. Now! As an attack dog, you'll be expected to neutralize intruders. Wanna buy some cookies? Wanna buy some cookies? If that were a real Girl Scout I'd have been bothered by now. I know how you feel, I lost my dog too. He's in here somewhere. Now here's a film that will turn you into a vicious souless killer. Enjoy. Poor Santa's Little Helper. I'm starting to think we'll never see him again. That was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug. Homer get a-hold of yourself. Even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. Remember Doggie Heaven. Oh, Marge! There is no such place! Or... to put it another way... there is. I'm not giving up. I don't care if I have to knock on every door in this two-bit town. I'm gonna find my dog. And I'll be right here watching TV. Poke-A Poke-A Poke-A! Poke-A Poke-A Poke-A! Excellent! Hello, I'm Kent Brockman. Um, excuse me sir, I lost my dog. Hmm huh. And I suppose you want me to buy you a new one. You know, ever since I won the lottery, everybody wants a piece of Kent Brockman. Homeless this, and hungry that. Gee, I'm sorry mister. Sir, your llama just bit Ted Kennedy. Good. I, uh. I hate to interrupt your longevity treatment, sir. But there's a sweet little boy at the door. Release the hounds. Santa's Little Helper! It's you! AAAGGGHHH!! What's the matter boy? Don't you know me? I'm your buddy! I love ya, boy. Let me pet him again! You already petted him for ten minutes. I know. I want to pet him again! You can pet the cat. The cat?
