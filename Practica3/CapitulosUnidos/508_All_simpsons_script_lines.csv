501,508,"See that town? Goes by the name o' Springfield. Birthplace of the brass knuckle, the Nigerian Prince scam, and putting a tomato on your grilled cheese sandwich. Our story begins not long ago, on what seemed like a typical day. Ralphie, please. That's not for people, son. Aww, he's a dumb kid, but he's an above-average dog. Roll over, son. Aw, nobody saw. But little did they know, a change was coming. First, the creatures of the earth sensed it, then the fish of the deep. Then the Mormons got a heads up, then everybody else. Strange doin's, mother. Horses are spooked, cows ain't milkin', and look what the chickens laid. Sparkle eggs?! Storm's a-comin'. 'Tain't no storm, pa. It's The Lady Gaga Express! She's-a-star! She's-a-star! She's-a-star! She's-a-star! Presenting the Queen of the Hottieverse. Appearing courtesy of Interscope Records, Lady Gaga! At ease. Conductor, you know the rules. Take off some clothes. Oh, um, yes ma'am, sorry ma'am. Now, what's our status? We are about to pass through... uh, Springfield. Springfield? What's their deal? Let's see, quiet suburb... home of the Tomb of the Unknown Mascot... has the lowest self-esteem of any place on the planet. Really? That's so sad. And as entertainers it is our solemn duty to cheer them up, for a little while. Gaga, it's my job to keep you away from ugly bumps on the map like Springfield. Don't worry, we'll get you right on a plane. No! Don't you remember what happened at LaGuardia? Ready. Yeah, well uh, you missed your flight. Then we'll party on the boarding ramp! Wait! I quit! We spend ninety minutes training 'em and off they go. I just can't ignore a billboard in pain. We're stopping in Springfield! But... No buts! Well, Lady Gaga couldn't arrive soon enough for one Lisa Simpson... Now let's turn to the ever-unpopular ""Popularity Awards"" -- the awards voted by students, in judgment of their peers! No way that can go wrong! First up, Campus Clown... Bart Simpson! That's my brother! Four years out of four. Prank you! Prank you very much! I fail to see the honor in this. Aren't awards shows rather silly? What?! Without awards shows, how would I know what movie has the ""best beheading,"" or that ""Glee"" is a comedy? And now the award for ""Least Popular Student."" Lisa Simpson! What?! ""Least Popular?"" I gotta go. You probably should accept it, Lisa. They'll go easier on you if you do. Um... thank you for noticing me? She actually accepted it! You said they'd take it easy on me! I know very little about children. We've gotta cheer up a whole town. Where's the dress I wore when I met the Pope? It's nice, but I saw Jennifer Lopez wearing it. Burn it! Burn it now! Help! Helllp! I've been on here since Chicago! I just want my life back! No negativity! Oh, you're right! I'm missing a terrible winter! ...and that's how Berber carpet got its name, according to some. Lisa, how was your day? Um, can I be excused from holding up my end of the conversation? What's wrong with her? She just found out no one likes her. I thought she knew! Hey, Lisa! Maybe you'd feel a little better if you read the Daily Fourth Gradian message board, huh? Let's see... ""Uncensored Jump-rope Chants""... Oh, there's a whole thread labeled ""Lisa Simpson!"" Ay carumba! Somebody's actually on your side! ""Lisa doesn't judge other people. Why should we judge her?"" It's signed, ""Truth Teller."" Whoever this ""Truth Teller"" is, I'm a fan. It takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously. Y'know, it seems like more than a coincidence that Milhouse brought it to our attention. Well, I certainly wish I was Truth Teller. But if I was, you'd know, because I can't keep a secret. I sleep under my bed every night 'cause I'm scared of the cars from ""Cars"" -- if gasoline is their food then why do they have teeth?! So Lisa, I guess you're not as unpopular as we thought. Yep. Message boards are never wrong. Well... um, maybe we should skip rope together. Dutch? Double Dutch. Forgive a fool her tears. Hey Lis, some fifth graders are having a make-your-own pizza party at Flesh-In-The-Pan Pizza, and wanted me to invite you. Fifth-graders? Ooh-la-la! They get to put their desks in a circle! And read books where the parents are divorced. That joint is jumpin'. So, when's the party? ""Lisa rocks, and so does her rock collection."" That's mine! This notebook is full of things Truth Teller said! Give that back! This one says ""post next Friday."" Oh my God! You're Truth Teller! Lisa, what you did is like my mom sticking ten bucks in her own g-string. Truth Teller? More like Lie Smeller! Lie Smeller! Lie Smeller! Oh great, it stuck! Take five. Hey, easy on the soda. I don't want gassy demons like last night. Jerry. Oh! Wait a minute! No! No, no! Brrrrrr make it stop! Oh! Someone in Springfield needs my help... Light up the after-bras! That's it, I am off of this stuff. Me too, sweetheart. Kids? Yes, momma. No exceptions! Kent Brockman reporting live from the Springfield rail yards, where Lady Gaga's fabulous freighter has bumped and grinded its way into town. Suffice it to say, this is the most culturally significant train to stop here since the McKinley funeral cortege paused to pick up casket ice! Now sweetie, don't make a big deal out of this. I stopped reading after ""TOP STUDENT"". You wanna honk your jazz tube? What is the point? I think this is the end of me. All I had was my integrity. And now that's gone. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I try not to cry till you're asleep. I appreciate that. Look, if I could just spend a few days in my room without anyone trying to cheer me up, I think I might have a chance to... Hey, why don't we go see Lady Gaga? That'll turn your frown upside down. It's not a frown. It is a straight line of resignation. Looks just the same upside down. What are you talking about? Y-you're right! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Dad, if you really wanna help, please stop trying to help. I will, but you know me and my crazy number thing where I always have to get to seventeen. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Whoops, I lost count. Better start again. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Ga-ga-oo-la-la! Ga-ga-ra-ma-ma! Ga-ga-ra-ma-ma! Ga-ga-ra-ma-ma! Hey Lisa, come on. I'm sorry, I don't really want to be here. Claws up, Springfield! Never forget you're all my Little Monsters! Uh, actually, I'm half monster, half Armenian. Pick your poison. And you should love yourselves as much as I love you, because... Tell us in song! BECAUSE... With theatricality! Come on, I woke up for this! Four! Three! Two! Where are they going with this? One! BUT EVERY MONSTER NEEDS TO FIND THAT SECRET DEEP INSIDE / THAT TRANSFORMS DOCTOR JEKYLL INTO SEXY MR. HYDE ALL MY MONSTERS ARE BEAUTIFUL... DISCO STU-TIFUL... SQUARE ROOT-IFUL... OLD COOT-IFUL... I love you, Lady Zsa Zsa! MONSTERS DON'T NEED IMPLANTS OR A BITCHIN' MONSTER CAR / MONSTERS ONLY NEED TO LOVE THE MONSTERS THAT THEY ARE OH YEEAHH Gaga / Dada / Jawa / Peace! Lie Smeller! Lie Smeller! Does everybody love themselves? That kind of thing sounds hollow from anyone but you! Now we have to get going. Wait a minute... No! No, no! You! What's wrong, honey? Please, I've had enough attention for one day! Yo, lighting! I can't see the girl who's had enough attention! We should go to your house and talk! Incognito! Oh God. Psst, it's me, Gaga. But no one must know. Gaga. Gaga. Gaga. So peaceful. Just the buzzing of the paparazzi. Hey, Gary. How's your wife and kids? Still ashamed of me. Big smile! This is where I live. Well, hello! It's one of those music industry superstars who's turning our innocent children into ladies of the night. What sweater drawer did you crawl out of? Name's Ned Flanders, I've heard of you. Haven't seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm. But all I'm saying is that everyone is beautiful-- Yes, but Jesus said that... pretty much the same thing. Darnit, the Bible said the Devil would be attractive! What makes you think I'm the Devil? Unless you're gonna slap some wieners on those, turn 'em off! Joke's on you, I needed a trim! Bastards! Lisa, look at me. So what if your number one supporter is you? That's how it should be. I had some very tough times myself before I became a superstar at age twenty-two. Everything is gonna be fine. You better yet? Sorry, gotta answer this text. Please, take your time. You know what you need? Solitude? Flash mob. Now, Lisa, if that didn't fundamentally change who you are, I don't know what. You idiots! She meant we should disperse. Lisa, you un-tattooed little miracle, I'm not leaving here until I restore your sense of hope. Come on, say something. Let me explain. I have a chance for a grim but tolerable life, but only if I give up hope. Now if you don't mind, and with all due worship, I would like to be alone. Lady Gaga, meet your biggest threat: Baby Googoo. Can I please be alone? Well, it worked once. So, any ideas about Lisa? I never have any idea what to do for Lisa. To be the mother of someone who's so smart and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument I don't really care for. It's so hard. I wish I was one of those young women who could just wave their hands in front of their eyes and not cry, 'cause it doesn't work for me. Marge, take it easy. It's just human contact. I'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up. Well, maybe this will. Homer! Wow. Wow. This is like the night Hillary won the New Hampshire Primary. Lisa snuck out. I'm going after her. What are you gonna say? I'll just tell her that... Stop it, Homer! Some of that meat is me. Can I just trim the hem? It's yours. Oh good, she's playing. Not so good. It's ""Lisa Roulette."" Don't let her getcha! Her eyes shoot loser lasers! There is no over the top... There is no over the top... Run! With an egg that big, there's gotta be an even bigger chicken! Lisa? Lisa! Listen to me. This pity party's being shut down by the smile police. Here's what you're gonna do: Why do you keep telling me what I'm gonna do? This isn't about me. Well, who else would it be about? You! It's about Hello, hello, Springfield. It's me, Gaga! Why is everyone looking at my purple hair full of bluebirds? Well, I denounce thee! Wha?! I denounce thee for giving people ambitions they cannot fulfill! And I denounce thee for positing a world where social acceptance and walking on heels are easy! Please, may we kill the kid?! I denounce thee! I denounce thee! I denounce thee! Whoa. Easy, little monster. Don't ""monster"" me. Whatever you say. Are you crying... glitter? Tiny diamonds. Hurts like hell. Gaga-Gaga-Gaga-Gaga-Gaga-- Okay Lisa, comin' up to make things better! Okay, I'm almost there... upward, ever upward... stay hydrated... I'm on the wrong tree... Okay, try again... here we go, okay... Lisa, can you come down? Sweetie, I've been thinking. Now, this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself. The problem's not that you were cheating...it's that you got caught. I cheat on my diet but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside and the first warning sign is sudden death. So, honey, what do you say? Dad, thank you. Like always, the fact that I could tune you out without fearing I'd miss out on something, gave me the time to take stock, and realize how ungrateful I have been. Which means I've got a train to catch. Parenting. It's the one job you always know you're doing right. So long, Springfield. You are my Waterloo. And now I'm just going to lie in bed and eat Fruit Roll-ups. Why is she doing in defeat what I do in victory? Gaga! Lisa? Why are you here? To thank you! For what? Look at me! You did help me, by allowing me to inappropriately focus eight years of rage and rejection on you. It was like a great sneeze. And now I can say what's good about me. And I can say it as Lisa Simpson! Just not that loud. Go ahead. Well, I'm smart, nice, tolerant, funny but not ""mean funny,"" and I never forget a birthday, even for kids who move away. Now Lisa, there's only one last thing you have to do to be a Little Monster! I'll do anything but sing! You're gonna sing! I USED TO THINK THAT I WAS STUPID, WORTHLESS, WEAK, AND WRONG A MOCKINGBIRD WITHOUT A SONG... I WAS SMALL INSIDE AND LACKING PRIDE... ON A ONE-WAY TRAIN TO BE MILHOUSE'S BRIDE... End the song! End it right here! I LOVE NPR, AND JAZZ GUITAR... SOME DAY I'LL DESIGN A SOLAR CAR! THAT'S RIGHT, I'M LISA SIMPSON, SUPERSTAR! YOU'VE GOT A GREAT BIG HEART IT'S AT THE TOP OF MY CHART... LISA SIMPSON / LISA SIMPSON LISA SIMPSON SUPERSTAR! LISA SIMPSON / LISA SIMPSON... LISA SIMPSON SUPERSTAR! YOU'RE A SUPERSTAR! Wait, wait! Waiiit! Can you help me with my self-esteem? I'm not that good. Right, gotcha. And the best thing is, even if they weren't waving, it would be okay. I bet a lot of folks are wondering, did this story really happen? Well, it did. And I know because I was one of Gaga's dancers. The one with the spangliest crotch. Higher! I'm speaking fast because I'm so excited. Seeing Maggie Simpson in her first starring role in ""The Longest Daycare"" in 3D before Ice Age Continental Drift, only in theaters! We've already done the hardest part: making the poster!
