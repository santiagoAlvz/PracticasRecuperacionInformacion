321,325,"Children, I'm sorry to say, one of your lunches exploded. Who has the ""Little Bunny Foo Foo"" lunchbox? Um... that would be me. It's not my fault. I can't afford a better lunchbox 'cause I'm poor. Shut up! My Mom got too fat to work at Hooters! They won't even let her park cars. Please children, don't be cruel. Nelson might be poor, but I'm sure he has the seven dollars for today's field trip. Um, well, actually... Some day... Now I know the rest of us are excited about visiting the Museum of Television today. Hey, don't tell us how to feel! Bart Simpson, be quiet. Hey, that wasn't me, that was Milhouse? Milhouse? What happened to my little class coward? What do you care, Mrs. Krabappel... or should I say, Mrs. Crab Apple? Crab Apple? / I never thought of that! / It totally works! / How could I have been so blind? ROLLIN', ROLLIN', ROLLIN' / TOXIC BARREL ROLLIN' THEY'RE SO HOT AND GLOWIN' WE'LL DIE! Smithers, the board of directors is coming here today, and I don't want them to see Snap, Crackle and Pop down there. Sir, there's a big cardboard box out back that could keep them amused... they could make a fort... No, no, just give them each a nickel and send them to Moe's. Let them while away the afternoon spilling their beer on gullets and trousers whilst drooling over French postcards. Hello, I'm Isabel Sanford, the beloved Weezy from ""The Jeffersons."" At this ""museum"" you won't see a Michelangelo, but you might see Michael Landon and Beverly De Angelo. This blows. Let's sneak off. Wander away from the group? Man, you've been huffin' from the Bart bag. To old man Burns, who's paying us to drink because we're embarrassing! We suck! A lot of that went in my lungs. Attention American bar devils: it's our anniversary! Free drinks for everyone! That's great. I'm honored to drink to Apu and, uh... Apulina. You know, Marge and I have an anniversary coming up. I have given Manjula many gifts, including a bouquet of flowers, diamond earrings, and we're going to see Paris... Hilton. In Paris... Texas. On our way to Paris, France. What did you plan to get your wife, Homer? These charity address labels that came in the mail. Milhouse, why are you acting so crazy? Did your imaginary friend try to kill you again? No, Walter's been cool. Bart, I gotta say something, and it's not easy. Well, if it's not easy, don't do it. That's how I got where I am. Then let's just say... I don't care what people think of me anymore. You mean up until now you did care? Then why did you wear that tutu to school last week? What about all the times I didn't wear a tutu? Nobody ever brings those up. Now leave me alone. It's the Paul Lynde-Helen Reddy-Hudson Brothers Easter Special! With guest stars Willie Tyler and Lester and Nadia Comaneci! I'd like to hippity hop on your balance beam. I don't think you understand the mechanics of heterosexual sex. Circle gets the square! TV sure has come a long way, huh Milhouse? Check it out -- I'm riding some guy named Ironside! Ow, my banana! Danger, danger! Door ajar. The indignity! The agents got all my money. I'm bored. Let's go switch the heads on the Cosby Kids. I don't wanna go home! I'm not done talking to me! Just get out this door, rummy, and you're the city's problem. If you make it through the night, you're welcome back. Home sweet home. Now to watch some TV. Oh, you poor soul. You think that rat is a remote. Five bucks? I don't need your sharity! I'll dance for my money! Oh you poor man, you think you can dance. I didn't say stop! Bart... there's something I've gotta tell you. I'm moving. What? My mom got a job in Capital City. Capital City? You can't move that far, you're my best friend. What's your Mom making? I'll match it! It's too late, Bart. My Mom's already transferred her 401K. Nooo! Luann, what are you doin'? Look, Kirk, I need a fresh start. Well, couldn't you get a fresh start by remarrying your old husband? Kirk, we're going. Fine. But you can't take Milhouse. I have visitation rights. Yes, and you're also supposed to pay child support. Hey, I thought you said my money was no good. I said you're no good. Get in the car, Milhouse. This isn't over. I'll fight you with every lunch half-hour I get. Ooh, speaking of which... It's gonna be tough to be peppy today. Tell me about it. Why are your clothes so dirty? And why do you smell like liquor? Have you been clubbing? Homie, they're beautiful. That Chevron station has the most romantic bouquets! I feel a swoon coming on... Here it is! I am so wasted. Oh my God, oh my God, we're having a simultaneous pass out! Well, at least they're not fighting. Right this way! What's on the menu? Oh Bart, I'm sure it's hard to lose your best friend. You mean Milhouse? Funny little guy. Afraid of the dark. And the light. Now I got new friends. Guys who get me. There's one right now. Who is it? Is it Ralph? It is not Ralph. Hi, Bart! My nose makes its own bubble gum! Just get in here. Eighteen... nineteen... twenty. I found you, Bart! Ralph, we're playing checkers. I don't like you, boy-mommy. Loveless loners are so lucky. There's no way I can afford to give Marge a nice anniversary present. Oh, you poor man. You smell worse than you did last time. Hm... Hey buddy, that's nice sign work. Your penmanship is clear yet sad. Hey, I know you. We met in a police lineup. Oh yeah, yeah. You know, number two and number four are an item now. You don't have to tell me, I was number three. Listen, you have any pointers for a newbie? Well, there are six schools of begging -- bad musician, messed-up vet, cripple, fake cripple, religious zealot, and crazy guy. I think you would do well with ""crazy guy."" Coke and Pepsi are the same thing! Wake up, people! Wow, now that is good crazy. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no! Oh yesss! I never thought I'd have to take a plane to see Milhouse. Well, I'm sure he'll be happy you came. Now departing, No-Frills Airlines flight eighty-nine. Milhouse, Bart's here! What up, B? Milhouse? Is that you? Yeah, I gave my look some new flava. Suck it in! Uh, maybe later. What up, M-life? Milhouse, this isn't you. This is my only chance to be cool. Now, please let me give you a wedgie in front of these guys. No way! Please. I'll be gentle. Oh, fine. Wedgie! Milhouse, you went Cap City on him! Springfield baby, in a diaper! / Poked his eye with a windshield wiper. Springfield baby / Springfield baby! Springfield baby! I'll always love you, Bart. Springfield baby! Springfield baby! Bart honey, it's a nice day. Why don't you play outside? Outside? That's where me and Milhouse played. You know, I think your sister could use a little help washing the car. You'll be like an owl saying Milhouse who? Milhouse who? Milhouse whooo? Hey, Moldilocks. Mom says I'm supposed to help you. Fine. You can confirm the accuracy of the hose. Ha, ha, ha, you wet your pants. Shut up, it's a serious problem. Lis, you are so dead. I'm gonna hit you so hard, I'll kill your whole family. Bart, you're in my family. Shut up! Homie, I'd like to know what you've been doing after work. Marge, I'm not gonna lie to you... I also found this in your drawer. All the answers you need are in here. Happy anniversary! Are these Diamondique? Nope. Diamondelle? Nope. Cubic Diamondium? Nope. Dioxy-ribo-diamondoid? Close, but no cigar. Just plain diamonds. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We finally have something to put in the wall safe. Hostess Twinkies? I heard if you age them for ten years, they turn to liquor. Kids? Go ride bikes for a while, huh. Yeah, you heard your mother. We can't jump this ditch. Sure we can. But let me go first. Everyone knows you're the future of this family. That's not true, Bart. Mom and Dad value us equally, and... oh, you're right. 'Kay, go ahead. Geronimo! Just forget everything you know about gravity. But I know so much about it. Just do it. Geronimo! Look, we can go inside! Ooh, we're like Howard Carter discovering the Temple of Tutankhamen. Or like when I discovered the school's Xerox code. One, four, seven. Just sayin' it makes my butt feel warm again. Arrowheads! Pictographs! Bart, this is a Native American burial mound. Look! He's pickin' his nose. Hey, we shouldn't tell anyone we were here. This place should be our special secret! Okay, shake. Psyche! Bart, there's spiders in your hair. That's what you call commitment to a bit. MR. BO-JANGLES / MR. BO-JANGLES / WE'RE ALL BO-JANGLES / WHO KILLED BO-JANGLES? / MAYBE IT WAS YOU... Thank you. Thank you. Remember, my dog up and died. Thank you. You got your wife the earrings, man. Why are you still doin' this? I want to get a second house. Closer to work. He's taking all our business! We're gonna have to do something. We never do anything, that's why we're bums. Hey, you're a woman. And you're a three-headed devil dog. Devil dog! Wanna make out? No one wants to be alone. ""The Mound Builders worshiped turtles, as well as badgers, snakes, and other animals."" Thank God we've come to our senses and worship a carpenter who lived two thousand years ago. Hi, Janey... Branford Marsalis' car broke down outside your house? And he's just jamming 'til Wynton shows up? Oh... Um... some other time, maybe. Today I'm just hanging out at home. Hey, Bart, I ""borrowed"" my uncle's pellet gun. Wanna go shoot Apu? Oh, that does sound fun. But not today. I think I'm just gonna hang out at home. Oh my God! My brother's my best friend. Oh my God! My sister's my best friend. Diamonds! I still can't believe he gave me diamonds! Mirror mirror on the wall: who's the baldest of them all? One time I swung all the way around. You did not. I know a guy who did. Who? You don't know him. He lives in Russia. I can't believe they're hanging out. Ha! Maybe she'll be a good influence on him. Or maybe he'll corrupt her. It won't last. Brothers and sisters are natural enemies. Like Englishmen and Scots. Or Welshmen and Scots. Or Japanese and Scots. Or Scots and other Scots. Damn Scots! They ruined Scotland! You Scots sure are a contentious people. Ye just made an enemy for life! Listen, Mr. Hobo. You may not have laundry to wash, but I do. Now what do you want to show me? There's your husband, a.k.a. Mooch-a-lini, Drooly McGee, Corporal Flashback, etcetera, etcetera. Homer! You're panhandling! I should have known from that panhandling sign! Plus that ticket you got for panhandling. But Marge, it was all for you. To buy you all the nice things you deserve. The flowers, the earrings, the Bob Seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice... Homer, I don't need fancy things. And even if I did, this is the wrong way to get them. And to remind you of what you've done, I'm going to keep these earrings and wear them at social occasions. I don't understand. Well, then maybe you need to buy me a brooch. Bart! I cracked the code of the pictograph. It says there's a curse on the mound. Of course I don't believe in... Hi Lisa! I brought you the Cap City version of Monopoly. Baltic Avenue is now Wayne Street. It's awesome! Milhouse? I thought your mom took you away forever. I got a court order bringing him back. The judge said I was the most pathetic person he'd ever seen in court. Pity custody -- boo-yeah! Repo man. I'm here to take your pants. Not in front of my son. Please. You're somebody's father?! Yes, okay. Umm, boy. Well, I'm glad to be back. Those Cap City kids don't think I'm cool anymore. We were having a sleepover, and a robber came and wet my bed. Then he folded the bed back into the couch...and disappeared into the night. I knew you'd blow it. Now let me show you that mound. You told him our secret?! Hey, he's my best friend. Oh. I see how it is. Great. Then we're all cool. Since he's been back, Milhouse has had three bloody noses and stepped in dog doo. It's always a party with that guy. Well, it's nice you have your best friend back. You should hang with us sometime, Lis. Mmm-hmm... I think I'll go to bed now. What's wrong? Nothing. Hoo boy, are you in trouble. What're you talkin' about? When a woman says nothing's wrong that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off. Hey Lis, you wanna play Cap City Monopoly? Look, just because Milhouse is gone doesn't mean you have to pretend to be my friend. Oh c'mon, I'll roll the dice for you. ...three, four, five, chance. Pick up a card. Bart will make your bed for a week. What? Really? Yep. Pick up another one. But it's not my turn. I'm trying to do something nice, you dink. Pick up a card. ""Bart will defend you when other kids call you a nerd."" No one calls me a nerd. Trust me, that is a valuable card. Pick up another. Bart will give back the Malibu Stacy head you thought was lost. Oh Bart, that's really sweet. Just because I have Milhouse back, doesn't mean I haven't learned a few things about being a brother. I think I'm gonna use this card right now. Aw, do I have to? All right. This is what sitcoms call ""a schmaltzy ending"" -- a sentimental capper to leave the audience feeling good. Usually followed by a little coda to cut the treacle. Granny, I'm gonna shoot me some Viet Cong. Yeah, well I ain't cookin' 'em.
