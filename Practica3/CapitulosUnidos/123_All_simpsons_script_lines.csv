122,123,"Welcome to the six o'clock news in our brand new studio! Lookin' good, Springfield!! In today's news, a two ton rhino escaped from the Springfield Zoo. But zoo officials were quick to act and Petunia, as she is known, is safely back in captivity. In other news, a three ton rhino that escaped from the zoo last week is still at large. All right, who broke my vase?! Who took all my test papers off the refrigerator and tore them up?! Who spread garbage all over Flanders' yard before I got a chance to? Oh, please! This is senseless destruction, with none of my usual social commentary. If it wasn't you, then who was it? Well, I'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now did they? Did they?! Hmm, I guess Bart's not to blame. He's lucky too, because it's spankin' season and I've got a hankerin' for some spankerin'. I don't know why you're so energetic today, boy, but prepare to be worn out. What's wrong, boy? Getting tired? I think there's really something wrong with Santa's Little Helper. He was up barking all night and dug up the back yard worse than ever. My Bongo drums! My strobe light! My ""Best of Ray Stevens featuring The Streak"" album! So it was the dog that buried all our stuff! Yes, the dog... Oh my God! He's got the precious cable TV cable! Always use fresh macaroni. If the box rattles, throw it away... Your cable TV is experiencing difficulties. Please do not panic. Resist the temptation to read or talk to loved ones. Do not attempt sexual relations, as years of TV radiation have left your genitals withered and useless. Well, I'll be damned. Excuse me, we're having a problem with our dog... Lady, I'll tell you what I'm telling everyone else. I'm sorry if your dog went blind, but your gripe is with Hartz Mountain, not with me. No, no, our dog is out of control. He's wild, destructive, and has little or no respect for authority. Hmm... let me try a canine/human mind meld. It's an incredibly rare psychic power possessed only by me and three other clerks at this store. Okay. I'm bored... I'm restless... Need change in life... Like imported leather leash... Uh, blue contact lenses. 200 volt shock training collar... Well, problem solved. Homer, hold on to the wheel! You got it. Hey! Don't worry. We'll catch him, or run him over tryin'. Look, he's heading back to the greyhound racing track where we found him! Don't worry. As soon as they find out he doesn't have any money, they'll throw him out. Believe me, I know. Oh, this place is so big. Do you think we should split up and look for them, Homie? Homie? Two bucks to win on number eight... ...and have you seen my beloved dog? Gimme the ticket. We can't lose. Look at the name of the dog I bet on. ""She's The Fastest..."" Homer, I don't think that means necessarily... And they're off! She's The Fastest jumps out to an insurmountable lead! You're lucky you got looks, Marge. As they round the far turn, it's She's The Fastest, followed by Always Comes In Second and I'm Number Three... Yes! Come on, you little horse! And they're in the home stretch. It's -- wait! Another dog is on the track! It's Santa's Little Helper! The mystery dog is gaining fast on the outside. Of course, he could never win this race - or could he? What's Santa's Little Helper doing to that dog? Uh-oh... It looks like he's trying to jump over her, but he can't quite make it. Come on, boy, you can do it! Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end. This is the end of dog racing. I think they're in love. Aww... Aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. He misses casual sex. Can we keep Santa's girlfriend, Mom? Please? But she's not our dog. She's yours now! Once they fall in love they lose their racin' spirit. But won't you miss her loyalty and companionship? Lady, you're allll-right! Okay, you can go out and play, but... no more you know what in front of the house, all right? Hey, what did I just say?!! Take it, it fell on the floor-a. Hey, boy, you wanna play fetch? Me and Santa's Little Helper used to be a team, but he never wants to play anymore since his bitch moved in! Bart! Don't ever say that word again! Well that's what she is! I looked it up. Well, I'm going to write the dictionary people and have that checked. It feels like a mistake to me. Hey look! A really small dog just fell out of Santa's girlfriend. Oh, my God! She's having babies! Oh, I'm sorry, girl. I thought you were just getting fat. Look, it's twins! Now it's two sets of twins. Two sets of twins and a triplet! Homer, Homer find a place for all these little miracles. Oh, my. I've never seen anything like this. How many more can there be? Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four... Twenty-five. Wow! Twenty-five puppies! An army of dogs! No bully will ever touch me again! Hey, jerkface! You have the face of a jerk! All right, Simpson, you asked for... Get 'em, boys! Say, Jimbo ... hope I wasn't out of line with that ""jerkface"" crack. Oh, Homie, aren't they adorable? Yes, we've waited many years, but the good Lord has finally blessed us with a real family. Look at Branford II! Isn't that cute? He thinks he's one of the Models, Inc. Get that cat out of the way! Agh, my socks! Mom, why do I have to wear a flea collar? Well, it's just easier this way. Ooh... this time... Ah... Yeeesch! This house stinks! You're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you? Do you have a better idea? Now I know we love the puppies very much, but I think they're getting to be a problem. Yeah, they ate all my socks! I have to wear Lisa's to school today! How do you explain the culottes, boy? Well, I have to coordinate, don't I? Your mother and I have been thinking about giving the puppies away. Nooooooo! Mainly your mother. Is that what we do in this family? When someone becomes an inconvenience, we just get rid of them?! Hello? Is anybody there? All right, we'll give the dogs one more chance. As long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay. On a completely unrelated topic, I'm having a very, very important dinner party tonight. Splendid. Who's coming? Rev. Lovejoy, your old Army drill sergeant, and the Regional Director of the IRS. Oh, just lovely, Marge. The whole town will hear what a perfect evening this was, how nothing at all went wrong. Simpson, this evening has gone so flawlessly, I'm gonna forget that you were mistakenly let out of the Army a month early. And I'm so impressed by this problem-free evening that there's no need for that audit. A toast to the Simpsons... And to the delectable turkey...that's walking around the table??!! Dear Lord, it's a demon bird! Ewwwww! Simpson, see you at reveille O-five hundred tomorrow. See you at the IRS! See you in hell! From heaven. Oh, we sure could use a pooch to guard the flock at the Flanderosa. It'd be nice to have some companionship when mother goes out on dates. We could use a new pet over at the home seein' how we accidentally killed that smart-mouthed bird. They don't like being broken up. We've got to be realistic, kids. Who's gonna have a big enough heart to take care of twenty-five puppies? ...and I know the little fellas would love romping around my many acres, chasing my many cars, drinking from my many toilets... Who wouldn't? Mom, don't give the puppies to him! He'll be mean to them! She's right, Homer. There's something about his face I don't trust. Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but you can't have these dogs. Am I fired? Hmm? Oh, of course not. They're your pets, you can do as you wish. Good day, everyone. My, he certainly took that well. A little too well, if you ask me. I'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies. There you go. There you go. You too... Honestly, sir, you just don't put the effort into your schemes that you used to. Don't worry folks, we'll find your wallet. Dogs! Chief, you're getting powdered sugar all over my floor! No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm, uh, dusting for prints. We don't have to wait for the cops - who can track the puppies better than their own mom and dad? Let's go find your babies! Dinner's on, dogs! I'm sorry, kids. I don't think we're ever gonna find your greyhounds. Maybe Mr. Burns will sell you one of the twenty-five he got last night. Who knows what horrible things he's doing to those innocent little puppies? There. Now, wasn't that heavenly? And don't you feel better, too? He's giving them a bath! There you are, there ya go li'l' fella, and you... Smithers, look! He's standing up! I've never seen anything so adorable. You know who it reminds me of... Benji? No. Lassie? No, no, no. A person, you know who I mean. Snoop Doggy Dog? Bob Barker? David Brenner? No, no. The person who's always standing and walking. Rory Calhoun? That's it! You stay with me. You're the pick of the litter. Maybe we were wrong about Burns on this one. Are you sure you want to go through with this, sir? You do have a very full wardrobe as it is. : Yes...

Sorry. You've gotta admit it's catchy. Come on, Smithers. Let's go finish the little flea circuses off. Except for ""Little Monty,"" of course. We've gotta get the dogs outta there! Ssh. Hush, puppies! We've gotta get you outta here! I know, the window! No Bart! What're you doing? Dogs always land on their feet. That's cats. No, it's dogs. I'll prove it. Best two out of three. Bart, Look! A laundry chute! Okay guys, let's move! Come on! Come on! I've got an idea! Sorry, Monty, but you're too big for this ride. Quick, let's get... Going somewhere? That's impossible! How did you get here first? Oh well, there'll be plenty of time for explanations later. Right now, I'll be taking my puppies back. But they're ours! You stole them from us! Here's a phone. Call somebody who cares. Give me that! Now if you'll excuse us, children, the pups have a date with a fashion knife. There! Now you don't know which one is Little Monty! I guess if you don't want him to be part of your tuxedo, you'll have to let the other dogs go, too! Nice try. C'mon, Little Monty, stand up! Come on, stand up! Do your trick. No, don't! Stay down, Monty! Don't get up! Stay down! Stay down, boy! Excellent. Now it's simply a matter of bending down and picking up the one and only... This can't be happening! They're all standing! I can't tell them apart! All right, you win... I'll have to kill them all. Nooo!! But they're so wretchedly adorable! Twenty-five little Rory Calhouns. I can't do it! But I can kill you! No, I can't kill you either. Look at you standing there on your hind legs like a couple of Rory Calhouns. Well, Mr. Burns, I hope you've realized the folly of killing innocent animals for fashion. Oh, I have. I have! I swear I'll never wear any clothing made from an animal that can do an amusing trick! Another victory for Montgomery Burns' champion greyhounds! Twenty-five dogs, twenty-five world champions, which so far have earned their owner over ten million dollars. I'll bet whoever gave him those dogs is kicking themselves now! Homer! For the love of God, no. Marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million dollar greyhounds.","Waylon Smithers, Chief Wiggum, Fat Cheeked Housekeeper, Marge Simpson, Cable Announcer, Everyone, Kent Brockman, Crowd, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, C.
