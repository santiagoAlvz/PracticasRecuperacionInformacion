503,510,"Welcome to the grand opening of our whatchamacallit, which thanks to the lobbying of Lisa Simpson, we built instead of a new baseball stadium. At least the pennant works both ways. Professor Frink will now throw a switch, which will either answer certain obscure questions of subatomic physics or destroy the universe. Oh my god particle! What is it, Professor? You can tell your grandchildren you were here when humanity finally learned that this accelerator is much too small to tell us anything important. Thanks a lot, Liser. That money could've been used for a war! No one takes Willie's mop! Take the mop! Take the mop! Huh? A mini black hole! Whee! Oh no, I've got to take it away before more clueless kids fall into it! Geronimo! I's rich! I's poor and shackless. Lisa! Do you have a stray dog down there? Um, it's a lot worse than a stray dog. Two stray dogs? It's a black hole! That was gonna be my next guess! Are you sure your next guess wasn't ""three stray dogs?"" Maybe. A black hole? I'm sorry, can we call it that? Yes, it's the preferred term. And most scientists believe that what enters a black hole never comes out. But some think they may be a gateway to other universes. Hey, can it open a pretzel bag for me? Help a brother out, B.H. Woo hoo! Guys, stop throwing things in the hole -- the more you throw in, the bigger and more dangerous it becomes! Come on, you can't look at that infinitely dense little guy and not want to feed it something! Dad, don't pat it! Why should-- Why you little... I am nature's perfect choking machine! Okay, that's it! I'm putting a baby-gate across the black hole, and don't throw anything more into it! Uh-oh, yes, Homer. Dad, that's creepy. Sorry. I know we shouldn't feed this, but grease brings raccoons. Quit bageling my English muffins! The black hole is looking a lot bigger. Does anybody want to admit to throwing things in? Nope. / Not me. / Do we even still have that thing? And I have to ask... has anyone seen the cat? Now what? Okay, it's possible that someone may have started a business called ""Magic Craphole Waste Removal,"" but it wasn't me. Stop! This is a black hole, not a lawn and leaf bag! If one more thing gets in there it could reach critical mass! I did it! I hit my first homerun! Noooo! I'm still proud of you, buddy! And look! I've got money to take you for pizza! You saw that I had the money, right? Welcome, trans-dimensional visitors. We have received your many gifts with gratitude. Haw-haw! We have built our society around the treasures you have sent. Our most popular magazine is your President's Day mattress blow-out insert. Our favorite food is your banana peel. And we listen to all our music on the most wonderful device ever created... the Zune. Zune... Zune... Zune... Treasures? Gifts? You got it all wrong. That stuff is just our old-- Wonderful stuff! Enjoy it! Zune... Day one. We've bought this camera because strange things have been going on at our house in the dead of night. And if anyone finds this footage after we're all missing or dead, remember me as a hero. Dad, you forgot to pick me up after Little League! You tossed your car keys in my bean plant! A hero. Homer! Is that my camera? Hero away! Night One. Wanna snuggle? Not with the camera on. I turned it off. Looks like the red light's on. I swear, I am not filming. Note to self: edit out my lies. Wait! Don't kill the monster without me! I'm right behind you, honey! We have stairs?! What the? Why is this happening to us? I don't know, I don't know! I'm sure I don't know! Oh, sweetie, sometimes a mysterious, invisible being from hell waits for a family to go to sleep then kills them. Now go to bed. But-- Eh-eh, school night. Now you're sure I bought enough cameras and extended warranties to catch that ghost? Sir, whatever happens in this house, these cameras will pick it up. Ooh, I can't wait for tonight's massacre. Hey, Marge. Oh, like what you see, huh? I like it when you don't say words. Come here, you. / Yeah. That's hellfire all right. Someone in this family has made a deal with the devil, and now the devil wants his due! Now remember, this creature feeds on your fear. What the hell was that?! Actually, he feeds on more than just fear. Give back my baby! We had a deal! Mom, what's going on? Don't act so surprised, Marge. You knew this day was coming! Let's see what we're dealin' with here. It's Moe with wings! Moe Szyslak? Come on, he's much more hideous and evil than me! I brought this on us all. It began when I was a girl... Hail Satan! What are you doing? Trying to summon the devil. Why? Nothing good on TV. We have no boyfriends. We're bored. Something to do. Hail Satan / the minister of sinister / Rude dude with the bad 'tude Save us, Marge! We'll never make fun of any man you date or marry. Um... Mr. Demon, could you come back for my sisters later? Very well, you have thirty years. But when I return, Marge, I shall take your favorite child. I thought I was the favorite. Not the favorite! Not the favorite! Listen, pal, you seem like an honest guy. Is there any other deal that you can accept? Three-way. You, me and Marge? Demon, demon, you. I guess it's one of those things a dad has to do... Now, before we start, what's the safe word? Cinnamon. Ooh, I like that. Now, I'd like to try something new if you don't mind... Cinnamon / Cinnamon / Cinnamon! Cinnamon! Y'know, it's really not fair you're charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover! The only way to buy that comic book for twenty-five cents is to go back to nineteen seventy-four. That's impossible! Or is it? Oh, it worked! My time machine has worked! This is the most fantastically-powerful invention in mankind's history. Here, kid. Hold my keys while I grab some lunch. Nineteen seventy-four! I won't be needing this. Now to get my comic book and explore a world where no one's mad at George Lucas. Eh, pretty good. A little preachy. Well, well, well. If it isn't Homer Simpson and Barney Gumbel. Allow me, gentlemen. It's Homer! Before his boobs came in! Hey, Homer. Who are you? I'm your unwanted son from the future, who killed all your fun! Why you little... Excuse me, is this room one-oh-six? Let go of him! What kind of jerk strangles a little boy? Would you go to the prom with me? Promenade? With you? Forget it, bub! It was love at first sight, and you ruined it! It was not love at first sight! What do you know? I know who I'm in love with. You're lookin' at him. You're an idiot. You're the idiot. Don't act like I'm the first person that ever said that! You are the first person who ever said that! Shut up and go to the prom with me! Ay carumba! If you guys don't get together... what does that mean for me in the future? I don't exist? Or... my life might be a hell of a lot better! Ma'am, whatever you do, do not marry that ape. Whatever you say, little boy. C'mere! Now to return to a future where I'm either rich or allowed to stand in front of a rich guy's house. Either way, better than now. Stupid kid. Steals my future. Well I'm going to...ice cream, with cookie dough?! ...unnecessarily big TVs?! ...""Thursday Night Football?!"" And the globe feels so warm -- I am in awe of the future! Okay, that's not so great. Here's your smoothie, sweetheart. Why would I suck smoothie, when I can suck face with you, Mrs. Artie Ziff! My Dad is Artie Ziff? Indeed! Which makes you Barty Ziff! Oy carumba! Achem! Good morning, beloved son. Enjoy your luxurious life, including your own bully butler. Will that be haw-haw, sir? Give yourself a wedgie. Excellent choice. I've met some jive turkeys in the seventies but that turkey's the jivest. Hey! You! This is my peeping tree! Young me? What brings you to the present? I've traveled through space and time to make Marge settle for me because she doesn't know better. Well, if we put our heads together, we can think of a plan. I've gotta ask, what happened? Was I in a forest fire or something? No. I love my life. I love it not. I love my life. I love it not. You're just like Indiana Jones, son. A role played by Richard Dreyfuss in our universe. I'm here to take my life back! I thought this might happen so I mastered Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Crawl atop me and meet your doom! Not so fast! Say hello to The United Federation of Homers Through History! Crush them in the name of Jebus! Okay guys, let's regroup. We'll come back with more Homers and start fresh in the morning. What's she doing here? I'll tell you what I'm doing, I'm realizing that I married the wrong man. Oh, you poor, sweet, simple Homers. I was supposed to be with all of you. Even you, Caveman Homer. That's Renaissance Homer. Well, cardinal or cannibal, I wish that twenty years ago I had chosen love. Lemme get this straight. None of you had time to take out the garbage? Make Egyptian Slave Homer do it. It's always me.","Ralph Wiggum, Mayor Joe Quimby, Artie Ziff, Teenage Patty, Chief Wiggum, Milhouse Van Houten, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Homer Simpson, Ethereal Being, Lisa Simpson, Principal Dondelinger, Technician, Groundskeeper Willie, Little Marge, Fop Homer, Lenny Leonard, Kirk Van Houten, Ned Flanders, Teenage Selma, Teenage Marge, Present-Day Homer, Ethereal Beings, Egyptian Slave Homer, Demon, Teenage Homer, Corrupt Pope Homer, 2nd Ethereal Being, DEMONS, Professor Jonathan Frink, Cletus Spuckler, Mysterious Figure, Bart Simpson, Comic Book Guy",7.3,600.0,2,2012-10-07,2012,24,Treehouse of Horror XXIII,6.57,67484.0
