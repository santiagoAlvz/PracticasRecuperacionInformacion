261,265,"""Olive oil?"" ""Asparagus?"" If your mother wasn't so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like normal people. I need this candy for school. Candy Class. Well, okay, but get five bags in case we eat four on the way home. My teacher said I need cupcakes. Cupcakes to learn. In the cart. I'm out of wine. Cart. We need these because we have... to... My doctor says, and my garage mechanic agrees, that... In the cart. Woo hoo! Y'know, I always felt sorry for Marge, having to do the shopping, but this is kind of fun. Yeah. I wish Maggie had to go to the emergency room more often. Hm... I never heard of a baby swallowing a magazine before. And I'm a doctor. I don't know if it matters, but it was a Time Magazine. Does that matter? Uh-oh. This could be dangerous. What? What? Syrian hard-liners are gaining influence. Wait, I changed my mind. Stack it in the order I'll eat it driving home. Sir, please. I've already bagged it by color, and in order of each item's discovery by man. The customer's always right. That's what everybody likes about us. Now mush! You tell 'im, Jumbo! And you, start over. I want everything in one bag. Yes ma'am. But I don't want the bag to be heavy. I don't think that's possible. What are you, the Possible Police? Just do it! Hey, hey, watch what you're doin' there, sack monkey. You're bruisin' my DuraLog. Hurry up. I can't stand here jabbing you all day. Please. Ow. Stop. Bag boys have feelings, too, you know. No you don't... Excuse me? Is there a problem here? No, I can handle it. I'll get you, squealer. Ow! Ok-- That's it. On behalf of Sack Stuffers Local 199, I'm calling a strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Oh, the bag boys are on strike! I'm shaking. Mr. Simpson, please. Will you go home? If I can have this rubber stick. Pledging to honor the bag boy strike are the Brotherhood of Fruit Packers And Unpackers, the Shelf Dusters Union, and the Unattractive Waitresses Of America. Kiss my grits! Indeed. Good luck, sir. No bag boys are gonna stop Lenny from hosting a casual get-together. Casual?! Uh, I can taste that get-together now... Hey, I was holdin' that! Next time I'll knock your hat off, scab! So hungry... There's gotta be some food left. Sulfur jerky... Cream of toast... Where did we get all this crap? Most of it was sent by relatives who couldn't see very well. Hey, I found some eggs! The mother abandoned her nest. There's gotta be something to eat in this house. Hey, the dog smells something! Good boy. Good boy. Show us where the food is. Where? Over there? Hey! Yoink. My old lunch box! That Amos Burke made his own rules. Very old animal crackers! Homer, no! Those were made in the Sixties. Mmmm... turbulent. Ow! What the hell? Whoa, a solid gold animal cracker. ""Find the golden giraffe, and we'll send you and your family to Africa."" Africa? They're bound to have food there! And on my free African safari, I want to do everything on this box. I want to shoot a lion in the face, fight Muhammad Ali, and ride in a convertible with two happy zebras. Sir, that contest ended thirty years ago. We don't even make animal crackers anymore. We make household poisons and Christmas lights. Your box made promises of a vacational nature. And I expect you to live up to them. We won't, though. Sir, with all due respect... An old box of cookies is not a legal contract. Ow! My eye! He could sue us... Defective string... Sharp corners... Mr. Simpson, we've decided to make good on your vacation. Woo hoo! Hey, mister? Uh, yes? On the plane, I'm gonna need two seats... for the twins. The Simpsons are going to Africa! Yayyy! What is it, Ngongo? Evil is coming. What shall we do, Ngongo? Eh... You are Ngongo now. Africa looks like a beautiful jewel. And these musical garment bags aren't bad either. Attention, passengers. Please prepare for our landing in Tanzania. I'm sorry, it is now called New Zanzibar. Excuse me. It is now called Pepsi Presents New Zanzibar. Hello, hello, Simpsons! Welcome to Africa. I am your guide, Kitenge. Hey, how ya doin' there? / Hi! / Hello. / Yo, Kitenge! What's going on? Isn't that cute? A bush-baby. Where? Ah! Shoo! Shoo! Oh, man. I just bought this shirt. Who's Muntu? He is our leader. He seized power in a bloodless coup. All smotherings. Just like Jimmy Carter. Okay, you'll be sleeping here tonight... On the ground? No, Mom. Ohhhhhhhhh. I will come down for your bags. That's okay. I got 'em. Eh, bound to happen. Help! This mosquito net's not working. No, no. You have it inside out. There. When do we get to see the animals? In the morning, little one. Now goodnight, and don't let the bedbugs paralyze. Homie, did you remember to tip Kitenge? No. He did not. All right, I got another one! Hey, you didn't see a warthog! I'm looking at one right now. Mom! Bart implied I was a warthog! Nobody's a warthog. What about him? Ooh, look, everybody! Wowww... It just rolled over to ten thousand. Now we sit quietly, and wait for nature to unveil herself. Wait, rhinos don't come from eggs. What did you just see, Lisa? I know, but... What did you just see? Oh, now come on... Look, Mother. By that tree... Cheetah. He doesn't look so fast to me. BA HOOLIE GANGA / HEELIE DOO / MA HOOLIE WAPPA / IMBATU Take it, Homer! GLIBBIE GLOP GLOOPIE / NIBBIE NABBIE NOOBIE / LA LE LO LO LO. What? What is it? Mm. Poachers. That's terrible! Now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the balance. Whenever there are so many species that people get confused and angry, a poacher is born. I don't care. I hate them. They'll be back. They left their cargo pants. This is the earliest known fossil of a human being. It's over two million years old. I've got more bones than that guy. If you're trying to impress me, you've failed. It's not the number of bones, sir, it's the... You have failed. The Masai chief welcomes you to his village. Oh, thank you. Your ground is so comfortable. By the way, what kind of blood is this? Cow. Hey, Mom. Look what Mbali gave me. Hey, check it out. Bart, I told you not to get your lip disked. All right. Uh-oh-boh-boh. That's it. Get into a frenzy! Ha, ha! This song has been going on for hours. Yeah, it's like the Allman Brothers! Homer, no! A hungry, hungry hippo! Help! Kitenge! Now, Simpsons! Run for it! Good ol' Kitenge. Quick! Into the river! Hippos hate water. No they don't. They-- Shaka Zulu! Which way should we go? The left! Go to the left! It's working! Leeches! Okay, here's the situation: We're hopelessly lost and about to die. Don't worry. Being eaten by a crocodile is just like going to sleep... in a giant blender. Wonder where this river goes. I've got a map! Monkey. Now, according to Animal Crackers, there's no river here. Stay in the boat, Homer. Look! Let's just float by quietly... So, you think they settled that bag boy strike yet? Oh, no! We're headed for Victoria Falls! Here's why they shouldn't get anything. One... This flower saved our lives. Oh, no! It's eating us! Not a chance. Wow, Dad. How did you do that? It's a flower. Are we insane yet? Are we insane yet? Are we insane yet? I told you, yes. Now Bart, go to the top of that hill and see if you can spot our hotel. Mount Kilimanjaro? Go. Okay. A chimp! Hello, little fella. Hey, maybe it'll lead us to bananas. Or... more mouthwatering monkeys. Overtime for bag boys? Ridiculous! This is the place I've read about! Where Dr. Bushwell lives among the chimps! Oh, isn't that sweet? He named it after his wife. No, Dr. Bushwell is a woman. Well, now I've heard everything. It's kind of you to take us in, Dr. Bushwell. Yeah, thanks for the grub. Grubs. Whatever. Ah, there's a burst of flavor. Your work has really inspired me, Doctor. And I love your sensible ponytail. Thank you. See, Jojo, she likes it. So, I notice your home smells of feces. Yes. And not just monkey feces either. Could we talk about something else? I-I love what you've done with these poles. Every day I get up at five-thirty, watch the chimps, eat a quick lunch of roots and water, then more chimp-watching. After dark I come home and think about chimps until it's time for bed. You must be the most boring woman on earth. Possibly, but... I mean I knew scientists wasted their lives, but geez. Ho-mer. What? What is it, Pointy? Oh no! It's the poachers! Give us the chimps and no one gets hurt! Absolutely not! Will you help me defend the refuge? Anything for these noble animals. So like us... Yes! Somebody light this monkey. Help! Bad monkey! Hey! Ah! Stop it, you creep! Greenpeace? That's right. And we're not leaving till we rescue every animal here. Well, if you really cared about chimps, you'd know that Dr. Bushwell is their best friend. Oh is that right? Why don't you tell her about the diamond mine, Doctor. Diamond mine? What are you talking about? I'm talking about this. The chimps are running a diamond mine?! Why, what fascinating behavior. I... I must document this new activity. Dr. Bushwell! What? These? Well, they were a graduation present. Unbelievable. The shaft must be five miles deep. / Oh, for-- / Lookit. There's more over here! She's hidden diamonds everywhere. Even on the soles of her shoes. She's one of the ten richest chimp researchers in the world. Look at me, I'm a scientist! How could you exploit your beloved chimps like this? I think we should look at her research before we condemn her entirely. I haven't said anything for a while. These are just pictures of monkeys from famous movies. All right, so I snapped. You don't understand the crushing loneliness and greed. Don't worry, Doctor. We'll get you all the help you need. No! Don't put me away! I'll give you diamonds! Everybody wants diamonds! Diamonds will make everything all better! Diamonds! Diamonds! What a nice lady. Very nice. Hey, Lis, check it out. Diamond Vision. Buzz off. Hey, look! Our tour guide got a new job. Hm, quite a promotion. I was wondering what became of him. What happened to President Muntu? I don't want to talk about it. / Oh, he got overthrown! Now he's just a stinking flight attendant!
