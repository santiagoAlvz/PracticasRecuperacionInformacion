You're next, Mr. Simpson. Hey, wait a minute. ""Airport tax, five dollars?"" Sir, it's a standard fee. Well, we are not boarding that plane unless you waive that tax. Waive it... Stupid anti-fist-shaking laws. The Simpsons are ridin' the rails! Cool. A dead hobo. Mornin', folks. What are you gonna do to us? Now, don't worry, I'm not a stabbin' hobo, I'm a singin' hobo. NOTHIN' BEATS THE HOBO LIFE / STABBIN' FOLKS WITH MY HOBO KNIFE-- I GOUGED... Excuse me, hobo. Can you play something a little less unnerving? Well, sure, ah... I was just havin' a little fun with you no-bos. Ah, here's a ballad that'll set fire to your trash can. WON'T YOU LISTEN TO MY TALE THAT'S TEN STORIES TALL / 'BOUT A KING-SIZED WOODSMAN NAME-A BUNYAN, COMMA, PAUL... Congratulations, Mister Bunyan. It's a boy. Jeezum crow! How was it, honey? Whiskey please. Me hungee. BORN MIGHTY BIG, HE CONTINUED TO EXPAND / THANKS TO A HOPPED-UP PITUITARY GLAND... HIS BODY GREW BIG, BUT HIS BRAIN STAYED SMALL / HE WAS TREE-CHOPPIN', FRIEND-STOMPIN', HOUSE-CRUSHING PAUL... Me hungee. Time to make Paul's breakfast. Hey, Paul, flapjacks! Flapjacks. Outta the fryin' pan! All right, uh, let's get started on lunch, and, uh... wait, where's Lenny? Hello? Can anybody hear me? I think I found a way oot. It's not pretty, but it'll do. All right. Look, we gotta do something about Bunyan. We're goin' bankrupt just feedin' and clothin' the guy. Not to mention the crushings. / Aw, yeah. Hey, I say we get him drunk and drag him outta town. Same way we got rid of Laura Ingalls Wilder. / Oh, yeah. That was classic. / Yeah, that's a good idea. Uh, hey Paulie, uh, what say we buy ya a beer? Aw, you guys are the greatest friends a giant doofus could have. Good Lord. Brought down by one beer? And a couple of these babies. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to the barn dance. Where am I? They don't want me anymore. PAUL WAS JUST AS LONELY AS A MAN COULD GET / SO HE TOOK OUT HIS AX AND HE CARVED HIMSELF A PET. Boy, I wish you were real. Hey! What the--? Oh, it's a miracle! I'll call you Babe! You'll be my best friend. So Paul and his blue ox Babe traveled all across this great land, leaving their mark... Excuse me... Paul Bunyan never fought Rodan. And his size seems to be really inconsistent. I mean, one minute he's ten feet tall, the next his feet are as big as a lake... Hey, hey, hey, who's the hobo here? I'm just sayin'... NOW PAUL AND BABE WERE A MIGHTY FINE MATCH... BUT THE MAN HAD AN ITCH THAT AN OX COULDN'T SCRATCH... She's purty... Ooh, what a handsome man! Gotcha! Don't worry. I won't smoosh you. You're cute. Ohhh, thank you. Hey, what are you doing? I just want to spruce up for our date. Ohhh! We've been together a long time now. When are we gonna, y'know...? Soon. I just need a few more yoga classes. Oh, look! A shooting star! That meteor's headed straight for us, with the fire and the impact and the hundred per cent chance of pain... Pain in the glayvin! God has sent this fiery killrock to show us his love. No, we're gonna die! / Oh no! / There's only one man who can save us... Oh, I get it. When I'm crushing and killing you, you don't like me. But when I can save your life, suddenly I'm Mister Popular. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Woo hoo! I'm Mister Popular! C'mon, right across the plate... Let's see what you got, huh? This one's for the little crippled boy... That I crippled. You can do it, Paul. Gimme a kiss for luck. And that's how Paul Bunyan started the Great Chicago Fire. Boy, that story had everything, a giant, house crushing, meteor... Townspeople... Got any more tall tales? Well, I s'pose I could spin ya a few more yarns... But first, who wants to give me a sponge bath? I'm filthy. All right, but your next story better be worth it. Git in there good. Yeah, that's it. Don't be shy. There you go. Okay, ready for another impression? This is Southside Jake tearin' into Tin Can Tillie. Oh, this'll be good. Who put the beans in my bindle? Oh, I am so tired of you sayin' that I put beans in your bindle! It just makes me so... Do you ever shut up? Kiss me, you fool. Uhhh, could we hear another tall tale? In a sec. All righty. Here's a story just for you, little girl. It's the tale of Johnnie... No, Connie Appleseed. Whoopsie. Dad, you just killed a poor, defenseless buffalo! A poor delicious buffalo. He'll be dinner for the whole wagon train. Hey, I found a bullet. Man, buffalo are easy to kill. Connn-nnniiiie! Connn-nnniiiie! Of course, apples! No, Con-nie! Over here! Help me! No Dad, they're apples. Well that's it. I don't want anything to do with this wagon train of death. Either switch to apples, or go on without me. You'll be sorry! She even changed her last name to ""Appleseed."" And her family changed theirs to ""Buffelkill."" I haven't had buffalo in six hours. Marge, how 'bout whipping up some buffalo sausage, huevos buffaleros, and some fresh-squeezed buffal-O.J. The buffalo are gone. I think you shot them all. What have I done? What have I done?! You're the fattest, Buffelkill. Okay everybody, dig in. Stop! I've got apples! Delicious, nutritious apples! And there's enough for everyone! Sweet... It's like a hootenanny in my mouth! We're saved! / It's a miracle! / Hooray for Connie Buffelkill! What? So now we're not eating Homer? And thanks to that little girl, today you can find apples in everything that's good. Apple wine, apple whiskey, apple schnapps, apple martinis, Snapple with vodka in it, apple nail polish remover... Don't forget apple sauce. Yeah, I suppose you could grind some pills into it. Aww... Ooh, look out there, folks. That's the mighty Mississip. Big deal. Reminds me of a tall tale about two scalawags raftin' down the Big Muddy: Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. That's not a tall tale. It's a book by Mark Twain. Look, let's just do this thing. Whitewashin' sucks, Tom. It powerful sucks. Mornin', friend. Want your turn at whitewashin'? It's powerful fun. Why, you ain't foolin' me again, Tom Sawyer. If I may... Now get to work! I still got it. Why Huckleberry Finn, you get down from there. A body could break his neck. I ain't afeared o' that. I'd just get a new neck, off'n a cat. Huck! Oh, Huck, you gave your bones an awful rattling. Yeah... but I'm feelin' better right now. Aha! Papa! Hold my daughter's hand, will ye? I was gonna let go, by and by! Well, I guess there's no harm done... as long as it was going to be by and by, but just to play it safe... We are gathered here today to force this man, Huckleberry Finn, into holy matrimony. How romantic! This reminds me of our shotgun wedding. Grampa, we've been married for years. When are you gonna put down that gun? Well, I reckon you're right. Hang it all! Do you, Huck, take Becky as your wife? Hey, they done switched the groom with a pig! No wonder he was poopin' so much. Haw haw. Come on, let's get those polecats! Aw, judge. Now we'll never catch 'em! I reckon we're safe now. There's the state line. Uh-oh. Rapids! Please do not exit the raft until it has come to a complete stop. Mr. Silas, this young lady's flashing her privates. Oh, well, I'll dispose of this. All for Silas. All for Silas. I'm considerable hungry. We got any food left? Hm. Looks like we're out of cornpone, fatback, hardtack, fatpone, corntack... Any tackback? Tackback? I mean backtack. Plumb out. One jug of whiskey... three plugs of tobacky... and some extra-strength opium. That will be two cents, boys. Two cents?! Hey, if you think my prices are high, go across the street. Thank you, come again. He put the lardpone on top of the eggpone. Dang! Double dang! Aw, donkey butter! Oh, it's no use. I got an idea. Well dog my cats. They's dis-apporated. Keep quiet, Huck. They won't look up here if nothin' draws their attention. OLD MAN RIVER / THAT OLD MAN RI-VERRR... HE JUST KEEPS ROLLIN'... Well, I see President Fillmore's in the news again... What'll it be, boys? Just three X's for me. Gimme five. This ain't no five-X whiskey! I can still see. That barkeep's a no-good cheat! Cheat?! All right, we've all got derringers. Now let's just put 'em away. Nobody here is a cheat. Cheat?! Man, those derringer bullets are weak. Powerful weak. Light out and stay lit-out! Aw, catfish! Let us pray for the souls of these dearly departed young men, Huckleberry Finn and Thomas Sawyer. Now for the traditional lowering of the bodies into the coffins. And that was Tom and Huck's last adventure. I liked that story 'cause I was a Judge. Delaware! Oh well, this is our stop. Would you like to come sightseeing with us? We're gonna visit the place where J.C. Penney sends their damaged merchandise. No thanks. I'm gonna keep on ridin' the rails, swappin' stories for sponge baths. I believe I told three stories. I'll meet you in Wilmington. Close the door. Raise your arm... Okay, the other one... You know, I do four hundred sit-ups a day. Oh, it shows. I was gonna say something, but I thought it might sound you know, weird. Oh, not at all. I like when people say nice things about my body. And it's important to feel good about yourself... Okay, spread your toes. Do you know how much glass is in here?","Mayor Joe Quimby, Carl Carlson, HUCK/TOM, Photographer, Hobo, Chief Wiggum, Hans Moleman, Milhouse Van Houten, FAINT VOICE, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Tom Sawyer, Country Doctor, Paul Bunyan, Crowd, Huck Finn, Homer Simpson, Sourdough Moe, Grampa Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, Sideshow Mel, Groundskeeper Willie, Villagers, Sheriff Wiggum, Pioneers, Lenny Leonard, Mrs. Abe Bunyan, Rev.
