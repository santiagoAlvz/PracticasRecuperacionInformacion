0,1,"Ooo, careful, Homer. There's no time to be careful. We're late. Sorry, Excuse us. Pardon me... Hey, Norman. How's it going? So you got dragged down here, too... heh, heh. How ya doing, Fred? Excuse me, Fred. Pardon my galoshes. Wasn't that wonderful? And now, ""Santas of Many Lands,"" as presented by the entire second grade class. Oh... Lisa's class. Frohlich weihnachten -- that's German for Merry Christmas. In Germany, Santa's servant Ruprecht gives presents to good children and whipping rods to the parents of bad ones. Meri Kurimasu. I am Hotseiosha, a Japanese priest who acts like Santa Claus. I have eyes in the back of my head so children better behave when I'm nearby. And now, presenting Lisa Simpson, as Tawanga, the Santa Claus of the South Seas. Oh, it's Lisa. That's ours. The fourth grade will now favor us with a melody, medley of holiday flavorites. DASHING THROUGH THE SNOW / IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH / O'ER THE FIELDS WE GO / LAUGHING ALL THE WAY... HA HA HA... BELLS ON BOB-TAIL RING / MAKING SPIRITS BRIGHT / WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE AND SING THIS SLEIGHING SONG TONIGHT! Isn't Bart sweet, Homer? He sings like a little angel. ""JINGLE BELLS, BATMAN SMELLS, ROBIN LAID AN EGG / THE BATMOBILE BROKE ITS WHEEL, THE JOKER GOT AWAY."" The fifth grade will now favor us with a scene from Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"". How many grades does this school have? ""Dear friends of the Simpson family: We had some sadness and some gladness this year. First the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. But we bought a new little cat, Snowball II...so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life going on, Grampa is still with us, feisty as ever. Maggie is walking by herself. Lisa got straight A's, and Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all..."" Marge, haven't you finished that stupid letter yet? ...Homer sends his love. Happy Holidays. Marge! The Simpsons. Marge, where's the extension cord? Oh, for heavens sakes, Homer. It's in the utility drawer. Sorry. I'm just a big kid and I love Christmas so much. ...Every year. All right, children. Let me have those letters. I'll send them to Santa's workshop at the North Pole. Oh, please. There's only one fat guy that brings us presents and his name ain't Santa. A pony? Oh, Lisa. You've asked for that for the last three years and I keep telling you Santa can't fit a pony into his sleigh. Can't you take a hint? But I really want a pony and I've been really, really good this year. Oh, dear. Maybe Bart is a little more realistic. A tattoo! A what! Yeah, they're cool and they last the rest of the your life. You will not be getting a tattoo for Christmas. Yeah. If you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance. All right! Homer! Y'ello. Marge, please. Who's this? May I please speak to Marge? This is her sister, isn't it? Is Marge there? Who shall I say is calling? Marge, please. It's your sister. Hello. Hello, Marge. It's Patty. Selma and I couldn't be more excited about seeing our baby sister for Christmas eve. Well, Homer and I are looking forward to your visit, too. Somehow I doubt that Homer's excited. Of all the men you could have married, I don't know why you picked the one who's always so rude to us. Good one, Dad. Okay, kids. Prepare to be dazzled. Marge! Turn on the juice! What do you think, kids? Nice try, Dad. Just hold your horses, son. Hey, hey, Simpson. What is it, Flanders? Do you think this looks okay? Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ooh. Oh. Neat-o. It's too bright. That Flanders, what a big show-off. Kids, you want to go Christmas shopping? I do! All right, the mall! Go get your money. Spill it, Marge. Where have you been hiding the Christmas money? Oh, I have my secrets. Turn around. You can look now. Oh! Big jar this year. Oh, Bart, that's so sweet. It's the best present a mother could get and it makes you look so dangerous. One ""mother"", please. Wait a minute. How old are you? Twenty-one, sir. Get in the chair. Mm-hmm... Mmm-hmm... Mmm-hmm... Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Attention all personnel! Please keep working during the following announcement. And now, our boss and friend, Mr. Burns. Hello. I'm proud to announce that we have been able to increase safety... ... here at the plant without increasing the cost to the consumer, or affecting management pay raises. However, for you semi-skilled workers, there will be no Christmas bonuses. One more thing: Merry Christmas. Oh, thank God for the big jar. Where's that Bart? But, Mom, I thought you'd like it. Yes, Mrs. Simpson, we can remove your son's tattoo. It's a simple routine involving lasers. Cool! However, it is rather expensive and we must insist on a cash payment up front. Cash? Ah-hmmm. Thank God for Homer's Christmas bonus. Ay carumba! Now, whatever you do, boy, don't squirm. You don't want to get this sucker near your eye or groin. Ow! Quit it. Ow! Quit it! Ow! Quit it! Ow! Quit it! Hey! What's with this? Ow! Quit it. It used to be a real boss tattoo. But Mom had to spend all the Christmas money having it surgically removed. It's true. The jar's empty. Oh, my God, we're ruined. Christmas is cancelled. No presents for anyone. Don't worry, Homer. We'll just have to stretch your Christmas bonus even further this year. Homer? Oh, yeah my Christmas bonus. How silly of me. This'll be the best Christmas yet. The best any family ever had. Heh-heh. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me, Homer. Oh. I love you, Marge. Homer, you tell me that all the time. Oh, good. Because I do love you and I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping. But I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus. I keep asking for it, but... Marge, well, let me be honest with you. Yes... Well... I want to do the Christmas shopping this year. Well, sure, okay... Marge, Marge, Marge. Let's see. Oooh, look! Pantyhose. Practical and alluring. A six-pack... Oh! Only four ninety nine. Oooh... pads of paper. I bet Bart can think of a million things to do with these. That just leaves little Maggie. Oh, look, a little squeak-toy. . It says it's for dogs, but she can't read... Ow. Oh, Simpson, it's you. Hello, Flanders. Oh, my, what a little mess we've got here! Well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine? Well, let's see. This one's mine. And this one's mine. This one's mine... and this-- They're all yours. Hey, Mr. Simpson. You dropped your pork chop. Gimme that! Well, happy holidays, Simpson. Gee, Dad, this is gonna be the best Christmas ever. You bet. What's the matter, Homer? Somebody leave a lumpa coal in your stocking? You've been sitting there sucking on a beer all day long. So? So it's Christmas! Thanks, Moe. Drinks all around! What's with the crazy getup, Barn? I got me a part-time job working as a Santa down at the mall. Wow. Can I do that? I don't know. They're pretty selective. Do you like children? What do you mean? All the time? Even when they're nuts? Oh, I certainly do. Welcome aboard Simpson... pending your successful completion of our training program, that is. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. What is it now, Simpson? Huh, when do we get paid? Not a dime till Christmas Eve. Now, from the top. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Dasher, Dancer... Um-hmm. Prancer... Um-hmm. Nixon, Comet, Cupid... Donna Dixon. Sit down, Simpson. And what would you like, little boy? You're not really Santa, tubby. Why you little eggheaded...! No, no, Homer. If such an emergency arises, just tell them Santa's very busy this time of year and you're one of his helpers. Oh, I knew that one, too. Homer! Why are you seven hours late? Not a word, Marge. I'm heading straight for the tub. But Homer, my sisters are here. Don't you want to say hello? Oh, Dad, you're finally home. Daddy! We're so glad to see you! What? Why? Oh, yeah. Hello Patty, hello Selma. How was your trip? Fine. You both look well. Thank you. Yeah, well, Merry Christmas. Oh, it's Christmas? You wouldn't know it around here. And why is that? Well, for one thing, there's no tree. Well, I was just on my way out to get one. Can we go too, Dad? Can we? No! Hey, you. What do you think you're doing? Uh-oh. Hey, hey! Come back here. So, what do you think kids? Beauty, isn't it? Yeah, Homer. Way to go, Dad. Why is there a birdhouse in it? That's an ornament. Do I smell gunpowder? And then I want some Robotoids... and then I want a Goop Monster... and then I want a great big, giant... Ah, son, you don't need all that junk. I'm sure you've already got something much more important, a decent home and a loving father who would do anything for you. Hey, I couldn't afford lunch. Gimme a bite of that donut. Get a load of that quote unquote Santa. I can't believe those kids are fallin' for it. Hey, Milhouse. I dare you to sit on his lap. Oh, yeah? Well, I dare you to yank his beard off. Ah, touch√©! I hope you feel better, Santa. I will when Mrs. Claus's sisters get out of town. Thanks for listening, kid. Hey Santa, what's shaking? What's your name, Bart... ner? -- Er -- Little partner? I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you? I'm Jolly Old Saint Nick. Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that. Homer! I want a word with you in Santa's Workshop, little boy. Cover for me, Elfie. Don't kill me, Dad. I didn't know it was you. Nobody knows. It's a secret. I didn't get my bonus this year, but to keep the family from missing out on Christmas, I'd do anything. I'll say, Dad. You must really love us to sink so low. Now let's not get mushy, son. I still have a job to do. Hey, little ones, Santa's back. Ho! Ho! Arrgh! -- Damn it to... Ah, son. One day you're gonna know the satisfaction of payday. Receiving a big fat check for a job well done. Simpson, Homer? Here you go. Come on, son. Let's go cash this baby and get presents for -- Thirteen bucks? Hey, wait a minute! That's right. One hundred and twenty dollars gross, less social security -- Yeah. Less unemployment insurance -- But... Less Santa training -- Santa? Less costume purchase -- Wait a minute... Less beard rental, less Christmas club. But... but... See you next year. Come on, Dad. Let's go home. Thirteen bucks. We can't get anything for thirteen bucks. All right! Thirteen big ones. Springfield Downs, here I come. What? You heard me. I'm going to the dog track. I got a hot little puppy in the fourth race. Wanna come? Sorry, Barney. I may be a total washout as a father, but I'm not gonna take my kid to some sleazy dog track on Christmas eve. Come on, Simpson. The dog's name is Whirlwind, ten to one shot. Money in the bank. Uh-uh. Ah, come on Dad, this can be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas. If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it's gonna happen to us. Well, okay. Let's go. Who's Tiny Tim? Hey, Moldy, do you think Santa will be able to find Elf County under all this snow? I doubt it, Bubbles. We'll be sad little elves this Christmas. Oh, no! Oh, brother! Where's your husband? Yeah. It's getting late. He said he went caroling with Bart. WE'RE IN THE MONEY / WE'RE IN THE MONEY / WE GOT A LOT OF WHAT IT TAKES TO GET ALONG. I can't believe I'm doing this. Can we open our presents now, Dad? You know the tradition, son. Not till the eighth race. Hey, Barney, which one is Whirlwind? Number six. That's our lucky dog, right over there. He's won his last five races. What! That scrawny little bag of bones? Come on, Dad. They're all scrawny little bags of bones. Yeah, you're right. I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas. Attention racing fans. We have a late scratch in the fourth race. Number eight, Sir Galahad, will be replaced by Santa's Little Helper. Once again, Sir Galahad has been replaced by Santa's Little Helper. Bart, did you hear that? What a name -- ""Santa's Little Helper"". It's a sign! It's an omen! It's a coincidence, Dad. What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper? Ninety nine to one. Whoa! Ninety-nine times thirteen equals MER-RY CHRISTMAS! I got a bad feeling about this. Don't you believe in me, son? Uh... Come on, boy. Sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going. Oh, go for it, Dad. That's my boy. Everything on Santa's Little Helper. Three cheers for Brainy. Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray! Yay! Unadulterated pap. It's almost nine o'clock. Where is Homer anyway? It's so typical of the big doofus to spoil it all. What, Aunt Patty? Oh, nothing dear. I'm just trashing your father. Well I wish you wouldn't because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have. Therefore he is my model of manhood and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me. And I am far to young to defend myself against such onslaughts. Um-hm. Go watch your cartoon show, dear. Come on, Bart. Kiss the ticket for good luck, not that we need it. Heh-heh-heh. Here comes Screwy the Mechanical Rabbit. And they're off! Around the first turn. Come on, ""Santa's Little Helper!"" Come on, dog! Go, man! Go! Come on Santa's Little Helper! Run baby run! Come on Santa's Little Helper! Go, go, go! Run your tail off! It's ""Whirlwind"" in the lead... And coming up on the left is ""Quadruped"", followed by Dog O' War and ""Fido"". Go! Go! Go Santa's Little Helper! Come on, boy. Come on, get that rabbit. ...Dog of war coming up fast on the outside... And with a lock on last place it's... ""Santa's Little Helper."" Don't worry, Dad. Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens. Around the clubhouse turn, Whirlwind is staking out a big lead, a couple of lengths. Quadruped fighting it out and coming up fast, Chew My Shoe. And it's ""Whirlwind"" by a country mile, and in second, ""Chew My Shoe"" followed by ""Dog O' War"". It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me. I don't want to leave till our dog finishes. Ah, forget it. Let's go. Find any winners, son? Sorry, Dad. Hey-hey, Simpson! What'd I tell you... Whirlwind. Let's go, Daria. Beat it! Scram! Get lost! You came in last for the last time. Look, Dad. It's Santa's Little Helper. And don't come back! Oh, no you don't. No. No. Get away from me. Uh-uh. Oh, can we keep him Dad, please? But he's a loser. He's pathetic. He's... -- a Simpson. Maybe I should call the police. Oh, he'll sober up. Yeah, and come staggering home. Um-hm. Smelling of cheap perfume. Homer! All right, look everybody. I have a confession to make. This should be good. I didn't get my Christmas bonus. I tried not to let it ruin Christmas for everybody, but no matter what I did, I just couldn't -- Hey, everybody. Look what we got! A dog! All right, Dad! Good bless him. So love at first sight is possible. And if he runs away, he'll be easy to catch. This is the best gift of all, Homer. It is? Yes, something to share our love -- -- And frighten prowlers. What's his name? Number eight. I mean, Santa's Little Helper. RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER / HAD A VERY SHINY NOSE / AND IF YOU EVER SAW IT / YOU WOULD EVEN SAY IT GLOWED Like a light bulb! Bart!
