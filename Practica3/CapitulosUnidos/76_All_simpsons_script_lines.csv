75,76,"My friends. Tonight, we unveil my most diabolical creation.... ""Swank."" Ten times more addictive than marijuana. To human misery. Ice to see you. McBain! Ah, McBain. So glad you could make it. Have a salmon puff. All right. Ahhh! Ahhh! That is one evil dude. It's just a movie, son. There's nobody that evil in real life. Eh. Smithers, where's that union representative? He's twenty minutes late. I don't know, sir. He hasn't been seen since he promised to clean up the union. Whoa! What the hell? Well let's look at the contract ourselves. Benefits... perks... a green cookie on St. Patrick's Day? Oh, it didn't used to be this way, Smithers. No, it didn't used to be this way at all... Come on! Come on! Crack those atoms! You... turn out those pockets. Atoms... Six of them! Take him away. You can't treat the working man this way. One day we'll form a union and get the fair and equitable treatment we deserve. Then we'll go too far, and get corrupt and shift-less and the Japanese will eat us alive! The Japanese!? Those sandal-wearing goldfish tenders? Bosh! Flimshaw. If only we had listened to that boy, instead of walling him up in the abandoned coke oven. Well, I'm going to avenge my grandfather. We'll take on that greedy union and get back our... Dental Plan. How often do you brush, Ralph? Three times a day, sir. Why must you turn my office into a house of lies? You're right, I don't brush. I don't brush... Let's look at a picture book, ""The Big Book of British Smiles."" That's enough. That's enough. Doctor Wolfe likes to pull kids' teeth so he can sell them. To who? You know that rattle when you shake up spray paint? That's a kid's tooth. Maggie's teeth are coming in crooked. Has she been sucking on a pacifier? Uh... not to my knowledge. Liar! I'm also afraid Lisa is going to need braces. Oh no. I'll be socially unpopular. More so. Are you sure, Doctor? Well, judge for yourself. Here's Lisa today... Without treatment, here's what she'll look like at age eleven. Age fourteen. Age seventeen. And finally, age eighteen. Cool. She'll be a freak. Bart! We can stick her in a trailer, drive her around the South, and charge two bits a gander. Now stay tuned for professional wrestling, live from the Springfield Grapplarium! Tonight, a Texas death match... Dr. Hillbilly vs. the Iron Yuppie. One man will actually be unmasked and killed in the ring! I hope they kill that Iron Yuppie. Thinks he's so big. Homer, Lisa needs Braces. Don't worry. We won a dental plan in the strike of eighty-eight. That's where I got this scar. What do we want? More equitable treatment at the hands of management! When do we want it? Soon! Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito? Then I got this scar sneaking under the door of a pay toilet. Welcome brothers of Local 643. As you know, our president, Chucky Fitzhugh, ain't been seen lately. We're all praying he'll turn up soon, alive and well. All right, all right, but seriously, we have to vote on Burns' new contract. It's basically the same deal, except we get a free keg of beer for our meetings. And in exchange for that, we have to give up our dental plan. So long dental plan! Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Bullseye! Thanks a lot Carl. Now I've lost my train of thought. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. If we give up our dental plan, I'll have to pay for Lisa's braces. People stop! We can't give up our dental plan! Lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth. Yoink! Hey! And Gummy Joe, where would you be without the dental plan? I wouldn't have old chomper here, that's for sure. You know what I think of this contract? Who is that firebrand, Smithers? That's Homer Simpson, sir. Simpson, eh?... New man? Actually sir, he thwarted your campaign for governor... you ran over his son... he saved the plant from meltdown and his wife painted your portrait-- Doesn't ring a bell. Homer! Homer! Homer! I move that Homer Simpson be our new union president. All in favor... Aye! All opposed? Nay. Congratulations, Homer! Hey, what does this job pay? Nothin'. ... Unless you're crooked. Woo hoo! President of the union! I'm so proud of you, Homie. This is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man. And make life-long connections to the world of Organized Crime. Hmmm... organized crime. Don Homer, I have baked a special donut just for you. Mmm. Gratzi. Don Homer, my son, he has trouble with the... Eh-Eh-Eh. Molto bene. That's-a-nice-a-donut. Do you think you can get the dental plan back? Well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, Mr. Burns or me. Dad, I'll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol' danish. Done and done! Heh, heh, heh. Lisa and Marge, these braces are invisible, painless, and periodically release a delightful burst of Calvin Klein's Obsession for teeth. Mmmm. Doctor, we don't have a dental plan right now. So we'll need something a little more... affordable. These pre-date stainless steel so you can't get them wet. Hmm, he's a worthy foe. Look at him, Smithers. Exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine. Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back? Okay, but it's the last time. We don't have to be adversaries, Homer. We both want a fair union contract. Why is Mr. Burns being so nice to me? And, if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. Wait a minute. Is he coming on to me? I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what's the harm? Oh my God, he is coming on to me. After all, negotiations make strange bedfellows. Yikes! Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no. Lisa, so you won't be scared, I'll show you some of the tools I'll be using. This is the scraper. This is the poker. And this happy little fellow is the gouger. Uh huh. Now, the first thing I'll be doing is chiseling some teeth out of your jaw- bone. Hold still while I gas you. Look fellas! It's Lisa in the sky. No diamonds, though. Look out for that campy drawing of Queen Victoria! For the love of God, help us! The mirror. The mirror! Honey, you look fine. Who is it? Goons. Who? Hired goons. Hired goons? Ah, Homer! I hope Crusher and Low Blow didn't hurt you. You know, you could have just called me. Oh yes, but the telephone is so impersonal. I prefer the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons. Hired goons? This is the largest TV in the free world. Aiiee! Un gato malodoro! This is a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters. Soon they'll have written the greatest novel known to man. Let's see. ""It was the best of times. It was the blurst of times?"" You stupid monkey! Ohh, shut up. And this is my basement. Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms. Yes, I really should stop ending the tour with it. Now, let's get down to business. Oh man, I've really got to go to the bathroom. Why did I have all that beer and coffee and watermelon? Now, Homer, I know what you're thinking and I want to take the pressure off. It doesn't take a whiz to see that you're looking out for number one. Well, listen to me and you'll make a big splash very soon. Which way to the bathroom? Oh. It's the twenty-third door on the left. Nope. Nope. Nope. Ah, he wouldn't even hear me out. Find the bathroom alright? Uh... yeah. Well, you've won this round Simpson, but I'll grind you into the earth like a bug! Simpson, be a dear and rub my legs till the feeling comes back. A bug, I tell you! A bug! I'm gonna resign. I don't know why they made me Union President in the first place. Because they love you down at the plant. Yeah, you're right. Guys are always patting my bald head for luck... pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh... That doesn't sound like they like you at all. Ya know, I think you're right. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm gonna punch Lenny in the back of the head. Batten down those cowlicks... straighten that part... uncross those eyes, Mister. But I can't. Oh, sorry Quigley. Come on, honey, smile. I bet you've got a beautiful smile. Why don't you share it with the world? We can always stick in a ""Photo Not Available"" card. Fellow workers, I've been meeting with Mr. Burns day and night and I've had enough. Strike! Strike! Strike! All in favor of a strike... Aye! All opposed? Nay. Who keeps saying that? It was him. Let's get him, fellows. COME GATHER 'ROUND CHILDREN / IT'S HIGH-TIME YE LEARNS / 'BOUT A HERO NAMED HOMER / AND A DEVIL NAMED BURNS / WE'LL MARCH TILL WE DROP / THE GIRLS AND THE FELLAS / WILL FIGHT TILL THE DEATH OR ELSE FOLD LIKE UMBRELLAS Ahhh. This is the life. Smithers, get me some strike breakers like the kind they had in the 30's. We can't bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways. One trick is to tell them stories that don't go anywhere... Like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time... now to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them. ""Give me five bees for a quarter"" you'd say. Now, where were we? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions, because of the war... Full power, Smithers. SO WE'LL MARCH DAY AND NIGHT / BY THE BIG COOLING TOWER / THEY HAVE THE PLANT / BUT WE HAVE THE POWER. Now do ""Classical Gas."" Oooo, look at him strutting around like he's cock of the walk. Well, let me tell you, Homer Simpson is cock of nothing. Why you and I can run this plant ourselves. Crush, kill, destroy... Tonight on Smartline -- The Power Plant Strike: Argle-bargle or Foofaraw? With us tonight are plant owner C.M. Burns; union kingpin Homer Simpson, and talk show mainstay Dr. Joyce Brothers. I brought my own mike! Yes, well, Homer, organized labor has been called a lumbering dinosaur. Yes, well, my director is telling me not to talk to you anymore. Woo hoo! Uh, Mr. Burns, you mentioned you wanted an opening tirade? Yes, thank you, Kent. Fifteen minutes from now I will wreak a terrible vengeance on this city. No one will be spared. No one! A chilling vision of things to come. Homer, any thoughts? Oh for God's sake. Goodbye, Springfield. From hell's heart I stab at thee! SO WE'LL MARCH DAY AND NIGHT / BY THE BIG COOLING TOWER... THEY HAVE THE PLANT / BUT WE HAVE THE POWER... Look at them all, through the darkness I'm bringing. They're not sad at all, they're actually singing! They sing without juicers! They sing without blenders! They sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers! Tell Simpson I'm ready to deal All right! You can even have the dental plan!... On one condition. You must resign as head of the union. Woo hoo! Smithers, I'm beginning to think that Homer Simpson was not the brilliant tactician I thought he was. Woop, woop, woop! Woop, woop, woop! We're going back to work! Oh, honey, you can hardly see your new braces. And that's the tooth! Oops. I left the gas on.","Ralph Wiggum, Carl Carlson, Waylon Smithers, Homer's Brain, Photographer, Mop Top #3, Chief Wiggum, Bumblebee Man, Marge Simpson, Man, Senator Mendoza, Goon, Kent Brockman, Burns' Grandfather, Crowd, Homer Simpson, Guy, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Woman, Seymour Skinner, C.
