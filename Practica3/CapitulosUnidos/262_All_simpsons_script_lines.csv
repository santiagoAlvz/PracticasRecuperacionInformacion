258,262,"Welcome back to ""Great Moments in Olympic History."" At the 1936 Berlin games, Jesse Owens humiliates Adolf Hitler by out-racing his zeppelin. 1968, Mexico City. Bob Beamon shatters the world long-jump record. And in 1984, Portugal's Carlos Lopez becomes the oldest Olympic marathon winner ever at age 38. 38! That's roughly my age! Marge, after a lot of thought, I've decided to run the Springfield marathon. Oh, please. You get exhausted watching ""The Twilight Zone"" marathon! I'm a regular Billy Crystal. You got that right. Well, Dad, I think running's good exercise -- it adds years to your life. Stay out of this, Lisa. Marge, I've made up my mind. I'll do your job for a day, and you do mine. Then we'll see who has it tougher. Good afternoon, and welcome to the 97th Springfield marathon, commemorating the time Jebediah Springfield ran across six states to avoid his creditors. You got all your equipment, Dad? Let's see. Sweatbands... check. Anti-chafing nipple tape... Check, check... and check. Attention, runners. On your mark, get set, now get outta here before I change my mind. I can't believe it! I'm actually running a marathon! Oh, I hit the wall! This is so painful! Hey, I got my second wind. Another wall! I ju-- Woo hoo! Third wind! Faster, rickshaw driver! Faster! Ow! Sir, the whip isn't helping. Silence! You call yourself a Chinaman? No one can outrun The Flash! Curses! One of my super foes has set a trap for me. Hey, Grampa's running! That's not Grampa. Dad's just dehydrated. And with five hundred yards to go, the runners from Australia and Djibouti are neck and neck. Two weary warriors now, burning with pain and exhaustion. But only one will win the grand prize... A walking tour of Springfield. That tour is mine. Wellll, hold the phone, Dora. A new challenger has emerged out of nowhere. He's running on sheer pluck, moxie, and grit... All of which he'll be tested for, after the race. Eh, I winna da race! Viva Italia! Folks, our winner seems to be from Italy. I love-a you all! I use up all-a my English. Grazie, Springfield! He's a phony! Lousy cheater! I demand a re-race! I got a better idea. Let's have a fun run...on his trachea. Yeah! / Kill him! / Make him pay! Get in! Hurry! Mob... Stranger. Mob... Stranger. Stranger. Who are you? Oh, you'll find out in due time. Well, it says here your name is ""L.T. Smash."" The time has come: I'm L.T. Smash. Thank you so much for saving our son from that murderous mob. Well, thank you for lettin' me chill in your crib. And thank you for assuming we're hip. All right, now here's the 411: I'm a record producer, see. I'm starting a new boy band and there's a place in it for Bart. My Bart? Oh, yeah. That stunt he pulled at the race shows me he's the bad boy I'm lookin' for. Now listen to me, Smash. We're not signing anything. Unless it's a contract. Why do you want Bart? He's not much of a singer. Marge, it's not the singin' that brings in the Sacajaweas. Bart's a rebel. And that's what I need for my new band, the ""Party Posse"". Now hold on. I have some concerns. Please, Mom. My dream is to be a rock star. And my dream is to get rid of Bart. But... How many lives must you ruin? Oh, Okay. Bart, I want you to meet 'n' greet the other members of the ""Party Posse"". He's smart... he's soulful... he's Milhouse! What up, G-money? Next, he'll break your nose, your glasses and your heart... Nelson! Wait, these are just guys from school. Who's next? Ralph Wiggum? Wheee! I'm a pop sensation. And I'm the mack daddy behind such groups as ""New Kids in the Ditch"" and ""Boy-nudo"". I'm gonna make you stars. Sneer, sneer. Two, three, four, and thrust, and grab, yourself, right there. Now let go and flirt. You call that a flirt? I'm not mel-ting! Okay, your 'tudes are fly and your threads are dope- All that's left is the singing. PARTY POSSE, WE RULE THE EARTH / THE GREATEST BAND SINCE MUSIC'S BIRTH. Isn't this song a little boastful? No one told me there was gonna be boasting. Just take it from the top. PARTY POSSE, WE RULE THE EARTH / THE GREATEST BAND SINCE MUSIC'S BIRTH... Thank you, NASA. WE LOVE TO SWEAT AND WE LOVE TO SING / WE'RE REAL FUNKY BUT NON-THREATENING. WE'RE THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD / BUT WE'D GIVE IT ALL UP FOR THAT SPECIAL GIRL. YOU'RE MY SPECIAL GIRRRL... SPE-CIAL GIRRRL! YOU'RE MY SPECIAL GIRRRL / ONLY YOUUUU. ... so, from now on anything caught in your zipper will be handled by the school nurse, and not me. And now... are you adequately prepared to rock? Yeah! Silence! Here they are, the Party Posse! Hel-lo, Springfield! Now, here's a song that your Principal Skinner doesn't want us to play. That's not true! This assembly was my idea. I like your brand of inoffensive pop rock. Screw you, man! We're gonna play it anyway! I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT AT THE SPELLING BEE... I KNEW RIGHT THEN THAT IT WAS L-U-V... I GOTTA SPELL OUT WHAT YOU MEAN TO ME... 'CAUSE I CAN NO LONGER BE A SILENT G. I'VE GOTTA SPELL OUT / I GOTTA SPELL OUT WHAT YOU MEAN TO ME. Man, they're gonna be big. And you stood in their way. No, I didn't. I even came in early and made orange drink. Orange drink: what, do you live with your mamma? She lives with me. I can't believe it. They loved us! I'm wearing a bathrobe and I'm not even sick! Yo, dudes, awesome show. It's 'N Sync! Word. What brings you to Springfield? We saw your Band Formation Notice in the paper. Really? You saw our B.F.N.? I can't believe I'm meeting Milhouse. Word. So anyway we brought you this wicked gift basket. Stubble glitter... crowd taser... Crowd taser? Yeah, it's perfect for getting through the fans to your limousine. Yo?! Dudes, we gotta go. Our clothes are getting a little out of date. To the Bandanna Republic! Word. Now we gotta send them a basket. Oh, yeah, that's the spot. Ohhh... that is perfect. Mommm, can't Bart get his massage somewhere else? Don't be selfish, Lisa. Will you two shut up? I'm missing precious VJ prattle. Wooo! That was the latest ad for Stridex Pads. Medicated! Okay, comin' at ya, a world premiere video from P squared. That's the Par-tay Pos-say! Woo! Yeah! All right! Rock! Woo! OH SAY CAN YOU... ROCK! THERE'S TROUBLE IN A FAR OFF NATION / TIME TO GET IN LOVE FORMATION. YOUR LOVE'S MORE DEADLY THAN SADDAM / THAT'S WHY I'VE GOT TO DROP DA BOMB. YVAN EHT NIOJ / YVAN EHT NIOJ / YVAN EHT NIOJ. NIOJ! YVAN EHT NIOJ. Ya gotta love that crazy chorus. What does it mean? Ah, it doesn't mean anything. It's like ""rama-lama ding dong"" or ""give peace a chance"". THIS PARTY'S HAPPENIN' / IT'S NO MIRAGE... SO SING IT AGAIN... Y VAN... EHT NIOJ. YVAN EHT NIOJ / YVAN EHT NIOJ. There's something weird about this video... None of those girls has had three kids, I can tell you that. No, something else... YVAN EHT NIOJ / YVAN EHT NIOJ / YVAN EHT NIOJ. ""Yvan eht nioj?"" They keep saying that. Wait, what was that? Uncle Sam? Let me play this backwards. JOIN THE NAVY Join the navy. They're recruiting people with subliminal messages! Otto, what are you doing? I don't know. I just got an urge to join the Navy. You're being brainwashed. Yeah, probably. Yvan eht nioj. L.T., thank God you're here! The government's putting subliminal messages in your videos! Subliminal messages? Do you have any idea how insane that sounds? Is that a navy tattoo? A navy tattoo? Do you have any idea how insane that sounds? Lieutenant Smash... Yeah, that's right. Lieutenant L.T. Smash. A wig! But, but your pant legs... How could you soil the good name of Star Blitzzz Promotions? Oh, come on, Lisa. We've always used pop stars to recruit people. Going back to Elvis. Then there was Sergeant Pepper's... The Captain and Tennille... And the KISS army. But you have recruiting ads on TV. Why do you need subliminal messages? Eh, it's a three-pronged attack: subliminal, liminal, and super-liminal. Super-liminal? I'll show you. Hey, you! Join the Navy! Uh, yeah, all right. I'm in. And, now that you know, Lisa, I'm afraid I can't let you leave. Oh. Wait a minute, Bart's band is brainwashing kids with subliminal messages? That's pretty farfetched, Lisa. Are you sure someone hasn't been bitten by the jealousy bug? Here comes the jealousy bug. Gonna git ya! Gonna git ya! Cut it out! You're a grown man! I wanna go home now. Nobody's going home. We're going to see Bart's concert. An aircraft carrier? Oh, that's subtle. Good afternoon and welcome to the U.S.S. Sea Spanker! Are you ready to tear it up?! I can't hear you! Do you maggots want to see a show or not?! I, uh... I mean, uh, uh, here they are, the Party Posse! HAD A GIRL IN EVERY PORT... FROM HERE TO BARCELONA... BUT NOW I'M DOCKED IN SPRINGFIELD... AND GIRL, I'M GONNA PHONE YA... STORMED A LOT OF BEACHES... BUT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I MISSED... LET'S GET BACK TOGETHER / GIRL, LET'S RE-ENLIST... Oww! Hot, hot, hot! SO SIGN ME UP / FOR A HITCH OF LOVE / RECRUIT MY HEART / FOUR SWEET YEARS OF LOVE... Everybody ball-walk! Oh, yeah. Lookin' good, guys. Annnd... double time! That's it. Protect the country. Groovy, dudes! Burn down the barber shops! I hate America! Lieutenant! Lieutenant Smash! Huh? Oh, Admiral! The hippie fantasy again? They're gettin' less frequent, sir. Excellent. Well, there's no easy way to say this: the new administration is shutting down Project Boy Band. Shutting it down? Permission to say ""That's crazy"", sir? You won't say it's crazy when you see next week's issue of ""MAD"" magazine. Oh, dear God. When this satirical bombshell hits the stands tomorrow, your band will have as much recruiting power as a wax apple. I don't follow, sir. It's over, L.T. LET'S MARCH ALL DAY / AND CLEAN LATRINES ALL NIGHT / DON'T BUST ME DOWN / LET'S RE-UP TONIGHT LET'S RE-UP TONIGHT! Boo! / I'm outta here! You fool, look what you've done! Now it's my turn. Don't do it, L.T.! You leave me no choice. No! So, ah, what songs did I miss? Dad, L.T.'s gone crazy! Yeah, that's the look. Think he's gonna do something dangerous? How should I know? Just keep loading missiles. Pop music's hard work. The Statue of Liberty! Where are we? All right, Posse... That's our target... Not ""MAD""! That's our nation's largest mental illness-themed humor magazine. Why don't we call it ""Everybody Hates Raymond?"" Well, we stayed up all night, but it was worth it. We can't let L.T. blow up ""MAD"". Tina Brown was just starting to turn it around. We gotta mellow him out. But how? We would need the ultimate chill-out song. And fast! We heard what you said. Yeah, heard it old school! It's 'N Sync! Can the chit chat, Milhouse. We've got just the song you need to defuse this wack-attack. Defuse it old school! 'Bout time. Radical! / Awesome! / I can't read. I can't sing without dancing! Fine. Thrust, spin, turn... Pivot, pout, jiggy. Jiggy, robot, do-si-do... And close with a Matrix. Nobody pouts going into a jiggy. Yeah, that's stupid. I wanna twirl. Aw, come on, guys, we've only got a few minutes... Uh-oh... Everybody okay? Uh Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'm fine, thanks. / I'm fine. / I actually feel better. Well, boys, the Party Posse is over, but at least I saved you from a public spoofing. Aw, man, we could have been on the cover of ""MAD"". They called me ""Smelson""! Haw haw. ""Smelson!"" It's funny 'cause you smell. ""Smelson"", I could have thought of that. Sure ya could've. Off ya go now. You know, we've had a lot of fun tonight at the expense of the U.S. Navy... But they're out there every day protecting us from Godzilla. And don't forget pirates. And jellyfish. Those wackin' invertebrates will sting you old school! So check out the Navy for a two or a four-year hitch. We signed J.C. up yesterday. Wuh?
