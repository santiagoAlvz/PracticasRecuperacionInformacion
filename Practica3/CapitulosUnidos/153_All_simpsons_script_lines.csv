152,153,"Hey, Bart, summer's almost here. Which kind of sprinkler do you like: the one that goes like this? Or the one that goes like this?! Oh, and there's this one! It's the last day of school, Milhouse. Try to show some dignity. Gentlemen, start your chimes... School's out! Up yours, Krabappel! Well, I'm glad the rest of you remembered that summer vacation starts at the end of the day, not the beginning. Here you go, Ma'am. Hmm. Quick work. How'd you know he was gonna run? We've got someone on the inside. The reward for a year's worth of toil and sacrifice: Retrospecticus. Oops. The Leatheroleum covers were worth the extra money! Oh, you can smell the benzene! Oh, when the kids see these layouts and fonts, you're going to be the most popular girl in school! You know something, BeeZee? I think you're right. And so as Abraham Lincoln sat in Ford's Theater that night, John Wilkes Booth entered, drew his gun and... Well, that's it. Have a nice summer, everyone. But what happened in Ford's theater? Was President Lincoln okay? He was fine. Go home, Ralph. In the beginning of the school year, each of you received a colored ticket. I hope everyone still has theirs. Who died and made you boss? Mr. Estes, the publications advisor. I edited the whole thing. If you hadn't done it, some other loser would have! So quit milkin' it! Hey, will you guys sign my yearbook? Wha? This is Becky, she's in the second grade. Hi, Becky. Thanks for comin' out. ""See ya!"" He writes the way people talk! Your daughter is named Seymour? Well, I... I lied -- it's for me. I don't get it. Straight A's, perfect attendance, Bathroom Timer... I should be the most popular girl in school. Homer, I'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. I was all set to go off on vacation, when I get called up for jury duty. Oh, it's a corker of a case -- seems a man drove up onto a traffic island and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums. Now they're trying it as a maritime offense. So anyhoo, how'd you like to use my beach house? Free of charge. I only get two weeks of vacation a year -- and you want me to spend it in your lousy beach house? Well, if it'll seal the deal, I'll take a look at your septic tank. See if I can get her hummin' again. Deal. See, Flanders, you give a little, you get a little. Hello, ""Mr. Brown Ground"", whatcha got for me? ... And you're sure the Flanderses won't be there? Well, it sounds great! Bart, you can invite Milhouse. Lisa, you can bring a friend, too. Heyyy, great, a friend... or a companion... ... stuffed animal... Well, did you call one of your friends? Friends? Hah! These are my only friends... Grown-up nerds like Gore Vidal. And even he's kissed more boys than I ever will. Girls, Lisa. Boys kiss girls. Mom, why don't I have any friends? We have each other! When I was a lonely little girl, I always dreamed that someday my daughter would be my best friend. We are best friends, Mom. But I'm a kid. I need friends my own age, too. Honey, you'll make plenty of friends. All you have to do is be yourself. Be myself? I've been myself for eight years and it hasn't worked. Look at all these dorky clothes... A bathing cap... nose plugs... A microscope at the beach -- ugh, what was I thinking? Mom, I'm gonna tighten Milhouse's straps. He's fidgeting again. Lisa, let's go! Hey. Hmm, somebody's travelin' light. Maybe you're getting stronger. Well, I have been eating more... Wave bye-bye to our house, Maggie. Bye-bye, tree. Bye-bye, job. Bye-bye toothbrush. Bye-bye Lisa Simpson. When the hell are we gonna get to... where the hell are we going? It's called Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport. It's known as ""America's scrod-basket."" I thought Springfield was America's scrod-basket. No, Springfield is ""America's crud-bucket."" At least according to Newsweek. ""Wel-diddly-elcome Simpsons."" Oh, geez. He actually wrote ""diddly."" That was thoughtful. I left a few helpful notes around the house... Put food in me. I'll take that. Well, duh! With what, Ned? Nice try, Todd. Isn't this fun, honey? It must be exciting to make a different set of beds. I know you're joking -- but it is! Say, why don't you put on your swimsuit and head for the beach? Well, it's kind of funny... with all the craziness and confusion and mishegoss of packing... Ha... I forgot to pack. Lisa, that's not at all like you. Exactly. I forgot my swimsuit, too. But I improvised. Hello. Uh, Mom, I'm kinda trying to go for a different look this year. Oh, okay. Ohhhh, how about this adorable sun-suit. It has a starfish on the fanny and it comes with its own pail! Mom, come here. Bring money. So where do you want to show off your new hip togs? The Sherbet Shoppe? The Candle District? Big Sue's Tap Water Taffy? Um, if it's okay with you, Mom, I'd rather go find some kids. Oh... okay. You'll be my friend. I'm never gonna let you get away. Last one in is a yearbook editor! Full speed ahead. Prepare to dive! Dive! It's low tide, boys. I wonder where all the kids are. Hey, a library! No, I can't. That's the old nerdy Lisa. Lisa, read about my adventures in the South Seas -- and make me live again. We've got periodicals on microfiche! Won't you join our tea party? It will be ever so -- Don't do it, Lisa, it's a trick! Run! Run! I don't see any kids at all. It's like they ditched me in advance. So he goes, like . I can totally hear him going that. Only kids are that incoherent! So my mom tried to take me to some candle place, but I'm all, like, no way. Like, you know, whatever. Like, you know, whatever. Hey, what's hap-- Okay, okay, okay... not your fault, it's a bird thing. You don't control the birds -- you will someday, but not now. Hi. 'Sup. Who's that? I'unno. Some kid. Hey, I like your hat. A compliment! Scanning for sarcasm... it's clean. Go! Thanks. Umm... You guys skate? Try to, but cops always confiscate our boards. Yeah, and you just know they're using them like five minutes later down at the station. I think I know a place you can skate that's virtually deserted. Like, you know, whatever. Hey, this place rocks. What'd you say your name was? Didn't. It's Lisa. I'm Erin. So how'd you know about this place? Y'into books? Me? Unlikely. My goony brother's always going to libraries. I usually hang out in front. Oh, you like hangin' out, too? Well, it beats doing stuff. Yeah, stuff sucks. Hey, you up? You can use my board. Okay... thanks. That's very, uh... ""rad"" of you. Hey, Bart, Lisa's skateboarding with some cool kids! And she looks like Blossom! Lisa? With people? If they're impressed by her, I'm gonna Bart their world. Okay, Milhouse, you know the drill. Right. You go over and wow them, I hide in the shrubs. Hot stuff comin' through! My friendship. You know you want it. The kid, like, tries too hard. Yeah, the whole thing smacks of effort, man. That's my dorky little brother, Bart --tholomew. Like, who does he think he is with that slingshot in his back pocket? Dennis the Menace? How'd it go? Are we down with them? No. They must have seen you. Oh, why do we have to play this lousy old game? Because it was the only one in the house. Come on, Homer, open the door for your Mystery Date! Ooh, Captain of the Football Team! He's a dreamboat! Don't wait up, Marge. Okay, Bart, your turn, your turn. You got ""The Dud!"" Hey, he looks just like you, Poindexter! How come Lisa doesn't have to play? Why does she get to hang out with her friends? You've got friends. You got ""The Dud"" right here. Stand up for yourself, Poindexter! Wow, Lisa, I never appreciated all this like... sea junk before. Hey, that clam's got legs. That's a hermit crab. When she outgrows her old shell, she finds a new one that's a better fit. Don't be afraid, little friend. You'll be the most popular crab on the beach. Aww, a gift from my favorite crustacean. Um, did you learn that word from a teacher or something? No. No, I heard it on ""Baywatch."" Hmm. I bet this place sells illegal fireworks. Just go in and act casual, like you buy 'em all the time. Um... let me have one of those porno magazines... a large box of condoms... a bottle of Old Harper... a couple of those panty shields... and some illegal fireworks... and one of those disposable enemas. No, make it two. My apologies, sir, but the sale of fireworks is prohibited in this state and is punishable by-- Follow me. Any red-blooded, flag-fearing American would love the M-320. Celebrate the independence of your nation by blowing up a small part of it. All right. 'Pretty cool of your mom to let us hang out here. Totally. Not like my mom. She'd be butting in with rice crispie squares and Tang. My dad's all stoked 'cause today's the Fourth of July. He woke me up at dawn to take a loyalty oath. My mom's French, so we only celebrate Bastille Day. Well, we could do something fun. Um, how 'bout a beach party? Great idea, Lis. Yeah, I know where there's a beach! I know where we can get some baguettes! Gee, I don't know what you've got planned for tonight, Homer, but count me out. Didn't you buy any meat? This baby's sure to kill something. Okay, now everybody -- stand back while I celebrate freedom. Bart, give me your matches. Fresh out. No lighter?... Nothin'? Wait, I got it. The beer! Oh, this is the worst Fourth of July ever. I hate America! Come on, Milhouse, let's go down there. I don't think you should. Let Lisa be alone with her new friends. They're my friends, rightfully. She only got them by copying me! Don't have a cow, man! See?! That's my expression! Oh, you haven't said that in four years. Let Lisa have it. It's the principle. She's gotta learn! No! Now park your keister, meester! Aye carumba! Hey, Lis, I made something for ya. It's a friendship bracelet. For me? Wow, my first real friend... ...ship bracelet. I don't have anything for you... ...except this necklace I made. Oh, cool. Thanks, Lisa. Hey, cinnamon dental floss! I just know we're gonna be friends forever. So Lisa has a friend. We'll see about that. Bart! I need my glasses! Oh, nice doggie. I'm dizzy! I'm nauseous! Oh, but I'm popular! What's he doing here? My yearbook! No! Hey, you guys! You wanna see how cool Lisa Simpson really is? Check this out: ""Miss Perfect Attendance"". ""Grammar Rodeo -- Head Buccaroo"". ""The French Table"" -- ooh la la. ""Teachers' Pet""? Hey, Lis. I guess my little yearbook stunt was pretty rough, but it did teach you a lesson: It's important to be yourself. I know exactly who I am. I am the sister of a rotten, jealous, mean little sneak. You cost me my only friends! You ruined my life! Hey, kids, there's a carnival tonight! Oh boy, a carnival! Kids! Stop that! Don't make me get the carney! Hey, Lisa, make friends with this! Hey! Hellllp! Hellllp! Remember, kids, there's no need to bump! Just enjoy the ride! Lisa, wait! Being myself didn't work... Being someone else didn't work... Maybe I just wasn't meant to have friends. Lisa is gonna freak when she sees this. Well, hurry up. They'll be back soon. Lisa! Okay, you found out I'm an over-achieving bookworm. So whatever mean prank you're pulling, just finish it up and send me a Polaroid. I'm going to sleep. Wait, Lisa. Look. Cool, huh? Now you can take the beach with you wherever you go! Uh... But don't drive at night. Does this mean you still want to be friends? Even though I tried to cover up my nerdish... leanings? Look, we don't care who you were. You can't fake the kind of good person you are. Yeah. You taught us about cool things like nature and why we shouldn't drink sea water. This is the most thoughtful thing anybody ever -- Sweet merciful crap! My car! The polite thing to do would've been to clean the shells first. Shoo, shoo! I guess I should give this back to you. I showed it to your friends again before we left. Bart! Look inside. Oh. Thanks, Bart. I signed it too! Uh huh. Well, get a last look at the beautiful ocean scenery, kids.","Ralph Wiggum, Miss Hoover, Lou, Milhouse Van Houten, Pippi Longstocking, Rick, Marge Simpson, Dean, Nelson Muntz, Kid, Eustace Tilley, Homer Simpson, OTHER NERDY GIRL, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, Erin, COOL KID VOICE, Becky, COOL GIRL VOICE, Lisa's Thoughts, Apu II, Ned Flanders, Ice Cream Truck Supervisor, Chuck, Alice, Ben, Bart Simpson, Edna Krabappel-Flanders, Nerdy Girl",8.3,1119.0,25,1996-05-19,1996,7,Summer of 4 Ft. 2,14.7,65847.0
