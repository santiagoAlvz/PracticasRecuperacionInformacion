So, the family's still gone. What do I do now? Let's get this party started. Bart's been alone for twenty-three minutes! Let's get this yo on the road, people! Wait! I haven't chosen my mix-in! Okay... I'll take some of... that. Well that's my tip jar! Mix it in. Whoa, mama! Let me freshen that up for ya. I love Saturdays! I'm gonna kill ya, boy! I'm bored. That's it, boy! I'm eating your yogurt! You ate his yogurt in the car. He didn't know that! Stupid kid. All you do is cost me money. Money I could be wasting! Is Bart Simpson here? Because I'm about to make him and his family very wealthy! Wealthy? Hey, remember the guy who drove you to school that one time. Eh? I should introduce myself. My name is Herman Millwood, and my company makes... ...the ""Aero"" chair. The most comfortable ergonomic chair there is. So, what brings you here, Mr. Chair? Bart, do you remember this? That's ""Angry Dad""! The semi-autobiographical web cartoon I created! I legally forced him to say ""semi"". The multi-million-dollar internet startup that put ""Angry Dad"" on the net ordered a lot of my chairs... ...but when the tech bubble popped... ...the chairs were never paid for, so we repossessed the only thing they had left -- the cartoons: ""Space Penis,"" ""Geena Davis Internet Project 1999,"" ""John Stankworth, Fart Detective,"" ""The Adventures Of Parody Man..."" ...and most importantly, ""Angry Dad."" Because now I want to make it into a movie. My stupid cartoon a movie? Thank you! Don't thank me, thank Hollywood for being completely out of good ideas. My little Roman Polanski! Homer! What?! What's wrong with being Roman Polanski? He what?... You monster! Thanks for letting me make this movie, Mr. Millwood! I've always loved cartoons, going way back to the real early SpongeBobs. Well, I think your movie has real potential. Everyone has an angry dad, even me. What the hell are you making chairs for? In this family, we sit on the ground! Now Bart, this is where we will help bring your vision to life. Oh my God, that's Bart Simpson! And Angry Dad himself! It's like meeting Mickey Mouse and Walt Disney at the same time! Mr. Simpson, I'm in charge of the team that animates your ass... Anything you can give us from real life? Observe. Soda? No thanks. More for me. Bart, we've got some bad news -- the actor who did the original voice of Angry Dad can't do the movie. He blew out his voice screaming about how he never got paid the first time around. Oh, man. What can we do? Well, the cartoon's based on your dad -- maybe he can do the voice. Can he get angry on cue? Hey Homer! You want to be the voice of Angry Dad? It would be an honor! Thanks for coming out -- one announcement: the voice of Angry Dad will be on a speakerphone today. There's something going on at the nuclear plant that's a little more important that your ""table read."" ""'Angry Dad: The Movie.' ""Angry Dad addresses the family from the top of the stairs."" ""Family, today I graduate from my anger management class."" Angry Dad slips and crashes down the stairs. Pained noises. No Dad, don't say ""pained noises,"" you make pained noises. Oh okay, uh, Lenny, hit me with that chair. Okay. Hi, everyone. I'm Bart Simpson, the creator of ""Angry Dad."" To make this film, I had to miss countless hours of school, and there was also some hardship. I hope you like it as much as I do. The movie! What did they think? Well, let's not jump to conclusions. We'll look at the tape of the audience watching the movie. Now comes the part where the movie actually starts. For God's sake, turn it off! Turn it offfff! Don't feel bad, boy. Everyone makes mistakes. Yours is just public and expensive. You know, your movie's not all bad. If you cut out the stuff that didn't work, it would make a great short film. A short film? Many great directors, like Wes Anderson, Frank Tashlin, and Tim Burton started with short films. Name one more. Taylor Hackford. I don't know who that is, but I'm convinced. Let's start cutting. Buon Giorno! Where is-a the Bart Simpson? I am the Bart. Bravissimo! You know me as Luigi the spaghetti guy, but I am here in my capacity as a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press. Your animated short, ""Angry Dad"" or, as we call it in the Pizza English, ""Papa Apoplectic-a"", she has-a been nominated for a Golden Globe. Now if you'll excuse me, I have-a some unhappy news to deliver to Sir Anthony Hopkins. Sir Anthony! Your pizza! She's-a gonna be late! Damn you. Damn you to Hell! The creative team from Mixar! Pardon me. I've seen all of your movies except ""Cars,"" and I can't believe my brother is in the same category as the digital Rembrandts of my generation! So... that makes your brother the competition. Randy, tell her how we feel about that. YOU'VE GOT AN EN-E-MY / YOU'VE GOT AN EN-E-MY / YOU BETTER HAVE NINE LIVES / BECAUSE WE HAVE EIGHT KNIVES / YES, YOU'VE GOT AN EN-E-MY. / YOU'VE GOT AN EN-E-MY. HATE YOUR GUTS Hi. Yeah, it is me, Ricky Gervais. Uh, Tanqueray gin and tonic, please. I'm paid to drink that in my movies. The amount isn't important. A lot to you, but to be honest, not so much to me. Ah, okay, you missed it, but I just put a tip in there. A big one. Double digits. Ten. The lowest of the double digits. But nevertheless, ten dollars, so, a lot of money... to you. Less to me. Uh, but ten dollars, nonetheless. Look at it. The ten? That was there before. It was not! Who else in here's gonna tip ten dollars? Keith Urban, Helen Mirren? I don't think so. They don't have the common touch, do they? Like me. You've seen that. We've bonded, you're thinking ""Wow, he's rich, he's famous, he's got great abs."" Personal trainer, you couldn't afford that. I used to be fat. I used to eat junk food. You probably still do. But you're going ""Wow, look at him. How much did that suit cost him?"" Nothing. I got it for free. That's what happens when you're a celebrity. Helen! Helen! She can't hear me. Helen--Mirren! Who does she think she is? Fur coat, no knickers. Anyway, mate, your ice is dripping. And now, to present the Golden Globe for Best Animated Short... Russell Brand! It's great to be here with all the old friends I haven't seen since rehab. No, no, I'm just kidding -- none of you are my friends. And now the nominees for Best Animated Short: ""The Brothers Of Beauville."" Saakashvili Spring. ""Condiments"" by Mixar...and Angry Dad. Woo hoo! And the globe goes to: ""Angry Dad""! I have many people to thank... Angry Dad's voice is part Walter Matthau... Hey, Felix!... part Little Richard Whoooo! ...and a little bit of Snoopy when he cries. This is insane! He didn't show up for work, he bad-mouthed the movie on Jimmy Fallon, and now he's hoggin' all the credit! Don't worry, sweetie, this is just the first of way too many awards shows. You'll get your chance to say ridiculous things. I'd like to thank Mr. Speedy Pants Repair for sewing up my pants just before the ceremony...and the woman who has inspired me everyday for the past twenty-five years... the cute one from the Bangles. See you at the cool party! 'Old on -- I'm 'earing my 'etainer. Angry Dad got an Oscar nomination?! I'M GOING TO THE OS-CARS! NOT AS A SEAT FILL-ER! I'LL GET A GIFT BAS-KET! BUT I WON'T DE-CLARE IT! Hey! Don't you know it's awards season? Who's calling you at five in the morning anyway? Uh... nobody. Wrong number. If I find out it's a right number, you're in big trouble. It's Bart Simpson, writer-director of ""Angry Dad,"" and you are with... My lame-o sister, Lisa. And Lisa, who are you wearing? I believe it's from Lamps Plus. And where's the ""Angry Dad"" himself? Where's Homer Simpson? Homer? Well, I don't know. L.A.'s a world-class city with a lot to offer. He's probably enjoying the sights... Uh-oh. Yo, yo, yo! Why you messin' with Simon Rodia's folk art masterpiece? Check it out, that's Angry Dad! Say, why ain't you at the Oscars, A.D.? Oscars? What are you talking about? My son gave me this list of awesome things to do in L.A. Chatsworth?! That's where the one-eighteen meets Topanga Canyon, fool! Someone must not want you at that kudo-cast, yo! Damn, Home-Simp -- you've been Oscar-blocked! What do you think about that, Nasty J? That's cold. Hmm... Who could possibly want to stop me from accepting an award? My category comes up pretty soon. I'm home free as long as this Oscar show is tight and fast-paced. Sound mixers may not be glamorous, but they make us sound so good. Without them we'd be up a creek without a decibel. No worries, A.D., we'll get you to your venue and pick up some dim sum on the way. According to this live blog, Ben Stiller and Jack Black are doing a bit that will not end. Turn it off! Turn it off! For God's sake, turn it off! And now please welcome, Academy Award winner Halle Berry! When most people think of animated movies, they think of forty minutes or more. But there is another type of animated film -- forty minutes or less! Conductor, get ready to play my song! And the winner is... not going to be announced until we watch a lengthy clip from each short. ""Condiments"" by Mixar. The Tabasco brothers got Frenchie! We're gonna have to... leave the kitchen. I don't wanna go! I don't wanna go! Wake me for the syrupy ending. Timmy's comin'! Assume your positions! My God! I'm empty! Don't let 'em... put pencils in me. Thanks, Rollin' Eighties. Hey, you two are honorary members for life. That means if another gang sees you, they'll kill you. I was born a Rollin' Eighty, and I'll die a Rollin' Eighty. ""Willis and Crumble in 'Better Gnomes And Gardens'"". Not to worry, Miss Pennyfarthing. Crumble will soon have your garden gnomes back in tip-top condition. He's good as new! You must come in for a spot of tea and a homemade marmite sandwich. Homemade marmite, and made by a woman with such gentle hands... Crumble! Crumble! Where has that silly dog got to? Oh my. Good luck, Mr. Park. There'd be no shame in losing to you. Oh, that's very sweet of you. Thank you for saying so. No worries. I'll just stick them back on. I'm more clay than man now. And finally... ""Angry Dad."" No free refills. Damn, that's good! And for Best Animated Short, the Oscar goes to... wait, one last moment about me... every night I dream my teeth fly out of my mouth. ""Angry Dad""! Yes! This is it... I finally get to accept an award for my movie...except it's not just my movie. It was my sister's idea to make this into a short. And so many animators... every day was somebody's birthday. And you know what? It was my Dad's movie too. I only wish he were here and not at Cerritos Auto Square. You got your wish, boy. I'm proud of ya. I'm sorry I took all the credit. This whole thing is silly. I mean, isn't the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard? You make a lot of good points, Bart. A lot of good points. You're a very thoughtful kid, you remind me of Deborah Kerr in ""Black Narcissus."" Anyway, granted, despite what André Bazin might say, films are a collaborative art form, but, hey, you can't give an Oscar to everyone. We can still order a replacement from the academy, right? Hey, they're like five bucks on eBay. Oh, hi! Ricky Gervais, umm such an honor to meet you, Sir Ridley. I love your movies. Or as I call them, ""films."" Umm, glad I bumped into you, actually. Because, uh, I'm looking to expand beyond comedy. I know what you're thinking, Sir Ridley. You're thinking ""Oh my word, he's been making me laugh all these years, but now he's moving me as well. I'm gonna have to put him in my new film. What do you think? I'm a seat filler. Well why couldn't you have said that a minute ago? Don't take any of my ideas.","Angry Dad, Miss Pennyfarthing, Herman Millwood, Father, Nasty J, Man In Audience, Celebrity Reporter, Male Animator, John Lassiter, Scratchy, Female Animator, Marge Simpson, 2nd Male Animator, Homer Simpson, Martin Scorsese, Squeaky-Voiced Teen, Lisa Simpson, Waffle, Scratchy's Father, MAN IN THE AUDIENCE, Lenny Leonard, Willis, Peanut Butter, Nick Park, Cowboy Ketchup, Crazy Clown, Announcer, Russell Brand, Halle Berry, Itchy, D.J.
