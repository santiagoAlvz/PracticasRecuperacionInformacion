80,81,"He's dead now. Gabbo! Gabbo! Gabbo! Did you see that? Yeah. What's Gabbo? I figure it's some guy's name. Some guy named Gabbo. I don't think they're giving you enough information, Dad. I'll figure it out. I'm gonna use all the power of my brain. Look Smithers! Garbo is coming! Uh... yes sir. Everyone is saying ""Gabbo this"" and ""Gabbo that."" But no one is saying ""Worship this"" and ""Jericho that."" What's this about Gabbo? I can't believe it. Our first glimpse of Gabbo! He'll tell us what to do. Hello. I'm Gabbo. And I'm Arthur Crandall. That's easy for you to say. You don't have a hand up your tuchus. Oh, Gabbo. You'll say anything. And you can watch us every afternoon at four. That's the same time as Krusty the Klown! Uh-oh. That cute little character could take America by storm. All he needs is a hook. I'm a bad widdle boy. Ay carumba! YOU'RE GONNA LIKE ME / YOU'RE GONNA LOVE ME / 'CAUSE I CAN DO MOST ANYTHING... ... I CAN DO THE ""HULLY GULLY""/ I CAN IMITATE VIN SCULLY... Let's take time out from this triple play to talk about Farmer Dan's pure pork sausages. Mmmmm! ... I'LL GIVE OUT SHINY DIMES... I'LL TRAVEL BACK IN TIME... YOU'RE GONNA LIKE HIM! YOU'RE GONNA LOVE HIM! IT'S THE GREATEST SHOW IN TOWNNNNN! Gabbo! Eh, that dummy doesn't scare me. I've had plenty of guys come after me and I've buried 'em all. Hobos, sea captains, Joey Bishop... Don't forget the Special Olympics. Oh, yeah. I slaughtered the Special Olympics. Are those our ratings? Let me see. I lost to Channel Ocho? What the Hell is that? Dos huevos, por favor. Que Lastima. I gotta steal that bit. This is boring. NELSON I wonder what would happen if you put your train on there. Cool. Now, let's throw some crud on it! Hey, it's four o'clock. So you want ventriloquism, do ya? All right. Watch this. Hello Alphonse, I've got a riddle for you. Why is a raven like a writing desk? I don't know. Why is a... Hey, the dummy can't hurt you. He's not even alive. He's dead! All right, here's the deal. Every time you watch my show, I will send you $40. Checks will not be honored. I admit I have used the city treasury to fund the murder of my enemy. But as Gabbo would say, ""I'm a bad widdle boy."" Well kids, this is where you would watch Itchy and Scratchy, except they're on the Gabbo show now. So, here's Eastern Europe's favorite cat and mouse team: Worker and Parasite! What the hell was that? Well, that's it. We've been canceled. I think we can be proud that we never did a bad show... except for that week Ray Jay Johnson was my co-host. ""You can call me Ray... and you can call me Jay..."" That thing was funny for about three seconds. But the important thing is, we're like a family. Krusty, I... Shut your hole. Krusty, how ya holding up? I'm kinda worried about the future. How do you deal with it? Well, you've been on TV longer than I have. I'm sure you've saved up quite a nest egg. Uh-yeah. Do they still buy human hair down at the wig shop? Krusty, you wanna stay for dinner? Nah, sorry. Ah, that's too bad. Tonight my guests will be Dr. Carl Sagan and from the San Diego Zoo, Joan Embrey. Oh Kyle, I just don't think I fit in here at Melrose Place. From now on, I'll be doing the thinking for both of us. Next. Come on! You stupid horse! I got my last ten bucks on you! No, don't look at me! Run! No! Don't come over here! Oh boy. And now, it's time for another patented Gabbo Crank Call! Oh I love these. I can't believe it. He stole this bit from Krusty! Yeah, well Krusty stole it from Steve Allen. Oh, everything's stolen nowadays. Why the fax machine is nothing but a waffle iron with a phone attached. It's ringing. Hello. Is this Krusty the Klown? Is this the callback for that porno film? Look, I was a little nervous that day. But I'm all man, I can assure you... No, I represent a Japanese camera company. We'd like to pay you two million dollars to do a camera commercial. Whoa! Me rikey velly much. Oh, I hope I didn't offend you. I need this bad. Bad enough to hit yourself over the head with the phone? Oh, you got it. Ow. Ow. Ew, blood. What the? If this is anyone but Steve Allen, you're stealing my bit. Somebody ought to ruin Gabbo's career the way he ruined Krusty's. Two wrongs don't make a right, Bart. Yes they do. No they don't. Yes they do. No they don't. Yes they do. Dad... Two wrongs make a right, Lisa. Ah, Rex Morgan M.D., you have the prescription for the daily blues. We'll be back after this commercial for Gabbo Airlines. That ought to hold the little S.O.B.'s. Gabbo, quiet. Oh, I wouldn't want to offend the little S.O.B.'s. I wish you'd stop saying that. Hmmm. Hey, boyo, what's so funny? Well, it's... Ah, you wouldn't be interested. It's too low brow. No I'm quite low brow. Well... somebody just wrote a bawdy limerick on the men's room wall. This I gotta see! All the kids in Springfield are S.O.B.'s. ... Gabbo's kind of language has no place on or off TV. And that's my two cents. Well, that ought to hold those S.O.B.'s. What the...? Oh no! Krusty, are you making any money? Nah. That guy is giving it away for free. THE OLD GREY MARE / SHE AIN'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE / AIN'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE / AIN'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE... Thirty-five years in show business and already no one remembers me. Just like what's his name... and whosis... and you know, that guy, always wore a shirt... Ed Sullivan? Yeah. I didn't know you knew Luke Perry! Know him? He's my worthless half brother. He's a big TV star. Yeah, on Fox... Elizabeth Taylor... Bette Midler... Bette and I owned a race horse together. Krudler. Hey Bart, If we get all of these big stars to appear on a special with Krusty, it might get his career going again. Here's my address book. Go get those stars! It won't be easy, but I'm gonna claw my way back onto TV. THE OLD GRAY MARE/ SHE AIN'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE/ AIN'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE/ AIN'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE... And now, the crazy old man singers. THE OLD GRAY MARE / SHE AIN'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE / AIN'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE... Miss Midler, I can't believe you do this all by yourself. We're Americans. We deserve clean highways. You pigs! Oh nooo! Bette Midler. Now where were we? We were asking you to appear on Krusty's come back special. Okay. Tell Krusty he can count me in. It's time to take out the trash. I'll get you for this, Midler... And off to your left is Hugh Hefner's Shelbyville Pad. A lot of people know about the grotto and the game room... Of course. But few know about the laboratory, the biosphere, the alternative energy research center... Fascinating. Desalinization plant? Yes. The grotto uses so much water... the bunnies felt we should go this way. Smart bunnies, Hef. I can call you Hef, can't I? No. You told our agent this place holds thirty-thousand people. It does. We had thirty thousand here last night. Now play. The audience is gettin' restless. We want Chilly Willy! We want Chilly Willy! Hey, Red Hot Chili Peppers. Would you guys like to appear on a Krusty the Klown Special? Sure -- if you get us out of this gig. No problemo. Hey, Moe! Look over there. What?... What am I lookin' at? I don't see nothin'. I'm gonna stop looking soon... What... what, is that it? Hey, Moe, can I look too? Sure, but it'll cost ya. My wallet's in the car. He is so stupid. And now, back to the wall... Ms. Taylor, a couple of grade school kids wanted you to be on a Krusty special. I told them to buzz off. Good. Krusty! We've got great news! Krusty! What have you done to yourself? I thought I'd get into shape so I've been drinking nothing but milkshakes. You mean those diet milkshakes? Uh-oh. Now, you can stay with us until you lose that weight. You can sleep on the sofa, it folds right out. Oh, wait. That was the old sofa. I'll never get my aim back. You've got to keep working on it. Ooh, delicious. Oh, why am I bothering? It's hopeless. Hi kids! It's me, Gabbo! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ho! Pork prices rose in early trading today. But you've gotta come back, Mel! We're a team. No, Krusty. You always treated me rather shabbily. On our last show you poured liquid nitrogen down my pants and cracked my buttocks with a hammer. Ah, come on, you wanna waste your life hanging out with a bunch of dorky teenagers? Here's your taco, Mister. Oops. It fell in the fryer. I'll get it out. Sorry, Krusty. I like it here. Mr. Johannson treats me with dignity. Is this clown bothering you, Mel? That's all right, Mr. Johannson. I'll handle it. Here's your taco, sir. I don't want it. But this comes out of my salary. If I had a girlfriend, she'd kill me. Ok Krusty, let's rehearse the balloon bit. Look, kids. A horsie! And what are you making Sideshow Luke Perry? A 19th Century carousel. Upstage me, will ya! Get the hell out! Look, there must be something I can do on the show. Please. For Mom's sake. Well... maybe we can find something. I don't like it. He's got Johnny Carson, Bette Midler AND Hugh Hefner. What do we got? Ray Jay Johnson. Now boys... uh... the network has a problem with some of your lyrics. Would you mind changing 'em for the show? Forget you, clown. Hey, our lyrics are like our children, man. No way. Well okay. But here where you say ""What I got you gotta get and put it in you,"" how about just ""what I'd like is I'd like to hug and kiss you""? Wow, that's much better. Everyone can enjoy that. Live from Springfield, the entertainment capital of this state, the Krusty Comeback Special. SEND IN THE CLOWNS / THOSE DAFFY, LAFFY CLOWNS / SEND IN THOSE SOULFUL AND DOLEFUL, SHMOTZ-BY-THE BOWLFUL CLOWNS... / SEND IN THE CLOWNS THEY'RE ALREADY HERE... I love you Krusty. Quiet Are you comfortable in there, Luke Perry? Fire away, Krusty. My face! My valuable face! Dancing around in their underwear. That is so degrading. Thirty seconds till your L'il Stinker sketch. Get me a bigger lolly. Now, Johnny, whatcha got for us. Jokes -- a little magic? Actually I thought I'd lift this 1987 Buick Skylark over my head. Hi yo! Johnny, that's amazing! Oh yeah? Get a load of this. I've got to fire that agent. DID YOU EVER KNOW THAT YOU'RE MY HERO? YOU'RE EVERYTHING I WOULD LIKE TO BE? YOU CAN FLY HIGHER THAN AN EAGLE... 'CAUSE YOU ARE THE WIND BENEATH MY WINGS. This was a great show, Krusty. You deserve an Emmy for this. Forget it. The Academy hates me. I don't know why. Bunch of old, know-nothin' dinosaurs wouldn't know entertainment if it bit 'em in the Hey hey! Now, Krusty, I just hope you remembered to save your money this time. Here's that ruby-studded clown nose you ordered, Krusty. Hey you can't come in here dressed like that. Get with the times, Moe. Yeah. I say, if it feels good, do it. All right. Don't snap my undies. I'm a star again. I don't know how to thank you kids. That's alright, Krusty. We're getting 50% of the T-shirt sales. What!? That's the sweetest plum. You... little... Ahh. What the Hell. You deserve it. Thanks kids. To Krusty. The greatest entertainer in the world. Except maybe that guy.
