526,533,"Poor Chip. Such a big part of everyone's life. People called him the sixth Simpson. Not sure why. Chip did such a wonderful job with my biography. Chip me ayudó a lidiar con mi pena después que mis padres se murieron jugando paintball! Chip was the life of Sector Six-F at the nuclear plant...but Chip once confessed to me... he did have a few regrets. Chip regretted never ascending Mount Springfield from the south face. He regretted that the high school long jump record he set was wind-aided. We often spoke of that asterisk. He never broke par on hole seventeen at Springfield Mini Golf. Let us pray. Eh, everyone has regrets. Not me! You?! Your marriage is a dead fish floating in a tank of stale beer. Your baby's addicted to pacifiers...and your son is out of control! Let us kneel... My knees! Forty years of healing gone! He's such a little dickens. Although Dickens was pretty well-behaved. He's been screwed up since the moment Homer's D.N.A. staggered into your womb. I have no regrets about that. It was a perfect pregnancy. Didn't smoke, didn't drink, lost three pounds. And every night before bed, Homer would give me a little kiss... music. Could Bart have been prenatally screwed up by the KISS music? GET UP / EVERYBODY'S GONNA MOVE THEIR FEET GET DOWN / EVERYBODY'S GONNA LEAVE THEIR SEAT YOU GOTTA LOSE YOUR MIND IN DETROIT ROCK CITY! Man, this is the weirdest pregnancy craving ever. Well, for some reason it relaxes me. Now do that thing Gene Simmons does. Overstay my welcome for forty years? Regrets, eh? This local newsman's had a few, covering a town of backwater rubes who for some reason hate my guts. This is Kent Brockman, live at the Springfield Peach Parade. Sir, could you give us eight seconds of your homespun wisdom? It's a little known fact that you can get head lice from peaches. This is my daughter, Peaches. We'll have more regrets at eleven tonight following an all-new bottle of scotch. You have regrets, Mr. ""I Get To See The Weathergirl From The Side?"" I made the worst financial decision of all time. Oh, I can't think about it, I won't think about it, I don't want to think about it... I'm thinking about it! That's the coolest bowling ball I've ever seen. Hello, Bear Stearns? I'd like to sell all my Apple stock so I can buy a fancy bowling ball. You heard me. Technology is a fad. Heavy blue balls are the future. Now, let us text on our ubiquitous Apple tablets and phones... You cost me a piece of all of that! Aw, don't cry. If it makes you feel worse, I'm the man who bought the stock you sold. I'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all. Just one. The girl that got away. She broke my first heart. So, is there truly anyone among us without regrets? I have no regrets! Really, mother? Oh, I didn't see you there. I'm Father O'Greedy! Dimes for the needy! Milhouse! Are you the bottom half of that mischief? Uh... Uh... uh... Oh my! My pants, like the Lord, work in mysterious ways. Return those vestments! Speaking of return on investments, my Apple stock is up thirty-five hundred percent! You misheard that on purpose! Tithe denied! Tithe denied! Must find way... to blame myself. Um... it says I should give you ""lumbar support."" Better go to the lumberyard... Lumbar! It means lower back. How many times will you make that mistake? Just put on the KISS record. Which one? Anything from ""Love Gun""! Hey book, are you expecting this? And while I'm at it... burn dumb helpful books! That is a good fire. You're going down, Bart! Ah, reckless youth. He'll be okay. I was referring to him. I had a spring in my step like that once, back when I met Lilah. Lilah ran a little crepe stand in the 7th arrondisement. Oh Monty. Looking at you, I could lie in this unheated garret forever. There's heat, I just don't turn it on. Seeing you there, in the sweet light of Paris between the wars, there is a question I must pose. I have something for you. Nope. Not that. Wrong box. Lilah, will you take that big step from cousin to wife? Oh, Monty... you must promise me one thing. Anything she wanted I was willing to do. Anything. Except... All I ask is that you set aside five minutes a day to think of others. When you say others... could they be bars of gold? I shall find another husband. As good as you are evil. No one's that good! All I have left is my drawing. It looked a lot better in my memory. But do you know what, Smithers? I will find Lilah and win her back... I'll just check with the old gang. Hemingway! Picasso! Matador Juan Belmonte! And Stalin! That man could really put pressure on you. Hello, Kent. Well, well, well, Rachel Maddow. Everyone came back for Chip's funeral. I was flying from D.C. to New York, and of course I had the layover in Springfield. How's the gang at Channel Six? Look, let's get this out of the way. Just because we both worked at Channel Six and you made it big and I didn't doesn't mean I'm bitter. Um... is that your car? Maybe. Kent, I'm going to tell you the most important mistake you ever made... after this break. So Kent, that mistake you made? That fundamental life-changing error? That cosmic fail? That-- Just tell me already! After this break. You could've come with me. But you were suckling the dual teats of infotainment and celebrifawning! So, tell us about your new movie. It's fantastic. The studio let us play in their sandbox. Great! We have a clip. No! No, don't show it! There aren't five good seconds in the whole film! I'm not a newsman anymore, I'm a geologist. I keep discovering a new rock bottom. Kent, I think I've found my ticket out of this town, or at least to a better Springfield. You two newshounds working on a story? How 'bout this? Mario's down the street found a rat in their pasta. When did that happen? Whenever you want Eh? Rachel, can I come? We can share blazers! Just follow me. At Mario's, the picture of Sinatra on the wall... is signed by Frank Junior! The frame hides the Junior! Someone's been dumping tires in the forest. Willikers! In my three years of soft news, I've never seen anything like this. Those are tires from my ill-fated Krusty Town Car. It would explode if people gripped the wheel too tightly. You're not tellin' no one! As the four p.m. clown, I have complete control of Channel Six's news division. Local news is a joke. I'm going to cable. Cable news? Bah! People only want news at six p.m. from white guys on weekdays and black guys on weekends. We'll see about that. Yes, we shall see. About that, things will be seen. By us. Kent? You coming? He ain't comin'. This little piggy's afraid to leave his cushy anchorman slop trough. Could you uh, phrase that a little more nicely? Sorry. He ""isn't"" coming. You'll regret this Kent, when I have my own show and you're stuck here tracking Santa's flight from the North Pole. Oh look, he's over Greenland. Don't worry, piggy, you made the right choice. Eh, it'll burn out in an hour or so. Look Burns, I've got the dope on your sweetie. She's still alive and she just got over being mad at you last week. Lilah's alive?! Yeah, well, uh, she's alive, but... she's a nun. Married to Jesus, eh? Does he beat her? Jesus? No, he's a real Eagle Scout, that one. But your penguin's not a Catholic. She's a Buddhist nun. Spent her life expressing her sexuality with a Zen garden. Those raked rocks could've been me! Now since you're so good at finding things, find the exit! There is the little matter of my fee. You're becoming very tiresome. Who moved my desk?! Here I am. Cable news alley. Fox News. Is this really how I want to get back in the big leagues? Let's see how print journalism is doing. Sir, do you sell the New York Times? Sir, we are the New York Times. And in I go. Why are you doin' this, Bart? Fifty percent attention-seeking, fifty percent to drop things on people. He's gonna visit my sky granny! To work at Fox News, all you have to be able to do is operate this device. Now when a Republican is in trouble... At the time I didn't know it was illegal to sex up a cow on the Capital steps. ...we simply do this... Now you try. We've had some good times. And you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep. So I'm gettin' you shined up nice. What the? That's a ball-proof window, sir. Would you like me to ask Siri for a nearby hospital? I'm sorry. I don't see any ""hops petals"" near you. Deleting all contact information. No, no, I didn't ask you to do that, Siri! Delete confirmed. Okay Bart, be cool. Calm down. You're not gonna die up here. Oh Monty, I can't believe you found me after all these years. I've saved myself for you. Well then, I should disrobe at once. Housekeeping! Send up a Chinese dressing screen! And one of Firestone's finest vulcanized prophylactics! Be right back. Smithers! Which do I take first? The rhino horn or the tiger tongue? I have my doubts about both, sir. Bah! I'll just do it the old-fashioned way. With my pump. Just powdering my nose, darling! Smithers! Run down to Sears Roebuck and get a five-eighths inch Phillips head bolt! Here I am, slowly dying every day at five, six and eleven. Help! Help! Child in danger with exciting visuals! This kid's corpse could be my magic carpet. Get me a cameraman! The movie ""Up"" has come horribly to life over Springfield. A local boy clings to life in a story that proves this reporter's relevance! Ay carumba! It's Bart! Pray for a miracle, boy! God can hear you better from up there! Dear Lord, please help me land safely, or transform this basket into a flying killer robot that I control with my mind, amen. That's not a prayer! My God says it is! Ah, I see you're ice cold with anticipation. Dead? Oh Lilah, even at the end I waited too long. What if I give her the breath of life? Hoo boy. I guess one regret just leads to another. You know, sir, maybe it would bring you peace to honor the one thing Lilah ever asked of you. There you are, my good man. A little broth will cure your mental illness. Sir, that's five minutes. You can stop thinking of other people now. You know what? I think I'll give it another five. I'm proud of you, Monty. I ain't eatin' that. Chief, what are you doing to save our son? Well, I've placed marksmen on the roof to shoot the balloons one-by-one, but frankly, they're not very good. Chief, it happened again! Oh c'mon guys, spread out! Arms length! It's all my fault. I should never have listened to those KISS albums when I was pregnant. Marge, with all due respect, that's ridiculous. My Sarah listened to Mozart and Churchill speeches when she was pregnant with Ralphie, and he can't even open a refrigerator. Pushing, always, always pushing. Really? Oh yeah, that kid's a mess. Hey! Only I get to criticize him, Lou. The kid's scared to flush. He thinks its his brother. Can we focus on my son? Up in the sky? Oh, I've got a long-shot idea. By which I mean firing a shot over a long distance. Yeah, you see, if we could fire an exactly twelve-and-half-pound weight into the basket, it would lower the boy very gently to the ground. Unfortunately, all our cannonballs were melted down to make a statue of Joe Paterno, which we changed to look like Eugene Levy. I think I just might have what you're looking for. Today I'm glad that I sold that stock. Apple closed up another twenty points today. Why does everyone know?! Because their terrific products keep track of it for you. And anything else you could ever think of. That kid's not dyin' on my watch. Which ends right now, fortunately. Homer's rising faster than Apple stock! My boy's okay! Bart! Bart! Bart! I won the science fair! I get to go to Chicago! Bart! Bart! Bart! Eh, Bart, Bart, Bart. You know what I think about regrets? As long as your family is together, every choice you've ever made is the right one. And together we are. Would you guys knock it off? He's down safe already! Sorry, Chief. That was me puttin' it down. And there you have it. A family reunited, and a grateful nation gives thanks for some solid reporting. Back to you, Rachel Maddow. Great job, Kent. I think we might have an opening for you at MSNBC, between our weekend prison documentary block and the two hours it takes to make up Joe Scarborough on Monday morning. No thanks, Rachel Maddow. I'm happy right here. No regrets. Ha!","Ralph Wiggum, Dexter Colt, Mayor Joe Quimby, Waylon Smithers, Interviewer, Chief Wiggum, Lou, Hans Moleman, Milhouse Van Houten, MR.
