300,304,"Come on, come on, let's get to the beach! Hold your horses. I was up all night fishing out the drawstring from your father's swimsuit. It came out again. Well, I'm all set. I'm gonna be following the latest designs from Modern Sandcastle magazine. Well, I'm all set, too. Then all that's left is to protect Maggie from the sun. I think she needs a diaper change. Well, it ain't happening today. Look, everybody! Here they come! Once again we celebrate Springfield's most beloved event. For each year, on the third Tuesday of May Sweeps, we witness the return of the stinging red jellyfish! What a sight! It happens every year like the swallows returning to Capistrano. Or the Fox Network getting a new President. I made a new friend! I'm going to Africa, to see lions and giraffes and monkeys and Santa and gorillas and... Daddy, why is everyone so happy the jellyfish are back? Well, in the old days, people thought jellyfish venom had curative properties. Now we know it just makes things a whole lot worse. Like laser eye surgery? Exactly. JELLYFISH, ALONG YOU CAME / AND RIGHT AWAY I'M STUNG...SWEET WORDS I LONG TO WHISPER / BUT YOU'VE PARALYZED MY TONGUE. Oh, what a magical evening. The moonlight, the music, the water... Enough talk. Dip me, my love. Lower. Lower! Lower! Ah, this is as romantic as the night I proposed. Maybe we can have this band play at our wedding. I was kinda hoping we could use this audio cassette. Seymour, we've got to have a band. Fine, but no cake. Sarah, you're as lovely as the day I first arrested you. Oh, Clancy. You know, I planted that crystal meth just to meet you. I was so shy. Well, Sea Captain, looks like you and I are sailin' solo tonight. Arrr you hitting on me? 'Cause I don't do that... on land. Well, guess I might as well head back to my store. I've got a date with some twins: my state and federal tax forms. Poor Ned. This is his first Jellyfish Festival alone. I know, and it doesn't get any easier from here. There's the Tongue-Kissing Festival... Cinco de Ocho... The Hobo Oscars... days just made for lovers. Not widowers, lovers. ""Form of business?"" Sole proprietorship. ""Owner's marital status?"" Happily married... to a dead woman. Excuse me, are you open? Mm hmm! Open as a tomb on Easter. Now, what can I ding dong diddily do for ya? Boy, they don't make 'em like you in L.A. Oh, I should say not. I gave up on L.A. when those TV people made that poor nun fly. All those Puerto Ricans lookin' up her dress. That's not right. Do you have any left-handed eyelash curlers? Do I! No I don't. But I can have 'em here by Tuesday. Well, for now I'll take a left-handed crimper. Why, you are gorgeous. You don't know who I am, do you? I sure do. You're the most important person in the world, because you're my customer. Are you for real? I'm as real as the nose on your face. Yeah... real. Well, it looks good... and it sounds pretty too. Thanks. I'll see you later. I'm here for a while and I don't really know anyone. Would you like to have dinner tomorrow night? A woman askin' a man out? Well, well why not. And maybe I'll eat my steak with a spoon. Call me. I'm staying at the Springfield's Four Seasons. Ask for ""Zelda Fitzgerald."" What the...? That's a pseu-diddily-eudonym. WELL I'VE GOT A DATE WITH A GIRL WITH NO NAME / IT SURE FEELS GOOD TO BE BACK IN THE GAME / AT DESSERT MAYBE I CAN ASK HER HER NAME / 'CAUSE I CAN'T PRAY FOR HER WITHOUT THE RIGHT NAME... I've got a date with a movie star?! Sure you do. And I'm goin' apple pickin' with Scooby Doo. Psst! Homer! Flanders?! Can't a man just drink alone on a Wednesday morning? I need your advice. It's about a lady. Ooh! Lemme guess. Skinner's mother. She sure knows how to swing it. No, it's Sara Sloane. I have a date with her tonight. Sara Sloane? The movie star? Yep. Why would that Twinkie want to go out with a ding dong like me? Flanders, I mix Twinkies and Ding Dongs all the time. In Europe they call it a Dinkie. Well sir, that's very encouraging but I can't date a movie star. I'm no Arthur Miller or Lyle Lovett. Now wait just a minute -- I used to worry Marge was too good for me. She was always thinking of ways to improve me. But then part of her died and she doesn't try any more. So we're all where we want to be. I'm sorry for the disguise, Ned. I just don't want to cause a commotion. Excuse me, Miss Sloane. May I have an autograph? Sure. Oh man, this is going right on ebay. I mean, my wall. Which I will then sell on ebay. Sad to say this isn't the worst I get. Oh, oh, can I just push this plaster cast onto one of your boobs? Okay, now you are the worst. ... Rod says ""Marco,"" and darn it if Todd doesn't say ""Polo"" right back! Oh, listen to me just running my gums about my kids. You're probably bored silly. No, it's a nice change from all the actors I usually date. All they want to talk about is their Botox, their Tae-Bo or their X-Box. Huh. Heaven's gate! I'm gonna be tastin' you on my mustache for a week. Wanna try for a month? Sara Sloane has been involved with every Tinseltown hunk from Affleck to Zmed! Yeah, she's had more stars on her than Lisa's homework. Now she's dating Mr. Flanders. That's so romantic! Who the hell is Mr. Flanders? Oh, Flanders. Hello? Yes, I'm Ned Flanders' close personal friend... that's right, hot and heavy... they've never been happier. Oh yes, I she does look pregnant. Now, who might you be? A tabloid? Is that one of those really strong mints? Hello? Hello? JESUS IS THE ROCK / THAT ROLLS MY BLUES AWAY / SHOO BE DOO BE / YEAH, SHOO BE DOO BE! You guys are jammin'! Daddy, she swore. You know, I grew up in a house like this. I didn't know there were people like you left in the world. Yep, we occupy that useless mass of land between Los Angeles and New York. Called America! Ned, I'm not sure you should open the door. Oh now, if someone took the time to press that little button, this is the least I can do. Are you sleeping with Sara Sloane? Is that mustache real? Do you plan to kill Sara like your last wife? It's the tabloids! Everybody run! / Pose! Pose! Your carpeted floor feels good on my toes. Let's concoct more lies! ""Zookeeper's Wife,"" scene one oh two, take one. Action! Kiss me, Diego. But your husband's animals are watching. Where do you think I learned to do this? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This movie's turning into Sponge Bob No-Pants! Cut. Sir, there's no reason Sara needs to do this scene in the altogether. Sam, he's got a point. Katharine Hepburn never showed her breasts. There's still time. I want a rewrite. With no nudity. All right, but you're gonna have to kiss a woman. Deal. Ned, we won! Yep. Now all we gotta do is turn that woman into a fella and that kiss into a game of Scrabble. You're so sweet to look out for me. The public may not see me naked, but you just might. Well, that's uh, very interesting... Easy, Ned. Think of the Bible. Ms. Sloane, I loved you in ""Sleeping with Pinocchio"" and ""Honey, I Scotchguarded the Kids"". Thanks. I grew really close to the actress who played my daughter. I think she's in France or something. And Ned, I haven't seen you this happy in years. Mm-hmm. I haven't felt this good since we stole the 2000 election. Hey, don't blame me, I voted for the green M&M. The paparazzi! I thought we fooled them with our Cher-crow. Are you aware that your daughter's gay? Why, those guys are such leeches. Moe, what are you doing here? Can't your old buddy Moe stop by with a list of questions from the Weekly World News? Number one: Sara, is it true you shoplifted a kayak? I'll have you know she pays full price for all her watercraft! Rainier Wolfcastle!? My ex-boyfriend. Sara, liebchen, take me back. If tears could burst through my muscular ducts, I would cry like a baby who was just hit by hammer. Rainier, you're too jealous. You beat up Jon Lovitz just because he presented me an award. Oh c'mon. No one misses a handshake that badly. Sorry, I found someone nice who doesn't talk like a freak. Exact-a-tically-tacally! My libido has been terminated. Ned, I've never met a man like you. You're sensitive, you're in great shape, you have a mustache, and yet you're not gay. No way! I won't even eat vegetables over two inches long. So anyway, uh, your movie's wrapping up soon. I guess you'll be headin' out on the first bus to the airport. If you ride with a friend, you can save twenty bucks! Ned, I know this is fast, but, when I go back to Hollywood I want you to come with me. Ned Flanders in Tinseltown? Ned, I'm James L. Brooks. Can I call you Jim? James L. Brooks is good. How about some sponge cake? Well, I can't see the harm. With a brandy glaze. Noooo! Or perhaps you'd like to go to a football game... Well, I... We don't have a team. Noooo! Hey Daddy, baby. We're movie producers now. And we're Jewish. Yayyy! Sara, I'm sorry, but I can't move to Hollywood. Heck, even Dollywood's too far out for me. Too many people appreciating it ironically. Well, then I'm staying in Springfield with you. For good. Forgive my language, but I am one happy camper! Dude! What's it like kissing a movie star? What's it like kissing a woman? Well, what seems to be the problem, officer? The problem is I can't seem to get an agent. Could you give your girlfriend my head shot? That's me as a greaser, Emperor of China, Eleanor Roosevelt--very regal, and uh just plain me with an eye patch. I'll give it to my agent. I don't do TV! Sure is nice to be shopping for a woman again. The last thing I bought for a lady was a casket. Sir, would you ask your sweetheart to sign her autograph for me? Well of course. Wait a minute. This is to adopt two of your kids. Oh, so it is. I've already dumped three on Mia Farrow. Sucker! Look, it's celebrity boy-toy Ned Flanders and his arm candy, Sara Sloane. Miss Sloane, how are you handling the change from La-la land to blah-blah land? Lisa, Springfield isn't a cultural wasteland. Part of ""Stroker Ace"" was filmed at our airport. And, um, oh! There's our Ladies' Book Club. Sara, you're more than welcome to come. Oh I'd love to. Another scoop. Sara Sloane to attend girl-on-girl book club. Moe, you loveable loser, you just made yourself five dollars! Today's book is ""Bridget Jones' Diary."" Now, let's go around the room and analyze why we didn't read it. Cramps. All my friends are dead. Well then, I guess it's time for margaritas! Well, I wish someone had read the book, since I did invite the author, Helen Fielding. Oh never mind. As long as they all bought the book, I'll still get the money. Besides, most Americans can't understand the sophisticated subtlety of British humour. I bid you good day. Hop to it, honey! If we get to the Pops concert early, we can give up our seats to some old people. Daddy, where do babies come from? Sweetie, that's not the kind of dress you wear outdoors... or indoors... or in a dirty dream. Oh, loosen up Honey. This dress just creates the illusion of nudity. Well, Siegfried and Roy create a lot of illusions, but I doubt their girlfriends dress like that. She should be ashamed! That's disgusting. Don't look, Seymour. I'm a veteran, Mother. A veteran bed wetter! Mother! Sara, I hate to say it, but your top's upstaging the Pops! Fine, I'll wear your stupid jacket. Sara, I love ya, but I get the feeling you're just... not a Ned-head tonight. Is something wrong? Actually, there is something. The time we've spent together has been wonderful, but... I want sex. With you. Se... well, that's a mighty big... kettle of... premarital... uh, doodly... I knew you'd say that. I need a glass of wine. This is quite a dil-diddly-lemma. I better talk this over with the big man. Homer, Sara wants us to have S-E-X. Stupid Flanders. I'm not giving you any of my secret moves. Well, I'm not sure I want to do it. I mean ""who'll buy the cow when you get the milk for free?"" You know, the cow being me. Look, Flanders. I'm always interested in talking about free milk. And if there's cookies involved, so much the better. Ned, look. I know I said I wanted this. But I don't want you to do anything you're uncomfortable with. Well, I consulted my bible and found some verses supporting what you want to do. And a lot of verses against it. What does that one say, Ned? It says a man should make restitution if he eats his neighbor's grain. And that's good enough for me. Wow. Wow. That made me completely forget about Bob Balaban. That's what Maude used to say. A girl could get used to that. Well, and you will. Right after the wedding. You want to get married? Uh hmm. That's right. I'm like Baskin Robbins. You get one free taste then you gotta buy the scoop. Ned, I love you, but I'm not ready to be tied down. I love you, too. And I always will. But unlike the Bible, I guess this isn't gonna have a happy ending. I'm sorry. Oh, darn the luck. That sounds like the Lupus Fun Run. Haw haw. Fight lupus! Screen siren Sara Sloane shocked tinseltown last night with a midnight marriage to Gosford Park mega-hunk, Bob Balaban. This was followed three hours later by a quickie divorce. I bet we woulda lasted twice that long. Poor Ned, gardening away his misery. His answer's not at the bottom of a hedge. Hey Hollywood! Call me! My number's on the bench. You know it's the darndest thing -- women love you when you've dated a movie star. I'm very happy for you, Ned. Me too. Uh-oh. Here comes Helen Fielding.","Ralph Wiggum, Mayor Joe Quimby, Big Band Singer, Helen Fielding, James L.
