483,490,"It's aliiiive! It's aliiiive! Friend? Bart, you wanna see something cool? Oh, did you pick that big scab off your knee? No. Don't touch the scab! My science fair project proves that an asteroid will strike the earth on July 15, 9789. Who cares? I'll be President of Hell by then. Fine. Good luck with your project, which I'm sure you haven't started yet. I'll tell you my project: a fisteroid hitting the planet nerd. That's pathetic. Jeez, I put a lot of time in this. Back to the drawing board. Hey Bart, is your cootie shot ready? No, the science fair's not till next week! I really need that shot. My dog and I accidentally touched tongues. How is it ""accidentally"" when this is the fifth time? Bart, isn't that awfully similar to the cootie patch you did last year? That was preventative, this is morning-after... eh, you're right. What am I gonna do? Good ideas don't grow on trees. Or do they? Good shot! Not really -- I was trying to bounce it off your left testie. Testis, my friend. Look, I need help with my science fair project. To sweeten the deal, I'll pick you first for basketball. Ah, to be a mathlete without the M. Fly orb, and find thy hoop! I'm in. ""In the event of a primary core breach, you have fifteen seconds to avoid a complete-- Howdy! A woman of stature! Roz Davis, your new assistant. Assistant? Well, I have been pretty overworked lately. But I guess I should find out a little bit about you. I'm just a gal from Ohio who never wants to call her daddy again and say ""I need to borrow money."" So your dad has money to lend? This is where we get our coffee. Just leave a little at the bottom so someone else has to make the next pot. The burning smell will let them know. Genius. Uh-oh, it's Old man Burns! Hello, Young man Burns. Oh, Simpson. You do know how to whip my buggy. That sucker soaks up flattery like a Twinkie soaks up gravy. Well, when it's a handsome guy like you talkin'... Oh well! Your giggle is like strawberry wine. And your snort's like a summer breeze. That's not very attractive though. You okay? I'm fine. Bart, I fail to see the scientific function of this ""Homer Humiliator"" you've devised. Well, we gotta come up with something. Hey, what if we make some kind of robo-pet? What made you think of that? Thy will be done, Lord Vader. Please don't hurt me. Please. A robo-pet? Not a bad idea. Bully, Bart. Bully! Where? Is it Nelson? No Bart, it's just an expression. Who hath summoned me?! Baby seal, huh? Research shows it's impossible to gaze at a baby seal and say anything but... Awww. Precisely -- and at science fairs, the ""awws"" get the ""A's."" Heavens to Asimov! Hmmm... Must make sure these wires aren't crossed. Awww... Marge, get my seal club! The big one! They're all pretty big... I'm an experiment! Fine. Check it out. So, the soft fur, big eyes and gentle motion are designed to make it one helluva pet with none of the poop. This is the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my entire life! What a wonderful science fair. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts we could not afford our third place ribbon. Now, in Second Place, Lisa Simpson's grim description of our short-sighted dependence on fossil fuels. It's about an asteroid! They're all the same, Gloomhilda. First Place goes to Bart Simpson and Martin Prince... Yeah! ...for creating a furry robotic friend who provides comfort when humans fail to, which they will, trust me. I carried you in my belly for four-and-a-half-months. When you fell out on the bus, that's when my job ended. Congratulations on gettin' a ribbon, Lisa -- you must've baked a mighty fine pie! It wasn't a pie, it was science! And it's not fair -- my project was way better than Bart's, and I didn't have help from a nerd! I'm my own nerd! Ha-ho sweetie, being second ain't the worst thing that can happen. Look at poor old Jasper over there. He lost his wife, his kids don't call. Soon he'll just be bones and beard. Wow! While I was sitting here feeling sorry for myself, Bart's invention actually changed someone's life! And best of all I got funding for my Homer Humiliator. Hm. Why would a Homer Humiliator do this to me? Y'ello. Hey, Barney... a free movie screening? Of course I can go! I just need somebody to hold down the fort. Oh, uh, Roz, I have to step out for one hour and forty-three minutes. Could you cover for me? Go ahead. Woo hoo! Oh, uh, if an emergency alarm goes off, there's earplugs in the top drawer! Life imitates Flart. It says that on the poster. I thought of it first. Marge, I just saw the greatest movie. Guess what happens when a mop is replaced with an octopus! I'll give you a clue, it's funny! Take off the 3-D glasses! Simpson! A gangly little bird told me you've been lollygagging at the Biograph. Someone snitched? Wha-wha-wha-wha-what are you gonna do to me? You're demoted. Up or down? Down! Don't tell my wife. So, partner, what's next on the agenda? Oh... um... Back off, man. Can't you see you're embarrassing Bart? When did you take that picture? Last time you slept over at my house. I love when you're sleeping and at peace. START HERE Hey Skippy, we need some more of them loveable critters for our friends at the home. Unless you got any heroin. You got any heroin? Hm? Well then, critters it is. I'm telling you guys, Roz told Old Man Burns I ditched work early and now I'm her assistant. I dunno, Homer. You're sayin' she's nice on the outside, but mean on the inside? No one could pull that off! Enjoy. And as for you, Homer, don't worry. You're at Moe's tavern -- lady-free since eighty-three. What the-- This is a gentleman's club! Yeah. So, what you boys drinkin'? I'm buyin'. Can we just have the cash value of the drink? Be my guest. I'd rather use my money to buy a Moe souvenir t-shirt. That comes in kid sizes too. This is terrible. What am I gonna do? Aren't you gonna come to bed, Homie? Can't, Marge. I'm fighting for my professional life here. Do you know what I just learned? My job is the reason I get those checks every week! And now that I'm demoted, the checks have gotten smaller! Not in physical size, but-- I know! I know! I represent the Eternal Valley funeral home, and I'm here to talk about an extremely unpleasant subject: people continuing to live. If we don't have a frickin' funeral soon people, you can say goodbye to Howard's Flowers! Calm down, Howard Junior. Now here is the zip, the zap and the zing: we're gonna rewire Charlie Loveable here into the greatest threat to seniors' lives since nursing homes themselves. Switcheroo... Impressive. Hard to believe two ten-year-old kids built this. And I heard one of them did all the work. That's True. / Wow. Am I early? You're late. Since I got demoted I have to show my I.D., but the picture was taken so long ago I put on a lot of weight, so I have to stretch out my face and say ""I used to look like this..."" Late. You're mean! Now, I want a list of a hundred ways to make your job worse by close of business today. Can one of the hundred be making the list? No. Can some of them be callbacks to earlier ones? Also, no. We're live at the Springfield Retirement Castle where long-time resident, Alice Glick, died last night -- at the paws of this cuddly little killer. Our Channel Six Substitute Medical Expert Dr. Nick Riviera had this to say: The champion was cleared to fight. Doctor, this press conference is about a nursing home death. The Springfield police are in the process of taking all the robots into custody...safely returning the seniors to their hopeless, dismal lives. Shut that thing off. I meant the TV! Sorry. Hi, we need someone to re-program our robots to break out of jail. A chance to reprogram robots? Well, I had a date with a beauty queen tonight, but forget it. Hello, yes, hello, Miss Wyoming? I'll, I'll have to climb your Grand Tetons another night. The breast joke! I, I, I served it up. Why won't he love me?! Do this, do that. Lousy Roz, thinks she's so big... Well, looks like it's time for another ""'End of the Walk' Talk With Homer and Ned."" Tonight's topic: ""The Niceness of the Evening."" Hey. Homer, all nonsense aside, are you okalidokalaroony? I'm having problems with my new boss Roz. She's the most evil person to come out of Ohio since LeBron, but at least he thought long and hard before screwing everybody over, in public for no reason. Y'know, I knew a backstabbin' buckeye named Roz at Bible Camp. Twice as tall as she should've been. Is this her? C'mon. The apple must be wreaking havoc with the Twinkie! It is! But if you've got the stones, I can tell you how to slay that Gal-ioth. Are you aware that ""stones"" means ""man junk?"" What the? I've been using that around the boys! Thank you. Now, it was one of our biggest celebrations...the nineteenth Sunday after Easter. We'd just had a rousing no-fun run and in the heat of the moment I wanted to offer my respectful best wishes. Peace be with you. Well, sir, she went crazy. Crazier than sleeping in on a Sunday. I can't stand to be touched! Never tell anyone! And I haven't. Not until now. That's it! That's it! My nightmare is over! Oh Flanders, you are my personal savior! Oh that's nice, but I don't approve of-- Hail Flanders! Mightier than Jesus! Yes, I, uh, I hereby call to order this meeting of the North American Man-Bot Love Association. I'll say this one more time: we really should change that name. Yes, all right, I'll change it whatever you like, as long as Man-Bot Love is in there somewhere. Now let's look at these blueprints, shall we? Uh, first, we remotely adjust them so they will never be malicious again. There, there and there. Now, arise, little ones! Hey-hey! What's going on here? I'd better call 911. Ugh, it's always busy when I call. Oh, what a bunch of idiots. Aw, I can't stay mad at you. Go on! Get out of here! Oh, oh, Chief? Yeah? Yeah, you too. Although this millennium is still young, I feel it is time to award this giant trophy paid for with your healthcare cuts... To our beloved Roz... What the deuce? Sarcastic clapping? Congratulations, Roz. What are you doing here, Simpson? If there isn't dry-cleaning in the back of my car, there's gonna be blood on my knuckles. Uh, I just came to say that you're perfect. So perfect, I think Mr. Burns should give you a hug. Who told you? I won't say, but his initials are S.F. Stupid Flanders. Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! You're fired! I underestimated you. I don't know what that middle word means. Well, it means my perception of you is that you were kind of a goof, but now I see you're rather clever. What is perception? It's how I view you. You understand that? No. I used to think you were an idiot. Now it turns out you're not such an idiot, in fact, you might even be smart. Little help? Rub the butter around you. Need more butter! And not the unsalted. Do you want to get out of there or not? Mr. J., if I don't get my green card, they're gonna turn me back into a washing machine! No dawdling! Just move it along! Oy! Oy! My mechanical mensch, how I missed you! Bless you, boys. Now that we've got 'em back, we'll never let 'em go again. 'Cause there's no stronger force than a senior citizen holding onto a freebie.","Ralph Wiggum, Carl Carlson, Snake Jailbird, Waylon Smithers, Reps, Chief Wiggum, Old Jewish Man, Scratchy, Milhouse Van Houten, Roz, Agnes Skinner, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Kent Brockman, Robot Maid, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Gary Chalmers, Seymour Skinner, C.
