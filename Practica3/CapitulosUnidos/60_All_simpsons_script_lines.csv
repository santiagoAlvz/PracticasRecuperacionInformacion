59,60,"Well, children, it's the last day of school. Here are your grades. Oh no, Mrs. Krabappel. If I don't get a C average, my Dad won't let me go to Kamp Krusty. Well, it isn't fair to the other children, but, all right. Much obliged, doll. Oh Bart Simpson, I'm gonna miss you. Attention, everyone. This is Principal Skinner. I trust you all remembered to bring in your implements of destruction. Now let's trash this dump! Somebody put a torch to these permanent records! Quickly now. La-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la. La-la-la-la-la. La-la-... Wake up, boy. Oh, I dreamt it was the last day of school. Well it is. Oh how do I know this isn't some beautiful dream, too? You know, a pinch is more traditional. Homie, you do remember your promise to the children? Sure do. When you're eighteen, you're out the door. No, Dad. You promised if Bart and I got C averages we could go to Kamp Krusty. And with no false modesty, you're looking at one happy camper. Yeah. Well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. It now goes: D,B,A,C. Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. I don't think I'd be any kind of a father if you got D's and I let you go to Kamp Krusty. But Dad... Son, if you really want something in this life you have to work for it. Now quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers. 17... 32... 5... 8... Woo-hoo! 47... Attention students: please clear out your lockers into the waste baskets provided. 36-24-36... Now let's see what we got here. Ah, my gym shorts. Here are your final report cards. I have nothing left to say to any of you, so if nobody minds, let's just quietly run out the clock. ARITHMETIC: A SOCIAL STUDIES: A CONDUCT: B+ ENGLISH: A ART: A P.E.: A I've never gotten a B before. How could this have happened? I feel so dirty. Uh.. uh...uh. The dirt's not coming off. Okay. Calm down. This must just be a little typo. Oh Miss Hoover, there appears to be a mistake on my report card. You gave me a B+ in conduct. Now Lisa, everyone needs a blotch on their permanent record. Perhaps I'm not making myself clear. I think you should reconsider. Lisa... you're... hurting me. Mrs. Krabappel, in figuring out my final grades, I hope you'll note that all of my textbooks are being returned in excellent condition. In some cases, still in their original wrappings. Duly noted. I'd also like to add as I gaze upon your beauty, I've never seen an angel fly so low. Forget it, short pants. Mrs. Krabappel, if I don't get at least a C average I can't go to Kamp Krusty. Have a ""D""-lightful summer. Five! Four! Three! Two! Don't open your mouth. One! Wait a minute! You didn't learn how World War Two ended! We won! Hmmm, I haven't seen such unfettered hurly-burly since the fall of Saigon. Well, William, another school year gone by. And may I say a job well done, sir. Well, back to work then. Make sure to give those toilets a good scrubbing. We want the old girls sparkling when I get back. Aye, sir. Ya silk-wearing buttercup... All right! Three whole months of Spaghetti-O's and daytime TV! So, Bart, will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of Kamp Krusty? You bet. Check out this hand. All aces! A+! Oh, Bart, why didn't you at least forge plausible grades? Hi kids! Only one week left to sign up for the bestest summer ever at Kamp Krusty! Kamp Krusty is built on an actual Indian burial ground. We've got archery, wallet-making, the whole megillah. And for you fat kids, my exclusive program of diet and ridicule will really get results. And the best part is when you come to Kamp Krusty, you'll spend the summer with me. Honest Injun! Well, here goes nothin'. Stupid roller-skate. Well, dad, here's my report card. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. A+? You don't think much of me, do you boy? No, sir. You know a D turns into a B so easily. You just got greedy. So I won't get to go to camp? Now, Bart. We made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades. And you didn't. But why should you pay for my mistake? You mean I can go? Yeah. I didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway. Oh, Dad. You're the best father a boy could ever have! Thanks son. Now, you've got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate? Never mind. Bart, where's your bathing suit? I'm gonna swim nekkid. You're what? Ah sure, there'll be a couple of uptight counselors who won't dig the Bart philosophy, but I feel the human body is a thing of beauty. Marge, am I crazy, or is my back getting hairier? Before I go to camp, I'll need boosters for malaria, German Measles, encephalitis, Hansen's disease... Oh now, I'm afraid what we have here is an advanced case of hypochondria. There's only one known cure. A wowwy-pop. Don't patronize me, doctor. It's our last family dinner for six weeks, but I promised myself I wouldn't cry. Oh, I'm going to miss this. Hey, hands off my pickle. I don't see your name on it, boy. No, but... Oh yeah? Check... mate. Always thinking two moves ahead. We'll see you when you get back from Image Enhancement camp. Spare me your euphemisms. It's Fat Camp for Daddy's chubby little secret. You promised you wouldn't make a scene. Good-bye my special little guy. Lisa, watch out for poison ivy. Remember, ""Leaves of 3, let it be. ""Leaves of 4, eat some more."" I'll write you every day. Don't look in my closet. In fact, stay out of my room all together. If the pets die, don't replace them. I'll know! Hi kids! Welcome to Kamp Krusty! I'll see you in a few weeks. Until then, I've turned things over to my bestest buddy in the whole wide world -- Mr. Black. I want you to treat Mr. Black with the same respect you would give me. Now, here's Mr. Black. Thank you Krusty, and welcome children. I am Mr. Black, your head counselor. For the past fifteen years, I was President of Euro Krustyland... until it blew up. I'll take any questions you might have. You... and then uh, one more. Can we call you Uncle Blackie? No. Last question. When do we get to see Krusty? Ah, he will be along eventually. In the meantime, our counselors Dolph, Jimbo and Kearney will be happy to handle any problems you may have. Looks like we got ourselves a troublemaker. You can have the shower to yourself, Homie. I'm finished. Oh no you're not. Ohhh... He-he-he. Whoa!! Here's your cabin. You don't like it, T.F. This is a little more rustic than I expected. I'm not worried, Lis. You know why? Because of this... The Krusty Brand seal of approval. You can only find it on products which meet the high personal standards of Krusty the Clown. Aaaahhhh! Whoops, I should have warned you. That clock gets incredibly hot if you leave it plugged in. That's okay. Eh, all this stuff is fine. Now I'm off to Wimbledon! Don't we get to roast marshmallows? Shut up and eat your pine cone. Are you sure that's safe? Well, it ain't getting any safer! All right, you balls of pan drippings, I want to see Crisco coming out of those pores. We're not leaving until this Christmas ham gives me a pull-up. HAIL TO THEE KAMP KRUS-TY / BY THE SHORES OF BIG SNAKE LAKE / THOUGH YOUR SWINGS ARE RUS-TY / WE KNOW THEY'LL NEVER BREAK... Louder! Faster! FROM YOUR GLEAMING MESS-HALL / TO YOUR HOLLOW BASEBALL FIELD / YOUR SPIC AND SPAN INFIRMARY / WHERE ALL OUR WOUNDS ARE HEALED... / HAIL TO THEE CAMP KRUSTY / BELOW MT. AVALANCHE... WE WILL ALWAYS LOVE KAMP KRUSTY / A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF THE KRUSTY CORPORATION... You're serving us gruel? Not quite. This is ""Krusty Brand Imitation Gruel."" nine out of ten orphans can't tell the difference. Yo, Mr. Black, another brandy. To evil. Marge, since the kids left, I lost five pounds! Oh, that's wonderful. And look. New hair! I'm this close to having a comb-over! Lights out, losers. Yeah, we're meetin' some tail on the other side of the lake. I feel like I'm gonna die, Bart. We're all gonna die, Lis. I meant soon. So did I. Mmmm... strawberries. Ah, That's good. Hey, Lendl! Choke! Choke! Yeah! Point and game - Becker. And will the harlequin in the third row please keep his voice down. Sorry folks. Sorry, Your Majesty. Dear kids, I hope this letter finds you well. We are doing great. Your father is in the best shape he's been since...well, ever. Size... right... agility! We miss you terribly. I hope these jelly bean cookies will tide you over until you get home. Hey Simpson, tell your mom her cookies sucked. Dear Mom and Dad, I no longer fear Hell, because I've been to Kamp Krusty. Our nature hikes have become grim death marches. A snake bit me. Back in line, maggot. Our arts and crafts center is, in actuality, a Dickensian workhouse. Come on, wimps, these Gucci wallets have to be on the streets of Hong Kong by Friday. Bart makes it through the days relying on his unwavering belief that Krusty the clown will come through. Krusty is coming. Krusty is coming. Krusty is coming. But I am far more pessimistic. I am not sure if this letter will reach you as our lines of communication have been cut. Giddyap. And now the effort of writing has made me lightheaded. So I close by saying, save us! Save us now! Bart and Lisa. Ah, kids' letters from camp. She complains now, but when we go to pick her up, she won't want to leave. Lisa, I've been thinking it over, and next summer I am getting a job. Oh... Homer, it's getting late, we'll miss the fireworks. Marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here. Well kids, uh, I promised you a little treat in lieu of dinner and here it is. The man who took an abandoned mule tannery and turned it into a summer wonderland, Mr. Krusty the Clown. See, I told you Krusty would come. Just like I said, heh, heh. He's gonna bring us food and water and smite our enemies. Now I must tell you kids, Krusty has laryngitis and a bad back so he won't be saying anything or doing anything. Krusty looks fat. He's really having trouble keeping his balance. He's still funny, but not ha-ha funny. That's not Krusty the Clown. What do you think, I slapped a clown suit on some wino? Yeah, Bart, I am so Krunchy the Klown . All right, that's it! I've been scorched by Krusty before. I got a rapid heart beat from those Krusty brand vitamins; my Krusty calculator didn't have a 7 or an 8; and Krusty's autobiography was self-serving, with many glaring omissions. But this time he's gone too far. We want Krusty! We want Krusty! We want Krusty! We want Krusty! Yeah, we want Krunchy! We want Krunchy! I thought you said you broke their spirits. We did. You broke nothing! Let's get 'em! To the hydrofoil. My chunky brothers, gorge yourselves at the trough of freedom! Ahh, sweet nourishing gruel! Kowalski! My brownies! Wiggum! A change of underwear! Crandall! My insulin! Bart, you said you were gonna name it ""Camp Freedom."" Ehh, this has more zing. I dub thee, Sir... There's a call for Mr. Clown. This'd better be important. Oy gavolt! Just let your head flop back and forth. Your neck is a well-cooked piece of asparagas. We interrupt ""Sadruddin Mabaradad's Yoga Party"" for this special bulletin. ""KRISIS AT KAMP KRUSTY"". Ladies and gentlemen, I've been to Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and I can say without hyperbole that this is a million times worse than all of them put together. Burn, Krusty, burn. Burn, Krusty, burn. A group of school-age Spartacuses has taken this camp by force. Three counselors are missing and presumed scared. What's that? I'm being told I can have an exclusive interview with the ring leader. Don't be the boy. Don't be the boy. I just want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp. Can I say ""crappy"" on TV? Yes, on this network you can. Are you and Princess Di just friends? You people make me sick. You're vultures. Where were you when I sang at Farm Aid? Out of my way you parasites. I said out of my way. I'm no fake, I am the real Krusty. Oh yeah? Who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom, ""President Clown""? I don't know her name, but she held up a liquor store last year. I smell bacon. Let's see if he's wearing a wire. It is the real Krusty. Look at that pacemaker scar, the cattle skull birthmark, and his famous superfluous nipple. Well, at least you're not as bad as customs. How could you, Krusty? I'd never lend my name to an inferior product. They drove a dump truck full of money up to my house. I'm not made of stone! Krusty, this camp was a nightmare. They fed us gruel, they forced us to make wallets for export, and one of the campers was eaten by a bear. Oh my God. Well actually, the bear just ate his hat. Was it a nice hat? Oh yeah. Oh my God. Well, I'm gonna make it all up to you. I'm gonna show you kids the time of your lives.
