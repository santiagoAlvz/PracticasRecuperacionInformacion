82,83,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's ""Up Late with McBain,"" I'm your announcer, Ubergruppenfuher Wolfcastle. And, heeeeere's McBain. Ya. Thank you. Ya, that's nice. Let's say hello to my music guy, Scoey. That is some outfit, Scoey. It makes you look like a homosexual. Maybe you all are homosexuals too. This is horrible. The Fox network has sunk to a new low. Lisa, you got a letter. It's from my pen pal, Anya! Dear Lisa. As I write this I am very sad. Our president has been overthrown and... ... replaced by the benevolent General Krull. All hail Krull and his glorious new regime. Sincerely, Little Girl. You got a letter too, Bart. I'm going to kill you. Bart, what's wrong with you? Oh my god, someone's trying to kill me! Oh wait, it's for Bart. Hmm. This one's done in different handwriting. Oh. I wrote that one, after Bart somehow put this tattoo on my butt. Haw haw! But who'd want to hurt me? I'm this century's ""Dennis the Menace."" It's probably the person you least suspect! That's good, Dad. I say we call Matlock. He'll find the culprit. It's probably that evil Gavin McCloud or George ""Goober"" Lindsey. Grampa, Matlock's not real. Neither are my teeth, but I can still eat corn on the cob if someone cuts it off and smushes it into a fine paste. Now that's good eating. I checked around. The girls are calling you ""fatty fat fat fat"", and Nelson's planning to pull down your pants, but nobody's trying to kill you. That's good. Fatty fat fat fat! Fatty fatty fat fat! All right, this is dedicated to Bart Simpson with the message, ""I am coming to kill you, slowly and painfully."" Bart, I'm going to get you... ... some ice cream at the store, since I'm saving so much money on diet cola. Say your prayers, Simpson... ... 'cause the schools can't force you like they should. Maude, these new finger-razors make hedge trimming as fun as sitting through church. You're going to be my murder victim, Bart... ... in our school production of ""Lizzie Borden,"" starring Martin Prince as Lizzie! Fourty whacks with a wet noodle, Bart! I'd like to help you, ma'am, but I'm afraid there's no law against mailing threatening letters. I'm pretty sure there is. Hrrmph. The day I take cop lessons from Ma Kettle-- Hey, she's right, chief. Well, shut my mouth. It's also illegal to put squirrels down your pants for the purposes of gambling. Boys, knock it off. Bart, I figured it out. Who's someone you've been making irritating phone calls to for years? Linda Lavin? No, someone who didn't deserve it. Hello Moe? We know you're the one behind this. So knock it off or we're going to the cops. No no, I'll take care of it. Okay it's over! Get 'em out of here! All right, andalay! Andalay! You're out there somewhere. But where? Where? Dear Life in these United States. A funny thing happened to me... Use a pen, Sideshow Bob. Parole granted! Next up for parole, Bob Terwilliger, aka Sideshow Bob. Take care, Snake. May the next time we meet be under more felicitous circumstances. Guh? Take care. Buh. Sideshow Bob has no decency. He called me Chief Piggum! Oh, now I get it. Sideshow Bob tried to kill me on our honeymoon! Murmur!... Murmur!... Murmur! How many people in this court are thinking of killing her right now? Be honest. Ah, she's always leaving the toilet seat up. Robert, if released, would you pose any threat to one Bart Simpson? Bart Simpson? The spirited little scamp who twice foiled my evil schemes and sent me to this dank, urine-soaked hell-hole? Uh... we object to the term, ""urine-soaked hell-hole"" when you could have said, ""peepee-soaked heck-hole."" Cheerfully withdrawn. What about that tattoo on your chest. Doesn't it say ""Die Bart, Die?"" No... That's German for ""The Bart, The."" Oh. / How continental. / Etc. No one who speaks German could be an evil man. Parole granted. Wow, the pooblic libary. Let's stay here for a while, Vern. That man is so rude. Yeah. If you don't mind, we're trying to watch the mov... Hey, Vern, help me get my get head out of this toilet. Oh really, now. That's too much. Sideshow Bob! You wrote me those letters. You awful man. Stay away from my son. Oh I'll stay away from your son, all right. Stay away, forever. Oh no! Wait a minute. That's no good. Wait. I've got a good one now. Marge, say, ""Stay away from my son"" again. No! And turn! And flex! And shake! And bounce! And turn! And flex! And shake! And bounce! Now Sideshow Bob can't get in without me knowing. And once a man is in your home, anything you do to him is nice and legal. Is that so? Oh, Flan-ders! Won't you join me in my kitchen? It doesn't work if you invite him. Hiedilly-hey! Go home. Toodledy-doo! Now don't you fret. When I'm through, he won't set foot in this town again. I can be very, very persuasive. Come on! Leave town! No. I'll be your friend. No. You're mean. The following neighborhood residents will not be killed by me. Ned Flanders, Maude Flanders... Isn't that nice? ... Homer Simpson, Marge Simpson, Lisa Simpson, that little baby Simpson. That is all. Woo hoo! Did you hear, Bart? Oh. Don't worry, Mrs. Simpson, we've helped hundreds of people in danger. We'll give you a new name, a new job, new identities. Ooh! I wanna be John Elway. Elway takes the snap and runs it in for a touchdown! Thanks to Elway's patented last-second magic, the final score of Super Bowl 30: Denver - 7; San Francisco - 56! Woo hoo! I don't think this is such a good idea. This isn't just because of Sideshow Bob. It's a chance to turn around all our stinking lives. I'll be Gus, the lovable chimney sweep. Clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster. Yeah! Shut up, boy. We have places your family can hide in peace and security: Cape Fear, Terror Lake, New Horrorfield, Screamville... Ooh, Ice Creamville. No. Screamville. Tell you what sir, from now on you'll be Homer Thompson at Terror Lake. Let's just practice a bit. When I say ""Hello, Mr. Thompson,"" you'll say, ""Hi."" Check. Hello, Mr. Thompson. Remember now, your name is Homer Thompson. I got ya. Hello, Mr. Thompson. Now when I say, ""Hello, Mr. Thompson"" and press down on your foot... you smile and nod. No problem. Hello, Mr. Thompson. I think he's talking to you. Here you go. Oh, what a cute convertible. You guys at the bureau thought of everything. Hey look! ""The FBI Light Opera Society Sings the Complete Gilbert and Sullivan."" THREE LITTLE MAIDS FROM SCHOOL ARE WE / PERT AS A SCHOOLGIRL WELL CAN BE / FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH GIRLISH GLEE / THREE LITTLE MAIDS FROM SCHOOL... EVERYTHING IS A SOURCE OF FUN... HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA. Lousy speed bumps. Ew. This coffee's too hot. Hey, kids! Wanna drive through that cactus patch? Yeah! Yeah! No! Whup, two against one! Ow! / Oh! / Etc. The Thompsons! Wow, a houseboat! You know, the great thing is if you don't like your neighbors, you can just pull up the anchor and sail someplace else. Homer, where's the dog? I tied him up, out back. We've left it all behind. How can you make a clean break with your life? Relax, Marge. I tied up all the loose ends before we left. Hello? Hel-lo? You have my pills! Hel-lo? I'm cold and there are wolves after me. Hello, Bart. Down here, Bart. What do you want? Surely there's no harm in laying in the middle of a public street. Not the elephants! Aaah... Mom! Dad! I saw Sideshow Bob and he threatened to kill me! Bart! Don't interrupt! Homer, this is serious. Oh it is not. Roman numeral three, surprise boy in bed... and a... disembowel him. No, I don't like that ""bowel"" in there. ""Gut him."" Ahh... Le mot juste. BARTDOYOUWANTSOMEBROWNIESBEFORE YOUGOTOBED?! C'mon, let me cut you a brownie while they're still hot. Dad, I'm kinda edgy right now. I'd appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife. Why? Oh, right. The Sideshow Bob thing. Sorry, boy. BARTDOYOUWANNASEEMYNEWCHAINSAWAND HOCKEYMASK? Sorry. What am I thinking? Hello, Bart. Mom! Dad! Your family can't help you now. Oh, no! Dad's been drugged! No, he hasn't. Uh-oh. Oh, yeah. Well, Bart. Any last requests? Well, there is one, but... Nah. No, go on. Well, you have such a beautiful voice... Guilty as charged. Uh-huh. Anyway... I was wondering if you could sing the entire score of ""The HMS Pinafore""? Very well, Bart. I shall send you to heaven before I send you to hell. And a two and a three and... WE SAIL THE OCEAN BLUE / AND OUR SAUCY SHIP'S A BEAUTY / WE ARE SOBER MEN AND TRUE / AND ATTENTIVE TO OUR DUTY... I'M CALLED LITTLE BUTTERCUP / POOR LITTLE BUTTERCUP / THOUGH I COULD NEVER TELL WHY... WHAT NEVER? / NO NEVER / WHAT NEVER?... HARDLY EVER! HE'S HARDLY EVER SICK AT SEA! FOR HE HIMSELF HAS SAID IT / AND IT'S CLEARLY TO HIS CREDIT / THAT HE IS AN ENGLISHMAN / HE REMAINS AN E-E-E-E-NGLISHMAN! And now, the final curtain. Hold it right there, Sideshow Bob. You're under arrest. By Lucifer's Beard! Uh, yeah. It's a good thing you drifted by this brothel. I knew I had to buy some time. So, I asked him to sing the score from ""The HMS Pinafore."" Ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies. Take him away, boys. Hey, I'm the Chief here. Bake him away, toys. What'd you say, Chief? Do what the kid says. It's so good to be home again. Look what happened without my pills. Bart, run upstairs and get Grampa's medicine! Not so fast. I wanna court this fair young maiden. There's something you should know about me. I've got Steve and Edie tickets. I'm all yours.","Parole Board Head, Blue-Haired Lawyer, Snake Jailbird, MRS KRABAPPEL, Chief Wiggum, Little Girl, Lou, Milhouse Van Houten, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Football Announcer, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Fbi Agent #2, Lisa Simpson, Investigator, Parole Board Member #2, Fbi Agent #1, Parole Board, Parole Board Member #1, Schoolyard Girls, Sinister Male Voice, Man On Screen, Moe Szyslak, Ned Flanders, McBain, Marty, Martin Prince, Selma Bouvier, Woman On Tape, Announcer, Jasper Beardly, Sideshow Bob, People In Court, Celestial Choir, Bart Simpson, Edna Krabappel-Flanders, Patty Bouvier",9.0,2010.0,2,1993-10-07,1993,5,Cape Feare,20.0,65585.0
