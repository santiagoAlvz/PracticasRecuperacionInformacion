196,200,"Gentlemen, I'm pleased to report strong holiday sales from the Christmas-Hannu-Kwanzaa spend-phase. And things look good for the Mom-Dad-Grad gift corridor. Ahh, then we'll have the usual summer lull, but hey, we're makin' enough money, right? Hey, hey, hey. Umm, but.. hey, hey.. hey, hey.. Okay, people, we need to cook up a new holiday for the summer. Something with gifts, cards, assorted gouge-ables... How 'bout something religious? We had great penetration last spring with ""Christmas II."" Oh, I know! ""Spendover"" -- like Passover, but less talk, more presents. Yeah, uh... ""Giftsgiving""... ""Store Appreciation Day""... No, no, no! No, it's gotta be warm and fuzzy. Something like, um, ""Love Day,"" but not so lame. Happy Love Day, everyone! Come on, Mom, the stores just invented this holiday to make money. Lisa, don't you ruin another Love Day. For you, Homie. I'm Sir Loves-a-Lot, the bear who loves to love! They didn't have Lord Huggington? It's the same basic bear, Homey. I guess. What the hell is this? It's a ""Kisses-Make-Me-Boogie-O-Lantern."" Kiss it and make it boogie! Kiss it. Uh, maybe later. Oh-ho yeahhh... Well, we'd better start our Love Day clean-up. You kids take care of the wrapping paper. I'm going to dismantle Love Land. Uh, what a terrible waste! Yes, but the memories will last a lifetime. Crap -- py -- stuff. It's full, Dad. That means you have to take out the trash. Yep, that's the rule. He who tops it off, drops it off. Nuh-uh. It isn't filled until it's spilled. I wuv you. I wuv... Wuv you.. I heard that! You know the rule. Ooh, but I can rebuild! Ow-ow, stupid-trash, rotten-stinky, hate-world, revenge-soon, take out on everyone... Garbage water! Oh-ho-ho! You're pushin' me, baby. Hey wait! Stop! I have garbage! You guys are the lousiest garbage men ever! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! You trash-eatin' stink bags! Uh oh. What did you call us? I don't know. A lot of people were yelling stuff. Yeah, you called us, ""trash-eating stink bags."" Didn't you learn anything from Love Day? That was yesterday, moron! Good news, everyone. I got in a fight with the garbage men and they're cutting off our service. Oh lord! Now what are we going to do? Just let the trash pile up? Hey, I'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbage men. Dad, is this another one of those situations that could be solved by a simple apology? I never apologize, Lisa. I'm sorry, but that's just the way I am. Siddown, honey. The men will clear the table! So long, chicken bone. See you in hell, brussel sprouts. No room for you, Jell-O. Goodbye, fine China. Bart! Easy, Ned, don't breathe in. Oooooh! Sorry Ned. I didn't see you down there. Got him. Uh, listen Homer, ah, hate to be a fussy Freddy and all, but Maude's folks are here and, ah, they're a tad touchy about odors... Then you might wanna close your windows before the sun hits Diaper Hill. Look, Daddy, I'm king of the mountain! Rod, get off of there! Three, two, one... Go! Go! Go! So-ho, the rats seem happy. Homer, that crazy lady who lives in our trash pile attacked me again. That's not the way she tells it. And the school nurse says Bart has the plague. Uh, it's like the measles. Good to get it out of the way. Homer, this has gone far enough. Will you please just apologize to the garbage men? Yeah Dad, you're always telling me and Bart to apologize. Yeah, but I'm always secretly disappointed when you do. Anyway, I think those garbage men are starting to crack. I think you're startin' to crack. Apologize for that remark. No way. Attaboy! Good morning, Trash Pile. How's about... Hey! Woo-hoo! I won! This is a very, very proud day for us, especially me. Your father, me, beat City Hall. It's just like David and Goliath, only this time David won. Oh, I know. I heard it too. Here's some music. And to think you wanted me to crawl, Marge! Well, this man doesn't crawl. He stands tall. That rhymes, Marge, and you know it rhymes. Admit it! Oh Homer, you didn't beat City Hall! They picked up our trash because I wrote a letter of apology to the Sanitation Commissioner and signed your name. Period. You signed my name? I feel so violated. You've signed my name lots of times. But this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. And I'm going to get it back. Lisa, do I have my pants on? Yes. Perfect. Here's your apology back, Mr. Simpson, and I'm sorry we couldn't work this out. Don't come off all high and mighty with me, Patterson. You can't scare me, with your office and your desk and your lamp. I'm not tryin' to scare you. I'm just tryin' to get my work done, here. Oh, oh, oh, I get it. Put on a big show for the cameras. What cameras? Why are you still here? I came to fight City Hall. I wanna shake things up, Patterson. Stir up some controversy. Rattle a few cages. Hey, stop that! You'll never silence me! I'm the last angry man, Patterson! A crusader for the little guy! Leave the bird alone! Never! Look Simpson, I've been elected by the voters of this city sixteen years in a row, so they must think I'm doing a damn good job. You want to know what I think? No! Nobody wants to hear the nonsensical ravings of a loud-mouthed malcontent! Well, we'll see about that. Hey! I want to register to run for Sanitation Commissioner. And tell the fatcats upstairs -- things are gonna change in this town! Okay, but this is where you register as a sex offender. Aw, jeez. There's always a line. Hey, everybody, vote for my Dad, Homer Simpson. If you don't he'll beat us. Why you little... No one's gonna beat ya, son. You're gonna get such a beating. Hey, vote Simpson... Hi... Nice to see ya... Heh, thanks for comin' out... Keep puttin' on weight, huh? Lenny, my man. So, Homer, if we vote for you, whaddaya gonna do different? What am I, the answer man? Just vote for me. Hmf, I don't know Ray Patterson, but he's no Ray Patterson. Yeah, Homer's a great Nuclear Safety Inspector, but I don't know if I'd trust him with my garbage. Yea, I know. It's a peace of mind issue you know? These old geezers just don't get it. It's time to rock the vote. Siddown! Sit down! You're ruining it for everyone! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Can I help you? Potato man. Where the hell you been? Okay, camera two... Uh, excuse me, this is a restricted area. Take a hike, Kojak. Hellooo Springfield! It's me, Homer! What the bloody hell? Quiet, you! I know you youngsters wanna see these rockin' rockers. But I also know you care about the race for Sanitation Commissioner. So, let me give ya the 911... Get off the stage! / Get out of here, fatso! Hold on, people. The man's talkin' about waste management. That affects the whole damn planet. Oh, here we go... What do you say we go down to Moe's for a pint? Can I come? No. Wankers... Now, Homer... I hear Ray Patterson is a fine public servant. Why should the people of Springfield-- Springfield! / Whoo! Why should they vote for you? That's a good question, Bono. 'Cause I'd be the most wack, tripped-out Sanitation Commissioner ever! Can ya dig it? Wow, look at him go! You're the real Lord of the Dance, Homer. Ow! Oh, Bono! Help me! Don't worry, folks. He'll get the help he needs. My campaign is a disaster, Moe. I hate the public so much. If only they'd elect me... I'd make 'em pay. Oh Moe, how do I make 'em like me? Ah, gee, you're kinda all over the place there, Homer. You need to focus here. You gotta think hard and come up with a slogan that appeals to all the lazy slobs out there. Can't someone else do it? ""Can't someone else do it?"" That's perfect! It is? Yeah. Now get out there and spread that message to the people! Woo hoo! Whoa, whoa, hey, you didn't pay for the beer. Can't someone else do it? / Very good. Seriously, gimme the money. Fellow citizens! How would you rate the trash service in this town? I would deem it excellent. Uh, okay, it's excellent. But aren't you tired of waking up early and dragging the garbage to the curb? Oh man, you got that right. / Yeah. / I guess so. / It's so annoying in the morning/ Yes. / Uh-huh. Aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty Kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket? I'll say. Well then... Well then, can't someone else do it? Hey, yeah! And can't someone else scoop out that nasty kitty litter? Yeah! / Someone else! / Someone else! / Yeah! Well, Ray Patterson thinks you should do it! Animals are crapping in our houses, and we're picking it up. Did we lose a war? That's not America. That's not even Mexico. Don't you deserve better than the best? Yeah! Who should handle all your dirty jobs? Someone else! Someone else! Someone else! I'm sorry my opponent didn't think enough of you to show up for this debate. I'm sure he had more important things to do. Sorry I'm late, everyone. Somebody tampered with my brakes. Well, then you shoulda been early. Ha. He - he gotcha there, Ray. Oh, c'mon, people. This man has promised round the clock trash pick-up. That's impossible! Not if we hire more men. And my men will do all your messy jobs. They'll wash your car, scrub your shower, air out your stinkables... I can't believe what I'm hearing! Well, then you'd better turn up your hearing aid, Pops. ""Pops?"" I'm only two years older than you! Do we want old man Patterson here with his finger on the button? What button? What the hell are you talkin' about?! What-what-what. What button? Where am I? Who took my false teeth? All right, fine. If you want an experienced public servant, vote for me. But if you wanna believe a bunch of crazy promises about garbage men cleaning your gutters and waxing your car -- then by all means, vote for this sleazy lunatic. Woo hoo! Aren't you gonna buy it, Dad? Fifty cents? Not likely. Hey, Ray. Cleanin' out the old office, eh? If I hadn't already packed my letter opener, I'd give you such a stabbing... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Ray. Are we gonna let politics get in the way of our friendship? Friendship? You told people I lure children into my gingerbread house. Yeah, that was just a lie. Simpson, the American people have never tolerated incompetence in their public officials. You are going to crash and burn, my fat-headed friend. See? We're still friends. C'mon, give us a cuddle. Jean-Paul, how are the new uniforms? Do they match the suede boots? Beautiful. Did you get the new trucks? Are they amphibious? Well, there's only one way to find out. We can always buy more. Wow, Dad, you're really working hard. Yes, I gotta work hard, honey. Daddy made a lot of crazy promises. I'm really proud of you, Homie, but can the garbage man really do all the things you said? Oh, the garbage man can, Marge. The garbage man can. WHO CAN TAKE YOUR TRASH OUT? / STOMP IT DOWN FOR YOU? / SHAKE THE PLASTIC BAG AND DO THE TWISTY-THINGY TOO? / THE GARBAGE MAN... OH, THE GARBAGE MAN CAN. THE GARBAGE MAN CAN / AND HE DOES IT WITH A SMILE / AND NEVER JUDGES YOU. WHO CAN TAKE THIS DIAPER? I DON'T MIND AT ALL. WHO CAN CLEAN ME UP / BEFORE THE BIG POLICEMAN'S BALL? / THE GARBAGE MAN? YES THE GARBAGE MAN CAN. THE SANITATION FOLKS / ARE JOLLY FRIENDLY BLOKES / COURTEOUS AND EASYGOING. THEY MOP UP WHEN YOU'RE OVERFLOWING... AND TELL YOU WHEN YOUR ARSE IS SHOWING. WHO CAN? WHO CAN? WHO CAN? WHO CAN? THE GARBAGE MAN CAN 'CAUSE HE'S HOMER SIMPSON, MAN HE CLEANS THE WORLD FOR YOU! Simpson, you idiot, you spent your entire year's budget in a month. Your department's broke. Oh no! Wait, I think I've got the perfect solution. You better, because those garbage men won't work for free. Patterson was right. I'm crashing and burning... crashing and burning... How could you spend four point six million dollars in a month? They let me sign checks with a stamp, Marge. A stamp! You know Dad, there's a lesson in all this. Many cities have problems with garbage disposal, and it's time we realized you can't just... Wait, shutup... I just thought of something! 'Mornin', boys. Where's our paychecks, ya bum? My men ain't workin' another minute till we get paid. Will cash be okay? Will it! Did I hear a briefcase opening? Okay, before I show ya, who wants to guess how I got the money? Dealing drugs? Drugs. I'll have to say drugs, too. Close, but you're way off. Look at that beautiful garbage! Other cities don't want it, so they pay me to dump it in this old abandoned mine. That's awful! I almost wish it were drugs. Some of it is. Good God, Homer! You're turning our wonderful little town into America's trash-hole. Marge... ix-nay on the ash-hole-tray. But Dad, you can't cram garbage under Springfield forever. Sure I can, Honey-kitten. I don't know how you did it, Homer, but you certainly solved that budget crisis. What the hell is that? Uh, nothin'. Now, uh, you were saying how great I was...? What's this? Melon rinds? Panty hose? A term paper from Texas Tech? Simpson, do you know anything about... Dear Lord, please take Mr. Bunny up to heaven. Hey Brandine, I think I done busted my stinkbone! And all those opposed to horse-whipping Homer Simpson? Nay! And now, all in favor of reinstating Ray Patterson! Oh gosh, you know, I'm not much on speeches, but it's so gratifying to leave you wallowing in the mess you've made. You're screwed. Thank-you, bye. He's right. He ain't much on speeches. Now, people, we are far from screwed. The time for panic has come. We must move forward, and turn to the town's all-purpose contingency plan. You mean plan B?! Yes, B. I can't believe it's come to this. Come to what? Moving the whole town five miles down the road! It's crazy! Yeah, it's somethin', all right. So we transplant the town. We're just gonna trash the new Springfield, too. Yeah, but whaddaya gonna do? If you need me, I'll be at Moe's. Hi Moe. Hey-ya, Homer. Do yourself a favor. Don't turn around. I told ya not to turn around. Look, guys. I got a Springfield spoon for my spoon collection. Okay, here we go. How many spoons have you got now, Adam? Nine. If I didn't have my spoons, I'd go insane. Can I see it? My spoon!
