309,313,"Does anyone else want to know why that sign is so funny? No. C'mon, we're gonna be late to the blooming of the Sumatran Century Flower. How come Lisa always gets to pick the family activities? Because I know every time you say ""pick a number from one to ten,"" it's always seven. That's because there were seven apostles. No, there were twelve. Boy, that's a big staff. And still he wasn't that funny. The Venus Flytrap is a carnivorous plant which uses bait to lure unsuspecting prey into its digestive tract... Stupid prey. They never suspect anything. Ooo, a hotdog! Flower power my ass. That's odd. It's eleven fifteen in the morning and the bar is empty. I'm live at Springfield Botanical Gardens, where we're minutes away from the blossoming of the Sumatran Century Flower, which only occurs once every hundred years. Hey, those are my customers-slash-only friends! Where are they getting their beer? A cooler! I've been replaced by a cooler! And who could blame 'em? Eh, no point in mopin' around. I might as well join 'em and have a jolly old time. Better set the alarm. Here I am, one of the crowd. I'm comfortable I'm calm. If anybody looks at me I got a hypodermic full of bleach. Um, people, we are officially over capacity. We've got to kick one person out. Someone who's alone, already bitter, someone whose feelings have been trampled on so many times one more won't make any... Oh, Moe! Yeah, that's me all right. Sorry, Moe. You can either walk out with dignity, or I can push you down this muddy hill. I'd prefer that you push me. Seein' how I'm desperate for any human contact. All right. Thanks a lot. The flower's starting to open! Everyone, flare your nostrils in olfactory anticipation! Man, the plant cut one! Bart, plants don't-- wheww! ¡Ay yai yai! ¡Que flora malodorosa! Argh, that smells worse than James Coco's ski boots! Oh yeah. That's mildly better. Listen to those lucky people, enjoying that pretty flower. I got nothin' -- just this can. At least there's someone worse off than me. So long, suckers! Well, at least we're outside instead of sittin' home watchin' TV. I hear that. Hey, that car has a TV in it! We now return to ""The Beverly Hillbillies Down Under"". Hey, Granny! I'm gonna be a professional didgeridoo player. Well, now it's a didgeri-don't! Oh, Granny... Can you put on the baseball game? My kids are watching a movie! C'mon, help a brother out. Why don't you call my secretary and make an appointment, ""brother""? A dream deferred is a dream denied! Dad, the traffic's moving. Woo-hoo! Pedal to the metal! My baby! Your baby! NOOOOOOOOOO! Well, this is it. The last call for Moe. God. God, God... Whaaa--? Moe! Thank God you saved my baby... That hideous man is a hero! Heh. Life don't seem so hard no more. Look, Maggie's in the paper with Moe. How cute. Look at those pants. They're standing up with no one in them. Hey, I was in the neighborhood and uh, thought I'd, y'know, check in on Maggie. Moe, I'm glad you're here! I wanted to thank you so much for saving my baby, so I knitted you a nice warm sweater. Aw, look at that. That's so soft and thoughtful and what's the gag? Is it full of chiggers? No, no all that's in there is love and gratitude. Aw jeez, there's somethin' in my eye. Ah, it's just glass. So, how's the little tyke doin'? Ain't she adorable. Oh my God, I'm late for work. How you got in my carpool I'll never know. The Swedish are coming! The Swedish are coming! Oh, Lord. Why do they keep changing his medication? Look at me, I'm Speedy Alka Seltzer! Whoa! Moe, I gotta handle this. Can you keep an eye on Maggie? Me? Yeah, uh... yeah, sure, i-i-if you don't think I'd spook her or nothin'. No, you'll be fine. I'll be right back. I got lindenberries! So, how's it goin'? Huh. Hey, you-you wanna see me uh, dislocate my arm? Take a look at this. It was years before I could do this without faintin'. Still hurts. Grampa, stop! Sayonara, Tojo! LA LA LA LA LA... LA LA LA LA LA! Oh, Lord. Hey, Mag. Raggedy Andy over there has been giving you the button-eye. I'll get rid of him. All right, come on. Out you go. Hmp, I finally caught up with Grampa. I found him crying in the cemetery. Thanks for taking care of Maggie. Oh, no problem. You know, it-it gave me kind of a good warm feelin'. Like when you get drunk and fall asleep in the snow. Yeah, well I better go. Aw, there, there Mags. I'll be back sometime. Wow, she really likes you. Maybe the next time I need a sitter, and you're not busy... I-I'd love to. Uh, uh let me check my schedule. Well, I was gonna erase those two apostrophes and replace 'em with 'g's, but that's about it. So, you know, call anytime. Why is she crying? Oh, that's right. I still got her nose. Here ya go, ya little idiot. Ball pit, that's nice. One, two, three colors -- you got 'em all. Aw! What a face! She looks just like you! You calling her repellant? No, I was just... 'Cause you ain't exactly Karen Allen yourself, you know. You idiot, I was trying to pick you up. Oh, great. Uh, well why don't you play with the baby while I go rent a room? Boy, that's one for the Christmas letter. What a nut. Way to go, Mom. Homemade dim sum, with eight kinds of dipping sauce! This is the best Year of the Rat ever! Well, I have so much free time now that Moe's our babysitter. Yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. She--hey wait, that's supposed to be me! You could be my father figure. No way! I'm not gettin' my fingerprints on that train wreck. But if I lose Maggie, I'm oh-for-three. I've gotta get her back. I can help you. I said, pipe down, Amtrak. Maggie, look what's in your ear, a penny. Okay, we won't tell no one about that. Now let's see, what else can we do? We can't tickle Elmo no more. Coochie, coochie coo. No means no for Elmo! Ow. And this Slinky... these things are fun for about two seconds. Yeah, that's it, slink away. Hm. ""Alice in Wonderland,"" huh? This must be a take-off on that ""Alice in Underpants"" movie I saw. It's so nice to be with someone who can't understand the horrible things I say. White rabbit... chicks poppin' mushrooms... this is like the Playboy Mansion. Maybe I can think of a story uh, more suitable for a baby. Ooh, I got one: it starts out with a beautiful wedding. But the father of the bride was nowhere to be seen. He was granting favors to all of his bestest buddies. I think we could scare that movie producer by puttin' a horse's blanket in his bed. Imagine waking up and seeing you got the wrong kinda blanket. How about a horse's head? Oh, you see here. That's why you're the Godfather. And the Godfather's playing with his grandson, see. So he sticks an orange in his mouth, like this. Okay. And now, it's intermission. Gimme a break, will ya? It's a friggin' saga. Don Bardzini gets whacked. Tessio, Ohh... you won't see him no more. Moe Greene: Bam! He gets it right in the eye. And Michael is now the new Godfather. And he shuts the door on Annie Hall. Oh, no, no baby. No, no... Okay, Part Two. Little Anthony's having his first communion at Lake Tahoe. Meanwhile Michael can't get a gaming license. But Senator Geary's got one weakness: call girls... That's right. This party's boring. Everything here is for babies. I'm helping Daddy! Lisa, it says one year and up. Oh, there she is, the birthday girl. Oh, your mommy tied a bow for you, huh. I'd better retie it -- the way you like it. I know it don't seem like it matters, but you know, she hates lookin' like crap. Hey, hey, hey, Osh Kosh B'Gosh. She don't want what you're shovelin'. Mr. Moe. My son was only playing next to this girl who is not your daughter. Yeah, sure he was, Nahasapasa-Imraisin'apervert. Back off, Moe. Maggie wants to be with me. This is how we play. THE SQUIRMY WORMY SPIDER / SQUIRTS OUT OF DADDY'S HANDS... ... DADDY FEELS REJECTED / HE'S GONNA EAT SOME CAKE. Oh, a rattle! Thank you, Selma. Yeah, great present, Selma. Nice of you to break a five. Eh, get a neck, Frankenstein. Hey, open my present! Open my present! It's Uncle Moe's Play Tavern, with classic drunk Barney. Look, even the little toilet is broken. I don't know if toy drunkards are an appropriate gift for a baby. Sure they are. They even talk. Look! I peed my pants. I recorded that for private use! Your turn. No, it's your turn. I got it. It's okay! Moe?! What are you doing here? Well, Maggie was crying. I heard her on my baby monitor. You have your own baby monitor in our child's room? I had to. It's so weird watching the video and not getting any sound. That's it, Moe. This is just too weird. You are not allowed to see Maggie anymore. Well, can I at least give her this Moe-bile? Eh? Eh? Get your own family, Moe. Hey, you never cared about Maggie 'til I started paying attention to her. Last night at the bar you called her ""Raquel."" Get out! Is that uh, ""get out"" like leave, or ""get out"" as in: ""Get out. You banged Bridget Fonda?"" Get out! Get out, that's-- okay. Maybe I can catch a late show of ""Alice In Underpants."" Or maybe ""Put 'em on the Looking Glass."" Boy, I'm like a mess here. I feel so lonely without that kid. You still got us, Moe. You guys mind if I uh... kiss your tummies? Here comes the airplane. All gone. TOYS AND CAKES AND PETS AND BROTHERHOOD... It's our song. Now, there'll be no more trouble from that meddlesome bartender. Yeah. You know, looking at this sweet precious child makes me want to have one of our own. Tonight I want you boys to take out the Castellaneta family. Uh, I don't know, boss. My passion for whacking is waning. Perhaps this will cheer you up. Oh, that's better. I could whack my own mother now. I'm glad you brought that up. Kill my mother?! She makes such good pasta sauce. It comes from a can. She's a corpse. What are you screaming about? Did you discover my snake farm? 'Cause I can explain. I'm going to farm and sell snakes. Maggie's gone! It must have been Moe! He's got your kid, but don't worry. Everything is gonna be okay. Scum, Freezebag! I mean, freeze, scumbag! You can't write stuff like that. See that's why sitcoms are dying. Chief, it's just a ham. Thank goodness. Well boys, looks like we've solved the case of the missing ham. Let's go. No! We have to find my baby! Maggie's missing? You gotta let me help find her, please! We have a special bond. Even greater than her bond with the duck-shaped washcloth. Okay, you can help us. Well, I think we know when we're not needed. You guys are the world's worst cops. No, now that I'm off duty, I'm the world's worst soccer coach. Well, it looks like Maggie crawled through these bushes, spit up over here, and crashed her tricycle into the wall. Uh, no, that was me. Here's a clue: a discarded orange wedge! Orange wedge? Marge, do mobsters ever congregate outside your house? All the time. Sometimes I bring them lemonade. Listen, I think we might have to make a trip to Little Italy. I'll get our little passports. So you see, you have no choice but to sell out to me. Oops! Clumsy me. I will consider your proposal in the restroom as I tidy up. Boys? Oops! Clumsy us. We must all go to the restroom, too. Those fellows should really consider sippy cups. Look, Boss. It's a baby! Ooh, a bambino. Or is it bambina? I no speak any language so good. We have considered your proposal...and our answer is no. Boss, they hid guns in the men's room! Clumsy me, I dropped my fork. Boys, help me pick it up. Now, hold on here. I'm President of the Italian American Anti-Defamation League. And this really burns my cannoli! Maggie's right in the middle of that Italian-American-Mexican standoff! Oh my God, I've gotta save her! No. You've got a family. I'm the guy with nothin' and no one. No, no, don't try to stop me. We're not. Your sleeve got caught on that tree. Here, let me unhook ya. Off you go. Yeah, thanks. Gee, uh, this is the second-most guns ever pointed at me. You know, a couple weeks ago I wouldn't have minded if you shot me. But all that's changed, because of this little girl here. Look at her. Ain't she a doll? I ain't cried like this since I paid to see Godfather Three. Here's your baby back. Thanks, Moe. I'm sorry we thought you were a baby-napper. Or worse, am I right? Hey, hey, hey, the important thing is, little Maggie is safe. Well, I gotta get home. There might be a telemarketer calling or something. I'll see you when you're old enough to drink, okay, Magpie. Oh great, I'm caught on another tree. Lousy shirt-grabbin', sap-drippin'... Whaaa?! I don't think Maggie wants you out of her life, Moe. Moe, I was just thinking, if Maggie and I were in the neighborhood, maybe we could drop by and have a playdate with you... and your ham. We'd like that, Homer.","Carl Carlson, Fat Tony, Eddie, Chief Wiggum, Jethro, Bumblebee Man, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Godfather, Younger Mobster, Kent Brockman, Homer Simpson, Elves, Grampa Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Mobster, Don Castellaneta, C.
