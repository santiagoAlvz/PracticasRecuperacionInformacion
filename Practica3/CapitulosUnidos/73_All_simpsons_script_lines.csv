Let's all congratulate... Nelson!!! Thanks, Dad! Told ya! Come on, Bart! We're gonna go sneak into an R-rated movie. It's called ""Barton Fink!"" No thanks, I told my Dad I'd wait for him. Bar-ton Fink! Bar-ton Fink! Barton Fink! Homer, we're going to my sisters'! Remember, pick up Bart! I'm on my way! What'd ya say, Marge? That could be Dad... station wagon... luggage rack... I AM WOMAN HEAR ME ROAR / IN NUMBERS TOO BIG TO IGNORE / AND I KNOW TOO MUCH TO GO BACK TO TODAY Dad, where are you? Tonight, on ""Wings..."" Aah, who cares? This isn't funny. Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Pick up Bart! Pick up Bart! Trab pu kcip. Trab pu kcip. What have we told you about writing on the walls? Go to your room. After sixteen glorious seasons, the Green Bay faithful bid farewell to Bryan Bartlett Starr. Hmm, I keep thinking I'm forgetting something. Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart Bart! Bart Bart Bart! Bart! I can't think with all this noise! What am I supposed to do? Pick up Bart! Pick up Bart! Pigabar? What the hell is pigabar? Bart?... Bart! Whyyyyy?!... Howwwww?!... Whennnn?!... Whichhh?... Bart! Dad, hide your shame! Hey Homie, I can see your doodle! Shut up, Flanders. Hey, boy. How was soccer practice? Hey, Bart, son. Here's my way of saying, ""I'm sorry."" I know you're mad at me right now, and I'm kinda mad too... I mean, we could sit here and try to figure out ""who forgot to pick up who"" till the cows come home. But let's just say we're both wrong and that'll be that. Now how about a hug? Hello, New York! When Lorne asked me to host this show, I said Lorne, why me? I mean, I did just star in my first movie with Marvin Hagler and Tovah Borgnine. Yeah! Anyway. We got a great show for you. Well actually, the last half hour is a real garbage dump. Uh... we'll be right back. I miss Joe Piscopo. Lost your dad? Uh-huh. He's not coming back, is he? He might. No, he's not. But at Bigger Brothers we can help. Hello, Bigger Brothers? My name is Bart Simpson and I don't have a father. And now, it's time for another episode of the Big Ear Family! Honey, I'm home! Ooh, I got wax in my ears. Better clean `em. Eh? Eh? This goes on for 12 more minutes. So the last time you saw your father was six years ago. Yeah... he left me out on the curb for the ashman. What a revoltin' development. You brave little soldier. I've been saving someone special for a case like yours. Bart Simpson? Yo! I'm Tom. Let's ride. Bart's dad has really pulled himself together. Bart's not mad at me. He called you a bad father. Marge, when kids these days say bad, they mean good. And to shake your booty means to wiggle one's butt. Permit me to demonstrate. No, I just think you should talk to Bart about-- Good Lord! Homer, do you have an explanation for this bill? It's that record club. The first nine were only a penny. Then they jacked up the price! It's not fair, it's not fair I tells ya. No, no. Someone made three hundred dollars worth of phone calls to something called ""The Corey hotline."" Wasn't me. Lisa. Why didn't you ask our permission, Lisa? I did. Dad, can I... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Aw honey, I know what you're going through. When I was a girl I had a crush on Bobby Sherman. The point is, I want you to stop making these calls. All right, Mom. I promise you will never be billed for another call. Bobby Sherman... Your dad ever take you to baseball games? Nah, his game was blackjack. He bet our life savings on a single hand. Nineteen. Hit me. Twenty. Hit me. Twenty-one. Hit me. Twenty-two. If I ever meet your dad . The start of the game will be delayed so we can introduce the recruiter for the Springfield Communist Party. BOO! Eh, this is better than dart day. Now let those ear drops sit for 20 minutes. If you get bored, here's a M*A*S*H coloring book. Here's a good one. ""Hawkeye's antics irritate the other surgeons."" Hi, you've reached the Corey hotline. $4.95 a minute. Here are some words that rhyme with Corey: Glory. Story. Allegory. Montessori... Okay, Bart. Tomorrow we'll blast your quads. This meatball soup is delicious, Stimpy. That's not meatball soup. That's my collection of furballs in stomach acid. You idiot!! You're trying to kill me, man. Someday I want to be an F-14 pilot like my hero, Tom. He lent me this new weapon called a Neural Disrupter. He's not dead, is he Bart? Nah... But I wouldn't give him any homework for a while. Very good, Bart. Thank you. Oh, don't thank me. Thank an unprece-dented eight-year military build-up. Hm. Milhouse, you're next. Uhhh... I have a horsie. Wuss! Lisa, I'm glad you came. I know you young-uns think we old timers aren't any fun. But we'll show 'em. We'll show `em all! Heh, heh, heh, heh. Hi, this is Corey. I hope you and I can get married some day. Hey, boy! Where you going? Father-son picnic. Have a good time! Wait a minute. Lisa, I know I can trust you to inventory this Glee Club peanut brittle. Yes, Principal Skinner. Now, I've gotta slash 40 percent out of the budget. Science... Ah, music and art. What in blazes?! Good Lord... That's a 900 number! Let's see what's in the newspaper today... Hmmm... ""Canada Stalls On Trade Pact""... Hey, look at that forest fire down there. Yeah. Great. What's the matter? Well... I've been thinking. You've been really great to me... but there's probably some other kid who needs you even more. Bart, I could kiss you, if the Bigger Brothers hadn't made me sign a form promising I wouldn't. No one needs me more than a child with your tragic upbringing. Now, let's set down at that Frogurt stand. So that's it! Hello, son. Where have you been? Playing with Milhouse. No, you haven't! You've been out gallivanting around with that floozy of a bigger brother of yours! Haven't you, haven't you. Look at me. Dad, it just kinda happened. You're taking this too hard. How would you like me to take it? ""Go ahead, Bart, have your fun, I'll be waiting for you?"" I'm sorry, I can't do it. Well, what are you going to do? Ho, ho, you'll see. And what are your reasons for wanting a little brother? Don't say revenge. Don't say revenge. Uh... Revenge. That's it, I'm getting outta here. Welcome aboard, Mr. Simpson! Any of these boys would be thrilled to have a bigger brother like you. Ugly... wiener... crater face... Soo-ee! Soo-ee!... Ehhh, maybe this was a mistake. Do you have a bigger brother for me yet? Okay. I'll be back in an hour. I'll take him! Do you have him in blonde? Lisa, the only way you'll lick this is one day at a time. If you can make it till midnight without calling the Corey line, you'll know you've beaten it forever. Midnight? Listen to your mother, Lisa. I owe everything I have to my mother's watchful eye... and swift hand. Oh, there's mother now. Watching me. What's that, mother? They have a right to be here. It's school business. I... Mother, that sailor suit doesn't fit anymore! I think we should go. Uh - huh. Just like Oscar the Grouch. Pepi! Poppa Homer! Son, your life is gonna get better -- starting now. Your son Bart sounds very bad. Oh, he is. Son, I just want you to know I love you very much. Shaddap! Mmm... grapefruit. I just press this button and the door opens like magic. Why does it stop there? Because it's a stupid piece of junk! Well, I'd better get you home. What's the matter? I've spent every night of my life in the city. I have never seen the stars. Tell me more! I want to know all the constellations! Well, there's... Jerry, the cowboy. And that big dipper-looking thing is Alan... the cowboy. Oh, Poppa Homer, you are so learned. ""Learned,"" son, it's pronounced ""learned."" I love you, Poppa Homer. I love you too, Pepsi. Pepi. Pepi. MUST YOU BE FOREVER DIALING THAT PHONE?!!! Excuse me. Oh, c'mon! Hurry! Lisa? Aw, Lisa. You tried your best. At the tone, the time will be: Twelve midnight. I made it! Hey, Homer, have you seen my skateboard? I gave it to Pepi. Who the hell is Pepi? He's my little brother. That's right -- you're not the only one who can abuse a non-profit organization. Who needs you? Tom's a better father than you ever were. Come on, Bart. We had our fun. Remember when I used to push you on the swing? I was faking it. Liar! Oh yeah? Remember this? ""Higher, Dad, higher!... Whee, whee... Push harder, Dad!..."" Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! You know, the whale is not really a fish. They're mammals like you and me. Is that true? No. Come 'n' get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Come `n get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Stupid dolphin. Hey! He's got my hotdog! Uh-oh. Better not let him see me. What the? Oh... it's you. So, you're looking well. Come on, Bart. You know better than to talk to strangers. For your information, I'm his father! His father? The drunk and gambler? That's right. And who might you be? There you go, fellas. Look! There's another disadvantaged boy. Where? There's a couple of guys fighting at the Aquarium, Chief. They still sell those frozen bananas? I think so. Let's roll. This just in, a fist fight is in progress in downtown Springfield. Early reports indicate -- and these are very preliminary -- that one of the fighters is a giant lizard. Do we have a source on this? Uh-huh. A bunch of drunken frat boys? All right. I could use some names. I.P. Freely? Uh... Homer? Oh. Right. This is even more painful than it looks. This is all my fault, Dad. I didn't want you to get hurt. Now I need to find another little brother. And I need to find another big brother. My car's gonna feel so empty on the ride home. And me, I have no ride at all. I already bought a giant ham for dinner. It's gonna go to waste. Don't talk about food. I'm so hungry. Well, goodbye. Wait! I've got an idea! An idea? Huh? Another beer, Dad? Thanks, son. Dad, remember when Tom had you in that headlock and you screamed, ""I'm a hemophiliac"" and when he let you go you kicked him in the back? Yeah? Will you teach me how to do that? Sure, boy. First, you gotta shriek lika a woman, and keep sobbing till he turns away in disgust. That's when it's time to kick some back. And then when he's lying on the ground... Yeah. Kick him in the ribs... Yeah. Step on his neck, and run like hell.","Santa's Little Helper, Homer's Brain, Chief Wiggum, Lou, Milhouse Van Houten, Nun, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Fans, Boys, Homer's Bloody Skull, Kent Brockman, Crowd, Cat, Homer Simpson, TOM, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Woman, Grampa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, Small Man, Krusty the Clown, Agency Worker, Dealer, Kirk Van Houten, TV Announcer, Ned Flanders, Announcer, Sketch Announcer, Chihuahua, Coach, Lewis Clark, Pepi, Bart Simpson, Boy, Edna Krabappel-Flanders, Corey, Voice On Phone",8.1,1176.0,14,1993-02-04,1993,4,Brother from the Same Planet,23.8,59040.0
