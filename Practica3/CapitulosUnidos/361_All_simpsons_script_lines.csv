357,361,"I'm so glad we came to Paradise Pier. Ever since I was a little girl, I've wanted to ride that Ferris Wheel! They're tearing down the pier! But what will junkies do drugs under? They'll bounce back, son. They're a strong people. Ooh! Ooh! I wanna ride the bumper cars! Whoa, Sir, we're dismantling this ride. It's not safe. I call the red one! Homie, no! It's not street legal! Don't worry, ma'am. He's not connected to the power supply, so he can't go far. Gulp. Hey, hey, hey! Oh, he's got us in a corner. I hate this ride! Mom, can we buy a magnesium-vapor soak tub? For the last time, no! But how will I increase my vitality? Uh, he's just faking loss of vitality, Reverend. Uh-hmm. I believe you. A strongman? Are you for sale? 'Cause I need someone to throw a birdbath at my neighbor. Robusto is not for sale! But would you like to buy my last dumbbell? Hmmm. I suppose I could use a little toning. I'll give you five dollars for it. Sold. A bicycle built for two! And I could be one of those two! Homie, if I buy a bicycle built for two, will you ride with me? Marge, I don't hate your mother. I just won't be sad when she dies. Forty-seven, forty-eight... I was asking for something. Yeah, sure. Whatever you want. Ninety-five, ninety-six, thirteen, sixty-four, banana... I'll take it! I can't believe I own a tandem bike! You want me to ride a whatsickle built for who? Our tandem bicycle! When I bought it, you said you'd ride with me. But I'm watching television. A lot of people worked hard on this show! I was really looking forward to it. Bart, how'd you like to go on a tandem bike ride with your mom? Mom, please. I'm playing a video game. Ooh -- small hill. Pedal, pedal, pedal! Now, enjoy scenery. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy! Maggie, would you like to ride with me? Bart, why is your mom riding a two-person bike by herself? Haw haw! She's lonely. Moms don't get lonely. Three hundred and six, three hundred and seven... Hey Mom! Wanna go for a ride? I'd love to! I'll be right... wait... Are you sure you're not just trying to get me to make pizza for breakfast? Woo hoo! Pizza for breakfast! Mom, I mean it. I wanna ride with you. Awww. I'll be right down. Hello, Domino's? What do you mean, you're not open? No, you call me back during business hours! I'll show you who's a recorded message! Puddle! I'm glad I could share in their fun. WELL, I HEARD NEIL YOUNG SING ABOUT HER... I HEARD OL' NEIL PUT HER DOWN. In the name of the fa... hey! WELL, I HOPE NEIL YOUNG WILL REMEMBER... THIS SOUTHERN MAN DON'T NEED HIM 'ROUND, ANYHOW! Mom, who's Neil Young? He was a singer in the sixties, like The Archies and The Banana Splits. I'm a little worried. This part of the county is unincorporated. Just to be safe I'm going to dial ""nine-one"" on my cell phone. A tea house?! Wanna go inside? I'unno. Think they have videogames? No. Batting cage? No. Rock climbing wall? No. Robot musical revue? No. Zumanity by Cirque de Soleil? No. Bathroom? Yes. Well, that's really what I need the most. Let's go. Wow, Mom, I love tea! You haven't had any tea. Yeah, well I still love this place. Good afternoon, madam. Who's your handsome gentleman friend? Oh, you. Don't do that... that hurts. Careful, careful. Hey, what's the big idea of getting trapped under that thing? Uh, long story. Uh, we were trying to impress some girls -- and things kinda got away from us. Just for the record, I regret nothin'. Homer, how'd your right arm get so strong? Just liftin' this dumbbell. Forty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine... fifty thousand! I'm pretty happy with this baby, now it's lefty's turn. Oh no you don't! I just got an idea. Wha? Hey, you... Mom, all we have is carrot sticks and fresh fruit. Well, we could bike to the tea shop and have some cake. All right! Pedal to the kettle! Hey, Bart! They're testing me for lazy eye! Wanna come with? Sorry, Milhouse, I've got plans. Okay. I'll bring you back an eye care pamphlet. Okay, here comes our victim. Let's bash his head in. Hey Moe, I thought you were just gonna hustle him. Oh, right. I was thinking of another thing I got goin'. Gimme a bottle of bourbon! I got a new liver, and I'm breakin' it in. Excuse me, Mr. Bartender sir, may I have a sugar-free ginger ale? And uh, make it flat -- the bubbles burn my buds. Goldarnit, son! What the Hell kinda sissy are you? Hey, are you callin' my life-partner a sissy? 'Cause a hundred bucks says he could whup you in arm wrestling. A ""Texas penny"" it is. Yee-ha! Gol-dangit -- I've been played like a dimwit's kazoo! Yes! Homer, we make a dynamite team, huh? With your arm, and my head-gunk, we're goin' right to the top! Whoa. This is one Texan who don't like when he's made out to be a fool. Well, uh... what do you like? I dunno... a good book... long walk on the beach... So, we uh, we kinda evened things up here? Not yet. I wanna play some Frisbee. You know, honey, I've really started to look forward to our little bike rides. Me too, Mother. Ooh, such respect! You could grow up to be a doorman! ""Loyal customers, we have been forced to close forever. It seems our cakes were filled with rat droppings. It's not that we're bad people, we just weren't paying close attention. Ta-taa!"" What'd it say? Uh... she died. Well, Bart, I guess that's it. We'll have to go back to our separate things. Hey, we could have tea in my treehouse. You... invited me... to your treehouse? Wow -- that's like Bruce Wayne letting his mother into the Bat-club. So... is that standing water? Yeah. You know, that puddle started life as a bowl of cereal. I think I might be able to turn this treehouse into a teahouse. Mom, this is great! It makes our real house look like a pile of crap. And I threw out all your old comics! Mom! Just kidding. Today's mom knows to seal 'em in Mylar so you can never read them again. Never ever again. Where are you two going? I'm joining the professional arm-wrestling circuit! Uh-huh. And how will this affect your job at the power plant? Negatively, I assume. Oh, well, we're off to buy a new tea set. Have fun! Gee, she didn't seem angry, or anything. Maybe she doesn't care anymore! Forget about it, Homer. She's dead to you now. Okay. Now, if we get bored on the bus, I got a book of brain teasers here. Let's see... oh, ""Brothers and sisters have I none, but this man's father is my father's son."" Huh. Screw you, you stupid thing! ""He is my son!"" That blows! I can't wait to use our new Krusty the Clown tea service! Me neither. Oh my God! I took the salesman's pen. I'll be right back. Green Tea? What's that? Mr. T's Irish brother? Earl Grey? I'd rather have Linda Gray. Is she still alive? What's next?... What the hell, I'm not doing that one. Hey Simpson! What are you gonna do with that teapot? Gay out? I'll answer for you: yes. What? Um... uh... I just shoplifted this bad boy. Housewares never knew what hit 'em. Why didn't you steal something cool? Uh... because I'm gonna bring it back to the store for store credit. How you gonna get credit without a gift receipt, ass? Um, well... We've seen you hanging out with your mom, Simpson. Word on the street is... you're a mama's boy. Hey, there is no way that Bart Simpson is a mama's boy. Oh, Ba-art! Aren't they jazzy? They match the new curtains we hung in your treehouse! Here, try yours on. I got you a child's large because your tummy's getting kind of bloopy from all the cakes we've been having. Somebody here likes princess cakes. Princess cake? Bart, you just got yourself a nickname for life. Hey Princess Cake! Want some princess cake? Bart, are you having a fight with your boyfriends? Shut up! I don't want your stupid sweatshirt! Or your tea set! Smashing voids my warranty! Have a good life! Mom, I only hung out with you because I felt sorry for you! That was weird. Will you teach us how to smoke? No! I can't believe she suckered me into being a mama's boy. I've got to make this place mine again. It's gonna take me weeks to get the booger wall back up. Bart? You're not allowed in here! Can't you read the sign? You mean this? Ay carumba! I'm worried about Mom. She's been sitting there just petting the dog for two hours. Hey, Mom. Hello, Bart. Just so you know, I sold our bike. Faster! Faster! But we had so much fun on that bike! Mom, I really did like hanging out with you. You know... there's a karaoke night at school tomorrow. Some of the little kids are bringing their parents. Do you wanna go? Really? Could we do a duet? Sure... why not? It'll be fun. It's still happening! I can't believe Marge hasn't called me. Maybe I should go home. Oh, Marge called you. She said... uh... that she loves you and she hopes you break the guy's arm so hard that it pokes through his skin. Did she say anything else? Yeah. She said to shut up, and stop asking questions and listen to Moe. Oh Marge, I love her so much. Now Homer, you gotta keep your head in the game, all right? Your first opponent is Lefty ""The Righty"" Leftwright. He looks tough. Yeah, he only lost once: in his fight against illiteracy. I can relate. I've fought that foe and lost many times. Marge isn't home. Homer, focus! Moe, I'm starting to have grave doubts about this thing I barely liked in the first place. C'mon, Homer! We can make it all the way to the quarter-finals for the Eastern Division, Class B, over thirty-five, Amateur Grouping! Sorry, Moe. The place for my arm is around my wife. Homer, come back! You've got my teeth-whitening system in your suitcase! Let's see... what would be a good duet? Hmm... ""Just The Two Of Us""... ""You And Me Against The World""... ""Ebony And Ivory""... ""Ebony and Ivory""? I'm afraid that song's taken! By me and my mother. You know, people say when we're on stage, it's more like ""Scary-oke."" Scary talented, I assume. I'm singing a song with Bart tonight. Capital! My mother and I have been performing together since I was in fourth grade, and it's really brought us closer. Seymour, where were you? A brightly colored car hurt my eyes. Don't worry, Mother. I have your eye balm in my man-purse right here. Good boy. You can push your crib into mommy's room tonight. It's not a crib, it's a cot! If it has rails, it's a crib! WHERE IS MY JOHN WAYNE / WHERE IS MY PRAIRIE SUN / WHERE IS MY HAPPY ENDING / WHERE HAVE ALL THE COWBOYS GONE? / DO DO / DO DO DO / DO DO DO / DO DO DO DO, DO You know, Mother, I wasn't sure about tonight. But seeing us dressed the same really feels right! Well, now I'm not so sure about the bells on the painter's pants. Are you kidding? I love my tinklies. Next up on the Springfield Elementary karaoke showcase is Skinner! And Mrs. Skinner! EBONY AND IVORY... LIVE TOGETHER IN PERFECT HARMONY... SIDE-BY-SIDE ON MY PIANO KEYBOARD / OH LORD, WHY DON'T WE... NOOOO! Stop the showcase! Mrs. Simpson, please... Hush up, Seymour. She's just saying what we're all thinking. Mother, what are you doing? Don't call me mother! My name is Mom! And my son is no mama's boy! Bart, you are a wild heck-raiser. And I don't want to see you turn into that. What, a wall? Mom, I thought this is what you wanted. Your job isn't to worry about me, it's to give me things to worry about. Hey losers, I'm gonna do to you what you did to these songs. Interpret them artistically? Die! Die! Die! Nooo! We were gonna sing ""My Sharona""! SWEET HOME ALABAMA / WHERE THE SKIES ARE SO BLUE SWEET HOME ALABAMA... LORD, I'M COMING HOME TO YOU / Alabama! Marge, spending time with you is more important to me than all the pie-eating contests in the world. I thought it was arm wrestling. I was in a pie-eating contest on the way home. Now let's go to bed. OOH, MY LITTLE PRETTY ONE, MY PRETTY ONE / WHEN YOU GONNA GIVE ME SOME TIME, SHARONA / OOH, YOU MAKE MY MOTOR RUN, MY MOTOR RUN / GOT IT COMIN' OFF O' THE LINE, SHARONA / NEVER GONNA STOP, GIVE IT UP, SUCH A DIRTY MIND / I ALWAYS GET IT UP FOR THE TOUCH OF THE YOUNGER KIND / MY, MY, MY, AYE-AYE, WHOA! / That song is a pop music footnote! I didn't say stop!
