473,480,"Who the hell are Cheech and Chong? Bart, Cheech and Chong were the Beavis and Butthead of their day! Who are Beavis and Butthead? I've failed as a parent. I swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy. To the media room! Open up. It's the police. Oh man, I gotta get rid of my grass! He's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily! Back then we'd play these albums again and again till they were filled with skips and clicks and pops. Which was about three times. These are comedy albums? The Noisy Minority... The Upside-Down Bubblegum Collective... The Regional Lampoon... The Plymouth Grok Experiment... Fro And Flo... Allan Sherman's Helter Shmelter... What are you guys doing up there? Hide the dope! We don't have any dope. Then what did I just smoke? Lou, I want you to confiscate these brownies. There's no drugs in these brownies. I said confiscate! Uh, also confiscate me a t-shirt, uh, triple-X-L. I thought you said double-X-L was a real wakeup call. That was for pants. Ladies and gentlemen: Krusty the Clown! Thank you. When they asked me to introduce Cheech and Chong, I said ""how much?"" And they said ""we don't pay for introductions,"" so I said ""then I don't need this crummy gig,"" and they said ""yes, you do,"" and I said... ladies and gentlemen, Cheech and Chong! Who is it? It's me, Dave, man. Open up, I got the stuff. I thought they'd do bits -- but their most famous bit?! Will you open up, I got the stuff with me. Ooo, he's gonna say ""Dave's not here!"" Dave's not here! Dave's not here! Dave's not here! Dave's not here! Dave's not here! Say the line, man! They already know the line. What's the surprise? What's the point? The point is they still give us a shoebox full of twenties to do this! Now say it! Dave's not... Dave's not gonna sell out anymore, man! I, I can't say it! What are you doing, man?! What am I doing?! What am I-- I'm experimenting, man! I'm growing as an artist, okay? That's not the Cheech and Chong brand. Brand? Brand? I'm a seventy-two year old man. I've eaten eggs every which way they cook 'em -- I can't play it safe anymore. Look, these people pay good money to see ""Dave's not here!"" You owe them ""Dave's not here!"" Well, how about this? Chong's not here! Man! Oh no! Chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases. Ay carumba! Homie, you know all the bits. Maybe you could help him! I can't do reefer comedy -- I'm drunk. Two different animals. Homer Simpson, that man's albums have given you decades of entertainment -- and seen you through some very square times. Help him! Dave's not here, man! No man, I'm Dave. D-A-V-E! Dave? That's right. Now open up the door. Dave's not here, man! You find this funny, sir? Just because it's too hip for you, Smithers... I'll give Dave your message. I don't find this funny at all. My time being wasted was not wasted! Hey man, you're alright! How'd you like to be the new Chong? Yes! Will I get to meet Dave? There is no Dave. How 'bout Don Johnson? It'd be easier to meet Dave. It is so cool for you to let me go on tour with Cheech. And remember, on the road, the only vice you can indulge in is gluttony. Save lust and rage for me and the kids. Sweetie, don't worry. I'm gonna come back so horny and angry... Awww. I can't believe I'm riding around in Cheech's van! The van made of weed! It's not made of weed. Oh. What's it made of? Hash? Shrooms? Lysergic acid diethylamide? No! The van is just made of van. Look, Homer, I really need you to be on your game, you know? A lot of our fans have gone through rehab, so they're much more critical. Don't worry, Cheech. I know all the classic bits of you and Chong. Don't say that name! Now, you drive -- I have to go black out his face on some t-shirts with a Magic Marker. Can we get high from the fumes? No! Okay, man, what I'm looking for in a new Cheech is someone who is, like, open-minded and adventurous. I haven't decided about the mustache yet, but you need your own suspenders. Snap, snap! Our friendship died with the first snap and you buried it with the second. You ever notice how your nose makes boogers? What's up with that? Uh... next! I can't pay the rent. You must pay the rent. I can't pay the rent. You must pay the rent. I'll pay the rent. My hero. Aw, who am I kiddin'? I don't got the money. Next. Zoom! I am your substitute teacher, Sister Mary Elephant. Class, attention, attention, class, class -- shut up! Thank you. Uh, no, man. No routines from the old regime. Really? But Sister Mary's no-nonsense attitude is what inspired me to become an educator. Just let your freak flag fly, man. Well, I guess as long as I fold it afterward and don't display it at night... Oh, perhaps I should improvise, or ""do an improv?"" I want you to reinvent the wheel! No, de-invent the wheel! No -- re-unvent the whool! Oh, I'll get my prop trunk! A lot of people have cell phones, but I like to eat healthy. So I invented... the celery phone! Hello? Hello? Wow. You are the un-funniest man I've ever seen. Which means, teaming up with you would be totally pushing the envelope. Mother, how did you get this number -- it's a prop phone! Yes, I have your celery... I took the limpest stalk there was! Stop it! Stop riffing! The gig is yours! Time to finally return your father's overdue movies. Is it really okay to just drop them into the pit where the Blockbuster used to be? Got a better idea? Um, hello... I'm Marge Simpson... I think I've given you money a of couple times... No, no, no, no, no, no -- I don't want the money back, I just came for my dog. Easter grass, Cable Ace Awards, aquariums full of broken pinball game parts, popped but uneaten Jiffy Pop still in the silver bubble, sample-sized shampoos, detergents and whiskeys... I hate to say this about the Cat Lady... but I think she's crazy. She's a hoarder! This is so sad. Can we help her? We can. It'll be great. Like a reality show without the cameras. You mean, just reality. Yeah, that's what you think. Cut, print, mail to NBC. CHEECH AND CHONG HAS LOST ITS CHONG / I AM THE CHONG NOW... TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AT ME-E... That's funny, Homer. Now we really have to work on the show. Oh yeah, I getcha -- ""work on the show."" Maybe we should start at four-twenty, right? Marijuana reference! Yeah, I got it. Listen, man, comedy is hard work. Hard work? I thought this was gonna be fun. It is fun! The fun is the knowledge that our audience gets a good value for their hard-earned dollar! CHEECH IS SURE A LOT LESS COOL / THAN I IMAGINED... Stop that! BETTER SHUT UP / CHEECH IS REALLY MAD / I WISH THAT I HAD GONE WITH CHO-ONG... Now, we've managed to preoccupy the cat lady for the next few hours. MEMORY / ALL ALONE IN THE MOONLIGHT / I CAN SMILE AT THE OLD DAYS / I WAS BEAUTIFUL THEN... So beautiful! Thank you, Marge. Thank you for clearing the clutter from my house... and my mind. Haul away, driver man! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! A perfectly-good hot lather dispenser. I can't count the number of times Homie's cried in anguish over his lukewarm lather. Ooh, a pen from the Milwaukee Hilton! ...a phone answering machine from the '80s! NOBODY'S HOME! All of J.D. Salinger's books, except ""Catcher In The Rye!"" Used pizza protectors! / Ooo! She's Crazy, but I'd do her. Class! Class! Shut up! You did all right, kid. You earned a reward. Oh yeah, a reward from Cheech! Homer? Homer! Hmm? Here's your reward! What the?! Yeah! I'm taking you to a museum, man. Chong and I used to come here all the time. Why aren't you exactly like your stage persona? Now Homer, this Viramontes image is an example of how Chicano poster art preserves a culture ignored by Eurocentric society. Eurocentric! When do we have wacky adventures? Ah, that's just the movies, man. Can we at least get some French fries? Too high in trans-fats. Stop speaking Spanish! Ladies and gentlemen, man! Prepare for comedy that will murder your expectations and bury them in a sea of ""what?"" with waves of ""huh?"" I am Dave. Dave is here! Man. Skin-ner! This dessert menu is funnier than you! Yes, but I'm funnier than the cocktail napkins. They're blank, Seymour. Yes, but there're two k-sounds in ""cocktail."" Yes, there are. So, how was your first day of school? I met the new principal, Mr. Baumgartner. He seemed really cool. When he walked through the gym, he shot a basket! Who has disturbed my tomb? Grampa, you're not dead. Well, wake me when I am. I never thought I'd say this, but Dad is the only one who can help us. Now Homer, what did we agree about personal phone calls during rehearsal time? It's disrespectful to the high standards people have come to expect from Cheech and Chunk. That's right. Now let's take it from the part where we sniff each other's butts. Yes, sir. Come on, sniff! That's a movie sniff. This is live theater. Now inhale, damn it. I'm hearing it but I'm not feeling it. Tour bus parked. Gotta save Marge! I can't believe the crazy house would throw out all these forks. Marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are ""insane?"" Well, sometimes people can be too. What are you talking about? Marge, you saved me. Now I want to save you. I'm not a hoarder! Do the Yankees hoard pennants? Does Marrakesh hoard intrigue? Marge, Marge, what can one person honestly do with... Filled-in mini golf score sheets... European ketchup...rolls of ""I Voted"" stickers... Styrofoam shaped like old computers! Gimme! Oh, lookie, lookie! But... Don't look back, Marge. Don't look back. Let's just leave the crazy woman alone in our house. We've got something more important to attend to. We'll deal with all that later. Hey baby, you want a ride? C'mon, if Art Garfunkle could forgive that untalented twerp Paul Simon, you can do this. What'd you do with Chunk, man? He sent me out here, man. He's got this idea I'm unhappy with my new partner. I decided to put family over career. You mean you put nothing over nothing! Tell him how you feel. I feel super high. Yeah. Me too! Come on, surrender to the moment! Don't make the mistake I always do of thinking too much before you act! I guess people do like the classic bits. You know what, it's okay if you want to experiment a little-- Oh Thomas! Oh Richard! I'm sorry I mocked your lack of suspenders -- I-I guess I was just jealous of your belt. This belt has caused too many fights between us. How now, mad spirits, before we part / 'Tis I, mischievous and puckish Bart / 'Twas not I the players did disturb / 'Twas the doings of a green and naughty herb / The gods have righted every wrong / Cheech the stoner has his Chong! And Homer, he is back with Mom / you can watch this tomorrow at Hulu.com. Who is it? It's me, Dave, man. Open up, I've got the stuff! Who? Dave, man! Dave's not here. Hold on, lemme get the door here. Who are you? It's Dave, man. You ruined it, man -- you weren't supposed to open the door. Oh, okay, wait, let's start again. Close the door. I'll be out here with you, Dave. Hey, Homer? Yes? Why don't you go and get us some stuff? Okay. I'll go get some stuff. All right. Way down there. Way, way, way far down there. Way down here? Yeah, keep goin'! Keep goin'! Now turn the corner! Turn the corner! Okay! Yeah, keep goin'! All right! Who is it? It's me -- relieved! Gee, sorry, Dave.","Ralph Wiggum, Carl Carlson, Grizabella, Waylon Smithers, Audience, Chief Wiggum, Lou, Agnes Skinner, Marge Simpson, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Gary Chalmers, Chong, Seymour Skinner, C.
