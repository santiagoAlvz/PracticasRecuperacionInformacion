184,188,"Stupid heater! Don't make me come in there! Why do you always wait until Christmas Eve to do your shopping? The crowds are just beastly. You know me, Marge. I crave the hustle and bustle. Homer! Look at this mob! The good toys are probably all gone. Oh, Santa's got a little trick up his sleeve. Attention, shoppers. Register 9 is now open for your shopping convenience. Sorry, these are for display only... This has been recalled... Oo, Bart would like this... We're out of these... Out?! But I just -- Register 9 is now closed. Hey, kids, I made your favorite cookies -- Christmas trees for the girls, and bloody spear-heads for Bart. Aww, thanks, Mom. This year's tree is just perfect. That old aluminum one was so fake. I couldn't agree more. From now on, it's plastic all the way. Bart, did you hear that? Could it be...? C'mon, kids. Let's try the lights! It's crap-tacular. ""Hocus-pocus, mucus-pukus..."" My powers of deduction tell me you're getting a hand-made sweater. Possiblyyy yellow. Mom! Make him stop! Bart! Put down that yellow sweater! Nobody's going near their presents until 7 o'clock tomorrow morning. Seven A.M. No earlier. And you can't set your alarm clocks 'cause I got 'em! For once we're gonna celebrate Christmas as a family. Hallooo? Anybody home? Ah, 12 glasses of water. That'll wake me up nice and early, and I'll have a big head-start on opening presents. Pure genius. You didn't invent that, Bart. The Indians used to drink water to wake up early for their attacks. It's always about the Indians, isn't it, Lis? Dear Santa. If you bring me lotsa good stuff, I promise not to do anything bad between now and when I wake up. Amen. Owww! I'll kill you! Go! Go! Go! / We're number 1! Gimme a ""P""! ""P""! Go! Go! Go! ""P""! ""P""! ""P""! Worked like a charm. Oh! Oh! Oh! How sweet it is! Oh, Aunt Selma. Always good for a fin. Whoa-ho-ho. Here we go. The Inferno-buster 3000! I knew Santa wouldn't have time to check that list twice. Whoa... Yeah... Cool... Uh-oh. Eep. Who designed this house?! Homer! I think I heard a noise. Knock it off... Snow covers all. Pure, white snow. I gotta get back to bed! What happened? What the-- Where's Christmas? Lisa, where's Christmas? Bart, what were you doing outside? I don't know how to tell you this, but... I came down a little early and... um... well... uh... I saw - a burglar and he was - he took - and he got all our stuff. Including the tree. We were robbed? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. How could somebody...? I know... Can - we - skip - church? Now, um, what did this, ah, Christmas thief look like? Well, he had a glass eye, a wooden leg, um... big scar on his cheek... Anything unusual? Hooks for hands. Um, oh, uh, and he was wearing a striped convict shirt. And he was carrying a big sack with a dollar sign on it. Classic burglar. Ahh, cheer up. We'll catch this guy. Uh, Chief... What? You can't rule it out. Well, there's no easy way to say it, kids: God hates us. Hey, since when is Christmas just about the presents? Aren't we forgetting the true meaning of this day? The birth of Santa? Bart's absolutely right. This is the one day that shouldn't be about material things. Hey, why don't we walk over to Grampa's and cheer up the old folks? That'll make us feel better. Okay, but they'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me happy. Looks like the Flanders are having a nice Christmas. Oh yeah? We'll show 'em. Come on, kids, pretend we've got new cross-country skis. Merry Christmas, Simpsons! That's not as fun as it looks. Nothing could be as fun as that looks. Hey, look what I got, Bart! A ""Tickle Me Krusty!"" Hey, kid, get your finger outta there! Ow! Homer! Lisa, you promised they'd be miserable. What the hell's goin' on?! Oh, the pharmaceutical man come by! And he shot us full of Christmas cheer! I can't feel nothin' below my chin! Sounds like you're having a rough Christmas, Homer. You know what I blame this on the breakdown of? Society. Yeah, you're right, Moe. You're always Moe. Homer, look! Your house is on TV! You take that back, Barney! Nah, he's right, Homer. Stay out of this, old man. Dateline: Kent Brockman. I'm here at the scene of the Christmas burglary, where a creature was stirring last night. And what he was ""stirring"" was ""up trouble."" Is your husband or lover here, ma'am? No. My husband is... at church. Aw, that's my girl. I love you, Marjorie. Yeah, she's quite a gal. You shut up. So when you realized Christmas was ruined, how did you feel? How do you think I felt? Absolutely devastated. ""Absolutely devastated."" The words of a heart-broken mother. For there will be no fire truck for little Bart. No sweater for little Lisa. No Cajun sausage for little Homer... So while you're home today eating your sweet, sweet holiday turkey, I hope you'll all choke just a little bit. Lousy doormat. Homer! You won't believe what's happened! It's a miracle! Oh, Marge, I don't wanna hear any more about that silver polish. People saw our story on the news and they've opened their hearts to us! Arr, we just gave what we could. Does anyone have change for a button? Wow, this really restores your faith in... Lisa, do you have to practice that stupid song now?! Sorry, Daddy. Hey, heard some no-goodnik stole your tree. Well we got a 30 footer, so you can have the top of ours. Thanks, Ted. Bart, this is Patches, and what was your name? Poor Violet. Ohhh, I don't like where this is goin'. Your story made everyone at the orphanage so sad. We want you to have this dollar we were saving. Please, I don't deserve this. Hey, listen up, everybody! The Simpsons are the best friends I ever had. So I'm givin' them the tip jar from the bar! My goodness, there is over $15,000 here. Fifteen thousand missoulians?! Holy schlamola! What are you gonna do with all that kablingie? Well, if you mean the money, I suppose we'll just replace the items the burglar took from-- Bo-ring! Spend it on something fun! Go wild! Ha! Right, Seymour? Yes. Something wild. Yeah, enjoy. Get something fun!/ Something stupid!/ You only live once! Hey, speak for yourself. Marge, kids, let's go buy some happiness! Yipee! / Woo hoo! / Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! God bless you, Bart Simpson. I'd kiss you, but doctor says I'm sick. Is this car $15,000? It is now. And because of your loss, folks, I'll throw in the undercoating for two hundred -- nooo, four hundred and ninety bucks. What a deal! I'd be a sucker not to get it. I don't know about this, Dad. Shouldn't we give the money to charity or some...? Ow! Oh, I'm sorry. I jabbed you with my pen. Ow! You're still doing it. Yeah, I know. Here comes Santa Claus / Here comes Santa Claus / Right down Santa Claus Lane... Vixen and Blitzen all the reindeer pulling at the reins... / Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh... Will this Christmas never end? Outta my way, snow-poke! Slow down, Homer. Don't worry, honey. I know exactly what I'm -- Oopsie. Tap the brakes! Tap the brakes! Turn into the skid! No, away from the skid! Hit the brakes! / Floor it! / Stop! / To the left! / Head back! Shut up! One at a time! Lisa? Bail out! That was close. I knew this would happen. Well, at least the burglar's having a merry Christmas. Bart! You're up early. I couldn't sleep. What's wrong? There was no burglar. No burglar? / What? / what's he mean? I accidentally burned up the tree and the presents. I'm really sorry. Why you little... Lisa, no! Your hands are too weak! Stop that! I'm gonna kill you! / No, I'm killing him first! / Why you little... Bart, the next time you ever have... / You went too far... Kent Brockman here for a follow-up with Springfield's favorite hard luck family, the Simpsons! Folks, any words for the Christmas thief, if he's watching? Yes, Kent. ""Hello, jerk. We may never find you, and we should probably all stop looking. But one thing's for sure: you do exist."" Strong words. Strong, bewildering words. Also, we want to thank the whole town for their generosity. Hey, look! It's little Bart's fire truck! Little Lisa's sweater? Little Homer's sausage?! What in the name of holy hell is going on here? Oh, it's true! We weren't robbed! That part we made up! But the rest is true! Wait! He's just covering for me! I destroyed the presents, then I buried the evidence. And I acted alone. So the family never knew about any of this. Well, the boy told us. But that was after we filed a phony police report. And after we spent all the townspeople's money. So you can see why my husband had to lie to you a moment ago. So this was all a scam. And on Christmas. Yeah. Jesus must be spinning in his grave. We gave them our vitamin money. Hey! Hey! Shoo, ya lousy freeloaders! Come back when you get some parents. In my long career, I've seen some pretty shabby things. But this putrid fraud out-stinks them all. And... cut. I just want to thank you folks so much. This has turned out to be a great, great story for me. I think they're running out of tomatoes. Yeah, but they've still got plenty of pumpkins. Oh, Homer. I'm so ashamed. Relax, Marge. This'll all blow over. Oh, no. Look at the line! Oh, there they are. It's the Simpsons. Aw, them stinkin' liars. There goes Christmas dinner. Ha. Head of the line! A family could get used to being shunned. Huh? Huh? Hey, look, Sean! It's that family everybody hates! What-ever. Um, Miss Hoover! Miss Hoover! Forget it, Lisa. I'm not teaching you anything until I get my money back. Now turn your desk around and stop learning. All the way. Hi, liar. Run for your lives, everyone! This is not a drill! Oh, right, yeah. Then while we're gone, you take our snacks, just like you took our money. You tell him, Lenny. ""...You'll all get yours in hell, you lying, thieving, blanking blankers. Sincerely, Moe."" Oh great, now we have to send him a card. I know you're used to getting hate mail, but I'm not. There's only one way out. We've gotta give this greedy town its money back. But we don't have $15,000. Unless... Aren't we forgetting something, Marge? You were down $5,200. But Mr. Trebek -- I asked you before the game if you knew the rules and you said you did. Judges? Run, Mom! She ain't gettin' the home version. I guess we better get used to being pariahs. There's no shame in being a pariah. Oh no, there's that angry mob again. Hey, look who's here, everybody. Oh, hi! / Oh, hello! / Hello! / Hi! / Ha! They've forgiven us. It's a miracle! You know, deep down, people are pretty g-- Hey, wait a minute! They're taking our stuff! Good Lord! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! If you're headin' for the medicine cabinet, I already been there. What the hell's goin' on? Well, we hated being mad at ya, Homer, so we decided to make things right. Consider your debt repaid, neighbor. And then some. Look, I know this has been a stressful holiday. But, in a way, having nothing reminds us how lucky we really are. What? We still have each other. And isn't that the best gift of all? But we would have had each other anyway. Yeah. Plus lots of other stuff. Maybe so. But there's one thing they forgot to take away from us. This washcloth. Hey, that's my washcloth. The hell it is! Gimme that! / Uh, gimme that! / No! / Let go! / Gimme that my washcloth! / I want it! Stop this madness. It's just a washcloth. Besides, it's mine. Yoink! Hey, she's getting away with the washcloth! Hey! Head her off at the stairs! I'm over here! She's going around the other side. Now get her! Go! Oh, I got it! Oh, it's just a thread! It was... She's got... she's got the washcloth!","Ralph Wiggum, Miss Hoover, Carl Carlson, Chief Wiggum, Goon #1, Lou, Milhouse Van Houten, Cheerleader, Cliff, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Fans, Sean, Cameraman, Kent Brockman, Crowd, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, C.
