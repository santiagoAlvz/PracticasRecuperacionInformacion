35,36,"Bart... Bart... Hey, Bart. Lisa? It's six a.m. Something's wrong! Dad died! No, no. He's fine. Well, what do you know? I'm relieved. Bart, my birthday is in two days. I'm gonna be eight years old. It's a big number -- almost double digits. Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesn't taste as good anymore -- Bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out? Sorry, this old timer does ramble on sometimes, don't he? Bart, I do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. I've made things for you. But you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all... Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, it's done! I'm doing it! Birthday gift coming your way! Oh, thank you. Bart, watch Maggie while I get the laundry. Can do. Hm... Krusty hotline. Hi kids! You've reached the Krusty Hotline. If you haven't asked your parents' permission, naughty naughty! But Krusty forgives you! Two dollars for the first minute, fifty cents for each additional minute. Thanks for calling kids! A new message every day. Maggie! Bart, I asked you to watch your sister! I tried to stop her but she overpowered me. Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt? I washed it. Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink? Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different. Now Homer, don't panic. You have plenty of white shirts. Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It's all over, Marge. It's all over. I don't know how this could have happened. Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle! You! You did this to me! Homer, please. No one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work. Wait a minute, go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink? Oh, that's Homer Simpson, sir. He's one of your boobs from Sector 7-G. Simpson, eh? Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he's some sort of free-thinking anarchist. I'll call security, sir. Excellent. These color monitors have already paid for themselves. Hey Homer, we saved you a doughnut. It has pink frosting! Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting -- Drop that doughnut. Let's go, Pinky. You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry... Spare me the tired semantics of the Simpson family! Take him away! You know, Mr. Burns, his body cavity search revealed nothing and we must have x-rayed him a hundred times. Maybe he's telling the truth. Or perhaps you two are in cahoots. Smithers, I seem to recall you had a penchant for bell-bottom trousers back in '79. Uh, sir, that was my costume from the plant production of H.M.S. Pinafore. Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show, as I recall. Now Doctor, what shall we do about our free wheeling fop over here? Well, Monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity took months. That's all changed, thanks to the ""Marvin Monroe Take Home Personality Test."" Twenty simple questions that will determine just how crazy or meshuggenah, someone is. Print name? Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form. Homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. I can't fill this out for you. All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it. Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me? Well, all right -- if you listen to the poem I just wrote. O-kay. Meditations on turning eight, by Lisa Simpson. I had a cat named Snowball -- She died, she died! Mom said she was sleeping -- She lied, she lied! Why oh why is my cat dead? Couldn't that Chrysler hit me, instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy -- He died, -- No deal. Dad, maybe you should do this. Son, it's no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot? Oh, yeah. Our $50,000 Home Video Finalists are: ""Man Breaking Hip."" ""Dog on Fire."" Ruff! Anybody order a hot dog? Look at him! And finally, ""Baby With A Nail Gun."" Awww. Okay, it's time to cast your votes now. Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire! Hey, Dad. ""Do you hear voices?"" Yes, I'm hearing one right now, while I'm trying to watch TV. Yes. ""Are you quick to anger?"" Bart! Shut up or I'll shut you up! Yes. ""Do you wet your pants?"" Well, even the best of us has an occasional accident. So, did I pass? No. Careful, men. He wets his pants. The devil with his fly open. Right... That's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. They're gonna eat it. Good... Arrghh! The boy! This isn't fair! How can you tell who's sane and who's insane? Well, we have a very simple method. Whoever has that stamp on his hand is insane. Put him in with the big white guy who thinks he's a little black guy. Who are you? Hi. I'm Michael Jackson, from the Jacksons. I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons. I can't believe you've never heard of me. I'm a very popular entertainer. Oh, of course I've heard of you. I mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was? Michael Jackson. Doesn't ring a bell. Thriller? What was that last one? Thriller. Nope. Well, how about this? BILLIE JEAN IS NOT MY LOVER / SHE'S JUST A GIRL WHO SAYS THAT I AM THE ONE / BUT THE KID IS NOT MY SON. HEE, HEE, HEE! Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet? The moonwalk? No, that thing with your feet. Here look. Just raise your heel a bit and put a little pressure on the ball of your foot. Hee hee hee... You seem like a nice guy. Why'd they put you in here? Because I wore a pink shirt. I understand. People thought I was crazy for the way I dressed. What'd you wear? One white glove, covered with rhinestones. Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl-- Bart, in the split second before he died, I bet Scratchy appreciated his birthday present. You see how this relates to us? Hey, you want that once a year empty gesture. You got it, sis. Hey, Michael, I don't get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me. Homer, this is Floyd. He's an idiot savant. Give him any two numbers and he can multiply them in his head, just like that. Okay. Five times nine. Forty-five. Wowww. We call this guy the Chief. He's been here since 1968. Never says a word, never moves a muscle. Hey, Chief. Hello. Well, it's about time somebody reach out to me. Gee, I gotta call my family. Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I'm a god. I could call them for you. Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight. Joe's Crematorium. You kill 'em, we grill 'em. Hello. Who is this? I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you? I'm Michael Jackson. The Michael Jackson? No way! It's true. I'm with your father, in a mental institution. Uh-huh. And is Elvis with you? He could be. It's a big hospital. Aw, come on. If you're really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys? Brooke Shields, Diana Ross, Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles. Shiver me timbers, you are Michael Jackson. Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives? I'm afraid not, Bart. Your father really needs your help. You don't want him to get a lobotomy, do you? Hmmmm, lobotomy... That's all right, son. Well, there's probably a down-size I don't see. Uh-huh... New Bedlam Asylum... loves us... needs us... fears he may never see us again... Got it... Michael Jackson. Whoo-hoo! I love you, man. Hey Mom, Dad's in a mental institution. Oh my God! Mother was right. Now Homer, don't you worry. Your family's gonna be here before you know it. Forget it, pal, there's only one way out of here and it ain't pretty. What's that? Dating a nurse. I told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house. No, mom, you said poor house. I said crazy house! Poor house. Crazy house! Poor house. Crazy house! Hello, you've reached the New Bedlam ""Wrongly Committed"" Hotline. All of our operators are currently busy. Please stay on the line. What's wrong, Homer? This place is so strange. Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I'm... scared. We all get scared once in a while. Maybe I can help you. HOMER, THE TWO OF US NEED LOOK NO MORE / WE BOTH FOUND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR / WITH A FRIEND TO CALL MY OWN / I'LL NEVER BE ALONE / AND YOU MY FRIEND WILL SEE / YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME. Pancakes... football... Boobies... Bubbles, it's gonna be a long night. Please feel free to express yourselves. In these sessions we want you to feel relaxed and uninhibited. Okay, so I was working at an insurance company, right? Huh! Youngest VP in the history of the firm. Okay? The job was my life. Then one Monday morning, I got up and I couldn't leave the house. I just couldn't. Was the door locked? No, I just couldn't face what was out there. Was it raining? No, Homer. Dave suffers from agoraphobia -- a fear of open areas and crowds. Please, Dave, go on. Thank you. Anyway, that day I knew I-I just couldn't make that long drive to work. Were you out of gas? Baby. Mrs. Simpson, I'm sorry but your husband suffers from a persecution complex, extreme paranoia, and bladder hostility. Doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son, Bart, you'd see how sane he is. You mean there really is a Bart? Good Lord! Mmm... pancakes. Oh, Mr. Simpson, you've got a visitor. Marge! Oh, Homie. Mr. Simpson, after talking to your wife, we believe you're no threat to yourself or others. That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please? Of course. Not insane. I'm proud of you, Homer. Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us. Well, how about today? I'm only here voluntarily. You are? Why? Well, back in 1979, I got real depressed when my ""Off the Wall"" album just got one lousy Grammy nomination. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OVERLOOKED MIDDLE CHILD -- HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME. Joe's Taxidermy. You snuff 'em, we stuff 'em. Boy, when I get home, I'm going to wrap my hands around your neck -- -- And smother you with kisses. Homer, whatever they've got you on, cut the dose. Now listen. I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice. Um Homer, I'm a vegetarian. And I don't drink. Are you sure you're here voluntarily? Yes. Now Homer, please make sure he doesn't tell anybody I'm coming. Yes Dad, I solemnly swear I will not tell another living soul... No, not even Milhouse. Hello, Milhouse? Can you keep a secret? No. Oh well, who cares. Michael Jackson is coming to my house! Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson! Aunt Bella! Wait a minute. I got a call on the other line. Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson! We've just been handed a bulletin from our Rock 'N' Rumor Department. That's right, Michael Jackson -- the Thriller himself -- is moonwalkin' his way right here to our very own Spring- field! And while we go check it out, why don't you enjoy our seldom heard, extra longggg version of ""In-a-Gadda-da-Vida."" Michael Jackson! Oh such a thing happens once in a blue moon. Do I dare to leave my post? Aye carumba! This is the most exciting thing to happen to our fair town since the uh Dalai Lama visited in 1952. And so, I hereby declare that Route 401, currently known as the Dalai Lama Expressway, will henceforth be known as the Michael Jackson Expressway. And the guy in the pink shirt is the father of the family who, it turns out, was just released from a mental hospital. Thanks everybody! It's great to be sane. Here he is! Here's the guy you wanna see. Huh? Huh? Huh? He's three hundred pounds. He's white. He's dressed without flair. What the hell made me think Michael Jackson would even visit this jerkwater burg? You owe us Michael Jackson. Don't ever show your face around here again, ya tool. Bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before I join them I have one question: Today is my birthday -- you promised to get me something, and... and I'm afraid to ask. You know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask. I thought so. Oh, Bart, you... Come off. I'm sane now. Dear Bart, I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. Perhaps if a professional so advises, I will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show. Hey, Bart. Hey... you. Bart, when I was a kid, I didn't have much money. So you know what I did when my sisters' birthdays rolled around? Stiffed 'em? No. I wrote them a song. To show that I cared. I can't write a song. I'm only ten. Only ten? When I was your age I had six gold records. Hey, Looney Tunes, this is what Michael Jackson looks like. You look like a big fat mental patient. You'd be amazed how often I hear that. Just leave me alone. Look boy, either Michael Jackson is some guy working in a recording studio in LA or he's here with you willing to work on this song. It's your choice. So long. Wait, wait, Michael! You go sit at the piano and I'll boil some coffee. LISA, HER TEETH ARE BIG AND GREEN / LISA, SHE SMELLS LIKE GASOLINE / LISA, DA DA DA DEESA / SHE IS MY SIS-TA, HER BIRTHDAY I MISSED-TA. Uh, no. Bart, we've got to get to your real feelings about your sister. I don't have any. Well, let's go look at her. Maybe that will help. Ah, she looks sad. That's cause she knows you're looking at her. Although I am aware you are looking at me, I would look exactly the same even if you weren't. Bart, think. What happens to you when you turn eight? Well, your training wheels come off your bike. Good. That's good. THE TRAINING WHEELS COME OFF YOUR BIKE / YOU START TO NOTICE BOYS YOU LIKE...HEE, HEE, HEE. You're just putting that in because it's commercial. Lisa... Lisa... Lisa. Huh... wha-- Bart, it's six a.m. That's right! Hope you like your present. And a-one, and a-two, and a one, two, three, four -- LI-SA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / AND GOD BLESS YOU THIS DAY / YOU GAVE ME THE GIFT OF A LITTLE SISTER / AND I'M PROUD OF YOU TODAY... HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA / LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA / I WISH YOU LOVE AND GOOD WILL / I WISH YOU PEACE AND JOY / I WISH YOU BETTER THAN YOUR HEART DESIRE / AND YOUR FIRST KISS FROM A BOY... LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA / LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA... Yeah! Oh! This is the best present I ever got. Thank you, Bart. Thank you Michael. Well, my work is done here. Hey, Michael. What happened to your voice? This is my real voice. My name is Leon Kompowski and I'm a brick layer from Patterson, New Jersey. All my life I was very angry until one day I just talked like this. All of a sudden everybody was smiling at me, and I was only doin' good on this earth, so I kept on doin' it. To make a tired point. Which one of us is truly crazy? Not me. I got this. Bye, bye, Leon / Bye, roomie / Bye, Pardner / You're a credit to Dementia! See ya! LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / GOD BLESS YOU THIS DAY / YOU GAVE-A ME THE GIFT-A DA DOO DA DEE DEE DOO DOO / AND I'M A PROUD OF YOU TODAY!
