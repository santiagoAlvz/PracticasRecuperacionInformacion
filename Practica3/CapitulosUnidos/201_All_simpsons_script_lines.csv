197,201,"McBain to base. Under attack by Commie Nazis. They won't stop me from delivering these UNICEF pennies. Go, pennies! Help the puny children who need you. Wowwww! McBain has really buffed up. You could grate cheese on those abs. Yeah, but can he do this? I surrender! Not so fast. That's what I call break-neck speed. Mom, a man just died. Anyway, it's time for the church picnic. What? They had a picnic last week. No they didn't. You just brought a bucket of chicken to church. If God didn't want us to eat in church, he would have made gluttony a sin. Hey! Ah, the joke's on you. We borrowed that jar from your table. So you just shot your own mustard! Aw nuts! Ooo, still plenty of parking. Nice to see you, Homer. Yeah, out of the way, whoever you are. You're blocking the food. Ah, there's nothing like a good old-fashioned picnic. How's my kite doing, Smithers? Oh-ho, it's, uh, soaring majestically, sir. You're it! We'll see about that. After him, Smithers! You're not it. Gentlemen, the game is capture the flag. Rod, ladies pick first. Okay, I choose... Todd. Oh! Oh! Oh! Bart! Bart! Over here! O-over here! Um... I'll take... Nelson. Saving the best for last, huh, Bart? Yeah, that must be it. I pick my Dad. Do you want to play capture the flag, Daddy? Heh. Sports on a Sunday? Hm. I'd better check with Reverend-- Oh, play the damn game, Ned. Yeah, well, if you get a grown-up, then so do we. I pick my Dad. Him?! Oh, you'd be surprised. He gets pretty competitive when he's drinking. C'mon, Dad. We're playing Capture the Flag! Sorry, son, Daddy's down for the day. Why don't you go capture me some more potato salad? But Rod picked his Dad. It's a matter of family honor. Flanders is playing? Why didn't you say so? Oh, it appears I will have to find a new Fortress of Solitude. Okay, Dad, they've got our flag guarded pretty good... I agree. Let's surrender. No, wait. I have a plan. But I'll need your underpants. Hmm... All right, but don't lose them. They're my only pair. I got it! I got the flag! Get him! Stupid kids... This isn't the flag! It looks more like... Ewww! Suckers! Go Dad! Come on, Dad! Just a few more feet! Show 'em what you got! Tag tag tag tag tag! Time out... t... time out... Oh, I don't think he can get up. Let's egg him! Oh, stop it! Hey, h-he's trying to turn over. I've never seen Bart so ashamed of me. Oh, Marge. How could you let me let myself go like this? Me? I'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee. Yeah, well, I've humiliated my son for the last time. I'm going to get into shape. Whatever you say, sweetie. No, I mean it. I'm really serious this time. Okay, honey. Okay. I'll start taking in all your slacks. Okay, boy, I want you to keep this exercise thing under your hat. That way I won't be embarrassed if I fail. Oh, great. Now the cat knows. Okay, here we go... Look, son. Daddy got in shape. E-- I've got to keep trying! Or I could just move that picture. No! The picture looked good where it was. Boy, drag me back outside. So what will it be, Mr. Simpson? Your usual bucket of ice cream covered with miniature pies? Uhh... Don't you have anything healthy here? Oh, well, we have some low-salt candy bars and some reduced-fat soda. And our beef jerky is now nearly rectum-free. Hey, these Power Sauce bars look pretty healthy. Oh yes, that is a new item. No bar contains more applesauce. Hmm... A bushel of apples packed in each bar, plus a secret ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples. Wow. ""Gym?"" What's a ""Gym?"" Ohhh... a gym. Ow! Ow! Ow! Boy, am I feeling this. Ow! Oh, my head's gonna be sore in the morning. Ow! Excuse me. You're doing this station all backwards. Let me show you how to do it like a man. Ranier Wolfcastle! Oh, I love your movies and your Power Sauce bars and your taut, rippling-- Hey, hey, hey. That's enough. Now step over to the abdominator and I will shout slogans at you. Push! Harder! Go past the max! Reach over the top! Master your ass! Wow, Wolfie. Two months ago I didn't know what the word ""dumbbell"" meant. This place is great. Um-hm. Hello, handsome. Nice muscles. Care for a rubdown? Oh-ho, well, I'm flattered, but spoken for. Oh, what the heck, give me your number. Dad, what have you done to your stomach? And your chest! And your shirt! I have been working out secretly at night. And look at me now! Oh my goodness gracious! Heh, heh, heh. Go ahead. Try and grab some flab. Go on. Ju-- No, not there. Not there either. Over here. I've got some! No, here. Try my foot. No, not that foot. Just feel my biceps. Whoaa... Well, whaddaya think of your old man now, son? Damn right. How can you put that filth into your bodies? My casserole is not filth. Eat it. Look at you people. Bart's a tub, Lisa's weak as a little girl, and Maggie doesn't seem to be growing at all. Now that's just non-- You too, Marge. If you toned up a little, you'd probably get a lot more action. Homer, stop insulting us and eat your filth. Food. I mean, food. Sorry, I only eat food in bar form. When you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, I'm told. That's why I'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar. Hm. Hospital, please. Homer, please remember to wipe your sweat off that machine. I got a terrible rash yesterday. You know Rainier Wolfcastle? Yeah, he helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone. Yo, yo, Rainier, my man! How ya doin'? I thought you'd be here, pumping those guns. We've come up with a killer promotion for Power Sauce bars. Picture this: You... I love it. ...climb the highest mountain in Springfield... The Murderhorn. Are you crazy? That's suicide. Oh, sure, for experienced mountain climbers. But you're a movie star. And you'll have the Power Sauce edge. Not for all the applesauce in Glueckenschlaben. My Dad could do it! He eats fifty dollars' worth of Power Sauce bars a day. Overshoot the extreme, max the envelope, and so on. Wow, he's really been paying attention to our slogans. Uh, Brad -- a word. New angle: Joe Schlub eats Power Sauce bar -- becomes World's Mightiest Man. It's believable. That's what I like about it. Hm. Congratulations, sir. Huh? You're gonna be the first man to climb the Murderhorn. I am? Uh, no, that's it over there. Yeah, that's it. Just to the right of the one you're looking at. Okay, mountain-climbing supplies: rope, ice axe, heart medicine... Son! Don't go up that mountain! You'll die up there! Just like I did! You? Did? Sure, it was the winter of '28... The Butter Baby Flapjack company sponsored me and a fella named McAllister. We were almost to the top, when we ran low on supplies. Heroically, I gave him the last short stack. Then, that glory hog took all the supplies and headed for the top alone. I fell 8,000 feet onto a pile of jagged rocks. 'Course folks were tougher in those days. I was jitterbuggin' that very night. But that skunk McAllister was never seen again. If you're trying to scare me, it won't work. I'm one hundred percent focused on my goal. Hey, my hat has ear flaps! And when he reaches the top, Mr. Simpson, here, will plant this Power Sauce flag as an eternal symbol of man's contempt for nature. Wait -- is ""contempt"" the word I want here? Homer, you're the world's greatest hero. Do you owe it all to Power Sauce? That's right, Brad and Neil. I only eat Power Sauce -- the bar with Apple-saucicity. Has anyone mentioned that Homer doesn't know anything about mountain climbing and that this is all crazy? Well, yes, a number of people. But don't worry. We're sending two Sherpas along as guides. Aww. Goodbye, everyone. Don't touch my stuff. Dad, wait. You're not risking your life just to impress me, are you? Well, yeah... Oh, cool! Now get goin', chop-chop! Remember our agreement. He can't fail. Oh, man, this is hard. Uh, Dad? Shouldn't you save a couple bottles for when you're a little higher? Bart, this climb is the most difficult ordeal I have ever faced. Don't get discouraged, Dad. Only four vertical miles to go. Wow! Look how far I climbed! And I'm not even tired! Wake up, you lazy Sherpas. We've got a mountain to climb! This Power Sauce news break is brought to you by Power Sauce. Get sauced with Power Sauce. Neil? Our top story: Homer Simpson has just Power Sauced his way past the halfway point of the Murderhorn. Brad, could Homer have made it this far without the engineered nutrition of six kinds of apples? No way, Neil. Oh, this just in: Power Sauce is amazing! Huh?... Wha ya?... Hey! You guys are dragging me up the mountain. Brad and Neil were quite insistent you not die. Frankly we don't care. So nobody believes I can do this, huh? Well, my son does. And I'm not gonna let him down. I'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own. Then technically, shouldn't you go back down the mountain and start all over? Shut up. You are so fired. Woo hoo! Homer Simpson here. I've sent the Sherpas home and I'm heading for the top, solo. Are you crazy? You'll never make it. The hell I won't. You're forgetting I've got my Power Sauce bars. Wake up, Homer! Those bars are just junk. They're made of apple cores and Chinese newspapers. Hey, Deng Xiao-Ping died. Homer, listen to me! Turn back now! Forget it. I'll be at the top by noon. Over and out. Homer Simpson -- defying all medical advice -- has switched to Power Sauce's arch-rival: the Vita-Peach Health Log. Doctors say he may not have the meganutrients needed to stave off death. Oh, Dad's gonna die and it's all my fault! I really need a good talkin' to. Don't worry, kids. Your father'll be okay, as long as he's with those Sherpas. Uh... Mom? Air's getting thin, but I'm gonna make it. Woo! Getting lightheaded... Good -- no heavy head to carry. Wait! I'll just take that escalator! La la la la la la la la... La la la la la la la la la... Just a few feet more... I did it! I made it all the way to... Aw, crap! It just keeps going! I give up. You beat me, mountain! At least I won't freeze to death. ""Last entry. I have mountaineered to the utmost, but the peak is unclimbable. Worse still, that treacherous skunk Abe Simpson stole my oxygen, and tried to eat my left arm."" Ew, Dad. ""Tell my beloved wife my last thoughts were of her, blinding and torturing Abe Simpson. Cheerio."" My Dad's a disgrace, just like Bart's Dad. Me. This may not be the top, but it's as close as a Simpson's ever gonna get. This is for you, son. Hey. Wait a minute. I'm on the top. I actually did it. I climbed the unclimbable mountain! Bow down before me, everyone! For I am your KING! Family to Dad. Family to Dad. Come in, Dad! Uh, I'm pretty sure he's dead, little girl. Here, have a Power Sauce bar. It's on the house. Hey! Something's coming down the mountain! Fast! Oh no, he fell! I can't look! Hi. Oh, Homie! You're alive! Oh, Marge, I never thought you'd see me again. Where in the world did you find a sled on top of the-- We're too late. He's dead. A-- And it looks like someone tried to eat him. What are you looking at me for? You're all crazy! Crazy as-- Okay, here's what I think happened... Didja make it to the top, Dad? Huh? Didja? Why don't you tell me, son? See any interesting flags up there? All I see is a pole. Maybe the flag fell off. Aw, dammit! Forget about it, Homer. You made it to the top. You're the coolest Dad ever. Thanks, Bart. That makes it all worthwhile.
