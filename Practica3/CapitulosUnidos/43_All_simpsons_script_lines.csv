42,43,"Y'ello. Dad, I'm calling about the school talent show. Don't worry, I know it's tonight. No. Dad, I broke my last saxophone reed, and I need you to get me a new one. Uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at? I called her. She's not home. I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement. Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed. Well, you're in for a whale of a show tonight. I'd like to point out that the doors are now locked, so you parents can't sneak out of the show after your own child has performed. Oh, and let me caution the people in the first five rows, you will get wet. Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer? Hurry, Moe, hurry! I've only got five minutes till the music store closes. Why don't you go there first? Hey, do I tell you how to do your job? Sorry, Homer. You know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top. Sorry, Homer. This is a whole lotta nothin'. I'd rather be watching the boilers! Oh well, make sure you return those chairs to the cafeteria, Kim. I'm not kidding. Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare. What's the matter, buddy? The moron next door closed early! I happen to be that moron. Oh, me and my trenchant mouth. Terrible, just terrible. You know, they seem to get worse every year. Wonderful. You know, I think this is the best batch we've ever had. I really do. And now, here's Bart Simpson, The Boy of a Thousand Voices. I'd like to open with my impression of Principal Skinner. Duh, look at me, I'm Principal Skinner. That young man just became the Boy of a Thousand Days Detention. Hey, it's Lunchlady Doris. I wonder what she's got for us today. Today's special is refried dog poop. Please, you've got to open that store. Let me think about it... Eh... No. Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. Well I don't have one. Come on, Jer. Open up. Be a pal. Remember when I pulled you and your wife out of that burning car? Okay. Okay. But now we're even. So what does your daughter need? I'll have you know, I wrote it down. Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum! Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo! Uh-huh. And what instrument does she play? I dunno. Mom, where is he? If I don't get that reed I'll sound terrible. Don't worry, honey, I'm sure your father is... Maybe. No. That's a long shot. Bingo. Don't worry, he'll be here. Clarinet? No. Oboe? No. Saxophone? No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one again? Saxophone? Hmm. ""Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!"" Yes! That's it! Alto or tenor? My ding-a-ling / My ding-a-ling / I want you to play with my ding-a-ling -- This act is over! Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to put this filth behind us, and let's all enjoy Lisa Simpson's rendition of ""Stormy Leather -- ah, Weather."" Haw haw! Haw haw. Sounds like that gopher I caught in me lawnmower. Whew, I'd hate to be that kid's father. Uh-oh. That'll do. It's not my fault. It's the reed. Oh yes, of course. It's the reed. Let's hear it for Lisa Simpson and her wacky sax. Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah! Okay, who ordered the Mount Bellyache? I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh. I'm done. That cost eighty-eight dollars! I'm sorry dad, I don't feel much like eating. Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn't make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I forgive you. You didn't mean that! No. I didn't. Look Homer, Lisa's taking her first steps. You taping it? Yes. I'll watch it later. Da-da. Da-da. Did you hear that, Homer? Marge, please, I'm busy. No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed that she was alive. Homer, if you want to make up with Lisa just spend some time with her. Okay. Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie. Homie, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix. If you keep spending time with Lisa, she'll forgive you. Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let's see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for. We can't afford to buy a pony. Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony. That's ridiculous. Marge, I've got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa's eyes, I don't see love anymore. That's no reason to buy a pony! See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes. Stick to the subject. Ha ha, you love me. Let's be realistic. A pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You sound like you're going to buy a pony. Promise me you won't. Mm. What was that? Was that a yes or a no? Buh. Those aren't even words! Sneh. Oh my, what is that smell? Oh, it's you. Excuse me, do you sell ponies? Uh, sure pal, right here. ""Scot-tish deer-hound."" Hey, this is a dog! My friend, you're smarter than I gave you credit for. I suggest you try the pony farm on Route 401. Merely take a left at the rendering plant. Now lady, I'm buying this pony for my little girl, and I don't care what it costs. Very good. That stunning creature over there is half a million dollars. Half a million dollars?! He was sired by Seattle Slew and his mother won the Kentucky Derby. Wow! His likeness graces a stamp in Tanzania... I'll take it! Mr. Simpson, do you have half a million dollars? Uh, sure... let me write you a check. Mr. Simpson, this check is dated January 1, 2054. Is there a problem with that? Our ponies start at five thousand dollars. Cash. Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home? I sincerely hope not. I-I'd like to borrow five thousand dollars. Sorry, I can't approve a loan that size myself. Hel-lo. Simpson, eh? How can I help you? Mr. Burns, you do this personally? It's a hobby. I'm not in this for any personal gain, heavens no. By the way, are you acquainted with our state's stringent usury laws? U-su-ry? Silly me, I must have just made up a word that doesn't exist. Now, what is the purpose of this loan? I want to buy a pony. Isn't that cute? Smithers, he's planning on joining the horsey set. That is it, isn't it? You're not planning to eat it? No. I need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more. Shut up, Simpson. Sorry. Do you have any collateral? Oh Smithers, let's not be so cold. His spirit is my collateral. Just sign this form and the money will be yours. Sorry, I was just, uh, thinking of something funny Smithers did today. I didn't do anything funny, sir. Shut up. Mr. Simpson, are you quite sure you know how to take care of a pony? Of course. Simpson, you've done it again. I love you, Dad! I am very upset with you. Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own. Hey, how come Lisa gets a pony? Because she stopped loving me. I don't love you either. So give me a moped. I know you love me. So you don't get squat. Hee hee hee hee. Snowball II... Santa's Little Helper... this is Princess. Please don't exclude her because she's different. Homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse? I've got it all figured out. By day it will roam free around the neighborhood. And at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage. Dad, no! That's illegal. That's for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me. Dad, I think Princess belongs in a stable. Stable? That sounds expensive. This is what love costs a month? These are standard stable fees, Mr. Simpson. Plus, I'm teaching your daughter riding, grooming, and at no extra charge, pronunciation. Father, you've made me the happiest girl who ever lived. Oh nuts. What do I do? What do I do? Grampa, if you wanna go right... Yes... ... move your joystick to the left. Yes, move the... what's a joystick? You didn't tell me... Uh-oh, here comes a Xylon cruiser. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go into hyperspace! Ready, hit it! Wait. Where's the Hyperspace? Grampa, you're the spaceship, not the... I'm the what? I thought I was this guy. Ohhh. Game's over, Grampa. I got down on the floor for this? Wait, Dad, I've got something for you. I was hoping it'd be money. Hmm, oh dear, we're in serious trouble here. We're just going to have to cut down on luxuries. Well you know, we're always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have. Actually, I was thinking we could cut down on your beer. Nah, we're not gonna be doing that. Then I'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back. First you didn't want me to get the pony. Now, you want me to take it back. Make up your mind. Homer... Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays. All right. You got us into this, you get us out. Fine, I will. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it. Do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore? You're so beautiful. Oh look. You haven't touched your salt lick. Num num, good salt lick. Need money. Need money. One Scratch-for-Cash, please. Here you go. Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, come on, come on... Oh. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Three Liberty Bells! That'll be TEN thousand dollars, Apu. Oh congratulations, Mr. Homer! Thank you. If I could just see the ticket... There it is. Please to be removing your thumb. No. Yes. Please, I must insist... No! No! I've got to look at the ticket No! You can't see... come on! Yes, I must... No! Let go. You're ripping it. A cherry! Oh, Mr. Homer, what has reduced you to such cheap chicanery? Ohh... I need money. Well, if you need money you should have at least jammed a gun in my head or better yet you could inquire about my ""Help Wanted"" sign. You're looking for help? Yes. We need someone for the demanding, yet high-profile midnight to eight a.m. shift. I'm your man! You're hired. Woo-hoo! Always I dreamed the day would come when one of you would be working for me! She certainly tamed that horse. Yes, but what man can tame her? I won't lie to you. On this job you will be shot at. Each of these bullet wounds is a badge of honor. ...Badge of honor. Here's a pointer: try to take it in the shoulder. Now, these hot dogs have been here for three years. They are strictly ornamental. There's only one bozo who comes in and buys them. But I eat... Oh. Heh heh, the perfect crime. Homer, where have you been? I was so worried. Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night I'm not proud of and I don't want the kids to hear it. Busted! I'll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy. Oh my God, she killed him. Mmm... salty. Homer, are you stealing Squishees? No sir. This next song is also about a girl and her pony. It's called ""Wildfire."" Come on, Apu honey, loosen up. I'm sorry, baby. While I am here pleasuring you, my store is going down the tubes. Three dollars and fifty-one... fifty-two... fifty-three cents. Homer! You are asleep at your post! Now go change the expiration dates on the dairy products. Yes sir. Sorry baby, date's over. Homie, how long do you plan to do this? I don't know. How long do horses live? Thirty years? Mustn't sleep. Must monitor core. Y'ello. I just called to say I love you, Dad. Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me? I just heard Millie Vanillie was just arrested for impersonating a McNugget. Well, it's true. Well, it's still fun to be up late. Hey, Homer, where ya goin'? Going for... eight hour walk. Homer? Homer! Homer sleep now. What's wrong with Dad? He's just exhausted. Lisa, do you know how much it costs to keep a pony? No. Well, it's a lot. In fact, your father had to take a second job. The poor guy. Where's he working? The Kwik-E-Mart. Lisa, I hope you realize that your father can't keep this up. You're gonna make me give up Princess? Lisa, we can't make you give up that pony. I can make her. Just give me five minutes alone with her. No, Bart. No one's going to make her. This is something Lisa has to decide for herself. All the years I've lobbied to be treated like an adult has blown up in my face. Hey, pink hat, when I ordered that blueberry squishee, I meant today. Coming right up, sir. And fill it to the top this time. Yes, sir. She likes a little carrot after her oats. And she really likes it when you scratch her behind the ear. And if you're playing the radio, she likes contemporary adult in the morning and easy listening at night. Please take good care of my Princess. Although there is no change in my patrician facade, I can assure you my heart is breaking. I'll never forget you. What--- wha, da, you call this melted cheese receptacle clean? Eh, the young man you replaced is rolling over in his grave. Dad, you don't have to do this. Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money... Dad, I understand the sacrifice you've made for me. That's why I gave up the pony. You did? Hmmm hmmm. There's a big dumb animal I love even more than that horse. Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus! I mean you, you dummy. Awww. Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it! Giddyup, Dad. He slept, he stole, he was rude to the customers... still, there goes the best damn employee a convenience store ever had.","Ralph Wiggum, Waylon Smithers, Johnny Carson, Female Clerk, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Young Homer, Baby Lisa, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Kevin, Seymour Skinner, C.
