533,540,"High above Zenith City, Radioactive Man keeps a lonely vigil. All seems quiet. Maybe I'll fly to China and get some takeout. A Sky Tweet from Commissioner Sweeney! This looks like a job for ""at-Radioactiveman-underscore-oh-one""! Leaping leptons! It's the Fossil Fuel Four! Old King Coal... Petroleus Rex... French femme fatale, Charcoal Briquette... And the enemy of drinking water everywhere, The Fracker... Stop attacking the nuclear plant, this country's safest energy source! Studies show I'm America's best hope for energy independence! Those studies were industry-financed! You lie! Holy hadrons! I need backup! Calling Citizen Solar and his sidekick Wind Lad! I believe you will find zem... lacking in energy. It's too cloudy. People don't like the noise I make! Petroleus Rex! Please remember when you used to be environmental scientist Rex Bernstein! I have become my dessstiny! I'll crush you like a gnat, King Coal! Half-life... quarter-life... eighth-life... gone. Frack-cellent! They killed off Radioactive Man?! I did not see that coming. Die carumba. They'll just reboot Radioactive Man in an overpriced new origin issue and get clueless fanboys like you to line up at midnight to buy them. Clueless fanboys in costume! Wow! Midnight! I won't know which day to write in my diary. Homer! What? Would you take me to buy a comic book Tuesday at midnight? And miss the back half of Jimmy Kimmel? That's when he experiments, boy. You never watched an episode of Jimmy Kimmel in your life! Yes I have! After the Oscars when he forces you! Quiet! Quiet! And attention, please, valued customers. You will each be allowed to enter the store and buy one copy. Swallow your gum now. Mr. Book Guy? Can I go first? I was once cast to play Fallout Boy in a movie. Tell it to Harlan Ellison. I think you over-privileged kids with your electronic tablets and your talking phones wouldn't know a good piece of fiction if your iPod read it to your ass! I wish someone would've come from the future and warned me not to talk to you. That's my idea. You're stealing my idea. Sorry. C.B.G., what's the haps, my man? Well, well, well, if it isn't Milo, the owner of my main competitor, Coolsville - or should I say, Foolsville. That is some tasty cashish, my friend. Indeed. And how did you spend your evening? Let's see... I wrote a ""Lost"" fan fiction finale that also answers all the questions from ""Twin Peaks..."" re-ranked all the ""Dr. Who""s by puffiness of the hair... oh, and I also got married to my actual, non-imaginary, comic-tolerating girlfriend, Strawberry! Now when Milo talks to himself it won't seem crazy. So, Milo talks to himself. We will treasure that information. Yes we will. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna share this primo origin ish with my bride. Even the mintiest comic is just acidifying pulp if you have no one to read it with, right? Nerds don't get girls! These days they do, man. Comicon is now eight percent women. Wrong! Wrong! Wr-- or... is he? C'mon, buddy. I gotta get home and climb into bed with my loving wife. Oh right, you have a loving wife? Marge and I get along perfect. We're like George Burns and John Denver. Man, carrying these kids is hard on my back. And now to Moe's. Look at him, he's got family... friends... what do I have? ""Jimmy Olsen versus Matter-Eater Lad."" Hm, better than I remembered actually. No! No, it isn't! It's horrible! The only thing that could make this moment more clich√©d is if I started to sing about my feelings... and here I go. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HAPPY TO CALL MYSELF SINGLE / NO MARY JANE OR LOIS LANE WITH WHOM I'D COMINGLE... YOU COULD SAY THAT I WAS / AN UNSTACKABLE PRINGLE. I'VE GOT ORIGINALS SIGNED BY SIEGEL AND SCHUSTER / BUT THEY DON'T SATISFY IN THE WAY THAT THEY USE-TER. IT REALLY DON'T MATTER IF YOU'VE GOT A CAP ANSON / IF YOU SPEND YOUR NIGHTS IN YOUR UNDERWEAR PRANCIN' / WITH A CARDBOARD STANDEE OF SCARLETT JOHANNSON! GUESS I'VE ALWAYS BEEN LONELY, BUT I'VE NEVER REVEALED IT. / DROPPED MY HEART INTO MYLAR, AND THEN VACUUM SEALED IT. Stan Lee! Or... is it my imagination? I'm your imagination. The real Stan Lee's over there. Excelsior! But listen: as comic book guys go, you're trim, friendly and quite a catch. But now your opportunity is knocking. Don't let it slip by. Can you help me? I can only watch. I cannot interfere. New Radioactive Man number one, please. Come on, Nudnick. Ask her out. You're interfering! Hey, I'm ninety years old. I can do what I want. Um, er, stammer, eh... can I sign you up for our frequent buyer's club -- ""The Just Us League?"" You would be Member Number zero zero three. I am the first two. Sure. I am Kumiko Nakamura from Osaka. I'm visiting America's saddest cities as research for my autobiographical manga. Volume six: ""Springfield: Land of Angry Tears""! That's you. The man with sparkling eyes and zigzag beard. You've seen me before? Yes, through window. But you don't see me. You're either looking down in disgust or up in disdain. I think you have great soul. Would you permit me to go in the back and do a brief inventory? She tolerates me! Is-it-too-soon-to-give-you-flowers-in-a-Hulk-hand? It is the perfect time. Bart! Your comic vendor's here! Actually, it is you that I am here to see. I, um, I need your help... in getting ready for a date. The closest thing I have to a father is the Obi-Wan doll in my store. And he comes from a race of celibate knights, so... I will help you. As long as our bellies never touch again like they are right now. But why pick me? Because you're the only fat man in real life who ever got a hot woman. Well, come in! I'll explain how it all works. Okay, it helps if she's got a mother she's trying to get back at. No woman will be able to resist you dressed like this. Now remember, don't be the way you normally are, and sustain that for the rest of your life. Kumiko, meet my dear friends, Homer and Marge Simpson. In my country it is a tradition to bring a much older couple on a first date. It is not in any way weird or sad. Does anyone tell you that you look like the man on a box of Mr. Sparkle? Aka ni taishte burei da! Yogore o yaburu! In Japan, drinking your detergent is a popular method of suicide! Honki da yo?! Kumiko, for you we chose the coolest restaurant in town. But the walls are covered with garbage. Not garbage, Americana. Here's some more Americana that bubbled up in the swamp. Here you go! Your all-American, fifty-state potato skin sampler! Okay, Wisconsin, cheddar. Maryland, blue crab... They're neither in alphabetical nor geographical order! What madness is this?! Please, sir, ask your questions after all fifty ""tates""! I cannot hide the snide inside! I don't mind. If you think it's stupid, say it's stupid. Really? In Japan, no one ever says what they think. We know our game shows are degrading and our baseball fences are too close. But no one says anything. Attention restaurateurs! You should've spent less on the kitsch and more on the kitchen! With this bowl of Chuck's Cherokee Salsa, I baptize you mediocre at best! American nerd snark is the finest in the world. Let's go walking and mocking in the rain. I'm in love! And yet still a little bitter. It's surprising. Father, why-sa you-sa forsake-a me-sa? Marge, Homer, you have nurtured our love like Steven Spielberg nurtured the careers of Zemeckis and Gale... So we want you to know I have decided to move in, to the basement under his store. At last we'll be in the same bed, just like Batman and Robin. Homer, I want you to take Kumiko and Comic Book Guy a housewarming present... and maybe check in on them? We've talked about this, Marge. The hammock is a chore-free zone. Apparently including tying the knots on the hammock. And getting the termites out of the trees. Not a word. Excuse me, sir, I am looking for my daughter. I thought this was her residence, but all I see is a store full of non-pornographic manga. You're Kumiko's father? Welcome, sensei! I am not Kung Fu instructor. I am humble salaryman who could kick your ass. Say, has anyone told you you look like-- I know, Mr. Sparkle. I was going to say, like you're going to have a stroke. I get that a lot too. Now please, where is my daughter? Okay, she moved in with her boyfriend. Well, he's not a boy. He's immature, but fat and old. So, an obese nerd has stolen my daughter to live in his basement?! I didn't tell you about the basement. It was an obvious guess! Daughter, you are coming back to Japan! There are eighty-seven old people who need you to take care of them. No! Please! Please! I was becoming cuddly! I deleted rants from my blog! You can retrieve rants if you did not empty your trash. Goodbye! Now I know I've got a heart, because it's breaking. Wizard of Oz reference! Did I do that? Urkel reference! Help me. Fly reference! I can't stop. I can't stop. Homer Simpson, this was your doing. And I want you to fix it! I have a bad feeling about this. Every-action-movie-ever-made reference! Now! Homer, we have much in common. We both love our daughters and discipline our sons. No, discipline would imply I'm trying to make him better... so, are you married? My dear Michiko has passed away but she is always with me. You promised double suicide! You hear what you want to hear! Always with me. Another drink! Something stronger! Snake rice wine. Now that's disgusting. Wine made of rice? Try some. Hei. Why didn't I stop with the snake wine? Why did I drink the fish wine? That was the aquarium! You didn't see nothin'. Scram! I am ruined by whimsy! The good thing is, soon I'll be a beautiful swan. What's going on here? We'll explain it! The rice wine has penetrated to the essence of your souls. Yeah, listen to my tail. You're the tail! No, you're the tail! Dad, Bart's feet are on my half of the shell! Why you slimy little...!? Hey, that actually feels good! Oh yeah, more. A little bit more. Right there. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's the stuff! Enough nonsense! I came here for my daughter! I AM A GOLDEN BIRD / AND I LOVE THE COMIC NERD / OF THIS I WON'T BE CURED / PAPA SAN, PAPA SAN... The monster is me! Who'da thunk it?! Homer, drinking that snake wine and going to White Castle afterwards really opened my eyes. Mister Nakamura, I have used my hitherto unmentioned chemical engineering degree to get a real job, at the Springfield Phosphate Works. They're giant polluters but the C.E.O. is a woman. It's very vexing. Now, have I proven myself worthy of your daughter? No. Please, take your time. You were worthy... the way you were. I was? But I rented the store! I ebayed my stool! Cancel the sale! But then my seller rating will go down! Stop being nerd! Yes, Papa-san. Geekly beloved, we're gathered here in the eyes of me, king of the cameo, Stan Lee, to celebrate the wedding of Comic Book Guy and Kumiko Nakamura. Does anyone wish to offer any thoughts on this blessed occasion? Yes, I would like to say something. Since I met Kumiko, strangely, comic books no longer seem so important. I will also be selling greeting cards. Every day I will give one to Kumiko in commemoration of today with the salutation ""Best. Day. Ever."" Ghost wife, are you happy? Kind of! How long am I gonna stay this way? As long as we keep drinking this. Give us your eggs. I'm a boy! We said eggs!
