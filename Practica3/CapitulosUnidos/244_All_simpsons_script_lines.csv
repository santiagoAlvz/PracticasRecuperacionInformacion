240,244,"Ah, trash night. In France, they call it ""La Nuit Des Poubelles."" In Germany, it's ""Crappenfest."" I can't believe it only comes fifty-two times a year. Quit gabbin' and start grabbin'. And remember, the best stuff is usually deep in the garbage juice. See? A new pacifier for Maggie. Looky here -- cardy-board tubes! Now we can have indoor plumbing, just like they's got at the women's lock-up. They spoilt you, Brandine. Sometimes I don't even know who you are anymore. Looks like Milhouse's mom finally threw out his ""blanky."" He'll pay a lot to get this back. Especially when we send it to him piece by piece. Shh, quiet. It seems I will never sell these ""She-Hulk vs. Leon Spinks"" comics. Worst cross-over ever. Shoo, nerds, shoo! Well, this muscle shirt's a pretty good find. Dad, that's a sports bra. All I know is, I'm finally getting the support I need. Look, Dad. Barber hair. Ooo, Italian. Hey, Vinnie, how's about a pizza? I got-a no job. Mama mia. Look what the Hawaiian restaurant threw out! Get outta my dreams and into my car. I don't remember the air in the kitchen being so wavy. Good Lord - that's gas! Behold, I am King Talkie-Tiki! Hey Flanders? Can your God do that? Actually, Homer, you and I worship the same God, so... Irregardless, I am your God now! Homer, you can't just reroute the gas line. Do you know how dangerous that is? Do not anger Talkie-Tiki! I am all-power-- I'll be at Moe's. ...so I says to the cop, ""No, you're driving under the influence... of bein' a jerk."" Hey, Barney. What's with the glum face? You glum or somethin'? Huh, Glummy? You know, it was my birthday last week, and no one remembered. What are you, nuts? I threw you a party at my house. You lie. Why would I not remember my own birthday? But we did have a shindig for ya, Barn. We even videotaped it. Look. Oh, that's it, baby. All for Moe. Oh, yeah. Work the slot. Show me the package. Whoa, tha... that, that's a project I'm working on. Sorry. Okay, Mom. We're rolling. I wrote a poem for Barney on this special occasion. ""Now that you're one year older, the time flew by so fast..."" Bart! Gimme that! I'm just saying that when we die, there's going to be a planet for the French, a planet for the Chinese, and we'll all be a lot happier... Mr. Gumbel, you're upsetting me. No, I'm not! Gee, is that what I look like when I'm drunk? You wish. That's the stage we call ""Professor Barney"" -- talkative, coherent, even insightful. Here's drunk. Well, I'm off to market... Marge, you're making a complete fool of yourse... Oh, it's just Barney. Precious alcohol! Soaking into shag. How embarrassing. But how did this happen? Oh, that. You've had that for a while. Yeah, I can't really picture you without it. Oh, I'm a disgrace. Disgracefully hilarious! You passed out before we could even give you your presents. I still got mine. Barney, I got you what no drunk can do without: Morning-After Stationery. And I got ya helicopter flying lessons. Can you imagine this boozebag at the wheel of a whirlybird? He'd be all ""Look at me! I'm a tanked-up loser in a helicopter!"" Ah, anyway, Happy B-day, punkin. So, I'm a tanked-up loser? Is that how you see me? Oh, sounds like a certain loser could use some tanking up. Hey, hey, where ya goin'? I'll show you. I'm gonna take these helicopter lessons. Wait a minute, Barney. You gotta be sober to fly. I mean, it's not like drivin' a car. Then I'm gonna quit drinking. No, I mean it. You won't see me here again. Ever. Wait, that ain't funny. He's my best customer. Well, the handwriting's on the wall. To stay afloat, this bar's gonna have to go queer. You mean it's not? Wrong again, ""Gay Guide to Springfield Farewell, my long-necked friends. All right, world. Get ready to meet the clean and sober Barney Gumbel. Weee! Gimme a beer! I knew you'd be back. Santeria, you're the greatest! Barney, didn't you say you were gonna stop drinking? I know, but it's so hard. Please help me, Homer. You came to the right guy. I'll straighten ya out... right after I finish this beer. Ah, man that's sweet. Okay, let's go. My name is Barney and I'm an alcoholic. I feel for you, pally. But, uh, you want A.A. -- this is triple A. Oh. My name is Homer and I'm planning a trip to St. Louis. East St. Louis? Is there any other St. Louis? Ah, welcome back, Homer. I see you've finally hit rock bottom. Not a chance. I can sink way lower. I just came to help my friend Barney. We all know why we're here, don't we? To keep ourselves sober -- and to network. So, let's get started. Well, after I lost my third job in two days, ol' Gil was in a pit of despair. And that's when you realized you were an alcoholic... Oh, no. I never touch the stuff. But you don't have to be drunk to know the value of Amway. Now this is used crankcase oil, which you ladies know is murder to clean up, ya know. And company's coming! Aw, you're doin' this at the worst possible time. Ahh, your finger's in my eye... I have a problem with alcohol and I need help. Well, your recovery begins today. And we promise you all the sugar cookies and second-hand smoke you can handle. The sugar cookies you speak of. Are they real or symbolic? They're on that table over there. I don't wanna walk that far. Anything that takes twelve steps isn't worth doing. Get it? Huh? Twelve? Steps. Hey? How did I get out here? Hurt everyone. Did Gaga just say ""hurt everyone""? Gaga. Cute name. The Springfield phone book needs a new cover! It does? Send us your snapshots, and if we select yours, you win a fabulous mystery prize. To enter, send your film to this address. Too quick? Try again. Did you get it? Here it is! Coming in from the left! Don't delay - do it today! You think we should enter? Well, it shouldn't be too hard to beat the old photo. Hmmm. It's gotta be here somewhere. Hey, here's a camera. And it's still got a roll of film in it. Man, these old cameras are really built solid. Bart, we need that to win the contest. Win the what now? Here goes. So, he's so busy worrying about the front rotor, he walks right into the back one! Only in this business. I'd like to sign up for helicopter lessons. Sorry pal, but it takes a special kind of man to pilot these birds. I've got a coupon. Okay, get in. Elvis played a chopper pilot one time. He made so many darn mistakes, we were just laughin' at him. Great singer, though. Oh, absolutely. You know who else I like is that, uh, Leo Sayer. Anyway, we're nice and level now. How'd you like to take the controls? You think I'm ready? Sure I do. One sec... Testing black box, one, two... She's all yours, friend. Whoa, whoa, ah, ah. Hey, I think I'm gettin' it! Yes, that's great. Now, let's just pull ourselves out of this tailspin here. Ooh, oh, I'm sorry 'bout that. It's okay. That's what the diapers are for. Now, when the mama bird returns to feed her babies, we'll have a prize-winning picture. Lisa, people these days don't want to see a baby bird. They want to see celebrities at their worst. Is that Rainier Wolfcastle? Check out the gut! It's for a movie. I'm filling a fat secret agent. Hey, Homer. Ah, no, no, no, don't sit there. Take this seat, right next to the tap. But that's Barney's seat. Are you tryin' to make me the new Barney? Hey, every bar needs a world-class drunk. Yeah, someone who makes our alcoholism seem less raging. Well, forget it, guys. I am not Barney! See, Homer? It's not so bad. Now dance, rummy! Okay... You danced for hours just because they told you to? If I didn't, I'd lose their respect. Check it out, Homer! I'm flying this thing! Get it away from the house! Wanna go for a ride? Can I, Marge? Can I? Yes, go! Just go! So you missed some big changes at Moe's. He hangs newspapers over the urinals now. You can read the sports page while you pee. Very la-di-da. I've made some big changes, too. Can you believe I'm flying this helicopter? Power lines! Power lines! Whoops, sorry. When I think about all the time I wasted at Moe's... Wasted? What about our staring contests? And the way we always knew what football coaches should've done? Remember the day we jumped that Census guy and stole his clicker? Those are all priceless memories, Homer, but I don't want to do that stuff anymore. Oh, so you're better than me, is that it? I didn't say that. Take me home. Oh, don't be that way, Homer. I'll scream. Okay, okay! So how was your ride with Barney? I don't wanna talk about it! Stupid Barney, thinks he's too good for me. Cheer up, Homie. You don't need friends to be happy. I haven't had a friend in years. But you've got me. Who have I got? Well, you still have Lenny and Carl. Lenny and Carl suck. Please don't tell Lenny and Carl I said that, 'cause if I ever lost them as friends... Well, if Barney's that important to you, you've gotta work it out. Old friends stick together, like O.J. and A.C., or the Falcon and the Snowman. Oh, why can't I have a nickname? Okay, that's it... looks good... Oh, Bart, the bulldog didn't ante! Okay, on three. One... two... Perfect. Phone book cover, here I come. Haw haw! Hey! No fair! We'll never get a good picture. Hey, why don't we dump spaghetti on Maggie's head? That picture's a clich√© . Picture? Hey, Apu. You got any of those potato chips that give you diarrhea? I need to do a little ""spring cleaning."" They are in the safety cabinet. I'll get the key. Oh, hello Homer. Barney. Beer, huh? That's right. Enjoy. That I will. Then we agree. You keep thinkin' that. I will. Me too. Good day, then. Good day, then is right. Ta. Ta-ta. Hey! You did not pay for that beer! Boy, you can see everything from Mount Springfield. The Squidport, the old monorail... The Play-Doh Factory... Crescent-moon! Crescent-moon! C'mon, Springfield. Sparkle for me, baby. That's it... Heads up. Ow! Bart, that's hot! I said heads up. Lenny, Carl, I know a lot of people bad-mouth you, and focus on how you suck, but not me. To me, you're true blue. Aw, thanks big guy. Now dance, rummy! Okay. Hiya, Moe. Well, if it isn't Little Miss ""I'm not wasting my life anymore."" Which he is. Moe, I've come here to make amends for my disgraceful behavior over the last twenty years. Aw, that's okay, Barn. No, it's not okay. I broke barstools, befouled your broom closet, and made sweet love to your pool table... which I then befouled. Well, that would explain the drop-off in play. This is a Channel Six news bulletin. Fire has broken out on Mount Springfield, trapping two youngsters and their camera. Oh, no! That's Bart and Lisa! Unfortunately, fire trucks are unavailable to fight the blaze, as they are all being used to film the new Burt Reynolds movie, ""Fireball and Mudflap."" I caught up with Burt on the set. So, Burt, tell us a little about ""Fireball and Mudflap."" Well, I play Jerry ""Fireball"" Mudflap, a feisty Supreme Court Justice who's searching for his birth mother while competing in a cross-country fire truck race. It's garbage. Barney, you gotta fly us up there and save my kids! I can't. I've never flown solo! Barney... The call is from heroism. Will you accept the charges? Where are you going? The fire's that way! I know, I know! I haven't learned right turns yet. Look out! I can't do this! My nerves are shot! Beer. That's what I need. Barney, no! Don't! Yes! I need it! No! You've gotta be sober for this. Gimme that! Ugh, it's warm. You can't drink 'em all. Oh, yes I can! Gimme that! I won't let you give up now, when you've worked so hard to be the greatest pal in the world. I love you. Let's not lose touch after graduation. You brave man. You took six silver bullets for me. Stay away from my wife! Looks like it's up to me. We should be safe up here. I'm pretty sure fires can't climb trees. Ow! Dad! Hi, kids! Hang on! I'll throw you a ladder! Get off! Get off! Dad, help! All right, I'm comin'. Let me know if you're gonna do that again, Homer. You did it, Dad! You can't prove I did it. No, you saved our lives. I could do a lotta things if I had some money. What? Now, there's a picture. Kids, the new phone books are here. And your picture's on the cover! All right! / Cool! / Lemme see! Isn't it adorable? I guess some baby pictures were on that old roll of film. We'll be the laughingstock of the whole town! Well, at least we won the bike. Actually, I took the picture, so I gave my prize to the orphanage. What? / How could you? Just kidding. I would never do that. Well, I'm glad we're friends again. Yeah. So what do you call this stuff? A double tall mocha latte. It's not bad. Well, it ain't beer, but at least I got that monkey off my back. Nobody gets away from Moe.
