68,69,"Maggie, can you say ba-ba? Can you say Ma-ma? Can you say ""get bent""? Bart! Mr. Rogers says it all the time. He does not. Maggie, can you say ""daddy""? Dad-dy? ""Kit-ty""? ""Kit-ty""? ""Be-bop""? ""Be-bop""? ""Shove it?"" ""Shove it?"" Did you hear that? She said ""burlap."" Hmmm, I don't think so. Oh, Maggie, when are you going to talk? Well, don't push her. Remember, ""Tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."" What does that mean? Better say something or they'll think you're stupid. Takes one to know one! Swish! According to 'Fretful Mother' magazine, if Maggie doesn't talk by age one, we should consider a corrective tongue extender. Hey, what was my first word? Uh, well... Aye carumba! You know, I don't think I remember... But the story of Lisa's first word is very cute. Tell it, Mom. Tell, it Mom. Yeah, tell it, Mom. Well, this story begins in this unforgettable spring of 1983: Ms. Pac-man struck a blow for women's rights... a young Joe Piscopo taught us how to laugh. Before Lisa was born, we lived in a tiny apartment on the Lower East side of Springfield. Chipwich for sale! Chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin. Chipawich for sale! Youse guys wanna play stickball? Soitenly. Yeah, sure. Over here. Did you girls watch the last episode of MASH? That Mike Farrell really boils my p'tata. I miss-a da Klinger already. WHEN THE WORKING DAY IS DONE / GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FU-UN / THAT'S ALL WE REALLY WANNNNT... Homer! Homer is what grown ups call me. Call me Daddy. Homer. Daddy. Homer. Daddy. Da... da... da... Ye-esss... Domer. Why you little... He'll tire himself out soon. Then the prince and the princess got married and lived happily ever after. Then what happened? Uh, They had 30 sons and 30 daughters. What were their names? Dennis... Brad... Mavis... Brad... No, this is true. The Coast Guard arrested Boy George for scraping the barnacles off his dinghy. Hi yo! Hi yo! Heh, heh. Got your nose. Got your wallet. Nooo! Bart, don't you ever do that again. Understand? Beep. Guess what, Homie... There's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now. We're gonna start doin' it in the morning? No. Oh. We're going to have another baby. Marge that's... Bye-bye, keys. Hear that, Bart? You're going to have a little brother or sister to play with! Who did this? Baby. Bad baby! Heh, heh, heh. Uh-oh. I'm afraid we're going to need a bigger place. No, we won't. I've got it all figured out. The baby can have Bart's crib and Bart can sleep with us until he's 21! Won't that warp him? My cousin Frank did it. You don't have a cousin Frank. He became Francine back in '76. Then he joined that cult. I think his name is Mother Shabubu, now. That afternoon, we left Bart with my sisters and went househunting. Hey, Bart, want a dollar? Uh, uh, uh, you know what I want to hear. I'M A LITTLE TEAPOT, SHORT AND STOUT / THIS IS MY HANDLE/ THIS IS MY SPOUT... THE ITSY-BITSY SPIDER WENT UP THE WATER SPOUT, ETC... Oh yeah. DOWN CAME THE RAIN, AND WASHED THE SPIDER OUT. Love that spout medley. Now, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, the only houses I have in your price range are in the neighborhood colorfully referred to as the ""Rat's Nest."" This one just came on the market. Oh dear. Now, here we have beautiful hardwood floors, track lighting... What's that stench? Once you get used to the smell of melted hog fat, you'll wonder how you ever did without it. Mmmm. Hog fat. Let's keep looking. Ew. Do you smell something? Arrr! Why buy a house when ye can buy a house boat? Excuse me. Don't forget to check out the galley -- that's real shag carpeting. Arrr. Once we get these cats out of the way it won't be too bad. Actually, according to the will, the cats own the house. You'd be their tenants. I wish we lived in the kitty house. I could have trained them to be my unholy army of the night. Go my pretties... kill, kill! We were about to give up, when we found a house that was perfect... Just imagine what we can do with this place. Wow. How much? How much? Well, here's what they're asking. I can't afford that! Dad, I have a problem. Why'd you come to me. I don't know nothing. I used to get by on my looks. Now they're gone -- withered away like an old piece of fruit. Are you done? No, not yet. I was voted the handsomest boy in Albany, New York. Dad, I don't need advice, I need $15,000 to buy a home. Oh! Well, all I own is this house, that I built with my own two hands. You didn't build this house. You won it on a crooked '50's game show! I ratted on everybody and got off scot free! All right, son. I'll sell this dump and write you a check. Dad, first you gave me life, now you've given me a home for my family. I'd be honored if you came to live with us. Thank you. So, how long before you shipped Grampa off to the old folks home? About three weeks. Maggie I'll give you this cookie if you talk. What? What? All right, you win round seven. When are we going to get to my first word? Your what-what? My first word. Eh, you don't want to hear that story. I know! I'll tell you about the time I got locked in the bank vault with Mr. Mooney. It was another one of my hair-brained schemes. Daaad! Wait a minute. That was a ""Lucy"" show... Okay, where were we? Mom was pregnant and Dad just threw our money down the sink hole. Ah yes. I remember the day we moved in... Hey, Homer. This house sucks. Bart, I told you not to use that word. Call me ""Daddy."" Homer. Nyahhh. WE WELCOME YOU TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD / SING FA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA... Fa la la la la la la! FROM NOW ON, YOU'LL BE HISTORY... you'll be hist... You'll be hist... You'll be history! Buenos dias, neighboritos. The handle's Flanders, but my friends call me Ned. Hi, Flanders. Who the Hell are you? My name's Todd. Would you be my friend? You're funny! If you need anything, just give a whistle. I could use a TV tray. Well, gee, I... Whaat? I just this minute bought it at the hardware st... You said, anything. Sure, you can borrow it for a little while. And that ""little while"" is now eight years and counting. Heh heh heh. Anyway, Bart had just entered the ""terrible twos."" I AM SO GREAT / I AM SO GREAT / EVERYBODY LOVES ME / I AM SO GREAT... / EVERYBODY LOVES ME... Oh, honey... honey... honey... HONEY. Could you please be quiet? QUIET, BIET, DIET, ZIET, FIET... Bart, get out! Not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but somehow I managed to fit in eight hours of TV a day. Heyyy, kids! Summer's just around the corner, and Krusty Burger is the official meat-flavored sandwich of the 1984 Olympics! Coochy, coochy, coo! Krusty funny. Duh. It's all a part of our Krusty Burger Olympic Sweepstakes. Just scratch off the name of the Olympic event on your gamecard... and if America wins a gold medal, you win a free Krustyburger! Mmm... Mmm... Mmm! And... cut! Bleh! I almost swallowed some of the juice. Uhh. I'll be tasting that for weeks. Great spot, K.C.! Put a sock in it, preppy. How much are these free burgers gonna cost me? Not to worry, Mr. K. We've rigged the cards. They're all in events that Communists never lose. I like, I like. This just came over the wires, Big K. Uh huh... Soviet boycott... U.S. unopposed in most events... how does this affect our give-away? Let's see...You personally stand to lose 44 million dollars. Bart, from now on, the baby sleeps in the crib. Crib! Crib! I'm a baby! All right, I know how to handle this. Just use a little reverse psychology. Let's go, Marge. Leave the baby with his little crib. Ah, Homer J. Simpson, you're a genius. I know you like clowns, so I made you this bed. Now you can laugh yourself to sleep. If you should die before you wake... Can't sleep... Clown'll eat me... Can't sleep... Clown'll eat me... Oh, doctor! We are seconds away from the 100-meter Butterfly, and with the East German ""women"" shaving their backs 9,000 miles away. ... The Americans are heavy favorites. Patience, my pet. And the Americans jump out to an early lead. Although, we should point out that many of the other women represent countries that don't have swimming pools. Boo hoo! You're breaking my heart. Homie... I think the baby's coming. Wow. A baby and a free burger. Could this be the best day of my life? Coming up next, an hour-long episode of Mama's Family. Yes! We'll take good care of your boy, Simpson. Enjoy the miracle of creation. Shut up, Flanders. So, kids, what do you want to play? Good Samaritan! I get to clothe the leper. Lucky! Suppertime, boys. Oh boy! Liver! Iron helps us play! I want to go home. No I don't. I GOT THE JOY, JOY, JOY, JOY, DOWN IN MY HEART -- Where? DOWN IN MY HEART TO STAY / AND IF THE DEVIL DOESN'T LIKE IT HE CAN SIT ON A TACK -- Ouch! Sit on a tack... Ouch! Paw! Can ye help me with my sums? Oh Bart, you met Grandma Flanders. Hope she didn't scare ya. Hello, Joe! Little Lisa. I've already started you a college fund at Lincoln Savings and Loan. According to this magazine, Bart might be jealous of her. Yeah, well Bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt. Bart, there's someone in here who wants to meet you. Well, Bart, what do you think of little Lisa? I hate you. I saved this newspaper from the day Lisa was born. Mondale to Hart: Where's the Beef? ""Where's the beef?"" What the hell's that supposed to mean? ""Where's the beef?"" No wonder he won Minnesota. Everyone agreed that Lisa was a beautiful baby... Here she is! Isn't that cute -- she's coughing. Aw. I'm gonna give her a kiss. I know a new song. You still here? Allouetty, jaunty allouetty, allouetty... ...Hmm. Allouetty... You already sang that part! The older they get, the cuter they ain't. Hey, the baby just spit up! Oh, wooja, wooja, wooja wu. Uh, wooja, wooja, wooja, wooja, wu. Welcome back to the final day of this, the 23rd Olympiad. Brought to you by Krustyburger. You people are pigs! I personally am gonna spit in every 50th burger. I like those odds. In a moment, we'll look at the courageous Korean gymnast Kim Hwan, who made a perfect dismount on what was later revealed to be a broken leg. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugggggggggg.... Ouch! But first, let's go to the boxing venue. Please, please, please, please, please... The American Drederick Tatum does a triumphant turkey trot over the supine Swede. One's thoughts turn to Alexander of Macedon's victory at Granicus and Issus. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!... Carl Lewis, I could kiss you. She has the reflexes of a young Mary Lou Retton. Have a wowwy-pop. Can I have a lolly-pop? Oh Bart, I'm afraid that was the last one. But I've got something even better for you -- a rubella inoculation. I wanna hold the baby. I wanna hold the baby. I'm sorry, Bart, you're too little. Here, Bart, you can hold my beer. Homer! What? Goodnight, honey. Hello, Lisa. Lisa, time for your feed -- Who's cuter now? She started it... came at me with a pipe... Stupid mailman... squeal on me... Heidy-ho, Simpson. Your son shoved this through our doggie door. And since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my TV tr... Boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah. I liked it when it was me, Mom and Homer. You wrecked everything. I'm leaving. Goodbye. Bart. What did you say? Bart! Sufferin' succotash! You can talk! Mom, Dad, she can talk! Say it again, Lis. Bart. Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart. I'm her first word! Well, I'm not surprised. Lisa's crazy about you. She thinks you hung the moon. Wow!
