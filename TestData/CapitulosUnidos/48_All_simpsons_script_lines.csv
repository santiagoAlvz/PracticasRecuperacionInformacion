47,48,"Aw, ain't that cute... Hey! Hey! Where in God's name did you learn that kind of... daaaanncciinng! Dad, can I have some money to buy Bart a birthday present? Mon-ey. Dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars. Oh, sorry. That's very righteous. Funky C Funky Do will be back to lip sync another one of their hits, right after this. Hey kids! Why sit in front of the TV, when you can be on the radio!? WE'RE GONNA ROLL THIS TRUCKIN' CONVOY / CROSS THE U.S.A. / CON-VOY... That could be Bart! Throw away your bulky transmitters and broadcasting towers... The SuperStar celebrity microphone lets you hear your voice through any AM radio! Hey good lookin', we'll be back to pick you up later. He's in for some lovin'. It's the perfect gift for birthdays, graduations, board meetings. You're fired! Hm... Bart's birthday's coming up. But order now, supply is limited. Limited?! Do you have any of those microphones left? Yeah, a couple. Y'know, Marge. Bart's really gonna like my birthday present this year. It won't be like those shoe trees I got him last year... or the shelf paper I bought him for Christmas. I'll buy his love yet. Okay, Sideshow Mel, bring out the birthday cake! Hey kids, while Sideshow Mel mops up, let's see the names of our Krusty birthday pals for today! All right! Here comes my name! Wow, best eight bucks I ever spent. Bart, your Grampa's on the phone. He wants to wish you a happy birthday. Isn't that nice? Take a message. Right now I'm off to hit forty-six local merchants for free birthday goods and services. I'm here for my free birthday sundae. Eat it and get out. Digital audio tape, my butt! When I was a kid, we had compact discs, and I don't recall no one complaining. Damn right. Sorry, Rosarita. I gotta get to my birthday party. Farewell, Señor Bart! Hey, good to see ya. Glad you could make it. Toby, have you lost weight? Uh-oh, here comes trouble. It's Wally! Hey Wally, do something funny! Hey, later, okay... hey, why don't you go bug your parents? Cool, Larry the Looter! All right! Stick it to the Man. Hey there, I hear it's your birthday. How old are you? Well, I'm -- That's great! Would you like us to sing you a special song? Hell, no. You got it! Ready, Señor Beaver-otti? I'm-a ready. And-a one and-a two... YOU'RE THE BIRTHDAY / YOU'RE THE BIRTHDAY / YOU'RE THE BIRTHDAY BOY OR GIRL. Wha th...? It's a label maker. Mmm-hmm. We have one at home. Before we got it I was always finding Patty's stubble in my leg razor. Ehhh... Bart, I'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. Well, check out my present! Next. Bart! Be polite. Next, please. Bart, I've noticed your birthday presents are a poor crop at best. I hope this turns the tide. Just gorgeous. Now we can be twins! There's only one can of beer left and it's Bart's. Hey boy, how's the microphone working? Fine. Bart! I would love to get a present like that. Here you go. Enjoy. Listen, boy, this is a great invention! Watch. WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / ROCKIN' THROUGH THE NIGHT / WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / AIN'T SHE A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT / CON-VOY Quit it, Dad! Hey good-lookin', we'll be back for some dinner later! Wha'd you say? I can't understand you with all that distortion. What a crappy birthday. Y'know Bart, I don't think this is such a bad present. Maybe you just shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does. Testing... testing... One, two, three... Oh, my. Do I sound like that? Hey, it does work! I bet you could have a lot of fun with this. Why don't you go show your father? Hmmm. Mmmmm. Chocolate. Mmmmm. Chocolate. Marge, we need some more vanilla-chocolate-and-strawberry ice cream. I'll get some at the store tomorrow, Homer. Mmmmm. Chocolate. People of Earth, this is Bartron, commander of the Martian invasion force. Your planet is in our hands. Resistance is useless. We have captured your president. He was delicious. Why, you little... Wait a minute. Does this mean you like my present? Uh-huh. Aww... Just promise me you won't play anymore practical jokes. I promise. Mama! Mama! Maggie! You talked! Can you say ""mama"" again? Sorry lady, show's over. Oh, Bart. I dreamed I was married to Corey, and we lived on a pony farm...and Corey was always walking around with his shirt off. Oh, brotherrr. Mrs. Krabappel! That was uncalled for! Bravo! Well done, old man. Rod... Todd... this is God. How did you get on the radio? What do you mean, how did I get on the radio? I created the universe! Stupid kids. Forgive my brother. We believe you. Talk is cheap. Perhaps a test of thy faith. Walk through the wall. I will remove it for you...later. What do you want from us? I got a job for thee. Bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen and leave them on the Simpsons porch. But those cookies belong to our parents. Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God? Happy God. Then quit flapping your lip and make with the cookies. Yes, sir. Whoops! Help! Help! Hoot mon! Sounds like trouble a-brewin' at the old well. Help me, please! I fell down the well! I'll get help, laddie! A little nip of courage. Out of my way! Look out, you horse's arse! Sucker. Hey, what's up? Some fool kid fell down a well. Yes! My name is Timmy O'Toole. I just turned ten years old. Timmy, where are your parents? Uh... I have no family. I tried to enroll in school, but your Principal Skinner turned me away because of my shabby clothes. He's a liar! Booooooo! The circumference of the well is thirty-four inches. So, unfortunately, not one member of our city's police force is slender enough to rescue the boy. By God, men -- you're a bunch of marshmallows! Why don't you go, Chief? I'm too... important. Although the well is too dark to see the boy, Timmy has told us his foot is trapped under a rock. Thus, any attempt to pull him up would snap him like a twig. In desperation, the city is considering more unorthodox solutions. Grasping the child firmly in his talons, Socrates here will fly him to safety! Just watch! I don't think he's coming back. With this hook, and this hunk of chocolate, I'll land your boy. And I'll clean him for free. Although we can't reach your boy, we can freeze him with liquid nitrogen so that future generations can rescue him. Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty, we ask you to watch over little Timmy O'Toole, trapped in that well. Bart! What's wrong with you? Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero. How do you mean, dad? Well, he fell down a well... and can't get out... How does that make him a hero? Well, it's more than you did! And finally, Channel Six's own Krusty the Clown has gathered members of the entertainment community -- who normally steer clear of fashionable causes -- for a video called ""We're Sending Our Love Down The Well."" I wanted to do something to help that boy. So I called my good friend Sting. He said, ""Krusty, when do you need me?"" I said Thursday -- he said, ""I'm busy Thursday"" -- I said, ""What about Friday?"" He said, ""Friday's worse than Thursday."" Then he said, ""How about Saturday?"" I said, ""Fine."" True story. Yeah, I used to open for Krusty in uh, '69. In fact, he fired me as I recall. Sting. But this isn't about show business. This is about some kid down a hole, or something, and we've all got to do what we can. THERE'S A HOLE IN MY HEART / AS DEEP AS A WELL / FOR THAT POOR LITTLE BOY / WHO'S STUCK HALF-WAY TO HELL. THOUGH WE CAN'T GET HIM OUT / WE'LL DO THE NEXT BEST THING. WE'LL GO ON TV AND SING, SING, SING. AND WE'RE SENDING OUR LOVE DOWN THE WELL! ALL THE WAY DOWN. WE'RE SENDING OUR LOVE DOWN THE WELL! DOWN THAT WELL! Krusty, what are your plans for the royalties? Well, we gotta pay for promotion, shipping, distribution... you know, those limos out back -- they aren't free... Whatever's left, we throw down the well. Authentic Timmy O'Toole baby teeth! Six dollars a bag! Step to the rear... plenty of room in the back. Awww. Drop that microphone! Drop it, boy! This is a special report from Channel Six news. Disturbing news from the old town well, where young Timmy O'Toole has apparently taken a turn for the worse. I... a, it's very simple, Kent. The child is reverting to a feral, or wolf-like, state. Here's an artist's conception. Bart! I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but I couldn't get through my sock. Goodnight everybody. Bart Simpson! The thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness and love of the entire community. When they find out you've been fooling them, they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors. Oh yeah? And how are they gonna find out? The police will catch you sooner or later. The police. They couldn't catch a cold. Maybe not, but I bet you're stupid enough to have left a ""Property of Bart Simpson"" label on that radio. And Cinderella had the most beautiful gown at the ball. With eight satin petticoats, each more delicate than the last. I think he's asleep. Want to get a cup of coffee? Okay. Brave little guy. Hey, I almost tripped over this thing. What did I do to deserve this? Help! Help! I fell down the well. Tell us something we don't know. No! My name is Bart Simpson! What are you doing down there? Look, I'll level with you. There is no Timmy O'Toole. It was just a prank I was playing on everybody. Well, you sure fooled us, kid. Hey, I got an idea for a prank. Let's go home and go to sleep. . Good one, Eddie. Great joke, guys. Ha ha. Ha. Guys? So I'm afraid your son is trapped down the well. You must think we're the worst parents in the world. Yeah, that's... pretty much the feeling down at the station. Don't worry, son. Just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll... Ow! Knock it off you bald boob! Hey, don't make me come down there! Like to see you fit. Why, you little -- Put a man on him. I liked the other boy. So polite. What are you doing to save my baby boy? Uh well, ma'am, we've located a piece of machinery in Shreveport, Louisiana, that could pop him out lickety-split. Well, why don't you get it? Well, I'm afraid we've got a budget problem, Mrs. Simpson. Your boy picked a bad time to fall down a well. Had he done it at the start of the fiscal year, no problemo. You're telling me that the city won't pay to get a boy out of a well? Well, they would have for Timmy. People loved that little guy. But your son, well, he kinda played us all for a bunch of saps. So it seems we've all been the victims of a cruel hoax, perpetrated by a ten-year-old-hooligan. The time has come for finger-pointing. And most of them are squarely aimed at the boy's parents. It's not our fault. We didn't want the boy, he was an accident. Homer! Uh, could you edit that last part out? Mr. Simpson, we're live coast-to-coast. One plus one plus three is five/ Little Bart Simpson's buried alive / He's so neat / He's so sweet / Now the rats have Bart to eat. Hey, stop that! Sorry, Lisa. How many days until Bart croaks. One, two, three, four... And our new number one hit, ""I Do Believe We're Naked"", by Funky C Funky Do, replaces ""We're Sending Our Love Down The Well"", which plunges all the way down to number ninety-seven. Ever since I've called for the rescue of that Simpson lad, I 'Have taken a lot of heat. So, I am flip-flopping. I say, ""Let him stay down there!"" Yeah, Shutton here. Now that's a story! Bart? Honey, I made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're down in the well. Mom, it's too big. Don't worry, you'll grow into it. Homer! You know, I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years. I guess now I'm paying the price. But there's so many things I'll never get a chance to do. Smoke a cigarette, use a fake I.D., shave a swear word in my hair... That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more. I'm gonna get you outta there myself. Now, why didn't I think of that? Agnes, we've got work to do. This is Kent Brockman with a special bulletin. The Lincoln Squirrel has been assassinated. We'll stay with the story all night if we have to. What's going on? It's an old fashioned hole diggin'. By gar, it's been a while. The canary! Gas! Out of the hole! Gentlemen, this canary died of natural causes. Back in the hole! Sting, you look tired. Maybe you should take a rest. Not while one of my fans needs me. Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play one of your albums-- Shh! Marge, he's a good digger. Sting! Mom! Dad! Oh Bart, I've missed you so much. Man, I was so scared. Don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again. That should do it.","Mayor Joe Quimby, Wanda, Operator, D.J., Sailor, Chief Wiggum, Eddie, Lou, Milhouse Van Houten, JANEY, Rosarita, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Executive, Kent Brockman, Crowd, Homer Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, Sideshow Mel, Groundskeeper Willie, Station Announcer, Dr. Marvin Monroe, Señor Beaver-otti, Teenager, Krusty the Clown, Teenage Clerk, Dave Shutton, TV Announcer, Selma Bouvier, Martin Prince, Rod Flanders, Fat Cop, Kids, Sting, McBain, Choir, Todd Flanders, Bernard, Jasper Beardly, Old Lady #1, Weasel, Barber, Robot Animals, Souvenir Hawker, Professor Jonathan Frink, M.C., Boy, Bart Simpson, Robot Weasel, Patty Bouvier, Falcon Man",8.5,1365.0,13,1992-01-09,1992,3,Radio Bart,24.2,58919.0
