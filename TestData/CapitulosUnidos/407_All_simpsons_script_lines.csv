403,407,"Lame, lame, lame, lame, have it, lame, Superman Dies, Aquaman Dies, Casper Dies, Caveman Robin, Black Robin, Born-Again Robin... Whoa! The infamous Wolverine comic with pop-out claws! Why was this so controversial? Nice work, Doctor Boo-Who. Your tears have smudged Wolverine's iconic sideburns. Hence, you must buy this comic. And the cost of your innocent accident is... Twenty-five dollars, please. But that's the money Yaya Sophia gave me for Greek Orthodox Easter. I hate when they tell me things about themselves. You should stop being so mean to us kids. Well, I suppose you could buy your comics somewhere else. Maybe they sell comics at the dry cleaners. No? Perhaps they sell comics at the mattress store. No? Or, perhaps you could buy your comics at that new comic book store across the street?! Philip K. Dick! It can't be! It is as if Superman moved to Gotham City! Which he did, in World's Finest Comics number ninety-four. See? That was an imaginary story -- dreamt by Jimmy Olsen after he was kicked in the head by Supergirl's horse, Comet. It never really happened! None of these things ever really happened. Get out of my store. Grand opening! Hey what up, you guys? How g-g-goes it?! My name's Milo -- and this is Coolsville! Now listen, before everyone chills with some sweet comic B's, everyone gets a free piece of Japanese hard candy! One for you. / Short kid in back. / Down low. / Go long! I got prawn! I got miso! I got dolphin. Now, I hope you all like Korean pop covers of Tom Jones songs. 'Cause they're about to be blasted! AHN YOUNG PUSSYCAT / WHAA WHAA WAAAAA AHN YOUNG PUSSYCAT / WHAA WHAA WAAAAA PUSSYCAT PUSSYCAT / NAHN GOAT DOH EET / GO HAHM GAY HI SHEE / GAW DO MAHN-OO-NEE / NAHN GAW SO PEE YUH WOON NEE KOO ROOM GOOM YA BAW Asterix! Tintin! I heard these only existed in high school French classes. Come on Snowy, we must save the Belgian Ambassador from the Black Orchid Gang! What's that? A sound of ignition? Zut alors! This castle is actually a four-stage rocket -- and it's headed straight for the Pompidou Center! Oh no, I ripped it. Hey, no worries, little lady. These books are meant to be read and enjoyed, not hoarded and then sold when you get divorced. / Whoa, he's so cool! / All right, I get it. You're cool, you're not ""mainstream,"" you wear a porkpie hat... Mmm... porkpie. ...but let's see what you know about super-heroes. Hey, I'm all about the capes! Flame on! Who's stronger? The Thung or The Mulk? And show your work. Whoa-ho, head rush! Okay, well, the Mulk kicked a tidal wave into the sun... Whereas... The Thung gave a piggyback ride to the nineteen eighty-five Chicago Bears... Woo, boy, that's a tough one. What do you think? You want to know what I think? Does Galactus eat planets? Of course I do. Wow. I was in such a bad relationship with my ex-Comic Book Guy. I'd forgotten how good it could be! Bye, Bart! Enjoy your funny books! Look Maggie, I'm Wonder Woman. I've lost my perfect twenty-six, twenty-six, twenty-six figure. Never compare yourself to a standee. Hey, you're way skinnier than a lot of superheroes... Girthquake, Flaberella... Kearney's Mom... Shut up! Her depression medication makes her bloated! She's depressed 'cause you're so lame. Shut up! I'd better join a gym before I go from hippy to hippo. I wish my Mom said cute things like that. She can't 'cause she's depressed. Shut up! Look at all these alternative comic book creators... Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman... Oh, Dan Clowes! I really identified with the girls in ""Ghost World."" They made me feel like I wasn't so alone. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Do you know anyone who works at ""Batman?"" 'Cause I really want to draw ""Batman."" I'm awesome at utility belts. Check these out. This is where the Batman keeps his money in case he has to take the bus. Mm-hm. Alan Moore, you wrote my favorite issues of Radioactive Man! Oh really. So you like that I made your favorite superhero a heroin-addicted jazz critic who's not radioactive? I don't read the words. I just like when he punches people. How do you make his costume stick so close to his muscles? Mr. Moore, will you sign my DVD of ""Watchmen Babies?"" Which of the babies is your favorite? You see what those bloody corporations do? They take your ideas and they suck them! Suck them like leeches until they've gotten every last drop of the marrow from your bones! Hey, Teacup, why don't you chill out? Very well. OH, LITTLE LULU, I LOVE YOU-LU, JUST THE SAME. Attention, comic book aficionados! This man is not one of us! He has a girlfriend! My name's Strawberry. My purse is a lunchbox. Now listen up, my wayward little fanboys. I have the most wonderful news. My store now sells ninja weapons. Whoa! You would sell weapons of the orient to children? That is weak. Face the facts, has-been. This man is the comic book guy our town deserves! Very well, I guess the mature thing to do is-- Oh no! The store's in trouble! League of Extraordinary Freelancers activate! Maus is in the house! How do ya like this punchline? Ooh, L.A.! This could be the gym for me. You're gonna get so ripped here. We've got Tummy Tone with Sasha... Power Bounce with Zach D.... Zen Abs with Zach G.... And you've just gotta try Mommy and Me kickboxing! Who thought walking could be so difficult? Well, I'm sure everyone else is having trouble too. Maybe I'll just hit the showers. Marge, you missed a spot. I wish there was a gym for us regular ladies. ""Rules: no men, no cell phones, no mirrors, no shame"". Marge, I wish you well, but why would women want to go to a gym if there were no men there watching them and judging them? We're gonna be rich! We can finally start a family! We have a family. A better one! Switch stations! I love this gym. Me too! Finally, an exercise bike for women of a certain age -- Jurassic! Mom, every workout appointment is booked up for months! We'll have to open a second Shapes. We just need to find a vacant rental property. Hmm... I can't believe the Labor Board is shuttin' me down. You lock your workers in at night. It's so they can't tell their stories. Mr. Krusty came to my village. He said he would marry me. No ring! Just fill apple pies all day! Today's guest created the women's-only gym that's taking the tri-county area by storm: MARGE SIMPSON! Marge. I thank you for creating ""Shapes""... and uh, my boyfriend thanks you too. When is Straightman gonna pop the question? Uh, uh-- You're all getting German cuckoo clocks! You're getting a cuckoo clock! And you're getting a cuckoo clock! And you're getting a cuckoo clock! And you're getting a cuckoo clock! Oh yeah, Marge, I love these business trips of yours. The TV remote isn't nailed on. My whole life, I've never been in a hotel that trusted me. Hors d'oeuvres, big fancy desserts... and my wife is paying for everything. Now I know why pimps are so happy. Yep, nothing beats living on ""wife-support"". I hear that. Yo guys, come meet a new husband! Hey, how ya doin'? I'm Homer. My wife invented a gym for ""regular"" women. My wife invented ""SkyPills."" She uh, mixed vitamins with Alka-Seltzer and pretended it was medicine. I pay ten dollars a tube for those! That's why I drive a Bentley. Yeah, I haven't decided what kind of new car to get. Well, you better decide soon. 'Cause I have a feeling your wife will also be getting a ""new model."" Yeah, she'll be ""trading up."" And they're not talking about cars. Are you sure they're not talking about cars? Because those are car words. Homer, we're all second husbands. As soon as our wives hit it big, they dumped the fat old guys they were with and married us. Yes! Marge won't dump me. I'm the anchor that keeps her weighed down. Mmm-hmm. Here's how it starts: she gets a total makeover and she starts wearing fancy new clothes. Then she stops wanting to tell you about her day. Here's how you know she's really about to go: your wife seems happy and full of life. That will never happen! Marge! Marge! A makeover! Oh my God! The prophecy is being fulfilled. Um, so... tell me about your day. Oh, you don't want to hear about my boring old day. I do! I do! Well, the first inspirational speech of the day was by the woman who climbed Mount Everest and got everyone else killed. Hey, the networks have different channels in this city. That's okay. I don't care that you don't care. Go watch your thing. Are you happy and full of life? I sure am! Marge, now that you're rich, you really should get rid of that bag. Really? But I'm so used to my old one. Old one?! They're convincing Marge to dump me! Oh, it's easy. I get a new one every two years. From Italy! You would love a big black one. Marge, get away from them! What's gotten into you? I'm going to the successful ladies room! You guys gotta help me! If Marge leaves I'll have nothing except my many friends, and half the fortune she is now making and will continue to make. Homer, I'm gonna let you in on a secret. I'm a first husband. I used to look like this. What's your secret? Oh, there's no secret. Just hard work... Uh-huh. ...exercise two hours a day... Okay. ...keep up with the latest fashions... Fashions. ...and of course, cut out all fatty foods and alcohol. Uh-huh, uh-huh... got it. I know just what it'll take to hang onto Marge. Mr. Simpson, let me outline the gastric bypass surgery procedure for you. Okay? We put a band around your stomach so that no solid food may enter. You see? Just like so... It's a very, very serious operation. You should only undergo it as a last resort. Please, Doc. I know I'm not the greatest looking guy in the world, but I took care of my family, and that used to be enough. But not anymore. Very well. If you wish, we can perform the procedure in the office, today. And I know how I can knock myself out. I'll look at your bill. Hm. I guess considering all the training you've received, this is quite reasonable. I've never seen anything so reasonable! It's the bargain of a lifetime! And-- Dad, are you okay? I see food on your plate instead of blurring motions. Kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother. You had your hot dog plumped? No, I had my stomach stapled! All food tastes like barf now. Homie, I'm back! Welcome home, Marge. You remembered I like romance! A smart successful woman like you deserves the very best. You also remembered I like flattery! Do you like guys who are... attractive? Homie, you look good! All for you, baby. Let me get a good look at you! Whoa, whoa, whoa -- slow down, sexy beast. Why don't you take some time to savor the front? What are you hiding from me? Is it chocolate? Uh, it used to be. Whoa! Those buns are poppin' fresh! Yeah, I'm gonna turn off the lights now. And I'll just fold this old sweaty blanket and put it in the closet. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Doctor, I'm embarrassed to show my body to my wife. And it's all because of your surgery! You want me to unstaple your stomach? No, I want you to give me every other surgery you have so I can look good! And can you call it an aortic valve replacement so my insurance will cover it? No problem. Okay, count backwards from ten. Fine, I admit it. I'm drunk! And so, to honor her success, I bestow upon Marge Simpson this hundred dollar gift card to Sweatpants Etcetera. Did someone order a super stud? My implants feel itchy. Yes, I was out of silicone rubber so I used rolled-up socks. He's a monster! Pitchforks, everyone. Monster! Monster! Monster! Monster! Cut his heart out! Different from us! Different from us! Listen, Homer, I gotta be honest with you... You better not make me cry. 'Cause I don't know where my tear ducts are anymore. I appreciate you trying to become more attractive for me. But the truth is... I'm way too successful for you now. I'm gettin' me a trophy husband! I don't want to live without you, Marge. Okay. Noooo! Huh? Why do I look like me again? The doctor called me about all the crazy surgeries you wanted. And I said no. But I did have him unstaple your stomach and turn you back into the sweet man I love. Then it was all a dream. I never became a hideous monster. The only person who thinks you're a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath. And Dad, I hope you learned something from this. I sure have. Plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good. When it is, everyone should get it. Amen. Listen Marge... I've been wondering all these years, what is it about me that you find so irresistible? Let's face it... you could do better. Well, maybe I could. But every time I look at you, I see the same adorable boy I fell in love with. Aw... Well, there's nothing like a happy ending. Holy heavens! Is that a meteor heading for the earth? Maybe. But tonight there's a benefit for underpaid comic book artists of the forties and fifties. To the cash bar!
