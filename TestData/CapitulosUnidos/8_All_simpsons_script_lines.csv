7,8,"You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... Oh, oh. Look, there it is! The head! Kill him! They've got us cornered, boy. We'll never get away. Give me the head. No, dad. This whole thing was my fault. You run along. Son, we're in this mess together. No matter how tempting it might be, I can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a blood-thirsty mob. Aw, dad. We'll die together, like a father and son should. Look, now we've got 'em. Hey, it's Homer Simpson. And his kid, Bart. Murderous mob. I beg you to spare our lives. At least until you've heard the story of how we ended up with the head of our beloved town founder. How long will this story take? Ah... about twenty three minutes and five seconds. Well, all right, go ahead. Okay. It all started Sunday morning... Kids, we're late for church. Get your butts down here right now. Ready for inspection, Mom. Very nice, Maggie. And Lisa you look lovely. Bart, assume the position. Oh, Bart. Now where's your father? Get him! Phillips has broken free. He's at the 45, 50, the 40, the 30, the 20, the 10. Oh no. Touchdown. No! A 64 yard run. We've got an upset in the making! No we don't. Try being objective for once in your... oooh! Let's go, Homer. But you don't understand, Marge. I have fifty bucks riding on this game. Don't forget, big double header action this Sunday, beginning at 12:30 eastern. Spend the whole day with us. Oh Homer, you promised me... This isn't gambling, Marge. It's a lead pipe cinch. They're kicking off. Wolodarsky takes it to the five and -- Oh my! He fumbles. Oh no! It's recovered in the end zone. Another touchdown! No! This is going to send the whole standings topsy turvy. Why should I feel like a traffic cop every Sunday morning when I'm just trying to get a little goodness into the family. Where is it. The game... where is it? Ah! All right Kogen's got Wolodarsky open in the end zone. He throws it. Catch it! catch it! It's complete. Touchdown! All right! Oh Doctor, we got a barn burner here. This could be the most remarkable comeback since Lazarus rose from the dead. Lazar who? C'mon everybody, we're late. Bart, I want you to promise me you'll pay attention in Sunday school. Bart? Bart? BART!! Whoa! Are you talking to me? What's this? A personal stereo? Were you going to listen to rock music in Sunday school? Maybe. Can you believe this, Homer? ... Homer? ... Homer? Oh no, no. We stink, we stink! Homer! Were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over? Maybe. It's because of your irreverent attitude that Bart thinks he can sneak headphones into Sunday school. Now, move it! Now, here's the kick-off. Wolodarsky takes it to the five -- Oh, my! He fumbles. Will my dog, Pepper, be there? I'm sorry but the answer is no. Why not? Because heaven is for people. What about my cat, Snowball? I'm sorry but the answer is no. Will there be cavemen in heaven? Certainly not. Uh ma'am, what if you're a really good person but you're in a really, really bad fight and your leg gets gangrene and it has to be amputated; will it be waiting for you in heaven? For the last time Bart, yes! And now I'd like to begin today's sermon which I have entitled, ""Gambling, the 8th Deadly Sin."" Today is Sunday, the Lord's day and yet, at this very moment, millions of Americans are not in the Lord's house. They're in their own house worshipping a false idol, professional football. Oh Lord... It's a beautiful Sunday. Perfect football weather for this incredible game. And by the way, this game is being brought to you by the good people at Duff Beer. You can't get enough of that wonderful Duff. Now, they're lining up for this crucial kick. One final tick of the clock remains. If they win, it will cap an amazing comeback. But it's a 49 yard field goal into the wind. Make it, make it, make it, make it. The kick is up. It's got the distance. Holy toledo, it's good! Oh please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please. It's good! It's good! It's good! It's good to see you all in church. Please be seated, Homer. Yeah. Sit down, Homer. The ventriloquist goes to heaven, but the dummy doesn't. Oh, oh, oh, me. Bart. What about a robot with a human brain? I don't know. All these questions... Is a little blind faith too much to ask? Don't forget next week... remember to read... That was very nice father. I was pleased you enjoyed it. I seem to have struck a cord with you today, Homer. What? Oh yeah. You were great. Homer, you embarrassed us in front of the whole congregation, and today's sermon was one you should have really listened to. What was it about? Gambling. Oh! He didn't by any chance say that under certain circumstances it was all right, did he? No! Look, I don't want to talk about this anymore in front of the kids. Lisa, Bart, what did you two learn in Sunday school today? The answers to deep theological questions.. Yeah. Among other things, apes can't get into heaven. What! Those cute little monkeys? That's terrible. Who told you that? Our teacher. I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars? Ah, cool, man. Space Mutants 4. Drop me off! Drop me off! No way, Jose. Marge. They're only space mutants. Um mmm. I know what those movies are like. Killing innocent people, eating human flesh. You just get a lot of bad ideas. Hey, Dad. Can I have five bucks? I hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see? Perish the thought. Here you go, son. Share the wealth, that's what I always say. Da da da da da da de de de Whoa! Ugh, Cowabunga! Hey, hot dog! What? Nice dismount, man. It didn't hurt. Oh yeah? Well, do it again. Nah. I might land on my face and end up lookin' like you. You little punk. Hey man, leave the kid alone. I like him. You do? Yeah! You're witty. So what's your name, man? I'm Bart Simpson. This here's KEARNEY and I'm Jimbo. You don't need an introduction. You're the worst kid in school. Thanks. Psst. Coast is clear. You guys are sneakin' in? Yeah. Only saps pay to see movies. Hey Bart, come on. But sneaking into a movie is practically stealing man. Practically? It is stealing. Well, okay. I just wanted to make sure we weren't deluding ourselves. Wait, I think I hear something. Come on, loosen up, baby. There's nobody here but you and me. No. Stop it, I think I hear something... not human. Let's get romantic. Well, okay. You little sneaks. You're comin' with me. Next time you little hoodlums try this, I'm calling your parents. Oh yeah? Well, we don't want to see your crummy movie, anyway. Yeah! We'll take our business elsewhere. You know, Bart, I've been kicked out of all four space mutants movies. Wow, man! Three jumbo cherry Squishees and one double jumbo original flavor, sir. Okay. But, don't you kids take anything. I'm watching you. I've got eyes in the back of my head. Four fifty-two. Don't worry, guys. It's on me. Share the wealth, that's what I always say. Guys? Guys! Hey, guys, where'd you get all that great stuff? Five finger discount, man. You ripped it off? Yeah! Thanks for coverin' for us, man. Ugh! Go on, Bart. But that guy founded Springfield. He built our first hospital out of logs and mud. If it weren't for him all the settlers would have died in the great blizzard of forty eight. So...? So... watch me hit him right between the eyes. Hey. What are you doing there? Show a little respect, you insolent little thugs. Oooh. We're really scared. Hey, hey, you! Hey! Hey you! You know, when you look up at clouds in the sky they start lookin' like stuff. No, they don't. Yeah, they do. Like that one over there looks just like a cherry bomb. Hey, you're right. And look at that one. It looks like a guy with a switchblade stuck in his back. Yeah! That one looks like a school bus going over a cliff in flames with kids inside screaming. That one looks like the statue of our town founder, Jebediah Springfield. Does not. Does too. I mean without the head, of course. Oh, yeah. I wish someone really would cut his ugly old head off. You do? Yeah. That'd be cool. Sure would cheese everybody off. But guys, come on. Don't you remember history class? Jebediah once killed a bear with his bare hands. Oh. Sorry. We forgot how much you love Jebediah Springfield. Yeah. He's your boyfriend. C'mon guys, knock it off! Beat it, Simpson. Man, I thought you were cool. Beat it, Simpson. I thought you were cool. Ah! Wow! Look at these bowling balls, Maggie. Can you think of a better way for Daddy to spend his hard won fifty bucks? Now I've seen everything. Black marbleized with a liquid center. The ""Stealth Bowler"" -- the pins don't know what hit 'em. Dad, can I talk to you about something? Sure, boy. What's on your mind? Well... I was wondering... how important is it to be popular? I'm glad you asked, son. Being popular is the most important thing in the world. So like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better? You're not talking about killing anyone, are you? No. Are you? No. Then run along you little scamp. A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center. What have I done? Bart, are you all right? Oh yeah. Top of the world, Ma. Well then come down for breakfast. Oooh. Look at this one. ""The Hammer of Thor. It will send your pins to Valhalla."" Lisa? Valhalla is where Vikings go when they die. Ooooh, that's some ball. G-o-o-o-d morning, everybody. We interrupt Mambo in the Morning to bring you this special news bulletin. The statue of Jebediah Springfield, our illustrious town founder, was brutally decapitated last night in an act of senseless vandalism. We now go to Police Chief Wiggum at City Hall. Well, we have no witnesses, no suspects and no leads. If anyone has any information please dial ""oh"" and ask for the police. That number again, ""oh."" Stay tuned to this station for further developments as they break. It's just a statue. It's a statue of the trailblazing founder of our town. It's a symbol of what we can all do if we put our minds to it. Just a statue? Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue? Is the Leaning Tower of Piza just a statue? Uh-oh. School bus. C'mon Lis. School bus. Go on, Lisa. We've all got to be brave just like Jebediah when he killed that bear. It's so awful. Okay, come on, come on everybody. We've got to get on with our lives. Let's try and put this tragedy behind us. You're right, Moe. A beer, please, and make sure there's a head on it. Ohhhh. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Hell in a handbasket. I hope they find the punk who did this and I hope they cut his head off. Hi guys. What's up? We were just saying we'd love to meet the guy who cut off the head of that statue. Yeah, we wish he were here right now. Oh, really? Yeah, we'd break every bone in his stupid little body. Yeah, that's right, man. Limb by limb. Yeah, man. What? But, but yesterday didn't you say it would be cool to cut off the head and really cheese everybody off? That was just cloud talk, man. Yeah! I mean throwin' rocks is one thing, but I would never cut the head off of a guy who iced a bear with his bare hands? So what's in the bag, Bart? My head. I said, what's in the bag, Bart? Go ahead, Bart. Tell them. It's the head of Jebediah Springfield. I gotta go. Look what you've done. You want to be popular. Now you're the most hated boy in town. You're not really talking to me. You're just my overactive imagination. Oh, I am, am I? Shut up... I wanted them to like me. Ummm, the child seems rattled. Can you blame him? No, no I can't. There, there, Mr. Burns. Blow, sir. Hey Bart, where you going? To my room. Why don't you watch ""Krusty The Clown""? There is someone out there, in Krustyland who has committed an atrocity. If you know who cut off Jebediah's head, I don't care if it's your brother, your sister, your daddy, or your mommy turn them in... and Krusty will send you a free slide whistle just like Sideshow Bob's. Wait a minute. I hope you're not planning to do what I think you're doing. Sorry, man. It's either you or me. You know, Bart, you don't have to found a town to be a hero. Sometimes a hero can be a young boy with the courage to stand up and admit he's made a mistake. Yeah, well I'm running a little short on courage right now. Anyway, think about. Will you, son? Jebediah Obediah Zachariah Jedediah Springfield came West in 1838. Along the way he met a ferocious bear and killed him with his bare that's b-a-r-e hands. Although modern historians recently uncovered evidence that the bear, in fact, probably killed him. But whether bear killed man, or man killed bear, a burgeoning town, Springfield, was born. Mom, Dad. I knew it all along. Why, Bart, why? Yeah? Why you little... 'Cause I wanted some really bad kids to like me. Somehow I got the idea that being popular was the most important thing in the world. Where did you get a ridiculous idea like that? Lay off the boy, Marge. He's a good kid. Quit givin' him the third degree. Homer, did you have something to do with this? Well, maybe I am a little responsible. A little? C'mon, son. Let's take the head thing back to the authorities. You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... Oh, oh. Look, there it is! The head! Kill him! We know this part. Oh yeah, right... Well, that's my story. And if you still want to tear apart this young Sunday school student as he stands on the brink of salvation, I await your wrath. Oohhh! Somehow I don't feel like killing anymore. Neither do I. Dad? Forgive me, sir. No problem, Bart. Look. It's glorious It's beautiful, man. I love you, Smithers. The feeling is more than mutual, sir. Good going, son. But remember, most lynch mobs aren't this nice.","Tv Announcer #1, Announcer #1, Waylon Smithers, Chief Wiggum, Milhouse Van Houten, DOLPH, JANEY, Marge Simpson, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, C.
