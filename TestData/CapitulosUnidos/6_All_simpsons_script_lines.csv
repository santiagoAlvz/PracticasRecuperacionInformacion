5,6,"Lisa! Lisa, are you still in there? What's the problem? Did you fall in? Lisa! Sorry, Dad. Women and children first. Wha' th-- Where the hell are my keys? Who stole my keys? Come on, I'm late for work. Oh, Homer, you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to your neck. Did you check the den? The den! Great idea! Warm... no, cold... colder... Ice cold. Do you know where my keys are? No. I'm talking about your breakfast. Did you try the rumpus room? Rumpus room. Great idea! Oh, Dad... Here. I'm sorry, everybody. But I've only got two cupcakes for the three of you. Well, Mom, one of us has scarfed down more than enough cupcakes over the past three decades to keep him... Bart! Just take mine. A simple cupcake will bring me no pleasure. Oh yeah! All right. Hey, hey! All right, class, from the top. One and two and... three and. Lisa... Lisa Simpson! Lisa, there's no room for crazy bebop in ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee."" But, Mr. Largo, that's what my country's all about. What? I'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of its car. The Iowa farmer whose land has been taken away by unfeeling bureaucrats. The West Virginia coal miner, coughing up his... Well, that's all fine and good, but Lisa, none of those unpleasant people are going to be at the recital next week. Now, class. From the top. Five, six, seven... Every day at noon a bell rings and they herd us in here for feeding time. And we sit around like cattle, chewing our cuds, dreading the inevitable... Food fight! C'mon, Lees, what are you waiting for? Chuck that spaghetti! I choose not to participate. Lisa, we are playing dodge ball here. The object of the game is to avoid the ball by weaving or ducking out of its path. In other words, to dodge the ball. Listen, missy, just tell me why you weren't getting out of the way of those balls. I'm too sad. Too sad to play dodge ball? That's ridiculous. Now, let's see some enthusiasm! Play ball! Come on, come on. Let's go. In the red trunks, with a record of forty-eight wins and no losses, the undisputed champ of this house, Battling Bart Simpson. Whoopee! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! And in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and forty-eight defeats -- oh, correction, humiliating defeats -- all of them by knockout... Must you do this every time? ...Homer ""The Human Punching Bag"" Simpson. Boo! Boo! Hiss! And Homer is down! Three seconds, folks -- a new record! Oh, no! I'm not down, I'm -- get up, you! Get up! Come on! Okay. Here we go. Yo, chump, you back again? Get out of the way! How come he's not ducking? Ugh! Wait a minute, I can't get my... Get out of the way, stupid! Homer? Not now, Marge. Ohhh... get out of the corner! But they sent a note from school. What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oop. Get out of the way. I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it. There's no way they can prove anything. No, Bart. This note isn't about you. It isn't? There must be some mistake. Hey, you're right. This note's about Lisa. Lisa? ""Lisa refuses to play dodge ball because she is sad."" Well, she doesn't look sad. I don't see any tears in her eyes. It's not that kind of sad. I'm sorry, Dad, but you wouldn't understand. Oh, sure I would, princess. I have feelings, too. You know, like ""my stomach hurts"" or ""I'm going crazy"". Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee and tell him all about it? I'm just wondering, what's the point? Would it make any difference at all if I never existed? How can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world? Well... eh... er...eh... Come on, Lisa... ride the Homer horsey. Giddiyap! Whee! Lisa, honey, why don't we go upstairs and I'll draw you a nice hot bath? That helps me when I feel sad. Sorry, Dad. I know you mean well. Thanks for knowing I mean well. Gee, Homer. Looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands. You're right. Bart, vacuum this floor! Hey, man, I didn't do anything wrong. In times of trouble, you got to go with what you know. Now hop to it, boy! Stupid Homer... Thinks he's so big... Stupid Homer... Stupid Homer. I'll show him. Enjoy your bath? No. Not really. Oh. Too bad. Well, I certainly had fun vacuuming. Maybe now I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub. So typical of Bart. All he thinks about is himself. Hey, don't say stuff like that about me to Maggie. She's on my side, anyway. Is not. Is, too. Is not. Is, too. Is not. Is, too. Watch, I'll prove it. Maggie, come to the one you love best. No, Maggie! Come here, girl. Come to me. Come on, Maggie. The choice is obvious. No, Maggie, don't go for the glitter. Look for substance. All right Maggie, just go to Bart. Exactly, come to the one you love. Oh, no, come on! Don't let that boy -- get out of the... Oh, no, not again! Don't. Don't. Don't. Great, get over. Oh, geeze. Gee, Dad, you're really bad at this. I am not. It's just that I couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. Lisa! Lisa! Lisa, what did I tell you about playing that saxamathing in the house? I was just playing the blues... ...Dad. Lisa, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. Go ahead -- play your blues if it'll make you happy. No, that's okay, Dad. I'll just work on my fingering. Unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you. Let's hear it. You just clack as loud as you want. Lis. I've got to find that sound. That was beautiful. What's it called? It's a little tune that I call the ""I Never Had An Italian Suit Blues."" Wait, Margie. Before you go out that door, let's put our happy face on. Because people know how good a mommy you have by the size of your smile. What th... Put up your dukes, Homer. Bart, go easy on me. I'm your Dad. I am going easy on you, but you're just so old and slow and weak and pathetic. No, Bart, no. Homer, wake up! Wake up! Oh my, here let me wipe off that drool. You know Marge, getting old is a terrible thing. I think the saddest day of my life is when I realized I could beat my dad at most things. And Bart experienced that at the age of four. So why are you still awake? Well, I'm still trying to figure out what's bothering Lisa. I don't know, Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs attention, but all the while our little Lisa's becoming a young woman. Oh, so that's it. This is some kind of underwear thing. Good night, Homer. Now -- low B-flat. Okay, Lisa -- altissimo register. Very nice, very nice. I once ruptured myself doing that. Thanks, Mr. Murphy. My friends call me Bleeding Gums. Ew! How'd you get a name like that? Well, let me put it this way. You ever been to the dentist? Yeah. Not me. I suppose I should go to one, but I got enough pain in my life as it is. I have problems, too. Well, I can't help you, kid. I'm just a terrific horn player with tons of soul. But I can jam with you. Okay. OH I'M SO LONELY, SINCE MY BABY LEFT ME / I GOT NO MONEY, AND NOTHING IS FREE / OH I BEEN SO LONELY, SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN / ALL I GOT IS THIS RUSTY... THIS RUSTY OLD HORN. ""I got a bratty brother / He bugs me every day / And this mornin' my own mother, she gave my last cupcake away! / My Dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo / I'm the sa...dest kid in grade number two."" You know, you play pretty well for someone with no real problems. Yeah, but I don't feel any better. The blues isn't about feeling better. It's about making other people feel worse and making a few bucks while you're at it. Which reminds me, if you're ever in the neighborhood, I'm playing at a little club called the Jazz Hole... Lisa, get away from that jazzman! But Mom, can't I... stay a little longer? Come on, come on. We were worried about you. Nothing personal. I just fear the unfamiliar. Today's fire raced through downtown Springfield gutting Symphony Hall, the Springfield Museum of Natural History, the Springfield Arts Center... And Barney's Bowl-a-Rama. Fire officials said the two-alarm blaze took them more than an hour to get under control. Oh, no, Marge! Marge, are you all right? No, I'm very upset. Then you've heard. Oh, God. What are we doing to do? The lanes were kinda warped but, oh, the food! I'm upset about Lisa. Oh. Me, too. Me three. What are we talking about? Bart! Do you think you're being nice enough to your sister, Bart? Oh, yeah. Easy. You do love her, don't you? Oh, Mom. Well you do, don't you? Don't make me say it. I know the answer, you know the answer, he knows the answer, let's just drop it. Okay? Okay, Bart, you don't have to say it, but you do have to have a loving attitude. Be nice to your sister. Okey-dokey. Go on, Bart. No time like the present. Hi, man. I don't want your pity. Aw come on, I'll cheer you up. How? Yeah! Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking. Is Jacques there? Who? Jacques. Last name Strap. Hold on. Uh..Jacques Strap! Hey, guys, I'm looking for a Jacques Strap! What -- oh! Wait a minute -- Jacques Strap? It's you, isn't it? You cowardly little runt. When I get hold of you I am gonna gut you like a fish and drink your blood. Where's your sense of humor, man? Lisa, you'll be late for band practice. Let's go. Gimme some quarters. I'm doing my laundry. Yeah, right. Where's the video boxing? It's over there in the corner, but if I were you, I really would use those quarters for laundry. Hey, that kid's pretty good. Good? Are you kidding? Over two thousand fights, and he's still on his original quarter. Okay? Who's next? Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! No, me! No, Me! Listen -- can you teach me to fight like you do? I don't think so. Aw, come on. I'll tell you what, I'll do it if you bark like a dog. You little... Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! You got yourself a deal, Fido. Well, looks like you're all out of quarters, old man. That's okay. With the tips you've given me, I'm going to pound the tar out of a certain little smarty pants tonight. Howie! I thought I told you to stop wasting your money in this stupid place. Uh-oh. Sorry, Mom. And you! A man of your age! You should be ashamed of yourself! Excuse me. I think I hear my wife calling. Now, Lisa, listen to me. This is important. I want you to smile today. But I don't feel like smiling. Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. It's what shows up on the surface that counts. That's what my mother taught me. Take all your bad feelings and push them down, all the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you... and happiness will follow. Come on. You can do better than that. Ah, that's my girl. I feel more popular already. Hey, nice smile. Thanks. Hey! What are you talking to her for? She's just going to say something weird. Not me. You know, I used to think you were some sort of a brainiac, but... I guess you're okay. Uh-huh. Hey, why don't come over to my house after practice? You can do my homework. Okay. Five minutes, people. Five minutes. Now, Miss Simpson, I hope we won't have a repeat of yesterday's outburst of unbridled... creativity. No, sir. Wow, Mom. So that's where she gets it. Lisa, I apologize to you. I was wrong. I take it all back. Always be yourself. You want to be sad, honey, be sad. We'll ride it out with you. And when you get finished feeling sad, we'll still be there. From now on, let me do the smiling for both of us. Okay, Mom. I said you could stop smiling, Lisa. I feel like smiling. I'm going to knock you out one more time and that's it. This is getting boring, man. Just try not to kill me too hard, son. Heh-heh-heh. Whoa! Kid, tonight's not your night. All right, man. You asked for it. No more Mr. Nice Guy. Oh! Oh! Block it. Wha' the... Uh-oh. You missed me. Ha ha! I got you. Don't try that. I got ya. I'll block you. And the crowd is on its feet as Hurricane Homer moves in for the kill. Boys, I'd like your attention, please. Quiet, Marge. This is my big moment. Bart-the-bloody-pulp Simpson is on the ropes. He's hoping I'll put him out of his misery. Well, you're in luck, Bart, here comes my right. Oh, noooo! My game! My game! I coulda beat the boy! Marge, how could you? I was so close. I'm sorry, but this is more important than that silly, loud game. You're right, Mom. I'd just like to use this occasion to announce my retirement, undefeated, from the world of video boxing. Oh, calm down, Homer. Lisa has an idea that she thinks would be fun for the whole family. This next song was written by a friend of mine, one of the great little ladies of jazz. ""I got this bratty brother / He bugs me every day / And this mornin' my own mother, gave my last cupcake away! / My Dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo."" What? I'm the saddest kid in grade number two.","Newsman, Ralph Wiggum, Champ, Boy Onlooker, Moe Szyslak, Homer Simpson, Cashier, Lisa Simpson, Ms. Barr, Kids, Dewey Largo, Woman, Bart Simpson, Bleeding Gums Murphy, Jacqueline Bouvier, JANEY, Stan, Marge Simpson",7.6,1674.0,6,1990-02-11,1990,1,Moaning Lisa,27.4,55355.0
