6,7,"Rusty old hunk of junk. Howdy, Bart. Hot enough for ya? Shut up, Flanders. Hey dad, how come we can't get a decent mower like the Flanders? Just be happy with what you got, son. Don't try to keep up with the Flanderses. How do you like my new wheels, Simpson? Wow, man! What an RV! Bart! I suppose it has..uh..various features? It's got everything! Microwave, dishwasher, big-screen TV, deep fryer, and... see up there on the roof? A satellite dish! Yes indeedilly-doodily. But how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while... you make only twenty-seven dollars a week more than I do. Simple, Simpson. Credit. Oooh! Credit. Thank you God. Heh, heh. May I help you? We're just browsing, thank you. I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth? Yes, I do. That would be... the Ultimate Behemoth. Where is it? Homer. We're standing in its presence. Behold! Isn't she... Look at this thing... Can you believe it? Man built this. It's a vehicle. Does it have its own satellite dish, sir? You can tell your son, it has its own satellite. The VanStar One launched last February, just for this thing. That's all. Oh man! I'm not sure that we can afford... Does it have a deep fryer? It has four of them. One for each part of the chicken. I don't think we can afford this, Homer. Let's worry about that later. C'mon let's take a tour. Want to? C'mon. Aye carumba! This is better than our house! Wait till Flanders gets a load of this. It all seems so expensive... Hey, how much is it? You're a man of convict... You just wanted to ask that and blurted it out. Didn't you? Yeah, how much is it? Well, first of all, I want you to know, I like your face. You do? Really. I really do. I'm not just saying that. I mean it. You've got color in there. You're not Roman are you? No. You look like a God, sort of. Why don't we step into the credit office, Zeus? Hey your dad's just gonna come in here and work it out. Then you'll drive home in this. I'm not gonna quote you a price until I check your credit rating. Lemme. I want to make myself clear on this. This is a formality. If you're saying to me, Bob, is this guy good for it? I say, yes. I don't check this machine. But I don't own the place. Even though my name's up there. Long story. But that doesn't matter. I'm gonna have to run it through the computer. Is that a good siren? Am I approved? You ever known a siren to be good? Ha! No, Mr. Simpson, it's not. It's a bad siren. That's the computer in case I went blind telling me, sell a vehicle to this fellow and you're out of business. That's what the siren says. Oh. It seems the Ultimate Behemoth is a wee bit out of your price range. And wee bit is me being polite. You couldn't afford this thing if you lived to be a million. Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? I don't want to go away empty-handed, Bob. Take it easy there. Don't ruin this feeling I'm getting from you. Perhaps I can show you something a little more... you. Well, what do you think? Used, isn't it? What'd you say? Is it used? Mr. Simpson, you're never gonna own a better RV. And I don't mean that in a good way. I mean literally, buddy, this is it for you. You know, it's this or a wagon. How much do you want for it? This is for you? This is yours? The price I'm quoting you? You're not gonna hand it to someone else? 'Cause I'm gonna give you a price for you, not for someone else... someone else, I'm doubling this. I swear it Bob. This is you and me? Yeah! In other words, two months from now I see this vehicle, your head's in that window? On my honor. Three-fifty a month. Oh, well, I don't know. Would it be alright if I conferred with my family? Mr. Simpson, if you have to go talk it over with those humans out there, then, there's something wrong with all of us. You look like a man who is able to make a decision or I wouldn't be wasting my... See that man right over there? Yeah! He's buying this. Did you know that? No. Called me two minutes before you came in, said, 'Save the little one, I'm coming down'. Here he is. Now, do you want it or not? All right. All right! I'll take it. Best decision you're ever gonna make. You're gonna... This is gonna change your life. Hey Flanders! Look what I got! Oooh, She's a beaut. Hey, congratulations, Simpson. I'm sure you'll have loads of fun. Jealous. Everybody ready? I hate this. I don't want to go. that's the spirit. Ready or not, nature here we come! Turkey farm? No. Skunks? No. Slaughter house? No. What are you two doing back there? We're playing ""What's that odor?"". Dad's feet. Bart! You win, Bart. Lisa! Are we there yet, dad? I'll tell you when we get there. Go back to your smell game. Homer, I'm telling you this is not the Interstate. Pfft. Maps. Shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions? Don't worry. This is an all-terrain vehicle. My feet are getting wet! Ah, come on. We're going back to nature. Mom, I'm scared. We all are, dear. Your father says there's nothing to worry about. What do you think? Should we stop here? Yes!!! All righty. Well, here we are! Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!! Okay, nobody move. Nobody panic. When I give the word, everyone ever so slowly open your door and slide out. On the count of three. One... The Simpsons have entered the forest. Well, heh heh, now we get a chance to be real pioneers. Yes sir! This is a real adventure. Why, I bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like this. You mean like we just did? Will somebody help her? Look, Maggie! Birdies! Oh, Homer. What are we going to do? Now don't worry. Our situation isn't as bad as it seems. And you're forgetting, I'm an experienced woodsman. Now you all stay here for a minute while I go over this way and try to get my bearings. What am I going to do? I've murdered us all. I've murdered us all... us all.. us all... us all. Shut up! Shut up... shut up... shut up. There! Finished. You are? Well, it's a quick job, but it's shelter. It is? Uh-huh. Okay, we'll be back with help before you know it. You girls just stay here and relax. Remember, Dad. The handle of the Big Dipper points to the North Star. That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. We're in the woods. Should Maggie be going with them, Mom? Oh, I don't think they'll be gone long and she's in good hands, Lisa. There aren't any dangerous animals in this forest are there, Dad? Well, might be a few. But don't worry about it. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone. It's a deal. And remember not to act afraid. Animals can smell fear. And they don't like it. Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of. Right. A rattler! I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not... Run, you fool! Through here, boy. Back to civilization. How do you know? When you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things. It becomes natural. Like a third sense. Wahhhhhhhhh! Yahhhhhhhh! Wahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! The boys certainly are taking a long time. I hope Maggie isn't slowing them up too much. Bart? Where are you, Bart? His lucky red hat! Oh dear God! No! Bart! Bart! Oh Bart! Bart, Bart! Oh, Bart, my beautiful son. Why couldn't you have taken me? Of all the fates of heaven and earth, why did this one befall me? Don't have a cow, Dad. What the--? You're alive!... and... buck nekkid. I'm not the only one, Homeboy. What? Oooh! Jungle Man! The first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy: Conceal your nakedness. Yeah, man. Okay, slap a fern on there, boy. Now, some mud. There. Ooh! That requires a little mollusk. And mollusk for me. All right. We're ready to hit the town. But dad, I'm so hungry. Can't we eat something first? I'm starving, man. Ah food. Good thinking, son. This young sapling ought to do the trick. What are we going to do, hang ourselves? No. This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy. Shhhh! Just watch. Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him! Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into those bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him. Right, Dad. Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Aaah! Great camping trip, honey. We travel eight hundred miles and we haven't seen a squirrel yet. Well, the Ranger at the gate said we should watch out for bears. Bears. Right. Right. Let me show you how many bears are around here. Um hello, bears. Um come on, have a donut... what the heck, have me? Come and get it? All right. all right. You made your point. Bears. I hope Maggie and the boys are all right. Oh, I'm sure they're just fine. After all, we built a fire and we don't know anything about nature. Imagine what your father, an experienced woodsman, has done. Yeah, I suppose so. Night Mom. Goodnight, dear. G-g-good night, D-dad. G-g-good night, s-son. S-sleep tight. Are we there yet? No. Are we ever going to be there? How would I know. Quit asking pointless... Bart look! Honey! Honey! We're saved! Uh Homer. Bees! How is it? Tangy. Wah-neh! Wah-neh! What? Wah neh! Wah neh! Oh. Water. Thattaway, man. Pleehhh! Hnnnn! Plem! Feh! Ahhhhhhh! Femmmmm! Wah! Gnnn! Hrmmerhrr! Bigfoot. The legendary half-man half-ape is no longer a legend. He's very very real. What you are about to see is unedited video footage taken earlier today in the hills three miles southwest of Tenderfoot Gorge. Plemk heh feh. Now the naturalist who took these absolutely extraordinary pictures was most impressed by the creature's uncivilized look, its foul language, and most of all its indescribable stench. A popular supermarket tabloid has offered a reward of $5,000 to anyone who brings in the creature alive. Naturally, we'll have more on this story as soon as it develops. We now return you to the President's address, already in progress. It looks like you girls have been getting along all right, but it's a good thing we found you when we did. There's something horrible roaming these woods. There is? Why... that's my husband! His name isn't Bigfoot. His name is Homer. What does it eat? I don't understand. What's this all about? Well, I suppose pork chops are his favorite. Hey, get those bears out of here. I'm trying to do an interview. No bears! We're taping! All bears off the set! Okay, now let's get back to your ""husband"". How would you describe your marital relations? Brutish? Is this going to be on TV? Coast to coast. Arewethereyet Arewethereyet Arewethereyet? Just a little farther... just a little further... just a little further. Food! Nice grizzles. Nice grizzles. Nice grizzles. What do we do, Dad? Praise the grizzles son. Nice grizzles. Maggie! Oh my little girl! Nice grizzly, nice grizzly. Later, grizzly dudes. Look. It's him! It's bigfoot! We got him! We got Bigfoot! You're lucky we got here in time to rescue you. What the hell are you talking about, sir? He's getting away. After him. We've got to take him alive. Johnson, you got that tranquilizer gun ready? Dad! Oh Dad! Avenge me, son. Avenge my death. Last weeks capture of bigfoot has turned into the scientific poser of the century. Although the creature was ultimately released, the question remains. Who was this Homer? Was it man or was it, in fact, the legendary missing link known as Bigfoot? Can I have some apple sauce? Specialists from around the world have gathered at the Springfield Primate Institute for a firsthand examination of the controversial creature. They are now ready to announce their findings. Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished colleagues, after extensive biological and anatomical testing, I regret to announce that the evidence we have is inconclusive. This... thing may or may not be human. Zat's vhat he thinks! I say it's none other than Bigfoot in the flesh. I disagree. I think eet eez a man. Ze eyes had a glimmer of human intelligence. The glimmer of the eyes. What about the sloping apelike forehead? Oh, Marge. The guys at work are going to have a field day with this. Cheer up, Homer. At least they let you go. Gentlemen, gentlemen, fraulein, please. Zis much ve can agree upon: The specimen is either a below average human being or a brilliant beast. Ooh, those stupid eggheads. Oh, Homer... My brilliant beast.","Homer's Canyon Echo, Salesman, Man #2, Cowboy Bob, Camper Mother, Beautiful French Scientist, Man #1, Marge Simpson, Newsman, Homer Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Dr. Marvin Monroe, German Scientist, Camper Father, English Scientist, Ned Flanders, Reporter #1, Rod Flanders, Reporter #2, Map Boy, Game Warden, Bart Simpson, NED, Tv Announcer #2, Flunky, Photographer",7.9,1638.0,7,1990-02-18,1990,1,The Call of the Simpsons,27.6,57793.0
