282,286,"Want a chocolate? Hold it right there, Forrest Plump. This town has laws against impersonating movie characters. Oh, behave! Luke, I am your father. Shagadelic. What are you doing here anyway? Waiting for my wife. She has a surprise for me. Hey, hey, hey. I didn't ask for your life story. Did you say ""life story""? Things started out great. I ate what my mother ate. And my mother loved chili. Then, suddenly: Wow, tell me some more. Don't you have criminals to catch? Hey, I'm workin' on it. We uh, we got an undercover guy who's infiltrating the mob. Hey Pete! Pete! They fixed the coke machine! Now, where were we? My father and I were never really close. I never found true happiness until I met Marge. And life just gets more exciting. Then came the day that changes every couple forever. The day we got our elephant. While I wait for my family, I'll tell you about the time my baby shot my boss. Hey, that's great, but I gotta get goin'. Whoa! There's a whole 'nother row of these bad boys. Keep talkin'. It's time for your surprise, Dad. Yeah. Hop in, Homer. Ah, the family car... we've been through a lot together... Now before we get there, you have to put this blindfold on. All my other senses are getting sharper. Bart, you had pizza for lunch. Lisa, you're extremely depressed. As if. Hey Homer, do you remember this voice? Kathleen Turner! No, it's me, Krusty. And you're at the Springfield Friars Club! Where tonight we're roasting you, Homer Simpson! Are the proceeds going to charity? Hell no. Woo hoo! We're all here tonight for one reason. To keep Homer away from the buffet. Haw haw! Excellent. That was at my expense. What kind of a roast is this? Now I'd like to read some telegrams from people who couldn't make it. First, we have Mark Spitz. Who's Mark Spitz? What's a telegram? Aw, forget it. I gotta get to the hot wings before the Comic Book Guy. You know, Lisa, they say father knows best. That's true, Bart. Our father knows the best way to embarrass his kids. Haw haw! Excellent. But seriously, we've had a lot of fun with our dad over the years. A lot of people think our Dad's behavior has screwed us up. And it has! But it's all worth it just to hear him sing. And now, our next speaker is Mr. Warmth himself, C. Montgomery Burns. I stand here to expose the criminal ineptitude of Homer J. Simpson. Again and again he has brought this town to the brink of annihilation. Why are you laughing? His bungling has shortened your lives and mutated your children. Just look at all of his catastrophic nicompoopery! Poop. Now here's a couple that's been dating -- -- carbon dating! Grampa Simpson and Agnes Skinner. Sweet Toledo! What's keeping that dress on? The collective will of everyone in this room! Haw haw! Excellent. You fruits wouldn't know what to do with me! I first met Homer in 1927 in a bar in Brooklyn. Little did I know he would soon become Mrs. Joe DiMaggio. Roll the clips! Hey Abe, you wanna hook up after the show? Yeah, to a suicide machine. Now everyone knows Homer loves his family... I'm sick of your lies. Secrets and lies. It's always secrets and lies. Homer, these people are professional roasters. Don't give them fodder! Secrets and lies... now let's welcome Springfield's original God couple. Reverend Lovejoy and Ned Flanders! Thank you so much. THE CAMPTOWN LADIES SING THIS SONG... DOO-DA, DOO-DA... HOMER SIMPSON'S BREATH IS STRONG / OH, THE DOO-DA -- Hey, hey, now hold on there. The nice people want to hear the real words. But Ned, I was singing the real words. Oh, let's just take it from the top. THE CAMPTOWN LADIES SING THIS SONG... DOO-DA, DOO-DA... THE CAMPTOWN RACE TRACK'S FIVE MILES LONG... That's better. HOMER'S BREATH SMELLS BAD! Oh, those are not the words! Silence! Cease all quips and comebacks! Look, you weren't in dress rehearsal, so you're not in the show. This can't be good for my pacemaker. What are you doing here? Our planet has been observing your puny species since your planet was created... five thousand years ago... by God. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And now humanity must be judged. The fate of your planet rests on one human being... Homer Simpson. Why him? Because he is the fat, selfish epitome of modern man. Hey! He stole my bit! Now we shall probe you to see if you are worthy. Yep, word for word! Okay, let's see what we've got. It has to be on channel three. Your species is brutish and primitive. Do you have anything to say before we obliterate your planet? Wait! What about Maggie's memories? Surely the innocent soul of a child will redeem mankind. Sure, let's give it a shot. It worked, Mom! Maggie's memories have shown them humanity's inner goodness. These are not tears. We are vomiting from our eyes! Your baby's treacle has only intensified our loathing. Wait... look at the screen! The baby continues to reminisce. This child thinks of nothing but trendy Hollywood celebrities. We can learn much from this innocent one, like Justin Timberlake's home phone number. So, I guess you can't destroy Earth, since so many of your favorite celebrities live and work there. We will not destroy the Earth...one condition. You name it. I can't believe we're going to the People's Choice Awards. And tomorrow the daytime Emmys! Ooh, it's Burt Reynolds and Michael Jeter! Could an ""Evening Shade"" reunion be in the works? There's Shannon Doherty? Didn't you have a thing with her? Don't go there. ULLMAN SHORTS, CHRISTMAS SHOW, MARGE'S FLING, HOMER'S BRO BART IN WELL, FLANDERS FAILS, WHACKING SNAKES, MONORAIL MR.
