195,199,"No... No... No... Man, you'd think the quality would dip after fifty-five hundred shows, but... Well, the FCC isn't laughing. They don't believe kids are learning anything from Itchy and Scratchy. Oh, please. What don't they learn? Don't trust mice... Cats are made of glass... Our license renewal is on the bubble. We need educational programming fast. What about that Mattel and Mars Bar Quick Energy Chocobot Hour? That's barely legal as it is. Here's what I was thinking. A newscast for kids, by kids. Well, you're not taking any time out of my show. It's jammed up as it is. There's the monologue, those idiot puppets, Krusty's nap time, the second monologue, Paul Harvey, Senor Papino. I tell ya, it's the tightest three hours and ten minutes on TV. We're cutting ten minutes from your show. Well, I guess we could trim the hobo parade to a lean twenty. Ach, she's a bonnie pile. Now for a wee nip and a wee nap. Ready, Milhouse? Ready! You owe me a quarter! I didn't crack my skull! Rats! Ach! Me pile! It's been raped of its bonnieness! Hi, Willie. My board! It's Willie's board now. And she'll make a fine piece of kindlin'. Sorry, Willie can't hear ya. It's pure. I really didn't want it to come to this... Lisa, Channel 6 is launching a children's news program. And they've asked me to select an outstanding student to be anchorchild. Oh, my gosh! Today's top story: ""Little Girl on Cloud Nine as Dream Comes True."" Lisa, I've selected you to be that child anchor. I know. I already jumped to that conclusion. Hmf. All right, if you're so smart, tell me who I selected to be lunch room monitor. Me? Take your sash and go. This isn't right! This isn't right at all! I'll have to eat me way out. Ach! It's terrible! Me shack! My beautiful shack! Oh, and I just got it the way I like it! You did this, Bart Simpson! The man knows quality work. This time you're in for it, Bart. What's he gonna do? I'll kill ya! All right. Back on the stretcher. ...And I'll be able to tackle all the hard-hitting children's news the grown-up controlled media won't touch. Plus I get to be on TV! Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you. All your hard work and grade grubbing have finally paid off! So who's on your news team? Nerd, nerd... Nelson?! Well, we used to date. Plus, he threatened me. Well, don't worry about sports. I got that covered. Back off, Bart. This may be the only chance I get as a second grader to produce my own TV show, and I'm not gonna let you screw it up. Mo-om... Oh, let your brother do sports. Mo-om... That ""Mom"" stuff doesn't work on me. Oooh, the gum with the cracker center. Mmm. That'll do it, Apu. So just-- Do not be alarmed. That is just my helper monkey, sir. I got him after a robber shot me six times and left me for dead. Helper monkey, eh? Hey, I'm on TV! Fart! Come on, quit foolin' around, you guys. So we meet again, Mr. Bond. Bart, get out of my anchor chair. Silence, Octopussy. Come on, this isn't a joke. All over town, kids are just waking up from their naps, cranky and hungry for the news. Wow, Kent Brockman. Good luck, kids. Where the hell's my grilled cheese? I'd like a monkey, please. And maybe one of those dogs. What do they do? Ah, they serve as seeing eyes for the blind, sir. Do they do any other tricks? No. Just the monkey then. Ahh, may I inquire as to how you are ""differently abled""? Oh-ho-ho, I'm not handicapped. I'm just lazy. Uh, sir, helper monkeys are only for the physically challenged or enfeebled. Enfeebled?! Oo, I know just the guy! Be right back. Oh, son, this monkey's gonna change my life. Mind if I take him for a ride? Sure, I'll just stand here. Mmm, I can't wait to eat that monkey. And now, Kids News... ... with Kids News anchor, Lisa... Thank you. Our top story today: in a move that could affect children townwide, the library book-purchase committee slashed its budget by three percent. First on the chopping block, periodicals. Bo-ring... And now, sports. Bart Simpson telling you to lock the doggy in the barn 'cause here comes dodgeball action! The shirts continued their domination over the skins today. And in schoolyard fights...the highly anticipated match between Kearney and Mr. Largo ended in a disqualification, for use of dog doo on a stick. Lisa? Aaannnd we are... out. All right, kids, we learned a lot today. Now, this is what makes my job difficult. Bart, you're off the sports beat. What?! Sorry, Bart, but you've got to take some things seriously. From now on, you're Lisa's co-anchor. What?! Oooh, that's gotta hurt! Anchorman, huh? Well, if I'm gonna be an anchorman, I'd better go bleach the crud off my teeth. I'll be in makeup. I don't need a co-anchor. I'm a straight ""A"" student. Lisa, Bart's got something you can't learn in school: zazz. What is ""zazz""? Zing, zork, kapowza. Call it what you want. In any language, it spells mazuma in the bank. ""Zork?"" What is ""zork""? I didn't say zork. The point is, the camera loves him. But that trivializes the whole idea of kids news. I mean, let's be honest. Bart's not exactly the brightest penny in the fountain. In English, Lisa. Damn blueberry stains. Look, I love Bart... But he's never even read a newspaper. Between you and me, he's well... kinda dumb. There a problem, honey? Monkey! There's a monkey in the house! Relax. It's only Mojo. Mojo, Marge. Marge, Mojo. He can do anything you show him. Watch. Simpson residence. Why didn't you tell me you were bringing home a filthy monkey? This ""filthy monkey"" made the orange juice you're drinking. I'll show Lisa who's dumb. ""Supreme Court reverses..."" I won't turn to the comics, I won't turn to the comics. All right, I'll read one comic just to get me rollin'. ""Archie."" ""Hey, Jughead, didja hear, the Supreme Court reversed..."" Mom, am I dumb? Honey, I'd love to reassure you, but right now Mommy needs a tetanus shot. Mr. Brockman, I need your help. I've got to become a great anchor so I can show up my sister. Sister, eh? Well, I've got a sister. Miss big-shot-CNN-Washington-correspondent. Well, she's not the boss of me. Come in. Let's take the trophy route to the den. Twelve Newsies, seven Iron Mics, four Golden Coifs... This is the most prestigious award that Del Monte gives... Do you wanna hear my award-winning secret? Human interest stories. They tug at the heart and fog the mind. Observe. Hear that? It's the sound of children's laughter. Silenced. That's because tomorrow, this old carousel, which has delighted young Americans for lo these past six years, will be torn down to make way for the future: a store that sells designer mouse pads. Well, I guess there's no room in this modern world for old Blackie here. But, if you don't mind, this reporter is going for one last ride. This is Kent Brockman... ...reporting. And now... ""Kids News."" Marge! The kids are on! Hmf. The monkey's on my part of the sofa. Honey, he's clearly marked his territory. We'll bring you more on this chalk shortage as it continues. And now, Bart's been looking into that alleged ham salad from yesterday's school lunch. No, I haven't, Lisa. Because I went out with a camera and did a different kind of story. Bart, I really think we should stick-- It's about a man. A simple man. He's one of... ""Bart's People."" Joe Banks, 82 years young, has come to this pond every day for the past 17 years to feed the ducks. But last month, Joe made a discovery. The ducks were gone. Some say the ducks went to Canada. Others say Toronto. And some people think that Joe used to sit down there... near those ducks. But it could be that there's just no room in this modern world for an old man and his ducks. Smithers, do you think maybe my power plant killed those ducks? There's no maybe about it, sir. Excellent. Marge, can I get a duck? You already have a monkey. Can he get a duck? No! One man. No ducks. Lisa? That's Kids News. Good night. Way to go, Bart. That wasn't news. That was sappy manipulative drivel. Well, I'm sorry you couldn't feel for old Joe. You didn't feel for him either, you big fat phony. Bart, look up here. This is where the tears would be if I could cry. But I can't. Botched facelift. You could learn a lot from him, Maryann. It's Lisa. Maryann's better. They want cheap sentiment? I'll pump 'em so full of sap they'll be blowing their nose with a pancake. They call her the Cat Lady. People say she's crazy, just because she has a few dozen cats. But can anyone who loves animals that much really be crazy? The old Union Pacific doesn't come by here much anymore... Come on. Come to Poppa. Good boy, Mojo. Now, bring 'em down and I'll give you one. Would you... Stop that! You're a helper monkey. This isn't helping! Oh, I don't need your pity. Our forgotten veterans. Their guns are quiet now. Their helmets lost, or pawned. And yet here they are, making flags out of old clothes. Sure, they may not have the right number of stripes, and the colors are all wrong, and some purists will tell you the American flag doesn't contain the word, ""Jordache."" But you know, if they run this up the flagpole, I'll salute. I'm Bart Simpson. Hmm, thank you, Bart, for yet another touching ""Bart's People."" Now, turning to-- I just think our veterans deserve a little recognition. That's what Veterans Day is for, Bart. But is that really enough to honor our brave soldiers? They also have Memorial Day. Oh, Lisa, maybe you're right. Maybe you're wrong. The important thing is Veterans deserve a day to honor them. They have two. Well, maybe they should have three. I'm Bart Simpson. Oh my, look at all these letters from people who want to be Bart's People, Bart. I wish they could all be Bart's People, Mom. I truly do. I'm proud of you, honey. You're finally giving something back to the community, after taking so, so much. Hmm. It really makes you think. What does that even mean? Mom might not see through you, but I do. You don't care about any of these people. Well, if I'm guilty of anything, maybe it's caring too much. I'm Bart Simpson. Stop talking like that! Stop it! Lisa, please. You have absolutely no reason to be jealous. You're still a very important part of Bart's show. ""Bart's show."" If everybody knew what a phony Bart was, he'd be off that show so fast... I've got it! Hey Lis, be a doll and hand me that sealant. Hey, here's another letter for Bart's People. Oh, so many souls, so little air time. ""Dear Bart, I came to this country, hoping to share the American dream. But after many years of back-breaking labor, I find myself homeless and sleeping in a junkyard."" Oh-how-terrible-read-on. ""Should I abandon hope or fight on bravely against impossible odds? Oh, this is too perfect. It is, isn't it? I'm gonna put him on the air tonight, live. Oh, Bart, you'll have to ride your bike pretty fast to get out there in time... Naw, I'll just take the chopper. They gave you a chopper?! Mojo, will you wipe my mouth? Oh, for Pete sakes. Why is that monkey wearing a diaper? I thought he was housebroken. You said this monkey would be sweeping the floors and cleaning the gutters. And now he just lies there, struggling to breathe. What do you want? His cholesterol's through the roof. I want you to take that monkey back so he can be rehabilitated and get a second chance. No, no. He's fine. Go on, Mojo, show Marge your happy dance. And so on. Mojo! What have they done to you?! Pray... for... Mojo. So by waking up a little early and having some extra sheets handy, no one's the wiser. Tomorrow, destroying the evidence. Eww. Thank you, Milhouse. Now it's time for today's special live edition of Bart's People. Lisa, I've just arrived at the Springfield dump. A lot of things get thrown out here. Sometimes, even a human being. Somewhere in this pile of twisted metal and soiled mattresses... ...lives a poor immigrant whose home was cruelly taken away. Yeah! By yew! Groundskeeper Willie! Uhm. Ah. So, so you're the immigrant I'm here to help. Help?! You destroyed mY house and reduced me to living in a dump . Groundskeeper Willie, furious with the government that let him down. I'm Bart Simp-- I'll kill ya! Oh, no! What have I done?! Nelson, cover for me. Oh, Bart, it's me, a jolly policeman. Oh, we got Willie. Come on out so we can give you a medal. Way to go, officer! GAAAH! Willie, stop! Away with ya! I've gotta finish him off while I'm still temporarily insane! No, you can't hurt Bart. He's... Well, he's... your son! Wha?! Well, not literally. But in a way, isn't he everyone's son? For you see, that little ""hell-raiser"" is the spawn of every shrieking commercial, every brain-rotting soda pop, every teacher who cares less about young minds than about cashing their big, fat paychecks. No, Bart's not to blame. You can't create a monster and then whine when he stomps on a few buildings. I'm Lisa Simpson. Ah! You're right, it's all Willie's fault. I've been a terrible father. Hey, Lis. Thanks. Boy, that phony schmaltz of yours sure is powerful stuff. Uh, yeah, but I have a certain respect for that whole ""truth"" and ""hard work"" thing that you do. You know, Bart, if we combined your showmanship with my integrity, we could make kids really care about the news. You're right. If we work together, there's no stopping us. The new improved Kids News... has been cancelled. Stay tuned for the Mattel and Mars Bar Quick Energy Chocobot Hour! You can count on us, Mr. President.
