546,554,"Well, it wasn't easy, but we managed to watch every testicle fail video on the internet. Now to leave a great comment. ""LOL... that's... got-ta... hurt."" I guess there's nothing left to do but go outside and play. Wait, a sponsored link! Well, they did everything they could to stop us, but we hacked through anyway. They thought the party was over. After party! Brief nudityyy! I thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers. I don't know what that stuff blocks. Mammogram appointment. I told you to clean your room and instead you're watching chest videos! Look at all those bowls of half-eaten cereal! The cereal on the bottom gets soggy. I know how cereal works. Now clean your room. Why should I? It's just gonna get dirty again. I'm in charge. You do what I say. I'll get to it when I get to it. That better not mean what it means when I say it. Maybe you two are more similar than you'd like to admit. We're not similar. I love being told what to do by someone who's wise in the ways of the world! Love it! Here's what I would do... in the middle of the night, clean Bart's room for him, then in the morning thank him for cleaning his room. You poor woman. Dealing with Bart has turned your mind to ketchup water. You rest. I'll be the boy's father now. Hm, I'm not feelin' it. Why do I need to eat broccoli? Look, I'll drink another glass of milk. Milk. That's for babies and old guys who can't sleep at night because of what they did in the war. Broccoli. Oh it! You are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli. And I'm going to sit right here until you do. Pfft. You'll never out-sit me. The sit is on. Eat your broccoli. No. Eat your broccoli. No. They've been at it all night. I know, but they're not gonna waste a whole Saturday inside. Today's our draft! I've got to pick a good fantasy team! When I lost last year they made me do something so humiliating... Jebus loves Tebow. And so... the fat man caves. If you need me, I'll be up in my room eating cereal. Half a bowl of cereal. Marge, I want you, my wife, to draft my fantasy football team. I-- I don't really know that much about-- I've never seen moves like that! And never will again! Today, I wear the vest. Haw. Haw. Now I am never eating that broccoli. This has got to stop! If you don't go to work you're going to get fired! I can get another job! Who wouldn't want to hire a man who won't back down? I could be a prison warden or a southern anything. I've got an idea... but I'll need that broccoli. These two fruit smoothies look and taste exactly the same. One of them, however, has the broccoli blended in. Bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it -- maybe he had the broccoli, maybe he didn't. No one knows, so neither of you has given in, and this horrible impasse can come to an end. Uh, works for me. I'm in. Oh, thank God. Oh no, the broccoli! You did that on purpose! You lick this table clean! Come on. Lick it! C'mon, lick it! You can still lick it! I'm afraid Homer and Bart's problems are beyond our power to solve. There's only one thing left to try. Where are we? I don't know. Eat your broccoli. No. We're on an old-time boat! We've been kidnapped! Not kidnapped, shanghaied! Relation Ship. It works two ways. Pretty good. Pret-ty good. Hey lame ass. Thanks to you, we're stuck on a stupid therapy boat. I'm the lame ass? The only lame ass on this boat is you and all the other lame asses. Should we do something? We are doing something -- we're empathizing. Ooo, I'm getting a message from your father's fantasy football league. I must still be logged in as him. Lenny used the uck-word! Mom, it's trash talk. You know how guys say mean things to their friends, the way women say nice things to their enemies. Ohh. Yikes! Well I don't like this trash talk. And I'm gonna do something about it. Even if I have to bring in the big guns. Dear Lord, please help Homer's friends understand that make-believe computer football is no excuse for using the internet to be mean. It's everywhere. And now, a moment of silence for the victims of the Shelbyville sinkhole... The Wi-Fi! The Wi-Fi! I've got to take out the Wi-Fi! She's under a lot of stress. Her husband's at sea. WHO WANTS TO SING ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS? / WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST AND SING ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS? / I'LL GO FIRST AND SING ABOUT MY FEELINGS / I'M SO HAPPY TO BE SINGING... Now, Homer! So, Cletus... Gitmo. What brings you fellas to The Relation Ship? Why won't you let me fail?! What about you, Bart... Homer? Homer? What does that mean? Mainly climbing. Except for Wednesday night, when we project a movie on the sails. But really, a lot of climbing. Sheep shank, bowline, clove hitch... Dad, look! I did a round turn with two half hitches. Wait a minute... windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands. You're enjoying this, aren't you? So what if I am? You're my son and you will hate what I hate. Angled parking. Lemons. Kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money. And this boat! I'm old enough to choose my own things to hate. And the things I like! And I like being a sailor. Betrayed by my worst enemy. I never would have seen it coming. Why, Bart! That's a perfect halyard cleat! Just like you taught me, Captain. Over, under, over, under, over, under, under, under, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, under, over, half hitch. Well, the standard form is under, over, under, over, under, under, under, under, under, over, over, under, under, under, around, over, over, under... Fathers, sons... together we've made a lot of progress on this voyage. I learned that left is called ""port""! I finally got over my sea sickness. That's right, Mr. Midshipman. I'm sorry we had to discipline you. On the positive side, you won't miss out on the father/son hornpipe dance. I hate the Golden Age of Sail. Officer on deck! I'm in charge. You do what I say. Fine. I'll swab whatever you say. Look, I'm swabbing the deck. I'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of. Oh! I'm swabbing the top of the ocean. Ooo! Swab, swab, swab-- What the? Fantasy football has turned every man in this town into a trash-talking monster! Mas cowbell! There's only one thing that will shut these guys up. You gotta beat one of them at fantasy football. Then that's what I'm gonna do. That doesn't match my phone! Lakwando's mind won't be on the game. Aaaand benched. And now to make my big move. There would be no funeral. An eighty-five yard field goal? You gotta be kidding me! Refresh! Refresh! ...despite her breathtaking ignorance and a powerful dislike of the sport, a rookie housewife had been defeated by a savvy veteran... Ahoy Midshipman. I hope your voyage on The Relation Ship is proving interpersonally fruitful. I don't know. It's really hard when someone doesn't respect your authority. Epiphany ho. And I'm sure your father has been doing some growing and learning of his own. Yi-yo-yu! I love this boat, with all its pullies and flappies and... everything has a name. You know what, Homer? I always wanted to eat a parrot. What's the big deal? It's just like a green chicken. Yeah... But fortune did not favor The Relation Ship, as the same winds that lofted Marge's fantasy field goals to victory now sent gales of doom toward this vessel of questionable therapeutic value. Why is the Captain just juggling? Okay, okay. I can do this. I can do this. Someone count me in! I said count me in! Don't worry, I'll radio the coast guard for help. The therapy bears! Look out for the therapy bears! I'm a-comin' bears! Now I'm the ship's highest ranking officer. It's up to me to get us to shore. Dad! We can make it to harbor if we can just sail around that lighthouse! Are you crazy? We'll never make it! Drop the anchor and wait out the storm! No, we need to sail! I'm dropping the anchor! Can't you just do what I say?! You've never done what I say! Ever! Now can we respect each other? Yes, son. We can. Awaiting your orders, Mr. Midshipman! Put up the storm jib and haul in the main sheet! Aye-aye, sir. Another success story for The Relation Ship. So, did your sailing adventure help you work out your issues? Does this answer your question? Yar. Quite a hornpipe thar be. But, eh, surely you would never have gone on a sea adventure without your old friend, The Sea Captain. Yar. That's gonna hurt for a long time. Yar.
