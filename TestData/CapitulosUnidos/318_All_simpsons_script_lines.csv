314,318,"Okay, Mother's Day gift check. Let's see what you got. I picked Mom a bouquet of Erigeron elatiors. Daisies. Flowers. Flow... yeah. Lis, your stupid present will only last a week. Mine will sit in a closet for years. Bart, we made her the same thing! This is even worse than you think -- look! Kids, we're going Mother's Day shopping! I'm glad this holiday only comes every four years. Let's see, what would she like? Twenty on the trifecta? Her wedding china back? I could get Marge a new window, just like this one. Hey, Dad, why don't we try the ""Sprawl-Mart""? Yeah, I love Sprawl-Mart. They've got everything. Even Christian videos with talking vegetables. Mighty Yamses, we are weary of building your food pyramid. Let my pickles go! Mmm, Moses. Welcome to Sprawl-Mart! Grampa! You have a job? How dare you challenge my perceptions of what old people can do? I'm a Greeter! I'm here to make every visit special! And to size up potential shoplifters! Like I can't shoplift with my mouth. Haw haw! Wow, look at all this stuff. Oh look, Jaclyn Smith has her own line of axe heads! Yeah, it's impressive. But I still haven't found the perfect gift for Marge. Only imperfect stuff for me. Hey look, it's Hairy Ass Tubman. Well, well, if it isn't Fatty and Smell-ma. Your names can't hurt us. Aunts Patty and Selma, can you help us pick out a Mother's Day gift? You could give her one of these. A Kitchen Carnival. We got one when we appeared on an episode of ""The Price Is Right"" which the network refused to air. Apparently we're not TV pretty. Wow! It's a machine that makes carnival food at home. Endorsed by the American Carny Association. Wow! I never thought I'd say this, but you slags are all right. All this attention! I feel like a secretary on Administrative Professionals Day! Marge, you're gonna love my present. It is so thoughtful it makes the kids' gifts look like crap. ""Kitchen Carnival?"" I love it! Thank you, Homie. Whoa, Marge, get a room! Only my hairdresser knows for sure. Hmm, dare I pour caramel over the cotton candy? I'm gonna pour caramel on my clothes. And then, finally, I can eat my shorts. What is that?! This is eighty-five pounds of tooth-melting sugar. Dig in! That's it, kids. Suckle Daddy's sugar ball. Chief, that guy shouldn't be in the carpool lane. His passenger is just a big piece of candy. I wish mine was. What? Nothin' Homer, are you spooning that snack? That's my old lady. Ants! Birds! Cats! Flanderses! I was saving sugar for my wedding night! Homie, it's time you got rid of that thing. All that candy is rotting your brain. I think you should get rid of her. Then we can be together... forever! Maybe you're right, Marge. Or maybe you're right, candy ball. No, Marge. Then again... No, Marge. Definitely Marge. Goodbye, old friend. I'll think of you whenever I have a stroke or a heart attack. Oh my God, I'm gonna be killed by a bear! Well, I guess I don't have to worry anymore about the dangers of smoking. Smooth. Homie! What happened to you? Marge, please. I'm too upset to talk about it. But seeing you like this is more than I can bear. Bear?! ... the angry president woke up, crawled out of his grave, and went back to work. That sound can mean only one thing -- it's time for another installment of ""Kent's Cowards."" Today's clip comes straight from the Springfield dump. Dad, you got attacked by a bear?! I did a lot of stuff today. I went to Starbucks, but you didn't see that on tape. That hilarious footage was shot by local hunter, Grant Connor -- not with a gun, but with a camera! That's right, Kent. I often get guns and cameras confused. One time, tragically, at a wedding. I don't care if they think you're a coward, Dad. You did the right thing, hiding and crying. Yeah, we'd rather have a live sissy mincing around the house than some dead hero any day. Choke on your candor! You can strangle Bart, but you can't strangle your humiliation. It's a deal! Hey Simpson, I heard your Dad is afraid of a little old giant grizzly bear. The only thing my Dad's afraid of is paying child support. My Dad once beat up six employees at KFC. And he'd been up for three days. Homer Simpson, report to Mr. Burns' office immediately. What a delightful practically-based joke. Hello? Anyone home? Marge? Maggie? ""The Bear Went Over The Mountain""?! ""The Berenstain Bears""?! Ahhh, Goldilocks... and the Three Bears! Oh God, they're in our food! Teddy Grahams, Gummi Bears... Are you a Care Bear? I'm an intensive care bear. Why does a bear need a crowbar? I don't like to get my hands dirty. Crying in the corner huh? Mind if I join you? No, go ahead. All right. That's enough, Fraidy Sue. Here's what you gotta do: find that bear what whupped you, and whup him back. Can I fight human-style? By slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile? You cowardly Swede! You face that bear like a man, or I'll never speak to you again. But how will I find out what you had for lunch in nineteen twenty-eight? I have a web site. Welcome to my homepage. Why don't you visit more often? Mr. Simpson, if you want to find that bear that attacked you, use this. It tracks an electronic tag I stuck in the bear's ear. It's the same technology they use to keep tabs on Gary Busey. Finally, science has joined forces with revenge. Now, listen. The bull grizzly is seven feet tall, weighs more than a Mazda Miata, and can tear through a tree like a Jewish mother through self-esteem. Next time you face him, you better have some way to protect yourself. Lookin' good. And I did it all without wasting money on one of those stupid welder's masks. Behold! The ultimate in anti-bear technology: The Bear Buster Five Thousand. Available wherever fat men dream. Oh, dear Lord. Check it out, ladies. The suit that makes me completely invulnerable to bear attack. Homer, there's no rear on that thing. I know. If I get really scared, I don't want to ruin the suit. Now look here, mister. I forbid you to fight a bear. What kind of an example would I be if I didn't take revenge on things? Dad, you can't get revenge on an animal. That's the whole point of Moby Dick. Lisa, the point of Moby Dick is ""be yourself."" You're not going, and that's final. Fine. But do you know how ridiculous you look right now? Marge, you awake? Marge? Marge is sure gonna be steamed when she finds you missing. Or dead. Gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him. You're sneakin' out to fight that bear. I wanna go too. No way. If something happens to me, you have to carry on the Simpson name. Screw that. When I grow up, I'm legally changing my name to Joe Kickass. That is so cool. All right, you can come. Lisa, I think your father just left! And Bart's missing too! I've got a bad feeling about this. Let's check the suit closet. Zoot suit... astronaut outfit... Southern belle... Renaissance dandy... Country-western octopus... It's gone! That man and his foolish pride! We've gotta go follow him. I just wanted to see what it was like. Howdy, y'all. If you don't like mah song, I'll spray ya with ink! I never realized how hot this suit is. I'm sweating out all my blood-lust! Why don't you take a bath in the river? This bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago. Suh-weet. Hey, the batteries are missing from this thing. Yeah, we borrowed 'em for the radio. SKYROCKETS IN FLIGHT / AFTERNOON DELIGHT... Rub a dub dub, I'm washin' the blub. Oh my God! Lenny! Carl! Bart? RUBBING STICKS TOGETHER MAKES THE SPARKS IGNITE / AND THE THOUGHT OF LOVING YOU IS GETTIN' SO EXCITING... Mr. Connor, thank you for helping find my husband. I don't want my last words to him to be ""clip your toenails, they look like Fritos."" Mom! Mom! Stop the car! Dad went to take a bath and the bear carried him off! Yeah, it almost wrecked the whole trip. Ma'am, I will find your husband before that bear kills him. But first, a snack. I guess this is it. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die a man. Is this thing hurting you? Okay, it's probably the tag. But just to be sure... Hey, you're not mean. It was just this tag that made you go ape-scat. We're not so different. Give me a hug. Jeez! I don't know why bear hugs enjoy such a great reputation. That's funny. Oh no, the hunter has become the hunter! He must be following this thing. Well I'm gonna make sure it never harms another living creature. A killer bear is on the loose in Springfield Forest, and local laughingstock Homer Simpson is missing and presumed mauled. Wrong again, liberal media. A bounty has been placed on the rogue bear in the amount of ten thousand dollars. Don't worry, I'll find you someplace safe. The bear is no longer wearing his tracking device. And it looks like he's headed toward that wildlife sanctuary. Is there any sign of my husband? Your husband appears to be traveling with the bear, either as hostage or as what we call a ""Forest Bride."" Okay, you wanna go over there. Hold on. Something doesn't feel right. Wait! Stop! I know bullets can be scary sometimes. But I have an idea. First we pull off all of your fur. All right, all right I'm still thinking! They're looking for a male bear, right? It's so easy to condemn, so hard to create. Okay boys, that bear's gonna make a dash for freedom. Unless we take him down. Yeah, all the way down. What you said didn't really add much. I know, I just wanted to belong. Well, we all feel that way sometimes. It's Homer, don't shoot! It's that bear! Aim for the holes in the colander! He made it! He's finally protected from man. Yeah, but now he's being attacked by an elephant. Well, I'm proud of you, Homie. You set out to fight an animal and you ended up saving its life. What can I say? I love nature...
