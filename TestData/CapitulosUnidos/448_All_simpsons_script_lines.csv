441,448,"Dad, how can you call it a ski weekend if we're going home at dawn on Sunday? Gotta leave early to beat the traffic. Now to get on route two-oh-five and it's a straight shot home. For crying out-- I hate traffic -- the band, and the phenomenon! Well, there's only one game we can play in the car over and over and over again. ""Bonk It."" Oh, I'm sorry, kids. We lost the batteries for that. No problem. A couple just rolled out from behind your seat. Bonk it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it! Bonk it! Bop it! Thwack it! Twist it! Bop it! Smack it! Whack it! Thwack it! Bonk it! Twist it! Smack it! Bonk it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it! Bonk it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it! Bonk it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it! Bonk it! Bop it! Bonk it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it! Bonk it! Bop it! I can't take it anymore! I can't take it anymore! Bonk it! Twist it! Smack it! Bonk it! Twist it! Smack it! Oh, darn, the batteries are dead. Not to worry. It plugs into this cigarette lighter. Bonk-bonk-BONK it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it! Bonk it! Bop it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it Bonk it! Bop it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it! It's daddy's turn! Stomp it! Crush it! Kill it! Bonk it! Bonk it. Bonnnnk it... Finally, some peace and quiet. Why do my actions have consequences? Now, kids, we're about to get really cold, then really warm. Bonk it. Twist it. Smack it. Drink up, sweetie. Let the possum work its magic. Possum?! Oh don't worry, we don't kill it. We just dip it. What happened? What happened is, I saved your life. Now you's had a rough day. Why'n'tcha have a pull on this? Where's the hooch? Oh, excuse my faux pas -- that jug was fo' Pa. C'mon, now. We'll go on back to the still. And in case we run into trouble... Brandine! Where's the bazook?! He's gon' shoot those Google Earth folks what caught me with my britches down. This here's my pride and joy: 'Ol Betsy. A female that gives birth to alcohol. Now, gentlemen, let us toast our new friend's escape from death's icy grip with my latest batch of whoopee water. So, what cha'y'all think? Yuh, yuh, yuh, good! It angrys up my fists! I just remembered my feud with this here tree! Git... 'er... done! Git... 'er... done! What's your take, city boy? Well, uh... it's got a rich mash base and a sense of danger. And I detect notes of elderberry, tobacco, oak, no, poison oak... and hints of game. That is amazing! You have the eloquence and urgency of a census worker caught in a bear trap. We's gonna invite you to all our soirees, mixers and drink-'em-ups. Now let's enjoy the bluegrass stylin's of the Country Bear Jamboree! So, you guys have any videogames? Nope, but my mama brought some of these boom potaters back from Iraq. Set 'em up again! So, I'll hide and you guys count to a hundred. One... Two... Backwards ""e""... One-legged triangle... Banana hot dog... Double banana hot dog... Sixty-corncob two... This is the best hiding place. They'll never find me. I'm here! Come find me! Olly-olly-oxen-free! Olly-olly-oxen-free! Why did I do Poetry Club instead of Girl Scouts? Why did I do Poetry Club instead of Girl Scouts? Dark is she, but brilliant! Black are her wings, black on black! She is Lilith, who leadeth forth the hordes of the Abyss! You're gonna be so embarrassed. There are two other people at this party dressed just like you. State thy business. My name's Lisa and I was playing hide and seek when I met you ladies. Please don't hurt me. We're not gonna hurt you. But we don't like outsiders observing our esbat. Uh-huh, what's an esbat? An ancient ritual in celebration of the full moon. We're Wiccans. You mean... witches? Technically, but we're not into broomsticks, or pointy hats... Well I'm glad you're not ""witches."" Wouldn't want you to ""cast a spell"" on me. Oh, we cast spells. And they work. Sure they do. If magic was real, I'd use it to get out of my pipe cleaner art project that's due tomorrow. You should keep an open mind. Things said in the circle have a surprising way of coming true. Lisa! Lisa! Dad! Over here! Come, sisters of the elements! Let us leave this place in a manner most wiccan! What are you talking about? Text your Mom to pick us up. Oh sweetie, I found you! Now, who's gonna find us? Help! Uh-oh. I have one minute to avoid my first late assignment ever. The pipe cleaner fur is coming off on my hands! Class, Miss Hoover will not be in today, so you'll get A's on your pipe-cleaner sculptures. What happened to Miss Hoover? Came down with a spell of stomach flu. Spell? Those girls couldn't have made her sick... or could they? Maybe we'll pass the time with another craft project. I'll let one of you pick. Uh... Lisa? Which craft? Which craft? Which craaaaaaft?!! This here country's home to over three hundred family-owned stills. None of them big corporate moonshiners, like Crazy-Think White Lightnin', or Dwayne Saggery's Demento Juice. So let's go taste some independent hooch! Hey, thanks for bringin' us down here, Homer. Yeah. There's somethin' wonderful about being drunk outdoors. I wonder if Moe misses us. No, I don't miss ya. Now get back to my bar for happy hour or I'll paint the snow pink with your brains! Drop your firesticks, man-possum! Oh, uh, so, uh, I guess this means you hillbillies are gonna have your way with me. Huh? Oh fer God's sake! Y'know, one hillbilly has his way with one fat guy in ""Deliverance,"" and suddenly people think that's all hillbillies do! I s'pose you think all space is ""Star Wars!"" No, I thought that we had a connection here, and we're out in the woods and everything, and... hey, forget it. I ain't gonna beg for it. You'll never know what you missed out on! Did you girls make Miss Hoover sick? Oh no, we would never ask the Goddess to harm a teacher. But if the Goddess chose to help you by giving Miss Hoover the Hershey Squirts, such is her divine wisdom. Listen, not that I've lost my skepticism, but I am interested in learning more about Wiccans. Are you a minority group as defined by Ivy League admissions? Cornell and Dartmouth. What else ya got? We worship nature. I worship nature! Want to join us? Well, it is an honor to be asked. But I never make a final decision in the middle of a forest at night. Hey, hey, that's smart thinkin'. Shut up and dig your own grave. What if I don't dig it? What are you gonna do then? Guess I'll have to dig it for ya. With your bad back? Fuhgetaboutit! Is that a pentagram? Lis! You've finally come over to the dark side. Um, it's the wiccan home page. I'm thinking of joining. No, no, no. You're too young to be a witch. Savor the steps leading up to it: college anorexic, string of bad marriages, career disappointments, failed pottery shop. And then when you're old and alone, you can hit the witch thing hard. Hey, every witch needs a familiar... I'm gonna put a spell on you! Yes I am, my tuna-breath familiar. Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! I curse you, Hell's Kitten! Just as I feared: her Buddhism has led directly to witchcraft. And she's teleconferencing the Devil using that computer from Hell! I think it says ""Dell."" We'll let the authorities sort that out. Mmm, not bad. What's that twirly ruckus? The gummiment! Initiate, how does one enter the circle? With perfect faith and perfect love. Join us, join us, join us... Do not sanctify that witch! I kinda feel sorry for 'em, crammed in that back seat. Toss 'em a Judy Blume novel, Lou. Uh... all we've got is ""Wifey,"" Chief. Nothin' with kids in it? Damn budget cut. Double bubble boil and trouble?! Today, Springfield will see its first witch trials in twelve years. Oh, I think I see the witches now. This reporter has never encountered such disfigured crones. We're not the witches! Oh, well then you must be victims of the witches' hideous curse. You didn't think I was so hideous that night we made out in the back booth at the Seafood Hut. We all did crazy things on nine-eleven. Ah, here COME the witches. Do you have a statement for us ""mortals?"" Goddess Lilith, who knows our hearts are pure... Oh queen of magic, show our persecutors that they are blind! They are blind! I'm blind! I'm blind! What goes around, comes around. Dear God, I've gone blind. Nurse, you'll have to be my eyes. I'm blind too! Then I guess it's up to me. Gwendolyn Nightshadow, did you use your supernatural powers to blind half this town?! We're just kids! My real name isn't even Gwendolyn Nightshadow! It's Stacey -- Stacey Deathsatan. So... the defendants recruited you, a young innocent, into their evil coven. They're not evil! They believe in friendship and respecting the earth... and they made me feel like I belonged. Your honor, I'd like to enter something into the record. Strangely, I'll allow it. Ladies and gentlemen, I am a big dummy with a stupid job. I write down what other people say just like a big dummy would. Could the court reporter read that back? ...I am a big dummy with a stupid job. Hey! In all my years of being a judge, I've never seen such a flimsy case. Are you sure? 'Cause we've brought you a lot of flimsy cases. Like that goat we accused of income tax evasion. I still think he was guilty. Well, I'm not wasting another minute on this. Case dismissed! There's no justice here. They made me blind! And now I can really hear how I bomb! Well, I say we take 'em out and have our own trial! Oh, uh, don't mind me. I'm just trying to get a fly on the ceiling. I got you now. BURN THE WITCH! BURN THE WITCH! BURN THE WITCH! Not so fast! As citizens, we are still bound by the rule of law... Boooo! Seventeenth century law! I have reconstructed the ultimate instrument of colonial justice: the dunking stool. If the alleged witches survive the dunking, they clearly were witches. If they drown, then they were clearly innocent. And after this, it will be featured in the fifth-grade play ""The Crucible""! Good seats still available, by which I mean seats in the back where you can fall asleep. Don't dip those Wiccans! They didn't blind anyone -- I have proof! / Proof? When my father was attending the moonshine competition last Saturday... You said you were at a parenting class! Marge, please. You're embarrassing me in front of the mob. You heard sirens, which you thought were the police coming to arrest you. To ditch their stills...the moonshiners pushed them down a hill. The moonshine landed in a river, temporarily blinding anyone or anything that drank it. That river led to the reservoir -- which made anyone who drank the town's tap water also go temporarily blind. Moonshine in the water? I'll be the judge of that. Hmm... Hillbilly moonshine -- the little witch is right! Wait, wait, wait, don't un-form! You're a great mob -- we'll think of something else to get upset about! How 'bout all that construction on Route One? Huh? Huh? Oh, you ain't no mob. You're just a buncha spineless weasels! Hey, hey, hey, it's just a figure of speech. Kill the weasel hater! Now this is what I'm talkin' about! Sister Lisa, thank you for saving us. You were awesome. No, thank you. I've been rational but nerdy my whole life. But these past few weeks, you girls made me feel cool. Cool! Me! Lisa Simpson! Well, I think you're very interesting girls, but from now on, the only witch in Lisa's life is which boy will marry her. Right, Homer? Homer? Start the ride!
