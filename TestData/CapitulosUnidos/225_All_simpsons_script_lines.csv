221,225,"I was really starting to enjoy Ethnic Mismatch Comedy #644. I've never heard so many Viagra jokes in thirty seconds. Shuuuut uppa you mouth. Attention Springfield. How low will you go... to win a trip to -- Hawaii? This Saturday our judges will select the lowest, most disgusting nitwit in town... and send him straight to Maui! Sponsored by ""Grandma Plopwell's."" The low-fat pudding that's approved for sale... by the government! All right, a gross-out contest! Grandma Plopwell, you've done it again. Care for a free sample? Thank you. Mm. For low-fat, this pudding's pretty good. Mmm-mm. Oh, I can feel the pounds just melting off. Our new hyper-sugar gives you three hundred percent of your minimum daily sweetness requirement. Mm. Do you suffer from diabetes? N-n-n-n-o. Well, you do now. We're here live at the KBBL parking lot to see h-h-howw lowww will you go? Our most disgusting contestant will win a free trip to Hartford, Connecticut! I thought it was Hawaii! No one said Hawaii. Now let's get stupid with our first contestant, the Human Garbage Disposal! Ladles and jellyspoons, I will now take going low to new heights. I will swallow anything -- and I mean anything -- you people throw. Please, no more spark plugs. Lisa, would you like a penny to throw at your brother? Unbelievable! We're rewarding people for acting like buffoons! Young lady, this may be the high point of Bart's life. Cut him some slack. No, wait, that wasn't the trick. I was gonna juggle chickens. And I-- Next up, Homer and his amazing Reddenbacher dreamcoat, with a number he calls, ""Kernel Knowledge."" I'm hot buttered / Check it and see / I got a fever of four fifty-three... I'm hot... so very hot... Fours? Ow! Ow! Oh! Oh, this is so embarrassing. Lisa, did anyone force you to come here today? You. Hm. Well, no one's forcing you to stay. Okay, I'm leaving. Oh! You're not going anywhere, missy. But it's me, Moe, wearing a sailor suit. Moe -- with a lolly. It's so out of character. Ain't that worth nothin'? All right, judges? Who is our winner? The winner is... me. For being seen with you freaks. Judges can't win the contest! Booooo! You have robbed us of our dignity! Well you-- A urinal cake? You, sir, have crossed a line. People, stop! Stop! We're not animals! Take that! An Open Letter to the People of Springfield: Today our town lost what remained of its fragile civility, drowned in a sea of low-fat pudding. Look, I got runner-up prize. You won second place? No. But I got it. Stealing is wrong. ""Free Boudoir Photography."" Sweet. Hm... Oh, right. We are a town of low-brows, no-brows and ignorami. We have eight malls but no symphony, thirty-two bars but no alternative theater, thirteen stores that begin with ""Le Sex..."" I write this letter not to nag or whine, but to prod! We can better ourselves! Yee-ha! Well, most of us. Dad, did you see anything provocative in today's paper? Yes, there's a real think piece here about a bra sale. Dad, stop kidding around. Look, they printed my letter. Hey, that is wonderful, sweetie. I'm gonna read it just as soon as I finish what I'm doing here. Well, I'm sure someone had the time to read it. I envy them. Hi, Mr. Flanders, I see you're reading the newspaper. Everything but the opinion page! I don't need to be told what to think... by anyone living! Chief Wiggum! Oh, you sure got a lotta copies of the paper. Yeah, I need to housebreak our new police dog. Plus, it couldn't hurt Ralphie to brush up on the fundamentals. Daddy says I'm this close to living in the yard! Doesn't anybody in this town read? Oh, hello Lisa. Can you recommend any books for my mobile? Oh, absolutely! Well, you know, anything by Jane Austen... Jane Austen. Thanks, Lisa. I'll get right on it. ""We read your letter with great interest. If you wish to learn more, go to 13 Euclid Street. Tell no one! And bring a dessert."" Hey Lis. Whoa! Whoa! Lisa Simpson! Are you ready to go on a voyage of intellectual self-discovery? I think so. Is that a pie, or a quiche? A pie. You may enter. Welcome to Mensa, Lisa. It's the organization for people with high I.Q.'s. I know that. It's also a constellation visible only from the southern hemisphere. She's good. She's very good. ... and she brought a cream pie. You want me to join Mensa? Oh, that's wonderful. But don't I have to take some sort of I.Q. test? No Lisa, you're more than qualified. I've shared all your standardized test scores with the other members. Aren't those supposed to be confidential? Welcome to Mensa! You've joined such luminaries as cartoonist Mell Lazarus, Geena Davis, and Parade Magazine's Marilyn vos Savant. Each the tops in his or her field, well, except for Mell Lazarus. Wow! I'm so honored you wanted me. Well, it was your delightfully condescending letter that put you over the top. Lindsey Naegle, Advanced Capital Ventures. Oh. What do you produce? Synergy. And books on how to cheat at bridge. Lisa, I think you'll really enjoy it here. Now let's get down to business. Any new palindromes? Rise to vote, sir. Now, you know the agenda. Palindromes, anagrams, eat Lisa's pie, then voting. But ""rise to vote sir"" is a palindrome. Well... She's right. Impressive. Lisa, I think you're going to fit in just fine around here. Wow. Me... fit in. Hello, I have a certificate for a free erotic photo session. Oh, yes. Your name? Uh... Geraldo... Simpson. All right, Mr. Simpson... Who told you? Don't worry, these photos are perfectly legal. Many husbands use them as a romantic gift for their wives. Uh, you're not gonna ask me to pose nude, are ya? Well, yes, unless you have some issues with revealing your body. Well, I don't, but the Block Association seems to. They wanted a ""traditional"" Santa Claus. I can't believe how they're dumbing down the Springfield Library. They've gotten rid of the English literature section and replaced it with a make-your-own-sundae bar. I heard they got rid of the reference desk to make room for an air hockey table. Even the microfilm? Even the microfiche. Oh, God. My family never talks about library standards. And every time I try to steer the conversation that way, they make me feel like a nerd. We are hardly nerds. Would a nerd wear such an irreverent sweatshirt? ""See DOS. See DOS run. Run DOS run."" Only one person in a million would find that funny. Yes. We call that the Dennis Miller ratio. Oh Dad, I just spent the day with the most wonderful people. Oh, that's great, honey. You tell me everything you can before the commercial's over. Well, for the first time in my life I feel that someone understands... Up-bup-bup-bup. Are you ready in there, Mr. Simpson? Are you sure you're a fully accredited and bonded pornographer? Just come out. Please be kind. You look fantastic. Let me just adjust my lens here. Now you're sure this will save my marriage? Try not to speak. It's making your body ripple. Dad? Dad? Are you home? Fine. I don't care what you're doin'. Don't look! Don't look! Don't look! Okay, I think he's gone. Let's reschedule. This is so cool. I feel like I'm back in the Renaissance. Please stay in character, gentle wench. Verily I declare that the Earth revolves around the Sun and not t'other way round. Stop looking down my blouse, Copernicus. Forsooth, mine eyes doth rove of their own accord. Zounds! Someone took our gazebo. No, no, that's impossible. We reserved it months ago. Someone should stand up to them. Oh, I'll do it. Excuse me, gentlemen. Might I take a peek at your gazebo reservation form? Beat it. Yes, well, we each have a good case... What part of ""beat it"" didn't you understand? Mmm... I guess it would be the ""it."" I'm not exactly sure to what that refers, it's a... Ow! Ahh, it's hopeless. There are some she-males in gazebo three, a nasty-looking spider in gazebo six, and the less said about gazebo eight, the better. Ah, Chief, thank God you're here. We reserved gazebo seven, and look! Geez, how many gazebos do you she-males need? Beer me, boys. Why do we live in a town where the smartest have no power and the stupidest run everything? Maybe I should just move back to Alabama. No, we should fix things here. If we put our minds to it, there's no limit to what we can accomplish. I think the girl's right. It's a good point. The jig is up, Quimby. Oh God! When you see what's in this report, things are going to change in this town. I earned that lotto money. I swear. Faster, you moron! Huh. Well, that was unexpected. What's goin' on? Where's the Mayor? He skipped town. Really? So who's in charge? Well... that's a good question. Let's, uh, take a quick look at the town charter. Done! Done! Done! Done! Done! Fin-ished! According to the charter, should the Mayor abdicate, a council of learned citizens may rule in his stead. Well, there's no one more learned than us... ... So I guess we're in charge. Whaaa?! Let me see that. Let's see here. ""We the people... cruel and unusual... blah, blah, blah... ritual circumcision... yak, yak, yak..."" Aw geez, I'll take your word for it. I guess you are in charge. With our superior intellects, we could rebuild this city on a foundation of reason and enlightenment. We could turn Springfield into a utopia! A new Athens! Or Walden Two! Yeah, a real Candyland! Of the mind, the mind. I'll just go now. Buncha dorks. This is Kent Brockman at City Hall where the intellectual junta known as the ""Bright Pack"" has been running this town for the better part of three days. ... can go over there... So, Lisa. What do you and your fellow eggheads have planned for the city? Business as usual? No, Kent. We're gonna use the power of good ideas to change things for the better... Well, excuse this jaded reporter if he says he's heard that before. Oh, well, we really mean it. You do? Yes. For example, no one was showing up for jury duty, so we made the experience more exciting by synergizing it with his comic book collection. ""You have been chosen to join the Justice Squadron! 8 a.m. Monday at the Municipal Fortress of Vengeance."" Oh, I am so there! We studied traffic patterns and found that drivers move the fastest through yellow lights. So now we just have the red and yellow lights. Come on, stay yellow... stay yellow... Man, I'm makin' record time! If only I had someplace to be. And we've really elevated the level of discourse at the dog track. We replaced the fanfare with classical music, and instead of chasing a rabbit the dogs chase a diploma. The world has already taken note of our accomplishments. Springfield has moved up to number two ninety-nine on the list of America's three hundred most liveable cities. Take that, East St. Louis! Gee, you said you were gonna to make me look sexier, but it's awfully dark in here. Light is not your friend. All right, let's do this thing. It's time to get Homer-erotic. Okay, next item of business is our weekly progress report. Principal Skinner? How's your transportation project coming? Oh, excellent. Not only are the trains now running on time, they're running on metric time. Remember this moment, people. Eighty past two on April forty-seventh. It's the dawn of an enlightened Springfield. Excellent. Now next week is our state of the city address. Has everyone finalized their proposals? Well first of all, I have a plan to eliminate obesity... in females. Oh, please. For a nickel a person tax increase we could build a theater for shadow puppets. Balinese, or Thai? Why not both? Then everybody's happy. Ooh, yeah. Everyone's real happy, then. Do I detect a note of sarcasm? Are you kidding me? This baby is off the charts. A sarcasm detector. Oh, that's a real useful invention. Maarge. Oh, Maaarge. I've got something for you. Oh, Homie. Houston, we have a problem. A sexy problem. Homie? Well, look at you... Grrr. I'm gonna to maul you. Homer, I've never seen this side of you! But I like it... Wooh, wooh. Look at those silk pillows. It's like the set of some high-class porno film! No, no. It's just our basement. Hold on, wha-- That's our basement? Yeah, so? Come on! More kissing! It looks so elegant. And all it takes are some lace curtains and a beaded lampshade. You've got to show me exactly what you did. But I was gonna score... No, you weren't. Welcome, everyone. Today we embark on a new era of intelligent governance. Governance! Governance! Governance! We have some new rules and regulations that you're just gonna go ape poopie over. Professor Frink? Well, first of all we're going to ban such barbaric sports as bullfighting and cockfighting. Also, boxing, both kick and the kind with the gloves there. And hockey, football, pushups... and anything in general where you have to take off your shirt, which is embarrassing. I don't remember discussing that. Inspired by the most logical race in the galaxy, the Vulcans, breeding will be permitted once every seven years. For many of you this will mean much less breeding, for me, much, much more. Ye canna do that, sir! Ye don't have the power! Uh, ladies and gentlemen. I must apologize. This man does not speak for the council of Alphas. We hold you sub-Omeguloids in the highest regard. When are we gonna get to my broccoli juice program? Quit butting in, please. Your I.Q. is a mere 155 while mine is a muscular 170. ""I am smart / Much smarter than you... Hib-bert!"" You should all do what I say. My I.Q. is 199! For crying out flaven...198, 197... Big deal. My I.Q. is 280. Stephen Hawking! The world's smartest man! What are you doing here? I wanted to see your utopia. But now I see it is more of a Fruitopia. I'm sure what Dr. Hawking means is... Silence. I don't need anyone to talk for me except this voice-box. You have clearly been corrupted by power. For shame! Larry Flynt is right! You guys stink! Yeah, you reek! / Yeah, that's right! / They all really stink! / You're always right! I don't know which is the bigger disappointment: my failure to formulate a unified field theory or you. I don't like your tone. If you are looking for trouble, you found it. Yeah, just try me you-- Oh! Now's our opening. Come on, you idiots, we're taking back this town! Yeah, let's make litter outta of these literati! That's too clever. You're one of them! Please stay calm, everyone. Time for this hawk to fly. Wrong button. Help! Lisa, thank God you're okay. Did you have fun with your robot buddy? Da-ad! Oh, Dr. Hawking. We had such a beautiful dream. What went wrong? Don't feel bad, Lisa. Sometimes the smartest of us can be the most childish. Even you? No. Not me. Never. I guess everyone has a different vision for the perfect world. Wow, Mom. That's very profound. Hey. You read that off my screen. Who's up for some beers? I am. That's the smartest thing I've heard all day. Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing, Homer. I may have to steal it. Wow. I can't believe someone I never heard of is hangin' out with a guy like me. All right, it's closing time. Who's paying the tab? I am. I didn't say that. Yes, I did. Larry Flynt is right!
