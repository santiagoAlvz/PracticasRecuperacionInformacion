318,322,"I got it! Bart, I got it! I ran here as fast as I... Bart, that creepy kid's here! Hey, Milhouse! Oh, what's this? ""Psycho Cycle Conversion Kit?!"" Oh, wow, this will look great on my bike. Flame decal for the chain guard, Marine Corps tassels... bullet-proof seat... and a rub-on tattoo for that ""special someone."" That's me! Biker chick? Now to turn on the moto-mimic. Sounds like a motorcycle gang! And we don't have back-up. We better lay low. But Chief, what if they like pizza? Way ahead of you, Lou. That is one bitchin' bike! Daddy said a cuss word! Lighten up, Roddy. Haw haw! It's the baby bike brigade! Hey Bart, I used to have a bike like that -- back before I was born! Oh no -- they've got big boy bikes. Thanks for the tassels. My mom can wear these on her boobs at work. Hey, give those back. Gentlemen: first gear! Oh man, I sure wish I had a ten-speed bike. A ten-speed bike?! What did your mother say? She said ""yes."" I said no! I'm confused! Which is it? It's no! His old bike is fine! Yeah, the kitchen lady's right -- no new bike while your old one still works. I see. So if my old bike didn't work, I would automatically get a new one? That's right. No questions asked. Boy, I'm really gonna miss you. We've really had some great... Ooh, a Mercedes! What the Halle Berry? Yes! My bike! My crappy, crappy bike. I'm very sorry, Bart. I'll pay for a new bike. This was a wake-up call -- from now on, I'll keep my eyes on the road and off my ""Kool and the Gang"" air freshener. Celebration's over, boys. Snowball! I know how you feel, Lis. No kid wants to outlive their pet. There, there. You're both right. Son, would you like to ride your new bike out of the store? Can I, for true? For true, son. Hey, pally. I don't want to down-shift your enthusiasm, but that's a floor model. Your bike is in here. I could put it together right now -- for a small assembly fee. Here we go. Now it starts with the fees. I'll assemble it myself. Dad, no! Think of the bike. I can make a bike. I made you. Yeah, great workmanship. Hey, that's gonna win you a lot of bar bets some day. Oh man, this is so confusing. What the Hell is this? Bike's over there. You actually did it! You're the coolest, Dad! Look what my Dad just built for me! Hey, guys! This butt's for you! Oh no! No one does this to Dolph! No one! Uh-oh. I'm riding a unicycle with my pants down. This should be every boy's dream. Haw haw! Your dad's not handy! Son are you okay? I brought my home-made first aid kit. It's spring-loaded for quick access! We now return to ""Robot Rumble"" on the Testosterone Network! Congratulations to our winning father-and-son team, who will receive a free appetizer at Fuzzy Zoeller's Green Jacket Steak House! And you won't be teed off when you come in, because our steaks are cooked two par-fection, our leader-board is filled with scrumptious... two more pages, I'm not readin' this. Face it, you're not the most mechanical guy in the world. But you're good at other things: like... eating while driving. That's somethin'... and nobody gets madder at the news. First of all, thank you. Secondly... Mom, I'm not sure I'm ready for a new cat. ""When Bad Things Happen To Cute Children"" says that a new pet will pull you out of your sorrow cycle. That book doesn't know how I feel. Oh, it's very wise. It's written by a rabbi -- who surfs! All right, I'll look. Too fluffy, too Siamese, too needy, too stuck-up, infected eye, clearly a skunk. Me-ow! Welcome to the family, Snowball III! There's nothing worse than the look on a boy's face when he says ""Dad I don't think you can build a fully-functional robot."" Robot, I command you: do something cool! I could quit now... but then my son will never look up to me. Why was I born a Dad? Why... do... I... suck? Wait a minute. What is it my Dad always said to me? If you can't build a robot... be a robot! That's it! It's Tuesday the first. If you live in Krusty Brand low income housing, your rent is due. Hey, it didn't fall apart. Smash this six pack! Awesome! I gotta tell Milhouse. Oh, the beer's gone. I'll have to suck it out of the shag. Oh, Lisa. Honey, it's okay. You're a Buddhist, so you know your cats are now reincarnated as a higher form of life. Like a dog. Or a snowman! Ashes to ashes... dust to dust... we've gotta go fight some robots. C'mon, Homer. How long does it take to go to the bathroom? Huh? Dear Bart... ""...I'd love to be with you, but I just remembered an old army buddy has come to town. Will meet you later. Love, Dad. Well, I wish Homer was here. But don't worry. I've got a name all picked out for you. Chief Knockahomer, let's win this one for Dad! And in this corner, the challenger, Chief Knockahomer! There's no love lost between these emotionless devices! Robots rumble! Go! Go! Geez, I'm the only one in the audience over fifteen. Are you here with your children, sir? Oh yeah, my two kids. Screw... and you. What's this? Knockahomer has dropped his hammer. Doin' it for the boy...doin' it for the boy... pain is love... to bleed is to care... Can robots feel pain? If so, we are horrible, horrible people. He's killing him softly with his saw! Killing him softly? With his saw! Woo hoo! I mean, beep beep! Coltrane? Lisa, I'm glad you're ready to love again. But a kitty needs a proper name, like Whiskers. Or Paws Scaggs. Well, I think it's only fair I get to name him. You got to name me. You should be glad I did. Your father wanted to call you Bartzeena! Coltrane, would you like to hear some music written by your namesake? Coltrane? Coltrane, you were with us only briefly, but we'll always have the ride home from the shelter. And uh... I guess that's it. Amen. And Lord, if you think I'm making lemon bars for your bake sale Sunday, you'd better stop killing our cats. Mom, I'm not sure God responds to threats and intimidation. It's the only way to talk to bullies. ...then Knockahomer did three victory laps and pretended to drink a beer! Pretended. Dad, what are all those cuts? Various bug bites and wounds. Now stop interrupting your brother. In my day, mechanical men had funnel hats and showed respect. Then it all changed when they got the vote and started tinkering with our memories! Well, if you ever want to see a mailbox shoot a boy, that's about as close as you're gonna get. Dad, it was so great -- Knockahomer really took a pounding but then he won! Not so rough, Bart. Daddy can't handle so much love right now. This robot's the greatest thing you've ever done for me. I can't believe you've never seen him fight. Well, I've been busy, son. They really need me over at the nuclear plank. Well, the next match is Saturday. Can you come then? I don't think so, son. But on the other hand, I may be closer than you think. So much metal in my eye. Ladies and gentlemen... eh, who am I kidding, just gentlemen... join us next week for our title bout, when Knockahomer will try to unseat five time defending champion... Smashius Clay, a.k.a. Killhammad Aieee! Our robot can kick that robot's ass! Right Dad? Dad? Oh no! My recurring nightmare is coming true! There are many people I'd like to thank for this award. My wife, Anjelica Huston -- this is for you, Angie! We did it! Speeches cannot be longer than thirty seconds. Now a tribute to those who have left us this past year. Sure he's tough. But he's never come up against a wooden mallet! Listen son, there's something I have to tell you about our robot. There it is! That thing that makes us respect Bart! You guys are just in time. My dad's about to tell me something important about our robot. Uh... I just installed a chip that makes it ten per cent more bloodthirsty! And if anything happens to me, I want you bullies to take care of my boy. Don't worry, I'll raise him like the mean streets raised me. I wish I had bullies like you growing up. Hey! Hey! These cats would rather take their chances in the back room than go home with you. My job was to keep Lisa's hope alive. But instead, she's really depressed. You think you've got problems, look what I just pulled out of my arm! That's what we in the business call ""a biggie."" Business, what business? The business of being a Dad. Can you hand me that magnet? Can you do my back? I guess I'm not meant to own a cat. I'm much happier petting this leaf. Wait, you don't want me to have this cat! Look, you don't want to get involved with a girl like me. My cats have a nasty habit of waking up dead. Now go, cough me out of your life like a bad fur ball. You're not hurt! You're a good-luck kitty! All right, ol' Gil's gonna collect big from insurance! I'll be eating food tonight! I'm keeping you! You're Snowball Five, but to save money on a new dish, we'll just call you Snowball Two and pretend this whole thing never happened. That's really a cheat, isn't it? I guess you're right, Principal Tamzarian. I'll just be moving along, Lisa. Snowball II. Okay I've been studying Frink's robot, and I've discovered he has one small weak spot. Uh-oh. His weak spot is now his strongest point. That moan sounded almost human. The Hell it did. End of round one! Two hundred and thirty rounds to go! B-R-L-F-Q SPELLS MOM AND DAD / WELL THAT AIN'T TOO BAD, 'CAUSE THAT'S MY BOY... You look a little sluggish out there, boy. I'd better open you up. Dad?! Bart, I'm sorry -- I could never build a robot this awesome. I'm a fraud. So, you fought all those robots? Affirmative. That is so cool! You really think so? Yeah! Any Poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life, even though you're the sole provider for a family of five! I am the luckiest kid in the world. And I'm the luckiest-- Round two! Oh no! Dad! That robot has given birth to a man! Hey, what gives? He's not killing me! I'll tell you what gives, I'm afraid he is subject to Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics. With the sci-fi and the so many books, not too many good. My robot is programmed never to harm humans, you see, only to serve them. He knows just how I like my martinis... full of alcohol. Go! Go! Go! Now's your chance! Bart, all that button ever did was send a mild electric shock up my backside. Why did you make it do that? Keep me focused. And the winner is nature's greatest killing machine: man. Show me where in the rule book it says that a human can't be a robot. Right here. Rule one. Well then, join us next week for more inconclusive action on Robot Rumble! I concur! Son, did you ever suspect it was me? Well, you did disappear a lot, but I have gone whole summers without seeing you. Yeah, I'm pretty unreliable. I like you, son. I like you too, Dad.","Knockahomer, Chief Wiggum, Lou, Milhouse Van Houten, DOLPH, Macho Tv Announcer, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Bike Guy, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Squeaky-Voiced Teen, Seymour Skinner, Sideshow Mel, Krusty Clock, Moe Szyslak, Ned Flanders, Rod Flanders, Kearney Zzyzwicz, Gil Gunderson, ROBOT WARS ANNOUNCER #2, ROBOT WARS ANNOUNCER #1, Scary Robot, Professor Jonathan Frink, Attendant, Jimbo Jones, Bart Simpson",7.3,607.0,9,2004-01-11,2004,15,"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-bot",16.3,42776.0
