134,135,"C'mon, Simpson! Open up! We know you're in there! Hmm... That one! Someone's in here. Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Boy, I've never seen a man so desperate to get out of five minutes of calisthenics. One, two, three, four! Up, down, three, four... This new exercise program is great! Yeah. Every muscle in my body's gettin' a workout. Especially my big fat mouth. Yeah! Especially your big fat... Oh, wait. Raise your right hock. Aerate! Raise your left hock. Aerate! I want to see more Teddy Roosevelts and less Franklin Roosevelts! TWO! Actually, Homer, that's just one. See, each push-up includes both an ""up"" part and a ""down"" part. Arrgh! Hey, where's Charlie? How'd he get out of this? Aw, he's at home on disability. Yeah, he got injured on the job and they sent him home with pay. Pfft. It's like a lottery that rewards stupidity. Stupidity, eh? Must hurt self. Must hurt self. Must hurt self. Hmm, probably better that didn't hit me. Yes? Hello. May I help you? Um, could you give me a little push in the opposite direction? Okay. Thank you. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? No. Lumber Lung? No. Juggler's Despair? No. Achy-Breaky Pelvis? No. Oh, I'm never gonna be disabled. I'm sick of being so healthy! Hey, wait... ""Hyper-Obesity."" ""If you weigh more than 300 pounds, you qualify as disabled."" You can do it, old boy! Yes I can. Yes, yes. That's the spirit! If you gain 61 pounds, they'll let you work at home? Yuh-huh, that's the deal. No more exercise program! No more traffic! No more blood drives or charity walks! Dad, I know we don't do a lot together, but helping you gain 61 pounds is something I want to be a part of. Dad-- I must protest. You're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate. I'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. But try to see it my way. All my life I've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body. Have you told mom about this? No. It would only worry her. If you want to add to her worries, go ahead. I guess I'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us. Da-ad! Yes, sweetheart? Obesity is really unhealthy. Any doctor will tell you that. Oh yeah? Well, we'll just see about that, Little Miss Smart Guy. My God, that's monstrous... I've never heard of anything so neglige-- I'll have no part of it. Can you recommend a doctor who will? Yes. Hi, everybody! Hi, Doctor Nick! Now there are many options available for dangerously underweight individuals like yourself. I recommend a slow, steady gorging process, combined with assal horizontology. Of course. You'll want to focus on the neglected food groups, such as the whipped group, the congealed group, and the choc-o-tastic. What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor? Be creative. Instead of making sandwiches with bread, use Pop-Tarts. Instead of chewing gum, chew bacon. You could brush your teeth with milkshakes! Hey, did you go to Hollywood Upstairs Medical College, too? And remember, if you're not sure about something, rub it against a piece of paper. If the paper turns clear, it's your window to weight gain. Bye-bye, everybody! Oh, it's a dream come true, boy! I can, nay, I must, eat everything I've always wanted. Now c'mon! Every second I'm out of bed, I'm burning precious calories. Now get grabbin'! Eat around the banana, Dad, it's just empty vitamins. Lucky for you, this stuff doesn't work. I don't know... fish sandwich? Are you sure? Oh, two-twenty-five?! That means I lost weight! Homer, you're... um... on the towel rack. Woo hoo! Four more pounds and my dream comes true: Working at home... Here's your lemonade and here's your beer. Oh, you're such a vigorous young go-getter. When's your next coffee break? Any time I want. Hey, Flanders, bad day at the rat races? Yeah. A crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat. Hey, Lis, come look at this. Neat! Hello, honey. Hi. Ah, er, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. Did you put on a little weight this week? I was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- Honey, I'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability. Have you lost your mind?! Have you thought about your health?... Or your appearance? So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I didn't know you were so shallow. Oh please, I would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but-- Beautiful. G'night. I've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or I gotta face another day at work. Bad news, Dad, we're out of food. We're even out of the basic elements of food. You ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce. I need a miracle. Oh, honey, that looks just like a real donut... Dad? It says ""Non-Toxic."" Well, that's a plus. Woo hoo hoo hoo! I did it! Ah, Dad? Towel rack...? Oh my. I am pleased to dedicate this remote work terminal. It will allow our safety inspector here to perform his duties from home. And so, excelsior to you, Mr. What's the name of this gastropod? Simpson, Sir. One of your chair-moisteners from Sector Seven-G. ... Yes, Simpson. Thank you for your pity. Mom, were you ever planning to step in and put a stop to this? Normally your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out as soon as he finds something good on TV. But this season... I'm looking for something loose and billowy. Something comfortable for my first day of work. Work, huh? Let me guess: Computer programmer? Computer magazine columnist? Something with computers. Well, I use a computer! What's the connection? Must be the non-stop sitting and snacking. Well, sir, many of our clients find pants confining. So we offer a range of alternatives for the ample gentleman: ponchos, muu-muus, capes, jumpsuits, uni-sheets, muslin body rolls, academic and judicial robes... I don't want to look like a weirdo. I'll just go with a muu-muu. Arnie Pie in the Sky with the morning commute! Traffic this morning is as bad as it gets! Due to a fire at the Army Testing Lab, a bunch of escaped infected monkeys are roaming the Expressway! Despite the sweltering heat, don't unroll your windows, 'cause those monkeys seem confused and irritable! I pity those poor suckers on the freeway. Gas-brake-honk. Gas-brake-honk. Honk-honk-punch. Gas-gas-gas. Eight fifty-eight. First time I've ever been early for work. Except for all those daylight savings days. Lousy farmers. ""To start, press any key."" Where's the ""any"" key? I see essc, ctarl, and pig-up. There doesn't seem to be any ""any"" key. All this computer hacking is making me thirsty. I think I'll order a Tab. Oops, no time for that now -- the computer's starting. ""Check core temperature? Yes-slash-No."" Yes. ""Core temperature normal."" Not too shabby. ""Vent radioactive gas?"" N-O. ""Venting prevents explo-si-on."" This is hard. Where's my Tab? Okay then -- yes. Vent the stupid gas. Aw no, the corn! Paul Newman's gonna have my legs broke. Bart and Lisa have to go to school while I get to stay home. Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah. I like school. Well, why don't you live in it then? I would if I could. Not me, sister. When I grow up I wanna be a lardo on workman's comp, just like Dad. I wash myself with a rag on a stick. Eww! Mo-om! This whole thing is really creepy. Are you sure you won't talk to dad? I'd like to, honey, but I'm not sure how. Your father can be surprisingly sensitive. Remember when I giggled at his Sherlock Holmes hat? He sulked for a week and then closed his detective agency. Well, maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings. The longer he lives like this, the harder it'll be to go back. You're right. Maybe if I use my least nagging tone of voice. Homer? Homer! Homer! That's it. That's the one. All right, send him on in. Dad? Yes, honey? Umm... Mom just baked a cake. Homer, we need to have a serious talk. You dragged me all the way from work for that? Let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan, shall we? I... Con: You're endangering your health. Pro: I'm drought and famine resistant. Con: You're setting a bad example for the children. Pro: I, uh... don't have to go to work. Con: You're running the air conditioner non-stop. It's freezing in here. Pro: Uhh... uhh... I love you? Con: I am finding myself less attracted to you physically. Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of, right here. And nobody's gonna take it away from me! You never had faith in me before. But let me tell you, the slim, lazy Homer you knew is dead. Now I'm a big fat dynamo. And where's that cake? There's no cake. ""Vent radioactive gas?..."" Y-E-S. ""Sound alertness horn?"" Y-E-S. ""Decalcify calcium ducts?"" Well, gimme a Y. Gimme a-- Hey, all I have to type is ""Y."" Hey, Miss Doesn't-Find-Me-Attractive Sexually-Anymore. I just tripled my productivity. Good. Good for you. Y... Y... Y... Let's see, so many letters to choose from. I'll pick Y. Y, Y... What the heck are you doing over there? There. There. You found the floor. YYY... Y... Y... Y... I'm going out. I run errands during the day. Could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer-- The mail! The mail is here! Oooo! ""An Urgent Plea From Edward James Olmos!"" ""Lisa Simpson: Can you afford to miss another issue of The Utne Reader?"" Kids. Free sample of fabric softener? Woo hoo! Hmmm, I can feel three kinds of softness. Dad, what are you doing down there? Washing my fat guy hat, honey. We now return to ""Search for the Sun."" According to Daddy's will, I inherit the entire plantation. I'll see to it you don't get apricot one. Uh... What's your dad's job again? He's a Nuclear Safety Technician. What's he doin' with that broom? What isn't he doing? I heard that guy's ass has its own congressman. Hey, leave my dad alone. Just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad. He's a sweet man and he has real feelings. Hey, what are you kids looking at? Hey, look. He's trying to get up to yell at us. Don't make me close the shade! Hey, Homer, you promised Mom you wouldn't wear your dress outside. Nuts to that. I'm going to the movies. Shouldn't you be working? I got someone to cover for me. One for ""Honk,"" please. Uh... Gee...Uh... Just a minute. I have to check with the manager. I'm terribly sorry, sir. But I'm afraid our facilities are not equipped to meet your needs. What are you talking about? Well, what I'm saying, sir, is that a man of your carriage couldn't possibly fit in our seats. I could sit in the aisle. I'm afraid that would violate the fire code. Hey, Fatty! I got a movie for ya -- ""A Fridge Too Far."" Shame on all of you. Give me my dignity! I just came here to see ""Honk If You're Horny"" in peace. Sir, if you'd just quiet down, I'd be happy to treat you to a garbage bag full of popcorn. This may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food! I'm sick of all your stereotypes and cheap jokes! The overweight individuals in this country are just as smart and talented and hard-working as everybody else. And they're gonna make their voices heard! All they need is a leader! I'll work harder than ever before, and show the world overweight people aren't undisciplined, lazy, and irresponsible! What happened to my bird? Marge?... Lisa?... Flanders?... Explosion imminent?! Omigod, the plant's gonna explode! Hey, that thing's going kah-kah koo-koo. Who cares? It's Homer's problem. Wait, I know! ""Vent Gas."" Pressure too high? ""Tank must be shut down manually?!"" Stupid bird! I never should have put you in charge! Why you... Oh, who am I kidding? It's all my fault. Shut up! I gotta call the plant and warn them! The fingers you have used to dial... are too fat. To obtain a special dialing wand, please mash the keypad with your palm now. I'm gonna have to shut it down myself. Fat, don't fail me now. The ice cream man! Take anything you want, man. Take it all. Push out the jive... Bring in the love... I heard your dad went into a restaurant, and ate everything in the restaurant, and they had to close the restaurant. Hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac. Oh, that's raspberry. Yay! Ice cream man! Workers, please! There'll be time for the frozen pudding wagon later! You still owe me ten more Iroquois twists! Ten hi-ya-ya! And nine hi-ya-ya..! Get away, dammit! Run for your lives! I'll take a rocket pop. What can I get for thirty cents? Let go! I gotta get to the tank! Heck! I can't decide without the pictures. ... Six hi-ya-ya..! ... Four hi-ya-ya..! ... Three hi-ya-ya..! ... Two hi-ya-ya..! Stupid switch! I wish I had my reaching-broom! ... One hi-ya-ya! Wait a minute! There's probably a -- Homer, your bravery and quick thinking have turned a potential Chernobyl into a mere Three-Mile Island. Bravo! I'm so proud. That's my husband wedged in that hatch. I think it's ironic that Dad saved the day, while a slimmer man would have fallen to his death. And I think it's ironic that for once Dad's butt prevented the release of toxic ga-- Bart! We'll have you out of there as soon as our tech boys get you decontaminated. Thank you, Mr. Burns. It was pretty scary up there. But... For a while I feared for my life. Now Homer, if there's anything else I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask. Mr. Burns... Can you make me thin again? I guarantee it. One... One... One... Bah! I'll just pay for the blasted liposuction.
