424,429,"Why do we have to go to the rec center? I wanna play with my friends! When you're older, you'll miss these fun activities. You're older. Why don't you do these fun activities? Uh, 'cause no one's making me. Buh-bye. Welcome to Shaolin Kung Fu. Ten thousand years of knowledge will be passed along to those whose parents have signed a permission slip. The rest of you have just purchased very expensive pajamas. Namaste. Pardon me, master, but what does a big fat wad like you know about kung fu? Ah. Kung fu is not about physique, but the channeling of one's energy, or chi. If you doubt my skill, please, feel free to attack at my signal. My chi! Do we have any more paints? My orange isn't the orange of that orange. Just paint the damn fruit. Lower your expectations, Lisa. Public program, public program... Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm... Mmm-hm. Stop! Stop! Juliet, this is terrible! Your art is personal and wrong. I was painting with my heart. And if you look carefully, you can see that the knight is Josh Groban, our young century's greatest vocalist. Ooh, another Grobanite! Um, excuse me, but I think her painting is very imaginative. I suppose you'd like to teach this class? Yes, I would. Class, everyone please stop and admire Juliet's painting... I do not need this! My family owns a gas station. If you two thoughtful and creative girls don't like the way I teach, there's a world of fun outside. See ya! What are you staring at?! Everyone paint me twenty laps! C'mon, fatty. Keep up! So, how come I've never seen you around the Janet L. Mu√±oz-Robbins Rec Center before? My father just took a position at Springfield University. Are your parents academics? Kinda. Let's do some Groban. EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE UNDERSTOOD / WELL I CAN HEAR YOU EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE LOVED / DON'T GIVE UP / BECAUSE YOU ARE LOVED I need some candy for a first playdate, but I don't want to come on too strong. M&Ms? Well... if I pick plain she'll think I'm cheap, but if I pick peanut, she may have an allergy. You just killed her, Bart! How about Charleston Chew? What is this, Brooklyn in the fifties? Don't just say stuff. You ask for my help, then you don't want it. Excuse me, but why not consider an Almond Joy? It looks like you only brought something for yourself, but then you just happen to have two pieces. Finally, a real suggestion! If she doesn't like coconut, you're screwed! Hi, Juliet. So, what do you want to do? I don't know -- it's been so long since I've had a playdate. Not that I couldn't get one if I wanted... My parents bought me a membership card to the Folk Art Museum. Does it get you into special exhibits? On Wednesdays. That's today! Folk art! ...So Lisa asked if her new friend could stay for dinner! She's finally doing something the book said she would! Won't last. Hey Mom, can Juliet sleep over? Are your parents okay with that? They've never met us. We could be murderers. Could've been. If we hadn't had kids. Juliet's father is the world's foremost John Grisham scholar. He found several undiscovered plot twists in ""The Client."" And he proved that the real villain in ""A Time to Kill"" is the legal system itself. Toldja, Marge. Tol. Dja. Now we need a name for our imaginary kingdom -- I mean, queendom. How about... Equalia? Equalia. Where everyone is equal, but we're in charge. I mean, somebody has to be, right? Okay, you two. Lights out. Lisa? Do you want to be best friends? Gosh. This is all happening so fast. I don't know what to say. Say ""yes"" say ""yes""!"" I'd love to! Woo-hoo! Goodnight, Lisa. I have a best friend! You heard me say that, didn't you? I did. We're still cool though, right? We are. My best friend is so cool! Mom, I'm meeting Juliet after school! Great! Here are a few ""best friend"" tips: compliment her hair and shoes. If her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it... and-- Friendship is like marriage -- the key is listening. Also, if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it. I just said that. Okay, honey. If it's that important to you, you said it. We're at the end of chapter four. But we need a grabber, a whammy, a snap-a-roo, some eye mustard... I've got it! How 'bout this? What if Queen Helvetica found a rare two-horned unicorn! A two-nicorn! I love your accent. Two-nicorn. You are definitely doing the book on tape. And Queens Valedictoria and Helvetica hid their beloved two-nicorn from the hungry ogre Homeroni. Girls are so lame. Isn't that right, headless Darth Vader? What's that? You miss your girlfriend... armless Malibu Stacey wrapped in hockey tape? Now remember, Juliet's family is very classy, so be on your best behavior. Use as many big words as possible. I call ""computer."" Bart, you can have ""doorbell."" Nice doorbell. Is it computerized? Hey! That was-- Homer! We... I... You come up with an excuse! Ow. Homer, isn't it wonderful that my Juliet and your Lisa have become such fast friends? If you say so, M'lord. Dinner's ready! If you'll show me to your bathroom, I'd like to pretend to wash my hands. Ah, new friendship. So full of promise. Much like a young Mitch McDeere, in John Grisham's ""The Firm""... When they make a movie from his books, does he get one, or two free tickets? It depends on the production company. He had much to be happy about. A brilliant mind and a solid body that did not gain weight and needed little sleep. Attention, everyone. Lisa and I would like to perform a medley of Josh Groban's twelve most popular downloads. Juliet, I'm worried this Josh Groban is becoming a bit of an obsession for you. Let's just listen to James Horner's soundtrack to ""The Pelican Brief,"" shall we? Ah, track three, ""Researching The Brief."" I hate track three! I hate it, I hate it! I'll go get her! Hey, could you take a look at a lump on my back? I'm not that kind of doctor! Oh, I get it. Here's ten bucks. That's chewing gum. What a racket. Juliet? Are you okay? I am now. Don't you see them? See who? Our friends! The Lords and Ladies of Equalia! Juliet, you're scaring me just a little-- Co-queens Helvetica and Valedictoria! We're so glad you're finally here. I'm a giraffapuss. I'm uncomfortable in water and on land. A two-nicorn! Toss me a treat! I didn't know I could do that. And now, hit ""shuffle"" on the royal myPod. These be mini-pizzas made from dragon eggs, your majesties. Mom, please don't do that. Who is this ""mom"" of which you speak? Mom, stop! This is our thing, not yours! I'm just trying to-- It's better if you don't. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we need to talk about Lisa. She's unfocused, scribbling nonsense, living in a world of her own. Well, that's Bart for ya. We're talking about Lisa, your daughter. Seems like you and I are always talking about Bart, my son. Lisa has been seeing an awful lot of her new friend. Ah yes, the one I've seen on Lisa's Facebook page. I search all the children's Facebook pages for unflattering references to me. By the way, I enjoyed the photos of your trip to Yosemite. Oh, that. We were actually just going out for brunch and I got lost. But don't worry, officer. We'll definitely have a talk with the boy. I can't see Juliet anymore?! I thought you wanted me to have a best friend. There are limits to how much two people should be together. Well, you can't keep Juliet and me apart! I'll... I'll disobey! I'm Bart Simpson's mother. You think you've got any tricks I haven't seen? Bart Simpson, age three. Bart Simpson, age ten. Juliet! What are you doing here? I'm running away and you're coming with me! I'd love to! Oh, but I'm supposed to attend the Model U.N. this weekend. I'm the delegate from Azerbaijan, and I'm threatening a rice tariff! Lisa, I know how important the model U.N.'s work is. But Equalia needs you. I need you. Okay... best friend. I remember when I was young and I ran off to a land of equality. Name! Doctor William MacDougal. From now on you're Groundskeeper Willie. Next! This is where we'll live. How did you find this place? My family ate here last week. It really went downhill fast. But if you just believe, any place can be Equalia. Oh no! Clam-elot's is closed! I'm not surprised. Their clam chowder smelled like soap. Yeah. I wonder if Lisa has threatened the Model U.N. with her rice tariff yet. I doubt it -- Friday is usually just committee assignments and procedural rules. Mrs. Simpson! Oh hiya, Martin! How's the Model U.N.? Total chaos! We're two minutes away from a roll-call vote on a non-binding resolution and no Azerbaijan! Are you saying Lisa's not there? To the extent you can trust the word of a Belgian, yes. Lisa ran away, and it's all my fault! If I'd just let her continue her obsessive relationship with that troubled little girl, everything would've been fine. If I know my sister, and unfortunately I do, she probably ran off to some lame-o make-believe castle. A ""castle""... I know where they are! Wait! Is it some place I have to put on a tie? No! Is it a place I'd look overdressed if I did wear a tie? You probably would. What about a jacket and jeans with a nice tee shirt? Just go! You know what I think killed this place? No one wanted to drive to the middle of the forest for clams. Let's go get my little girl. My family's here! She's not here!? Girls in our hideout?! Now they'll tell people where we go to stash our stolen peaches! And to wait out our bad haircuts! We'd better tie 'em up. This place is where we came after my bar mitzvah. You said you weren't having one. Uh... it was just family. All these pictures of seafood are making me hungry. We'll get some cream for the peaches while you guard the prisoners. Don't screw it up, butt-brain! At least my dad didn't smoke after his stroke! Juliet, I'm scared. Shut your eyes and you'll be in Equalia. Equalia is not real! Maybe not, but it's better than this. Yeah. So the armies of the gnomes and the elves faced off on either side of the hollow, broad axes poised. With a fearsome cry they raced toward the center of the battlefield, banners aflutter in the breeze. What comes next?! A battle to determine the fate of Equalia. But you wouldn't be interested. I have a wide variety of interests. Is there them dragon things? Isn't that a little clich√©d? Yes! I mean, yes -- there are dragons everywhere! Green ones, Chinese ones, chubby bald ones... I like those ones! Tell me about those! And so the queens-- And the Me-Dragon... Danced the minuet of equality on a gossamer dewdrop. Awww... What's going on here? What's this? An ambitious first novel by the two brightest young writers this side of the Iowa Writers Workshop! I bet it'll burn up good! Put. The book. Down. Why should we, butt-brain? For Equalia! Well, it looks like we're safe. Looks like. Juliet, I don't want to go to Equalia anymore. What do you mean? It's a special place, but I need to live in the real world. The real world? The real world is for people who can't imagine anything better. Goodbye, Lisa. Goodbye, Juliet. Cu-ckoo! ...we have received your manuscript 'The Chronicles of Equalia'... Sounds promising so far! ""...unfortunately, it is not what we're looking for at this time. Thank you for thinking of us."" Re-jected! You got a letter all the way from New York City, and that's something! And you know what else, sweetie? You and your friend Princess Nutjob inspired me to write my own fantasy novel, based on my experiences as a dad. Okay, chapter one... uh... uh... writing is hard.
