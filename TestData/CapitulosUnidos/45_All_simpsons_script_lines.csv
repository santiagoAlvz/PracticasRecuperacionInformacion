44,45,"Hello, I'm Kent Brockman and this is Eye on Springfield. Wow, infotainment. Tonight, we solute the silver anniversary of the great Springfield tire yard fire. Twenty-five years and stilll burning strong. ...We watch Springfield's oldest man meet Springfield's fattest man... He's not so fat. And we visit with Heavyweight Champion, Drederick Tatum, who reminisces about growing up in Springfield. That town is a dump. If you ever see me back there, you know I really up bad. But first, part seven of our eye-opening look at... the bikini! Whoa, T and A. Bart, why are you still up? Lisa's slumber party. Who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me? Boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego. Lisa, your brother is so gross! You should smell his room. Now remember, Wanda, whatever shape the wax takes, that's what your husband's job will be. It's a mop. My husband will be a janitor. That looks like an Olympic torch to me. Your husband could be an Olympic athlete who will go on to have a great acting career. It's a dustpan. The wax never lies. Let's play truth or dare. Truth or dare, truth or dare. I'll take -- ""dare"". I dare you to -- kiss Lisa's brother. Eeeeeewwwwww! What the... ? Aaahhh! Ptew!! Ptew!! I'm telling Mom and Dad. You're telling who? Mom and Dad! Jinx! Now you can't talk until somebody says your name! Coming up next, an elephant who never forgets... to brush! What is it, boy? Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man. Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad? Because I'm ""jinxed"" dammit! Ow! What was that for? You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it's the law. Heh, heh. There he is! Let's give him a make-over. Run for it boy! Come here, Maggie. That's it. I'm outta here. Hiya, Homer. What's the matter, Moe? Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn't for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine. Yeah, things are tough all over. Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself. Could I get a beer? Uh, yeah, sure. Oh sorry, I forgot we're out of beer. Yeah, I know, I got behind on my beer payments. The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the ""Love Tester"". You're too late, Homer. Barney sucked it dry. Cut his gums up pretty bad. Take it easy, Homer. I learned how to make other drinks at Bartender's School. Gin and... tonic? Do they mix? Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself... One night Marge's beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation. ... and this is Patty trying to plug her leg razor into one of those ungodly Czechoslovakian outlets. As you can see, we never did get the hang of it. Aye carumba! As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink. Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment? If you're going for a beer, this is the last one. I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle. In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup. It passed the first test: I didn't go blind. They say everyone can float in the Dead Sea, but Selma sank right to the bottom. I don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good. Whoa, sounds like one hell of a drink. What do you call it? A ""Flaming Homer"". Okay, why don't you make us up a couple of ""Flaming Homers""? Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup? Uh, let me check the lost and found. What do we got here, Bowie knife, troll doll, glass eye... Oh. Here we are. It's not without its charm. Try lighting it on fire. Whoa! Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited. Hey, your Love Tester's busted. I want my nickel back. Hey, buddy. Have one on the house. Hey, hey, this drink is delicious! And my phlegm feels looser. What do you call it? Well, it's called a ""Flaming... Moe! It's called a ""Flaming Moe""! That's right, a ""Flaming Moe"". My name is Moe, and I invented it. That's why it's called a Flaming Moe. What? What are you lookin' at, Homer? It's a Flaming Moe I'm Moe. Hey, what's this? A sneeze guard. Wow, it really works. Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it? Who can say? It's probably a combination of things. Another pitcher of those amazing ""Flaming Moe's"". Boy, I hate this joint, but I love that drink. Barkeep, I couldn't help noticing your sign. The one that says, ""Bartenders Do It 'Til You Barf""? No, above that store-bought drollery. Oh great! Why don't we fill out an application? I'll need your name, measurements and turn ons.. You really expect me to tell you my measurements? You could, but I find this way is much more accurate... and fun. what do you offer in the way of salary? Minimum wage and tips. Of course there are fringe benefits. Such as? An unforgettable weekend at Club Moe. I prefer to take my vacations someplace hot. I like your moxie, kid. You're hired. You shan't regret this. Methinks I shan't. Pardon me, are you the genius behind the ""Flaming Moe""? Why yes I -- I'm your man. Huh uh. My name is Harv Bannister. I work for ""Tipsy McStagger's Good Time Drinking and Eating Emporium"". Oh yeah? Hey, what's Mr. McStagger really like? Actually, there is no Tipsy McStagger. He's just a composite of other successful logos. Well, you tell him from me that he makes one great mozzarella stick. Yes, fine, I will. Anyway, I've got a proposition for you. Keep talkin'. We feel your ""Flaming Moe"" is perfect for our restaurant chain. We want to buy the recipe. No dice. The ""Flaming Moe"" is not for sale. Do you know how much of my blood and sweat are in this drink? Figure of speech. Sorry, Harv. I'll be back. Good for you, Moe. Only an idiot would give away a million dollar idea like that. So the next time you use a gas chromatograph, remember to thank Mister A.J.P Martin. Brilliant Martin, brilliant. Once again you've wrecked the grading curve. Oh, I pity the poor student who has to follow you. Bart Simpson? You're next. ""The Inventor I Admire"", by Bart Simpson. The inventor I admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. He's my father, Homer Simpson, creator of... the ""Flaming Homer""! The ""Flaming Homer""? You mean the ""Flaming Moe"". And your dad didn't invent it, ya wuss. Moe the bartender did. Yes, everyone knows that. It's not true! My father invented that drink, and if you'll allow me to demonstrate... Bart, are those liquor bottles? I brought enough for everybody. Take those to the teacher's lounge. You can have what's left at the end of the day. Good evening, Krusty. Nice to see you, Bernard. Thank you very much. Right this way. Krusty, over here! What the--? Henceforth, this date shall forever be known as ""Flaming Moe's Day."" Uh, sir, this is already Veteran's Day. It can be two things! Mom, instead of milk for dinner, can I have a ""Virgin Moe?"" Honey, what's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him! Take that off this second! Okay. Homie, why don't you just go down to Moe's and talk to him? I bet he'd be willing to share some of his success with you. Nah... Marge, I'm too upset to eat -- I think I'll go to Moe's. . Can I help you sir? I need to talk to Moe. Your name's not on the list. I didn't even tell you my name. Okay, what's your name? Homer Simpson. Not on the list. But-- We're all filled up. Fire laws. Ladies and gentlemen, some new buddies of mine stopped by tonight. Maybe we can get 'em to come up here. How about a warm ""Flaming Moe's"" welcome for Aerosmith! I don't think so, Moe. / Yeah, we're just hangin' out. C'mon, guys. Free pickled eggs. Hello, St. Lewis! Uh, that's Springfield, Steven. Uh, yeah, right. Are you ready to rock?! Yeah!!! I said, are you ready to rock?! Yeah!!! Hit it!! WELL THERE'S A BACK SEAT LOVER, THAT'S ALWAYS UNDER COVER, AND I TALK TO MY DAD, HE SAY/ HE SAID, YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' TILL YOU'RE DOWN ON A MUFFIN AND YOU'RE SURE TO BE CHANGIN' YOUR WAYS/ I MET A CHEERLEADER WAS A REAL YOUNG BLEEDER OH THE TIMES I COULD REMINISCE/ TO THE BEST THINGS OF LOVIN' WITH HER SISTER AND HER COUSIN AND THEY STARTED WITH A LITTLE KISS/ Barney? Hey, Homer. I want you to meet my friends, Armando and Raffi. Hey, Moe, get up here! Walk this way. Walk this way. Walk this way. Hiya, Scrumptious. Do you want to ignite my drink? You're my kid's teacher! Single parent, are we? No! Well, let's pretend you are. Get away from me. Hey, Moe? Oh, hiya, Homer. How 'bout a beer? I'd rather have a ""Flaming Homer"". A what? Oh, I get it. How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it. If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise. Morris, is what this man's saying true? Well, it's hard to say. He may have come up with the recipe, but I came up with the idea of charging six ninety-five for it. Whoop, telephone. Flaming Moe's. Uh, yes, I'm looking for a friend of mine. Last name Jass, first name Hugh. Hold on. I'll check. Hugh Jass, Oh, somebody check the men's room for a Hugh Jass. Oh, I'm Hugh Jass. Telephone. Hello, this is Hugh Jass. Uh... hi. Who's this? Bart Simpson. What can I do for you, Bart? Uh, look. I'll level with you, mister. This is a crank call that sorta backfired and I'd like to bail out right now. All right. Better luck next time. What a nice young man. Homer, I'm sorry you're mad at me, but this isn't personal. This is business. Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer! What? I'm sorry. Homer, I couldn't hear you. I said, you just lost yourself a customer! What? You just lost yourself a customer. Homer, you're gonna have to speak up! You just lost yourself a customer, Moe! I lost myself to what? You just lost yourself a customer. Homer, I'll talk to you tomorrow. You just lost yourself a customer. Yeah, you can use it!

Barney! How's the world treatin' you, Mr. Gumble? Hey, there. What can I do for ya, Harv? Well sir, Tipsy McStagger would like to buy your drink. He's here?! Oh, no, no. I mean my company is willing to do what it takes to get that recipe. We're prepared to offer you one million dollars. Sorry, Harv, but like I told you before, it ain't for sale. Don't be stupid. We have a laboratory for this kind of thing. We've got it all figured out except for one ingredient. Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph... the secret ingredient is... love? Who's been screwing with this thing? I'm sorry, but the secret ingredient dies with me. Thirty cases of cough syrup. Sign here. I got hooked on this stuff in the service. Ah, my new watering hole. Yeah, what do you want?! A beer? Okay, then. Can I have a clean glass? Here you go, your majesty. Next up, a toast to the wizard of Walnut Street. The Flaming Moe dates back to my forefathers who were bartenders to the Czar. So, Mr. Hutz, does my husband have a case? I'm sorry, Mrs. Simpson, but you can't copyright a drink. Well, this all goes back to the Frank Wallbanger case of '78. How about that? I looked something up! These books behind me don't just make the office look good, they're filled with useful legal tidbits just like that! Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed... Well Homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy. Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane! Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic. Well, duh. Now that's what I call a ""Happy Hour"". Morris something troubles me. Don't worry baby, my mother won't be home for another twenty minutes. No, I was just thinking about Homer Simpson. That's okay, I was just thinking about Sybil Danning. I meant I think you should sell your drink and give half the money to Homer. But honey -- He's your friend, Morris. And you took advantage of him. Alright, alright. I'll split the million with Homer. Jeepers, Mary and Joseph. I sleep with a chick once, it costs me a half a million bananas. Moe... Moe... Moe... Bart, are you going to moe the lawn today? Okay, but you promised me moe money. I moe, I moe. Moe... Moe... Moe. When Bart's done, can we moe to the moevies? There's a moetinee. Of course. All work and moe play makes Moe a moe moe. Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe... Hey, Homer. Whatsamatter? Hey, where's Joey? Mrs. Krabappel, I really need my drum sticks. Come and get 'em. You're gonna be a rich man, Moe. I gotta tell you, the way we usually work in these situations is to steal the recipe and run the inventor out of business. C'est la vie. What the... Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe's. All the time wondering, ""How does he do it?"" Well, I'm going tell you. The secret ingredient is... Homer, no! Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup! Shoot. Thank you, Mr. Nutball. Gotta go, Moe. Tough luck. Holy cow. You just fell on Aerosmith! Hey, Homer, come in here. Hi, Moe. Where's that waitress of yours? Ah, she left to pursue a movie career. Frankly I think she was better off here. Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. Oh, hey, hey. Maybe some things are too good to be kept a secret. I guess so. Compliments of the house. One ""Flaming Homer"". Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have. Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight?
