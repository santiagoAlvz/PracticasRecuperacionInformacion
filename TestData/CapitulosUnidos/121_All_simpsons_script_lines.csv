120,121,"Marge, are we Jewish? No, Homer. Woo hoo! Mmmmm. But first: we all stink. Hey! That's according to a national survey ranking Springfield as the least popular city in America. In science: dead last. I'm telling you people the earth revolves around the sun. Burn him! What a story! You've stolen my soul. In culture: dead last. Eleanor, we've got to do something about this depression... So I propose... Oh, that's right, I'm crippled. This is horrible. People will start to avoid Springfield. But what can I do? I'm just... one man. I think we should call a town meeting. If we don't do something soon, we won't get any tourists at all. No tourists? I'll be ruined. Maps to movie stars homes! Mapa por las casas de las cineastas! Top-u stah noh cheezu map-u! Excuse me. Are you Drew Barrymore? Eh, get outta here. I'm hung over! Sorry, Miss Barrymore. What? Are there any suggestions for how to attract more tourism? The easiest way to be popular, is to leech off the popularity of others. So we propose changing our name from Springfield to Seinfeld. I may be just a boy, but I have an idea. If I may, I'd like to show you a few slides. Here's Springfield as it appears from space. Somewhere in this windy valley is the Lost Dutchman's Mine. Young man, that appears to be a picture of your rear end. So long, suckers! This is the last time I use a plan devised by Milhouse. Sorry, Bart. I'm Marge Simpson, and I have an idea. Marge is gonna say something. Now I know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions. Like switching to the metric system... The metric system is the tool of the devil. My car gets 40 rods to the hogshead and that's the way I likes it. The old person's remarks will be stricken from the record. Who said that? But my new idea is different. I think we should hold a film festival and give out prizes. Could we make our own movies and enter them? Yes! At last -- an excuse to wear make-up! All in favor of Marge Simpson's film festival idea? Film festival! Film festival! You like my idea? Actually, I have several others... Don't push your luck! Don't push your luck! And... action! Hello, I'm Bart Simpson. In the past, I've brought you such classic films as ""Homer in the Shower,"" and ""Homer on the Toilet."" And now, I give you... ""The Eternal Struggle."" Relaxed fit, my Aunt Fanny! Stupid Dockers! Oh, the belt is buckled. Now, Maude, in our movie, you lay baby Moses in the basket, then put it among the reeds. Okay? Lights, camera, act - diddily-doddily-doodilly- Action Jackson! Help meeeeee... eeeeeee... eeeee. Flanders to God, Flanders to God! Get off your cloud and save my Todd. Thanks, God. Okily dokily. Whatcha doin' Ma? I'm looking for a film critic to help judge our festival. Did you know there are over six hundred critics on TV and Leonard Maltin is the best looking of them all? Ewww. Welcome to ""Coming Attractions;"" I'm your host Jay Sherman. Thank you! Tonight we review an aging Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish 9."" I wish I was dead. Oy. But first we have a special guest: Rainer Wolfcastle, star of the reprehensible McBain movies. Jay, my new film is a mix of action and comedy. It's called ""McBain -- Let's Get Silly."" Did you ever notice how men always leave the toilet seat up? That's the joke. You suck, McBain! Now, my Woody Allen impression: I'm a neurotic nerd who likes to sleep with little girls. Hey, that really sucks. The film is just me in front of a brick wall for an hour and a half. It cost Eighty million dollars. How do you sleep at night? On top of a pile of money, with many beautiful ladies. Just asking. Yeesh. I like him. He's smart, he's sensitive, he's clearly not obsessed with his physical appearance... My ears are burning. Uh, I wasn't talking about you, Dad. No, my ears are really burning. I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-tip. ""Dear Mr. Sherman. On behalf of the people of Springfield, I would like to invite you to judge our film festival."" ""You can stay with us, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the country."" Marge, is this a pimple or a boil? Just a minute, Homer! Oh, look what you made me write! Anyway, we think you'll really enjoy our quiet little town. Sincerely, Marge Simpson."" Hmm. Do I really want to leave Manhattan? Sherman, I just realized you've insulted me. Now you will die. Hey nudnick, your shoe's untied. From here they appear to be tied, but I will go in for a closer look. Taxi! To the airport! On closer inspection, these are loafers. Attention, the flight from New York has arrived. Hey, I'm landing here! It's supposed to say Jay's name, not yours. Oh, you're right. There ya... Just second... Oh, that should... Hello, I'm Marge Simpson and this is my husband, Homer. Oh, nice to meet you, Marge. I saw your hair from the plane. And you must be the man who didn't know if he had a pimple or a boil. It was a gummy bear. Coming up next: ""The Flintstones Meet the Jetsons."" Uh oh. I smell another cheap cartoon crossover. Bart Simpson, meet Jay Sherman, the Critic. Hello. Hey man, I really love your show. I think all kids should watch it. I suddenly feel so dirty. I don't know what's happening. It seems our profits have dropped thirty-seven percent. I'm afraid we have a bad image, sir. Market research shows people see you as something of an ogre. I ought to club them and eat their bones! Heh-heh. Well maybe this film festival could help us. A film biography might let them get to know the real you -- virtuous, heroic, nubile... You left out pleasant! But I like that film biography idea. A slick Hollywood picture to gloss over my evil rise to power, like ""Bugsy,"" or ""Working Girl."" Get me Steven Spielberg! He's unavailable. Then get me his non-union Mexican equivalent. Listen, Señor Spielbergo. I want you to do for me what Spielberg did for Oskar Schindler. Schindler es bueno. Senior Burns es el diablo! Listen, Spielbergo, Schindler and I are like peas in a pod! We're both factory owners; we both made shells for the Nazis, but mine worked damn it! Now go out there and win me that festival. Homer, the guest should get the last pork chop. But, I'm still hungry. Mr. Sherman, I understand you have two Pulitzer prizes. Well, I, heh heh, it's not like I carry them around with me. Ooh, it's so hot in here. Oh, look, here's my Peoples' Choice Award... Five Golden Globes... Hmmm... Where's my Emmy? Thank you! Yeah, well I won the belching contest at work. Very nice Homer. Wow. How many Pulitzer Prizes winners can do that? Just me and Eudora Welty. Oh, I invited my sisters over. Oooh, sisters. Allow me. So then, I said to Woody Allen: ""Well, Camus can do, but Sartre is smartre."" So original. How droll. Yeah, well Scooby Doo can doo-doo... but Jimmy Carter is smarter! Okay, Sherman, you're a movie expert... So, tell us. Who's gay? Oh, I don't know... Harvey Fierstein. No! Who else? Uh, uh... Oh, McGyver's gay! You bad-mouthed McGyver, didn't you? Muh... muh... muh... Whatcha doing, Marge? Making out the jury list for the film festival. Mayor Quimby -- Krusty -- Jay -- Marge, do you respect my intelligence? Yes. Okay! Wait a minute. Why did it take you so long to say yes? No reason. Okay! Wait a minute. Are you humoring me? Yes. Okay! Wait a minute. That's bad! Look, I know I'm not witty like that critic guy. But does he know all the words to the Oscar Mayer song? OH, I WISH I WERE AN OSCAR MAYER WEINER... THAT IS WHAT I'D TRULY LIKE TO BE/ 'CAUSE IF I WERE AN OSCAR MEYER WEINER... EVERYONE WOULD BE IN LOVE WITH MEEE! That's it, Marge, he knows the whole hot dog song. Go ahead, sleep with him. I'll just take a lock of your hair to remember you by. It's just you and me now, lock of hair... You don't have to do this. Yeah, well you think I'm stupid. I don't think you're stupid. Prove it. Put me on that film jury festival thing. Fine. You're on the jury. Sir, the actors are here to audition for the part of you. Excellent. Excellent. Next. Ex... cell... ent. Next. Exactly. Heh, heh. Next. Excellente. Es muy bueno. Oh, it's hopeless. I'll have to play myself. Oh, I thought they were playing ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" tonight. Our first film is by Indian director Apu Nahassapemapetilan: ""Bright Lights, Beef Jerky."" Help, help, police! Hey, I've got problems of my own right now. Oh boy, this is gonna get worse before it gets better. Next, we have Moe the bartender in ""MO' BETTER BOOZE."" MONEY GETS YOU ONE MORE ROUND/ DRINK IT DOWN/ YA STUPID CLOWN/ MONEY GETS YOU ONE MORE ROUND/ THEN YOU'RE OUT ON YOUR ASS... WHOA! Augggh my back! Hans Moleman Productions presents ""Man Getting Hit By Football."" This contest is over. Give that man the ten thousand dollars! This isn't ""America's Funniest Home Videos."" But ... The ball... His groin!... It works on so many levels! Roll it again. Next, they're gonna show my movie. You made a movie? I made a movie? No wonder I was on the cover of ""Entertainment Weekly."" My name is Barney Gumbel. I'm forty, I'm single, and I drink. There's a line in ""Othello"" about a drinker -- ""now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast."" That pretty well covers it. It's brilliant. Savagely honest, tender -- he has the soul of a poet. You're very kind. Excuse me did something crawl down your throat and die? It didn't die. My name is Barney and I'm an alcoholic. Mr. Gumbel, this is a Girl Scout meeting. Is it? Or is it that you girls can't admit you have a problem? Don't cry for me. I'm already dead. I think we have a winner. What'd I miss? Homer, please pay attention. There's just one more movie. Simple villagers, I promise you I will close plants in America and bring work here. Viva Señor Burns! Viva! Viva! Whoa-oa-oa! We did twenty takes and that was the best one. Remember, Elliot, I'll be right here. Pure egotism. / Self indulgent tripe. I don't care what they say. I'm going to win this festival. Drink up, Judah Ben Hur. You truly are the King of Kings. Excellent. Smithers, are they booing me? No, they're saying ""Boourns,"" ""Boourns."" Are you saying ""boo"" or ""Boourns?"" Boo! I was saying ""Boourns."" All right. It's time to vote for the grand prize. I vote for Barney Gumbel's sensitive, yet unfortunately titled film, Puke-ahontas. Second. Well, I vote for Burns' movie. Me too. Now, let's get going. I got a date with Eudora Welty. Coming, Eudora. Excellent. Bribing those two judges has paid off. Just as it did during the Miss Teen America pageant. How can you vote for Burns' movie? Let's just say, it moved me. To a bigger house. Oops. I said the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet. Oh, oh dear. Two to two. Well, Homer, it all comes down to you. Football in the groin. Football in the groin. Well, we're not gonna resolve this deadlock any time soon. Why don't we all take a five minute break? It'll clear our heads. Good idea, Marge. My mind is going a mile a minute. I knew this would happen. I put you on the jury and you vote for the stupidest film. I have every right to be on that jury even though I got there because I'm sleeping with the head of the festival. How many times have I heard Rex Reed say that? Oh great, now you're going to make fun of me. No, Homer, I won't make fun of you. But I will suggest that there may be better things in life than seeing a man get hit in the groin with a football. Haw haw. Well, Homer. Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do. Hm. Barney's movie has heart. But football in the groin had a football in the groin. Don't cry for me. I'm already dead. Wow. I'll never drink another beer. Beer here! I'll take ten. And now to announcer the winner. The award for outstanding animated short goes to Itchy and Scratchy for their film, ""Four Funerals and a Wedding."" And now, the winner of the grand prize: Barney Gumbel! What? Homie, you voted for the right movie. I'm glad you were on the jury. Aw, you know something Marge, it's not that tough being a film cricket. I've learned I have a gift to share with the world. From now on there'll be a new Barnard Gumbel -- hardworking, clean and sober. Congratulations, Barney. And enjoy your grand prize: a lifetime supply of Duff Beer. Just hook it to my veins! Goodbye, Mr. Sherman. If I ever play Carnegie Hall, I'll give you a call. And if you ever want to visit my show... Nah, we're not gonna be doing that. Well, Jay, I hope you tell your New York friends that people in small towns aren't quite as dumb as they think. Marge, look. This has spring snakes inside, but the suckers will think it's Beer Nuts. Mmm... Beer Nuts. Well, it was a lovely festival. The best movie won and Mr. Burns found there are some awards that can't be bought. And the Oscar goes to... I've got to win this one. I've bribed everyone in Hollywood. George C. Scott in ""Man Getting Hit By Football."" My groin.","Charles Bronson, P.A.
