452,459,"I can't believe you're making us go to a birthday party for a kid we don't even know. You remember Dylan. You were in ""Toddle Tots"" together. I don't even remember if Dylan's a boy or a girl. Of course you do. Dylan's a... Hm... let me check the invitation... Fish theme! That tells me nothing! There's gotta be a clue here somewhere. See? Dylan is clearly a girrr-- What kind of a party has two activities? They're just trying to confuse me. Look, everyone! Dylan's best friend is here! I give up! I hope Dylan likes trucks. Lady, you don't know Dylan. Carrot cake?! Ooo, carrot cake! So moist! Battle card -- digitate! Defense card -- deflecto-warp! Disubaki -- goji kick! Hey, dinks. Whatcha dweebin'? You don't know Battle Balls? It's a Japanese card game based on a cartoon based on an ancient religion, based on a candy bar. It makes Digimon look like Pok√©mon. What?! Impossible! No food allowed in bank? Better lie low, my sweet red friend. He's got a gun! I think he's saying... he'll kill one hostage an hour until he gets what he wants! He's saying he wants one million dollars in unmarked bills! It's just a candy apple. Clearly, he's saying he wants to be tasered again. Get him deep in the meat. Homer Simpson, for causing a panic in the bank, you are hereby sentenced to one hundred hours of community service. Community service? But... that's work! What about jail? Community service! No! I wanna go to jail! Free food! Teardrop tattoos! Library books that come to youuu! I'll serve anything but the communityyy! So, sweetie. This community service detail should end around five. You wanna go to that seafood place? Ah, yeah, you got your book club again. Man, that thing sure meets a lot. Hey, you know, I've read that book... maybe I could come and... oh right, right, right. Not enough chairs. Yeah. Well, I'll probably be asleep in front of the fridge when you get home. Bye. Well, well, well, the community service detail. You people make me sick. Hey, whatcha packin', Simpson? Just my lunch. Chicken parm, meatball parm, eggplant parm... Shish ka-parm, angel food parm, moo goo gai parm... my wife can parm anything. My wife only parms on my birthday. And that's only if I give her the sad puppy-dog look. Awwww, want a bite? Really? Ya mean it? Okay, criminals, here's your assignments: Brockman, you get the used condoms out of that thorn bush, Krustofsky, go sort those bums by the war they were in... And Simpson, you sit down at this picnic table here and grab a bite with me. Teacher's pet! Hey, find your nose, funny man. There was cocaine in there! I won't last an hour! Do you ever wear your police pants to regular things? Throw a jean jacket on top of these babies and you can go anywhere. From fast food to fine dining? And everything in between. Ever stop breathing when you're asleep? Oh yeah. All the time. They say it's 'cause I'm overweight. Overweight? You? Oh now that's crazy. Now me, I have to get my underwear specially made by this village in the Ukraine. They call me ""Daddy Round-Round."" Send me a Christmas card every year. That's some big underwear. My underpants paid for their water filtration system. All right, that's it for today. Uh Simpson, hold on a sec. Um... You wanna uh... Uh, I don't know, get a beer sometime, uh... Okay. Ever been to Moe's? Uh, Earth to Homer -- I arrested you there last month. Oh yeah -- sorry I was such a jerk about it. Aw, now, who could blame you? Your sports team lost. Yeah. Well I'll see you at Moe's. I'm there every day, five to eleven. Calling all units, Chief Wiggum just made a friend. Uh, he's not my friend. He's just a non-violent perp I'm gonna pound a few beers with. Is he looking at me right now? No-no-no -- don't be so obvious. Let's all look without looking, okay? Oh my God, he likes me! Officer up! Officer way, way up! Oh man, this is so awesome! I can't believe I'm having breakfast where the cops do. Yeah, and you can feel good about eating here too, because all the cooks are ex-cons getting a second chance. Aw dang! I lost track of time! I'm gonna be late for work. No you won't. Follow me. Wow. So this is what it feels like to be a pregnant lady. Hey, Simpson! Think you got all the best Battle-Ball cards? Well, stink again, smellwad. Ralph Wiggum's got a platinum lava genie! How'd a Pull-Up like you get a great card like that? My not-dead Gramma sent it from Tokyo. Ralph, I will play you for that card. Okay, but if I win, you have to teach me how to play this game. Deal. Sir, I think something's going down. Something big. Hm. Could that be some sort of narcotics transaction? Uh, what are you asking me for? I see you're impressed by my costume for the school's annual drug awareness assembly. Uh... so am I gettin' a raise or not? No. Hey Homer, hand me my coffee. Want some sugar? No, no, I got it. Impressive. Hey, would it be okay if I uh... ""ran a make"" on myself? G'ahead. Drunk and disorderly? That's a little redundant. Hey, uh, mind if I do a little ""spring cleaning?"" I'll tell you what -- I'll just look the other way while you press ""control F3""... You just put yourself on Amber Alert! Oh my God, oh my God! Um... Okay, that's better. Not a good time to be carrying this cake. Listen Homer, uh... would you like to see my uh, my favorite place in the whole world? Really? Me? Homer, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret: cops don't have many friends. Civilians are scared of us, and uh, other cops just remind us of things we want to forget. That's why our friendship is so special to me. Chief... me too. Um, y'know I've been back here for like, ten hours. Any chance of a bathroom break? Thanks a lot, Jailbird. Now I've got you on burglary and killing a moment. Mrs. Simpson, Bart has always been what we educators term a ""Nogoodnik,"" but lately his behavior has taken a more sinister turn. Yes, we have reason to believe your son has been dealing drugs. Dealing drugs? That's impossible. He... he doesn't have the math skills! Marge, I know you've tried everything to keep Bart under control: Ritalin, Lithium, Zoloft... well, they didn't work. He has moved on to drugs. Bart? Bart, are you here? You really know how to roll 'em Bart. That's drug talk! But I could be mistaken. Let me just listen to a little more, out of context. This product is unbelievable! It's imported, you know! Ever worry the sun's not going to come back after it goes down at night? No... Uh, me neither. But, but you know who does? Ralphie. Got a lot of worries, that kid: What if the bed wets him? What if Superman decided to kill everybody? Hey, Ralph's a good kid. And he should be, he's got a great Dad. Homer Simpson, you always know the perfect thing to say. Chief, Chief, it's Lou! Okay, what is it now? They're shooting at us! We need backup now! You need backup or you want backup? We got a two-eleven in progress! Hey, what have I told you about not using the numbers?! It's an armed robbery, dammit! I guess we should go. Ooh, ooh! Can I cuff him?! Sure, why not? Chief, come on, he's not trained! Who are you, the rules police? Uh, no -- we are the police police. Nobody moves or the doughboy gets popped. Take your hands off my brother from another mother! Let's get outta here! Not to worry, Homer. That's what bulletproof vests are for. Uh-oh. Is he gonna be okay? It's gonna be touch and go. His left lung was filled with shamrock shake. McDonald's didn't even sell them this year. Don't worry, Sarah. Clancy was there for me. And I'll be there for him. Oops. Don't die on me, Clancy. You said our friendship was special. Well if it was so special, wake up you fat sack of... Homer... what happened to me? You saved my life. And I came here every day to make sure you pulled through. Thanks, Homer. You're a true friend. Unlike that Lou. You're too late. Chief, I've been sleepin' on that couch for a week. You missed the wakeup. That's all that counts. Clancy, I haven't seen my family in days. Would you mind if I went home now? Now? But I just woke up. Well, if you really want me to stay... No, no. You do what you have to do. Live your life. Which I saved. Fine! I'll stay a little more. Great! Great! And can you read me a story... that you write yourself? It should be about an imaginary meeting between Babe Ruth and Hitler. But make no mention of baseball or Germany. And, begin. Awesome. You finally made my room cool! Bart Simpson, are you a drug-o? What? No! Not until you raise my allowance. Well, can you explain what you were doing in the basement with Milhouse? Getting higher and higher... ...Scores on Battle Ball! Hey, that's pretty nifty. Let me try. Oh my gosh, that's adorable! This one's going on the Christmas tree. It's no fun if my Mom likes them! Come on, toilet! If you can handle Dad, you can handle this! Homer, where you been the last few weeks? Playing nursemaid to Chief Wiggum. People who get shot in the chest are such big babies. Ahhh, that is so much better than hospital beer. Well, well, well. So this is the ""Saint Elmo's Fire"" reunion that Andrew McCarthy himself was going to attend. Okay, maybe I lied. But you've been so needy... ""I'm hungry,"" ""I'm itchy,"" ""that's not my blood type..."" Yeah, yeah, yeah... whoa... what have we here? World's worst friend. Hey man, you planted that! It's your word against the Chief of Police. Take him away, boys. Chief, being a bad friend isn't against the law. Well if it was, he'd be gettin' the chair! You, you all would! Bad friend! Bad friend! Bad friend! Who gave me up? Guess what, Silkie. It was your own mother. How does that feel? You're both jive. You hear me? You're both jive! Oh, everything reminds me of Clancy. You mugs'll never take me alive, see. Everything. Homer? You have visitors. Homer, we haven't seen the Chief in days. And uh, we're starting to worry. Any idea where he might be? I have an idea. But I must go alone. My car is filled with printer paper I stole from work. Hey, Chief. I uh, brought a thirty-two piece chicken bucket. Ha! Just like you to forget that I might want some. C'mon, c'mon, stitch those alligators! We gotta get those knockoff Lacod shirts to the mall in time for the crazy days of summer sale! Freeze! Careful, boys -- looks like his weapon's loaded... with twelve original herbs and spices. You're jive, do you hear me? You're all jive! I'm sorry, Homer. If I hadn't been so needy, we wouldn't be in this trunk. Well, I was kind of ungrateful. You did save my life. Well, at least we got to be friends again -- y'know, before we got whacked. We're not gonna get whacked. Because you're Chief Clancy Wiggum, and you're gonna figure a way out of this. You have that much faith in me? No, faith is what you have in things that don't exist. Your awesomeness is real. Louie, how about some ominous music? It will make our drive to the body dumpery most cinematic. You got it, boss. This sounds like your ""Folk Divas"" mix! I'm gonna slap some sense into that CD changer! Eat Fix-A-Flat! Oh, so that was a tire iron poking me in the back. Oh, that clears up a lot. Attention all units -- Chief Wiggum and Homer have moved into a new phase in their friendship. The flame will burn less brightly perhaps, but this time, may last much longer. Well said, Lou. Oh Homer, you want to take out the police copter and hassle people with the spotlight? I know just the guy. Flanders! Wake up! Take off your clothes and prepare to be raptured. Okily dokily. Now, shave off your moustache and drink the hairs in a cup of cocoa. Hot cocoa? No, ice cold.","Ralph Wiggum, Carl Carlson, Boy #1, Snake Jailbird, Fat Tony, Eddie, Chief Wiggum, Lou, Milhouse Van Houten, Security Guard #2, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Edward G.
