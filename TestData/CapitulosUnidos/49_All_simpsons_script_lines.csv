48,49,"Now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action. Well, bye-bye belt. Homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart. Pfft, my heart is just fine. A little beer will put out that fire. And now with his picks for today's games, the man who's right fifty-two percent of the time, Smooth Jimmy Apollo. Thank you, Bret. Our first game today -- Denver and New England -- is too close to call. But if you're one of those compulsive types who just has to bet -- well, I don't know... uh... Denver. Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah! Moe's Tavern. Where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly. Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver. I think I can provide that service. Um, uh, Chief Wiggum, could you hand me that little black book? Oh, sure thing, Moe. I was just using it as a coaster. Twenty big ones on Denver. Pleasure doing business with you, H. S. All right, Denver. Justify my love. At the end of thirteen seconds of play, it's New England seven, Denver nothing. Look, Dad. I made a modest studio apartment for my Malibu Stacey doll. This is the kitchen, this is where she prints her weekly feminist newsletter... DAAAAAD! You're not listening to me. Lousy, stupid Denver. Oh, look at that, a shoe box house. Lisa, you're so clever. Why isn't Dad ever interested in anything I do? Well... do you ever take an interest in anything he does? No.... well, we used to have burping contests, but I outgrew it. Hmmm, well, if you want to get closer to him then maybe you should bridge the gap. I do it all the time. I pretend I'm interested in looking at power tools, going to those silly car chase movies, and... some things I'll tell you about when you're older. Do you understand? I think so. Bart! Whaaat? Ho, look at that score. Moxy! Why did you do that? Wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together? Okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there. Over. Over... over... over... Lisa, please, I can't hear the announcer. He said Denver just fumbled. See you in Hell, soldier boy! Bart? Yeah mom? I was thinking that while your father and Lisa watch the game, it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping. Mom, I'd love to. But to be honest, I don't need new clothes. Oh really? Hmm... So even though I'd love to spend this sunny afternoon trying on clothes. It's not... Well folks, when you're right fifty-two percent of the time, you're wrong forty-eight percent of the time. Why didn't you say that before! Okay, Jimmy, you're off the hook. We've got Miami Cincinnati coming up. Any thoughts? I certainly do, Brett. I hereby declare Miami to be Smooth Jimmy's ""Lock of the Week."" Oooh, that's a big lock all right. I just don't trust that guy. In the Cincinnati - Miami game, I declare Cincinnati to be my ""Shoe-in of the Week"". Huh, they both make a good case. After evaluating millions of pieces of data in the blink of an eye, the Gambletron 2000 says the winner is... Cincinnati by two hundred points?! Why you worthless hunk of junk! You want some of this don't ya? Yeah! Well you need to know the winners. And I know the winners. So call me now! Whoa! Five dollars for the first minute. Two dollars for each additional minute. You have reached the Coach's hot... Line... line. Yeah, lay it on me, coach. In the game of Mi-a-mi... Mm-hm. ...versus Cin- Cincinnati... cin- Cincinnati. nat- Cincinnati. ti... C'mon, c'mon! Don't you realize this is costing me money? We must consider many things. The wind... Doh, not the wind. ...is blowing out of the west... Oh... at five ... miles per hour. knots... Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think's gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins? I don't know, the Dolphins. Good, good. Moe, fifty dollars on the Miami Dolphins. Gotcha, fifty beans on Miami. Um, Homer, I got a call on the other line. Hello? Moe, it's me Mr. ""K."" Yeah, yeah, what'll it be? Put me down for seven hundred dollars on the Rams. Oh, and put Sideshow Mel down for two grand. Mom, I'm tired. I wanna go home. Can't I just lie down for a minute? Now Bart, I think you'd look very sharp in this shirt. Fine, get it. Lets go. No, no, no, you have to try it on. Oooh, and this one's fifty percent off. You know why these clothes are on sale, Mom? Because the people who wear them get beaten up. Well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn't your friend. Ooh this looks good.... oh and this one is very, very cute... And these... Oh look! Little bow ties. And don't make that face at me. How'd ya know? Touchdown Dolphins! All right, Dolphins! All right, Dolphins! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Fifty big ones! Fifty big ones? Uh-oh. You see, Lisa, Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game. You mean you made a bet? Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting. What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football? Well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you? Uh-huh. And don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. Crumbled up cookie things... So gambling makes a good thing even better. That's right. My God, it's like there's some kind of bond between us. We've got a trouble maker in booth eight. Forget him. There's a code red in booth three. My God. Those aren't the socks she came in with. Un-unn. Let's move. Bart? In here, Mom. But don't open the-- Oh Bart, you could use some new underwear too. ...three, two, one... And the final from Riverfront Stadium, Miami 24 -- Cincinnati 10. YEAH! Boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars. You'd think that wouldn't you. But you see Lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. Even though they say it's okay in the Bible. Really, where? Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay? Okay, dad. Did you two have fun? You bet. Well, we had fun too. Right now, Bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends. You gotta come out sometime, Simpson. Goodnight, Dad. I had a really nice time today. Me too, honey. Can I watch football with you again next Sunday? Sure! You'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church. See how good things can happen if you make a little effort? Point well taken. Uh, mom, could you loosen my blanket a little? Dad tucked me in too tight and it's cutting off the circulation in my arms and legs. This team is fired up! We came here to play! All right! He'll lose. What? Didn't you hear what he said? Look at the fear in his eyes. Listen to the quiver in his voice. He's a little boy, lost in a game of men. You think we should bet against them? I'd bet my entire college fund on it. You got it. Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York. Start spreadin' the news, it's New York over Philadelphia, thirty-five to ten. Dad, I hate to break the mood, but I'm getting nauseous. Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon games? Well, I like the 49ers because they're pure of heart -- Seattle because they got something to prove -- and the Raiders because they always cheat. And in an extremely suspicious play, the Raiders win. Hey, the new sign is really working. It's been a madhouse, Lisa. Let's see... football... Football: homo-eroticism in... oddball Canadian rules... Phyllis George and... Oh Doctor, what a finish! The final score -- Atlanta seventeen -- Houston thirteen. And the lowly Falcons are flyin' high. Who would have thunk it? My daughter, that's who! Yeah, me! Lisa, you've picked the winner every time! You must have some kind of special gift. C'mon, dad. It doesn't take a genius to realize that Houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game. Oh, my little girl says the cutest things. You know, dad, Sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week. Not Sunday -- Daddy-Daughter day. The usual, Moe. A beer and a wad of bills. Okay, ya lucky moron. Here you go, Homer. A hundred and thirty-five dollars. I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory. Aw, shut up. Look at these prices. We could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal. Tut-tut. Only the best for my family. Homer, I can't help wondering where you're getting the money from? Mom, can't a man do something nice for his loved ones? Hmm, I guess so. Hello, I'm Marco. I'll be your waiter. Hello, I'm Homer. I'll be your customer. Never heard that one before. Uh, would you care to select the wine? I'll do the honors. No. No. No. No. My God, what passes for a wine list these days. Marco, just bring us your freshest bottle of wine. Chop. Chop. Charming lad. Oh, violin guy! What's your favorite song, Lisa? The Broken Neck Blues. Play on. It is the play-offs, it's five below and there's one loyal fan wearing nothing but a g-string and the team colors painted on his body. He doesn't look too happy. Well, maybe the paint has shut off his pores and he's slowly suffocating. Still, that is a real fan. Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter's picks. Dad, I'm making the Chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. And with your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys plus five at Chicago. Good, good... You call Moe. Moe, this is L.S. calling for H.S. Just give me the bet, Lisa. Hundred and ten, a hundred and twenty... You lucky son-of-a... Hey Homer, you wanna go bowling next Sunday? Barney, are you nuts? That's the Super Bowl. How about the Sunday after that? Well, my ma's coming in from Norway, but... uh what the hell. And when the doctor said I didn't have worms anymore -- that was the happiest day of my life. Thank you, Ralph. Very graphic. Lisa Simpson? Would you like to read your essay? The happiest day of my life was three Sundays ago. I was sitting on my daddy's knee when the Saints, who were four and a half point favorites, but only up by three, kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second, to cover the spread. Dear God! Oh dad, you must've bought me every Malibu Stacey accessory there is. Not quite. They were out of the Malibu Stacie Lunar Rovers. Ooh, perfume. Meryl Streep's ""Versatility."" Boy, I know you're gonna like your present. Shut up. Shut up. Kiss my butt. Shut up. Go to Hell. Go to Hell. Dad, I promise you I will never get tired of this. Homer, those are very thoughtful presents. But you have to tell me where you got the money from. All right, Marge. I'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad. I promise I will get mad, because I always do when you make me promise I won't. All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football. Homer! You promised you wouldn't get mad! I did not! I promised I would get mad! She's an eight-year-old girl. But Marge, she never loses. She's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent? But gambling is illegal. Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it's brought Lisa and me together. Well, I just don't know. Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted. Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this. You know, dad, we've been watching a lot of TV lately. Maybe, the Sunday after the Super Bowl, we could hike up to the top of Mount Springfield. The fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets. Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney. What about Daddy-Daughter day? Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away. So that's it. You just wanted me to help you gamble. You never wanted to be with me at all. You're a very selfish man. Go to hell! Go to hell! Hey, once again. Great present, Dad. My third husband bought me this. Give me some chips for it. Are you sure, ma'am? Don't tell me what to do, Sonny. I've been gambling since I was eight. And I've been hockin' jewelry since I was twelve. Now give me some chips! Look around you, Malibu Stacey. All this was bought with dirty money. Your penthouse, your Alfa Romeo, your collagen injection clinic. You're going back into the shoe-box. It may not be pretty, but dammit, it's honest. I, Lisa Simpson, am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten Malibu Stacey accessories! Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat. Huh? So you've come to buy my forgiveness. Sorry, Homer. Look Lisa, honey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But I really had a good time watching football with you. And I think you had a good time with me. Yeah, I did. Well, c'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can't we? Eh? Huh? Well, I would like to see what all the fuss is about. It's a date! So... do you think the Cowboys will beat the spread? Put me down. Look dad, I'll tell you who's gonna win the Super Bowl if you want me to. But it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me. Okay. I think Dallas is a mortal lock. Dallas! Whoo-hoo! However... However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what? However, I may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously I want you to lose. In which case, I'd bet the farm on Buffalo. Lisa, do me a favor. Complete this sentence: ""Daddy should bet all his money on..."" I don't know. If I still love you, Dallas. If I don't, Buffalo. Homer, I think that chip's got enough dip on it. We're live from Miami Florida home of Super Bowl Twenty-nine. Today we're gonna be seen by people in over one hundred fifty countries all over the world. Including our latest stolen affiliates overseas. Stupide. Whaa! I'm sorry Mrs. Wellenmelon. Formidable! Oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. I gotta get outta here. Moe's Tavern, Home of the Super Sunday Brunch Spectacular. Oh! Baloney. Bread! Gotcha ya down for forty bucks. Good luck Your Eminence. Sorry, Homer, you can't take any more of my money. I'm, uh, outta the bookie business. But Moe, you've been taking bets all... Hey Barney, how 'bout a free beer? Wow! Don't worry, Moe. I'm not bettin'. What? Gimme that. I had the greatest gift of all, a little girl who could pick football and I ruined it. Well sir, we're two hours and forty-five minutes into the pre-game show and we've got ourselves a special guest. Actor Troy McClure, whose new sitcom is premiering tonight -- coincidentally enough, right after the game! Thanks, Bret. My new show's called ""Handle with Care"". I play Jack Handle, a retired cop who shares an apartment with a retired criminal. We're the original odd couple! What made you want to do a situation comedy? Well, I fell in love with the script, Bret, and my recent trouble with the IRS sealed the deal. Could be another Drexel's Class. Ooh, looks like we're almost ready for the kickoff. Dallas kicks -- oh, it's a bad kick, way too short. Buffalo's going to start with excellent field position. Buffalo's gonna win. Lisa hates me! Whatcha got riding on this game? My daughter. What a gambler. That was the score at the half. Buffalo fourteen: Dallas seven. It's time for the never tedious Super Bowl halftime show. People of Earth, we've come ten billion light years to bring you this halftime message of peace. Oh, this sucks. C'mon snipers. Where are you? Bart, who's winning? ""You hate dad"" is up by a touchdown. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Yea!! It's a touchdown for half-back Dan Beer-dorf! Duff Dry has won the Duff Bowl! They wanted it more. Hey Homer, didn't you say if Duff Dry wins, your daughter loves you? Not Duff Dry... Dallas. Okay, okay. They're both great teams. Huh? Touchdown Cowboys! All right, we're back in business. Well, I'm glad some people could resist the lures of the big game. Oh my God, I forgot the game! So, with three ticks left on the clock, it all comes down to this one play. If Dallas scores here, happy fans'll be looting and turning over cars in the Lone Star state tonight. Here's the handoff. Please, please, please... Touchdown! Stick a fork in this one. It is done. The Dallas Cowboys wins Super Bowl twenty-nine. I guess you love dad. I suspected as much. Yes! She loves me! She loves me! What are you so happy about Homer? You didn't win any money. Money comes and money goes, but what I have with my daughter can go on for eight more years! Come on, Dad! It's beautiful. Isn't it though? After I catch my breath... can we... go... home?","Bret, Ralph Wiggum, Librarian, Miss Hoover, Troy McClure, Chief Wiggum, Marge Simpson, Man, Player, Football Announcer, Box, Homer Simpson, Cesar, Lisa Simpson, Larry, Nutty Comedian, Duff Announcer, Krusty the Clown, Rev.
