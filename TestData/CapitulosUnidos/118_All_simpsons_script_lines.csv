117,118,"When Krusty wants to he can still blow 'em away. Yes. He can take a simple, everyday thing like eating a bicycle and make it funny. See you tomorrow, kids. But before I go I'd just like to say... Ahh, there's nothing better than a cigarette, UNLESS it's a cigarette lit with a $100 bill. Put five thousand bucks on the Lakers... Hire Kenny G to play for me in the elevator... My house is dirty, buy me a clean one... Krusty, as your accountant, I must warn you you're spending too much mon-- Did you send those thousand roses to Bea Arthur's grave? Yes, but she's still... I don't want to hear the end of any sentences... George Carlin on three. Yeah? Lawsuit? Oh, come on! My ""Seven words you can't say on TV"" bit was entirely different from your ""Seven words you can't say on TV"" bit. So I'm a thief, am I? Well exCUSE MEEEEEEEEE! Give him ten grand. Steve Martin on four. Ten grand. Krusty, in regards to the large wager you made on yesterday's horse race... Oh, come on. How about letting me go double or nothing on the big opera tonight? Who do you like? The tenor. Okay. But we're only letting the bet ride because you crack us so consistently... up. You've got to stop blowing your money like this, Krusty. No can do. And those ridiculous bets you make! Gambling is the finest thing a person can do, if he's good at it. But you haven't won anything in months. So I'll just make some more money. Crank out some cheesy merchandise. But you've already merchandized everything: Krusty's Monopoly Game,... the Krusty Krowd Kontrol Barrier. Nothing is selling anymore. Not even your new ""Lady Krusty"" line. But our info-mercials are running twenty-four hours a day. So, what do you think of the Lady Krusty Moustache Removal System now, Angelique? It's Krusterific, Johnny Unitas, but is my upper lip supposed to bleed like this? Probably. At this rate you'll be broke in a month. The only thing left to do is to open a clown college and train some ""regional"" Krustys. You mean like that bozo, Bonko the Clown? Exactly. Forget it. I'll just cut back on the condor egg omelettes. Mmmm, a couple of those would be tasty right now. I'll found the college tomorrow. It must be the first of the month! New billboard day! Finders keepers. ""This year give her English Muffins."" Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard. ""Best in the West."" It rhymes. Clown college? You can't eat that. Well, I got everything I was supposed to get. I'm not going to enroll in that clown college though. That advertisement had no effect on me whatsoever. Hey, Homer. The section you're supposed to be monitoring is on fire. Clowns are funny. Mom? I think I'll have some wine. Marge. Yes, Homie? That's it! You people have stood in my way long enough. I'm going to clown college! I don't think any of us expected him to say that. Hurry up -- it's my first day of clown college. Hold still, Homer. Don't squirm. I am holding still. I am squirming. Dad, you can't just go around pretending to be Krusty. It's sacrilege. He's a one and only. I mean, he invented the pie fight, the prat fall, and the seltzer bottle... as far as I know. Yeah dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as Tom Bosley. But Krusty! You weren't complaining when I got you this close to Chachi. What's a Chachi? All right. Now, there can only be one Krusty in each territory, so I hope this works out. Tell me where you're from. Georgia. Texas. Uh... Brooklyn. Russia. New Hampshire. Homer. Okay, we'll start off with the baggy p...wha? Those are supposed to be baggy pants. Baggy! Ooh, I've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life. Okay, memorize these funny place names. Walla Walla, Keokuk, Cucamonga, Seattle... Stop it! You're killing me! Seattle... And now everybody's favorite, the ""spin cycle fantastique"" trick. It's a great piece of buffoonery if you pull it off, but if you blow it, you'll look like a fool. Steady, steady... Now, when the wealthy dowager comes in, the party's over, right? Wrong. Kill wealthy dowager. Uh, burn that seat. These Krusty brand balloons are three bucks each, but get a cheap one and what happens? It goes off, takes out the eyeballs of every kid in the room. What's that gonna cost yA? Hey Bill, what did that cost us? Wow. I'm sorry I doubted you before, Dad. If there has to be a bastardized version of Krusty, I'm glad it's you. Thanks honey. Bank shot. Good aim, Dad. Well, it was my major. Welcome to the noble family of skilled Krustaceans. You will now go back to your hometowns and do kids' parties, swap meets, and all the other piddling crap I wouldn't touch with a ten foot clown pole. Now come and get your cat skins -- Uh, I mean sheep skins. This is the happiest day of my life. A-YAH-ha. Got it! No shock for me . Oh yeah? And now, to help introduce our fantastic new burger, the one with ketchup, here he is, coming in by parachute.... Krusty the Klown! To- Audience -I - now - proclaim - this - new - burger... for sale. Lord save me. It's the Krusty Burglar! Omigod! He's stealing all the burgers! Why you little - I've got you! Homer, it's all just an act. Stop! Stop! He's already dead! Krusty the Clown everybody! Please look at my Medic Alert bracelet. Hey, hey. And - then - take - that, and - put - that - in - there - and Ah. Here's your giraffe, little girl. I'm a boy. That's the spirit. Never give up. Well, I guess you're pretty impressed, huh Bart? My dad got Krusty the Klown to personally appear at my party. I have a feeling I could get him to appear at my house. I don't know, Bart. My dad's a pretty big wheel down at the cracker factory. Uh, it's not 5:30 yet. Hey, nice threads. I'm beat, and after work I've got to dedicate a new jiffy lube and co-host the Ace Awards. Wow, jiffy lube. Boy, you're really running yourself ragged. Oh yeah. When I started this clown thing I thought it would be nothing but glory. You know, the glory of being a clown? I tell ya, it's hard, tiring work, but when I see the smiles on their little faces, I just know they're getting ready to jab me with something. Well my time's almost up here, so uh, I'd just like to say I know Woody Allen. And now the winner for the most promising new series on cable: old ""Starsky and Hutches."" Accepting the award is the son of the guy who played ""Huggy Bear."" Let's walk and talk. I ah, I have some wonderful stories about other famous people that include me in some way. Uh, can't. I've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo. Hey! Me too! We can go together. Uh... no. I'm going a different way than you, Dick. Your churlish attitude reminds me of the time I was having dinner with Groucho, and... Look, you're gonna be having dinner with Groucho tonight if you don't beat it. Being a clown sucks. You get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly. Who am I clowning? I have no business being a clown. I'm leaving the clowning business to all the other clowns in the clowning business. Oh no. Well, well, well ""Velocity Boy,"" I am gonna give you the biggest ticket you... Hey! Krusty! I'm not Krusty. Oh, to think I was going to give you a ticket! Krusty the Klown! I am not Krusty. Hey Krusty, Krusty, remember the time we got loaded and set those beavers loose in that pine furniture store? Memories. All right, you take it easy, Krusty. Hey, he didn't give me a ticket! This is an intriguing development. You mean I get 5% off on everything in the store just because I look like... I mean, just because I am Krusty the clown? How could I charge full price to the man whose lust for filthy magazines kept me in business during that first shaky year? By the way, here is your new issue of ""Gigantic Asses."" I'm telling you, Marge, this will work. They'll think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff. I've been gettin' free stuff all day. Look at this swell bucket of house paint. Look at it. I'm not saying it won't work. I'm just saying it's dishonest. Well if we agree, then why are we arguing? Hey, Krusty! Hey, ooh, beautiful date tonight! And such lovely children you have now! I'm more striking than lovely. You come with me. Come with Liugi. You don't want to sit with the rest of this scum. I only consider you scum compared to Krusty. Yeah, you see how you're scum. Let me get this straight. You took all the money you made franchising your name and bet it AGAINST the Harlem Globetrotters? I thought the Generals were due. He's spinning the ball on his finger! Just take it! Take the ball! That game was fixed. They were using a freakin' ladder for god's sake! I am afraid the time has come for you to pay us. Look, I'm cleaned out. Just take the clown college. We have already taken it. Kids have a lot of money these days, so, after you finish your performance, you might consider robbing 'em. Look, what can I tell ya? You can't get blood from a turnip. You wanna kill me? Go ahead and kill me. Hey! Hey! All right, okay, already. Look, we can talk this over. No more talk. It is time for us to take you for a ride. Mind if I go to the bathroom first? I see no harm in that. When he's done in there, I gotta go. Okay, wherever Krusty's gone, we'll find him. Legs, you check out the East Side. Louie, Rome and Budapest. Tell the boys I want a total world search. Right, Boss. I want a free car because I'm Krusty. Krusty the clown! Get it? Krus-ty! Cancel the world search. I want everything that's coming to Krusty the clown, which is me... Krusty. Hey! It's Krusty all right. Should I shoot him gangland-style or execution-style? Listen to your heart. Well, I can't give you the car, Krusty... but I can let you have this little number for practically nothing. Only thirty-eight thousand. Hey, what are these holes? These are speed holes. They make the car go faster. Oh yeah. Speed holes. You want my advice? I think you should buy this car. We need more ammo. Let's go to Big five. Krusty, your plastic surgery is complete. Now when I remove the bandages don't be alarmed by the total stranger staring back at you. I look exactly the same, you moron! Nonsense Krusty, you look at least ten years younger. Plus I did your breasts. Does anyone hear me complaining about the breasts? Ah, what's the use in hiding? I gotta go back to Springfield and face the music. Can you loan me bus fare? Hey hey hey hey hey. Whatcha diddily doin', neighbor? Putting speed holes in my car. Makes it go faster. Is that so? Well gee... maybe the old FlandersMobile could use a... Lucky I always keep a Bible close to my heart. Lucky I was wearing an extra large piece of the True Cross today. I think I'll go inside. What keeps doin' that? I told you we should've bought more than three bullets. Let's just grab him. But wait. You can't kill me for being Krusty. I'm not him. I'm Homer Simpson. The same Homer Simpson who crashed his car through the wall of our club? Uh... actually my name is Barney. Yeah. Barney Gumbel. The same Barney Gumbel who keeps taking pictures of my sister? Uh... actually my real name is uh... Think, Krusty, think... Joe Valachi. The same Joe Valachi who squealed to the Senate Committee about organized crime? Benedict Arnold! The same Benedict Arnold who plotted to surrender West Point to the hated British? I am so glad I had a chance to meet you before we did this, Krusty, because I am a great-a fan. Don Vittorio Dimaggio. Krusty the clown. Sorry, I have to do this, Krusty. I cannot do it. To murder a funnyman of such genius would be a crime. Tell you what, Krusty. Do for me my favorite trick where you ride the little bike through the loop, and I will let you live. But, I've never been able to do the... How 'bout if I just squirt you in the face with my boutonniere? Okay. I'll never be able to do this trick... never. Go! Go! Hey! I'm doing it! I'm doing it! I'm the greatest clown in the world! The fact that you did not do the trick well is the biggest insult of all. Hey, guys, I came to uh... Uh, you've got a deadly game of cat and mouse goin'. I'll come back. I'm seeing double here. Four Krustys. Krusty! Oh thanks! Thanks a lot! You came here to save me! Yeah, that's what I did. My apologies to you. I almost made a grievous error. Goodbye, Krusty. Wait! He can't kill anybody if he doesn't know which one's the real Krusty! I am confused. Heh-heh, good one, Krusty. Oh crap. Because of that disrespectful display, I shall now kill both of you... Unless... you both go through the loop. Together. I can't see, you idiot! Take your hands off my eyes! Uh-ho. Without the loop, it is nothing. Ta-Da! Yayyyyy Krustys! Grazie. Grazie. You have brought great joy to this old Italian stereotype. No, no, Don Vittorio, you're not. Yes I am. I know it. I am. Anyway, thank-a you, Krusty. You're welcome. So, we're even now, huh? No. We just won't kill you. But you still owe us the money. Forty-eight dollars. Here's fifty. And two, your change. And we thank you.","Ralph Wiggum, Carl Carlson, Salesman, Fat Tony, Chief Wiggum, Milhouse Van Houten, Gangster, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, 2nd Texan, Homer Simpson, New Englander, Lisa Simpson, Kid In Crowd, Gangsters, Secretary, Georgian, Johnny Unitas, Lenny Leonard, Krusty the Clown, Kirk Van Houten, Ned Flanders, Don Vitorio, Transport Driver, Texan, Louie, Announcer, Angelique, Krusty Burglar, Russian, Dick Cavett, Manager, Legs, Accountant, Luigi, Bart Simpson, Plastic Surgeon, Student",8.5,1254.0,15,1995-02-12,1995,6,Homie the Clown,17.6,73123.0
