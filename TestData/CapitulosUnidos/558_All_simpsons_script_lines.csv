550,558,"Students, each one of you has been assigned the mandatory honor of contributing to the Springfield Time Capsule...where your arcana will lie dormant until the thirty-first century...and... By the time you finish talking, we're gonna be opening this damn capsule. Right. Time capsule. Nelson. Give me something. I brought a picture of my Dad! He's still at large... in my heart. I brought my lucky rabbit's foot. I can have good luck without it. Ow! Wish we could put this moment in the time capsule. Consider it done. How about you, Bart? Let me guess, you forgot to bring something. I'm offended you think I forgot. Let's see... Ta-da! Listen boy, this is the only legacy you'll ever leave. Better make this count. My sandwich! And so a thousand years from now, this capsule will be opened by some future Mayor Quimby. That-that could be anyone's ooze! There. And now, to help secure the jazz vote...Liser Simpson will play her saxophone. Even God hates jazz! A mysterious electrical storm is currently wreaking havoc with our studio. But I'm not one of those brainless dolts who mindlessly reads a teleprompterrrrr, error four-oh-one, backslash backslash, colon, reset C-drive, shutting down! What the hell was that?! Probably just another piece of America's space junk falling out of orbit. Remember when this country didn't suck? 'Cause I don't. Homer! Homer. I think there's someone downstairs. Relax, Marge. It's probably just Homer comin' home late from Moe's. The eyes in that picture are following me. Uh, that's a mirror. Isn't all great art kind of a mirror? We'd better send the dog down. Come on. Here's your chance to protect us, boy. Come on. Stupid dog! Ow! We'll have to set a trap, bait. I mean, Bart. All set. When he starts gnawing at you, I'll whack him with this broom. Don't drink my loved ones! Bite my shiny metal ass! A robot with a catchphrase! Hey Homer, you gonna kiss him or kill him? All right! Tether-boy! Okay, so what are you? Must be a secret government project. Oh, what do I look like, a narc? My name is Bender and I come from... ...the future! Prove it. What happens to Homer Simpson in the future? I don't know. You die? Oh. My. God. He's telling the truth. I have to take you to our civic leaders. Hey, Hibachi head. How're you gonna pay for that? Uh... let me just transfer some, uh, electronic hyper-credits into your register here. Ding-a-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding! Ooh, and, uh, another round for my friends! Ding-a-ding-ding-a-ding-ding! Hey, this Blade Rummy is all right! He's a big spender, plus he fixed the jukebox. I think they had a thing going. OH BABY WHAT YOU DONE TO ME. I hate it when they get quiet. Listen, I-I know you're a robot and incapable of emotion... It's true! I'm empty inside. Uh, look, I just wanna ask... can we be friends? You're the only guy I know with less hair than me. Sure! That's why I came to your time, for all you know. For all we know! D'oh! A strike! A totally legitimate strike! Yeah! Hey, uh, what's the robot version of bromance? Romance. You future guys have a word for everything... pal. You know, they look a little similar. Yeah, like the guy who designed Bender just took a drawing of Dad and stuck an antenna on it. A little lazy if you ask me. Regardless, I see no reason to believe that ""Bender"" is from the future. Robotic technology today is very advanced. Oh really? Can your ""modern day"" robots do this? It's not my birthday. Although Maggie's is pretty soon. I can't do Maggie. The G's look like sixes. This is the robot who claims to be from the future. Can your present-day robots do this? No, no they cannot. Not sure why they'd want to... Now why are you here? What is your mission, uh, so-to-speak. I don't remember. Man, this guy doesn't ask permission. He just goes right in ya. Aha! Bender's mission protocol is definitely intact. It just requires a delicate procedure known as ""unplug and replug."" Because that fixes everything. I remember why I'm here! To kill Homer Simpson! My ears are burning. Not yet, but they will be. A boxing glove! But we bowled together. I can't do it. What stopped you, Bender? Asimov's three laws of robotics? You think robots care what some hack science fiction writer thinks? I killed Isaac Asimov on the way over here. Well, Isaac somebody. What the?! My ass is about to project something. You don't have to announce it. Just do it quietly and blame the dog. Bender, we've just regained contact. Have you killed Homer Simpson? Uh... yep. Killed him good. If Homer's dead, why are the creatures he begat still here and multiplying out of control? What the? You lied to me, Bender! Homer Simpson's still alive! Come on, Bender. Stabbity-stabbity! Wait, stop! Why must you kill my Dad? Especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you? Homer Simpson must be eliminated immediately! The creatures destroying New New York have his D.N.A.! The monsters are stealing our office supplies! That's inexcusable! Um... Hello, robut! Looks like everyone gets a turn to say something! This concludes my turn. We sent Bender back in time to kill Homer before the monsters could evolve from him. Apparently this was too heartless a task for a robot. Leela, can you handle it? In a New, New York minute, minute! Ow! Ow! Right in my langwich centard! Professor, you-you're a fellow man of science. Maybe if we teamed up, we could uh figure something out. Okay, but remember, to me you're incredibly stupid. Oh, and the annoying girl may be helpful. Meanwhile, Leela, take Homer and explore this time period. Find out why people would ever pay for ""freemium games."" I'll explain. Okay, it starts free, right? Then you visit your friend's game, and he's got this awesome candy mansion... Get a load of those freaks. ...and you're like ""ninety-nine cents? You bet I'd like one..."" And that's why I owe Clash of Candies twenty thousand dollars. Here we are. Marge, I'd like you to meet Leela and Fry. Oh, don't mention her eye. Don't mention her eye. Don't mention her hair. Don't mention her hair. I am so pleased to meet you. Nice to be hair! Oh, Lord. Professor Farnsworth, I'm dying to know how you got here. Was it a time machine? Little girl, time machines are physical impossibilities. We teleported through a singularity that I quantum entangled to Bender under the guise of fixing his collar. But how did Bender get here? With a time machine. But you just said that-- Sample's ready! Kill all humans... kill all humans... Start with Flanders... start with Flanders... Good news, everyone! That means it's bad. The human D.N.A. in the creatures was only half Homer's! The other half came from... someone else! Oh, so we can kill that person instead. Maybe they're evil and deserve it. Or have one of those annoying voi-ces that gets on everybody's nerves! With the adding extra noises for no reason bloing... bloing. And the other person is... Who is that?! It's me! Wait a minute, we don't have to kill you. Well that's better. We just have to kill all your children. Or just one of them, if you can figure out which one sired the killer rabbits. We interrupt this hologram to bring you an important bulletin. The horrific creatures destroying New New York have begun metamorphosing. Eat my shorts! / Aye carumba! What a surprise -- it's Bart. Wow, I'm doing the same jokes a thousand years later. Ay carumba! But how did a mere boy destroy the future? Well... Let this be a lesson: never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule. That's it! All we have to do is dig up the time capsule! And bury Bart in the hole! I thought people in the future would be more full of peace and love. Like in Epcot Center. In our time, Epcot Center is a work farm for the weak. Oh, but it's not as crowded as the slave labor camps at Universal Studios. We're here. My bowling buddy. Hey! You can't dig that up for a thousand years! Plus I wrote my name there. See. Shmayday! Shmayday! They got Scruffy! No, they just got my mustache. But a life without a mustache ain't worth living. No! That generator powers the portal! If they destroy it, we'll be... -- sucked back into the future. Okay, head count. One, two, three, where's Maggie?! Well, little meat bag, looks like it's just you and me, stuck in a terrible past where I know the result of every horserace ever! To the track! I want that! Well, you can't have it! Why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little... Dad, it-it's me! Prove it. When's your birthday? February twenty-third. Ha! February has no twenty-third! Yes it does! Can you please just get us out of this lousy future? Actually, of all probable futures, this is the worst. It is, 'cause my baby's not in it! Motherly love. Why did we outlaw that? Madam, our mechanical friend Bender is your portal home. But we can't use him until the generator is repaired. Homer works at a nuclear plant! He can help us get home! Oh, are you good at your job? I was voted Employee of the Month as an April Fool's Day joke. Why you little... why you little... Great. You and Fry can bumble around together while the rest of us give up and make peace with our various deities. As for me, I'm an atheist. Oh Nobody's Father who art nowhere, I know you can't hear me, completely ignore this prayer. Nothing art thou, and Nothing will thou ever be. Jesus was just, A Man. A Man. Well, I shall stay here for the decadence. There's no debauchery like end-of-the-world debauchery! Your lips. My lips. Apocalypse. I can't believe you're all giving up without a fight. Lisa, we're just a package delivery service. And not a very good one. The only way to handle the creatures is to do what we do to each year's Super Bowl losers -- shoot them into space. But we'd have to round them up first. Let me take care of that. If there's one thing I know how to do, it's manipulate Barts. You're nuts. I've got a will of iron. Okay, let's get goin'. Dad, we have beer in our time! Hey, I haven't had a drink in a thousand years. There's a horse called ""Bender's Bounty,"" but my memory says he died during the race. That can't be true. And way, way, way back is Bender's Bounty! Dammit! Oh, chief, it looks like a robot killin' horses over there. Oh, it's six-oh-eight. Lou, can't you let me enjoy my day off? Well why are you dressed in your uniform, then? 'Cause they're the only clothes that fit me. You happy? Happy? Attention Goblins: Madison Cube Garden is filled with Butterfinger bars. And people are laying fingers all over them. They're evolving! Wow. That's a first for you, Bart. Will you shut up? Did I remind you to strap yourselves in? You realize you're cheering the death of millions of my children. Wow, it's working! I guess the instructions were in English. What the? Hey, here's a souvenir photo of you guys comin' outta my chest. Aww, I will treasure this forever. Lie detected. My sweet baby! Ooh, it feels like you have a full diaper. Oh, um... I'll change her! Here's your cut. Nice knowin' you, meat bags. Have fun turning to dust. Wait, wait, wait! You're the portal. How are you going to get to the future? The old-fashioned way. Good night, friend. You'll always have a special place here with us. Thanks, pal. Look at this mess. It would've disintegrated upon entry if someone hadn't turned off the atmosphere last night. I like it cold when I'm sleeping! Besides, these horrible earth creatures are delicious. The Johnsons will be here for dinner any minute. What happened to the handsome man I married? I ate him, remember? Here they are. Uh, hm, hope we're not interrupting anything. I can't take anymore! I can't take it! Well, perhaps the one of you that is female should go console her.
