74,75,"Well Edna, for a school with no Asian kids, I think we put on a pretty darn good science fair. Go-go ray? Allow me to demonstrate. Dah! What the...? Can't... stop... doing... The Monkey! I'm disrupting the learning process... and I love it! First prize! First prize... first prize... First prize... first prize... First prize... first prize... Why are you saying that? Just screwing with your mind. Homer, I want you to encourage Lisa with her science fair project. Yeah, syrup is better than jelly. I've grown a futuristic tomato by fertilizing it with Anabolic steroids. The kind that help our Olympic athletes reach new peaks of excellence? The very same. I think this tomato could wipe out world hunger. More tomato? Yes please! Where's your Science Fair project, boy? I thought I'd investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs. Bart, don't give the dog cigarettes! Whelp, time to go to work. Little do they know, I'm ducking out early to take the Duff Brewery tour. Roll in at nine, punch out at five. That's the plan. Heh, heh, heh, they don't suspect a thing. Well, off to the plant. Then to the Duff Brewery. Uh-oh. Did I say that or just think it? I gotta think of a lie, fast. Homer, are you going to the Duff Brewery? If the plant ye wish to flee, go to sector 7-B. To overcome the spider's curse, simply quote a bible verse. Uh, thou shall not... Hey, that looks like Princess Di! Ah, wait. It's just a pile of rags. Oh Bart, I forgot my math book. Would you hold this for me, please? Soitenly. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Whoop. Shoe's untied. Over, under, in and out, that's what shoe tying's all about. Nooooo! Bart!!!!! Welcome to the Duff Brewery. Now I'm sure all of you have heard the rumors that a batch of Duff was contaminated with Strychnine. Strychnine? / First I've heard of it. / News to me. / Etc. Are you sure? Everyone's talking about it. It was even on CNN last night. CNN? / Wow. / No we didn't. / Etc. Well it's not true. Let's go. Now here's one of our favorite Duff Beer commercials from the early 1950s. Only Duff fills your q-zone with pure beer goodness. So drink up. And up! And up! Duff Beer! Proud sponsors of Amos and Andy. We're proud of all our Duff commercials. But here's a very special one from 1960. Well, I would suggest Mr. Vanocur, that if you knew the president, that that was probably a facetious remark... And now a word from our sponsor. I would like to take this opportunity to express my fondness for Duff beer. I'd also like to express my fondness for that particular beer. The man never drank a Duff in his life. ... And here we have Duff, Duff Lite, and our newest flavor, Duff Dry. What does the future hold for Duff? Let's just say we've got a few ideas up our sleeve. Like what? Um, I'd rather not get into it right now. Why not? All right, we don't have any ideas for the future. We got nothing. Happy? No. Mom, Bart wrecked my project and the science fair's in three days! Well, I got an idea! Why don't you run a hamster through a maze? Help me! Help me! What's so funny? Oh... I was just thinking of a joke I saw on ""Herman's Head."" Now this is the most important man on the tour. He's in charge of quality control. Fine. Fine. Mouse. Fine. Mouse. Rat. Fine. Syringe. Fine. Nose. Fine. Lemme just say, you're doin' a great job, Phil. Hey, thanks a lot. That makes it all worthwhile. Mmmm... Gummi Beer. Hey, Barney. I think you've had enough. Are you crazy? We still haven't tried Raspberry Duff, Lady Duff, Tartar Control Duff... Barney, give me your keys. You're too drunk to drive. I'm fine. Okay, you leave me no option. Ow. What was that for? I'm trying to knock you out. Ow, cut it out. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Awright, here, take the keys! Look alive, boys. Coupla stewed prunes headed your way. Gulp. W,X,Y, AND Z / NOW I KNOW MY ABC'S / WON'T YOU COME AND PLAY WITH ME? Flawless. We also would have accepted ""Tell me what you think of me."" I guess you're free to... Give him a breathalizer! Gee, thanks. You're under arrest. You think you can get this car home? Sure thing, Giant Beer. Ow! Ooh... ow... Mother of Mercy... Hey, this is kinda fun. Whee!! Hello. Ah, yeah, Mrs. Simpson, I have some bad news. Your husband was found DOA. Oh my God. He's dead? Oh, wait. I mean DWI. I always get those two mixed up. My name is Mrs. Phillips. You said my husband is DWI. Uh... why don't you talk to that officer over there? I'm going out to lunch. Don't worry, Homer. I have a foolproof strategy to get you out of here. Surprise witnesses. Each more surprising than the last. I tell you, the judge won't know what hit him. Augh! Pipe down in there, Hutz. Your license is hereby revoked and you are to attend traffic school and two months of Alch-anon meetings. Your Honor, I'd like that last remark stricken from the record. No. It doesn't get any better than this. I want the most intelligent hamster you've got. Okayyy... This little guy writes mysteries under the name of J. D. MacGregor. How can a hamster write mysteries? Well, he gets the ending first, then he works backward. Oh, come on. Look kid, just take him before his mother eats him. All right? Have a good day at work, honey. Haw haw! Stupid bicycle. Can't believe this. No good, rotten... I guess it's not all bad. I propose to determine the answer to the question: ""Is my brother dumber than a hamster?"" Hey Lis, look what I can do. Doggone it. Remarkable. Stupid books. Hey, a cupcake. Uh-huh. Aaahhh! Hamster one... Bart... zero. Experiment two: The food is connected to a mild electrical current. The hamster has learned a valuable lesson. Beware the hand of man. Oooh - wise guy, eh? Ow... ow... ow! Hampster two... Bart zero... Now if any of you ever think of drinking and driving again, this film will scare the pants off of you. Guys, guys, this is the wrong movie. Oh, wait a second, I do something really funny here. What a terrible waste. Hi! I'm actor, Troy McClure. You might remember me from such Driver's Ed films as ""Alice's Adventures through the Windshield Glass"" and ""The Decapitation of Larry Leadfoot."" For the next 60 minutes we'll be seeing actual film of car crash victims. Here's an appealing fellow. In fact they're ""a-peeling"" him off the sidewalk. It's funny `cause I don't know him. Heh, heh, heh. I'm here for the Alch-anon meeting. Huh uh, third door on your left. Coping with senility? No! I'm here for microwave cookery. No, wait. Coping with senility. My name is Ned. Hello Ned. It's been four thousand days since my last drink. It was my first and last Blackberry schnapps. Ned, did you clip Ann Landers today? Ann Landers is a boring old biddy. Ned! I was more animal than man. My name is Ot-to. I love to get blot-to. My name is Hans. Drinking has ruined my life. I'm thirty-one years old. My name is Homer and I'm just here because the court made me come. Homer, with our help you'll never touch a beer again. So they say I might have a problem. Homie, do you ever drink alone? Does the Lord count as a person? No. Then, yes. Do you need a beer to fall asleep? Thank you, that'd be nice. Do you ever hide beer around the house? Do I ever! Ah. Do you ever drink to escape from reality? Homie, I'd like you to do something for me. You name it. I want you to give up beer for a month. You got it. No deer for a month. Did you say beer or deer? Deer. Please, Homie, I know you can do this. All right. Starting tomorrow, no beer for a month. What was that noise? I was saying ""Pssst. I love you."" Bart, could you go get the cupcakes? Cupcakes, cupcakes. Yes, sweet cakes for all. Well, beer... we've had some great times. WHEN I WAS 17 / I DRANK SOME VERY GOOD BEER / I DRANK SOME VERY GOOD BEER I PURCHASED WITH A FAKE I.D. / MY NAME WAS BRIAN MCGEE / I STAYED UP LISTENING TO QUEEN WHEN I WAS 17. Huh? She'll pay for this. I'm gonna crush her like this pellet. Ow! Ow! Ow! Looking for something? What have you done with my report? I've hidden it. To find it, you'll need to decipher a series of clues, each more fiendish than the... Got it. Behold gravity! In all its glory. Pretty lame, Milhouse. Can I touch it? I've worked too long and hard on this for you to screw it up now. But it's got my name on it. Just stand over there. Over there! Behold the flying machine that will carry me, Phileas Fogg, around the world in 80 days! Dang, I was aiming for his head. Don't think about beer. Hm. Alcohol fueled car. One for you... one for me... One for you... one for me... I don't know if I like you experimenting on your brother. Please, Mother. It's purely in the interest of science. That'll learn `im to bust my tomater. Step right up folks! We'll answer the question that has been plaguing scientists for ages. Can hamsters fly planes? Oooh, look he's got miniature goggles on! And a little scarf, isn't that adorable? But this project has no scientific merit. Lisa, every good scientist is half B.F. Skinner, and half P.T. Barnum. I don't think I need to see the other exhibits. First prize! One down. Twenty-nine to go. DOWN WITH SEXISM! DOWN WITH SEXISM! DOWN WITH SEXISM! Huh, look at all those feminists. You thinking what I'm thinking? T.V. have you turned on me, too? The windup and the two two pitch... Oh no! The batter is calling for time... Looks like he's going and getting himself a new bat. And now there's a beachball on the field. And the ballboys are discussing which one of them is gonna go get it. I never realized how boring this game is. I think I've lost weight. You've never looked better. Thank you all for coming. We've got some very interesting developments in the field of Supperware. Uh huh. This is the 128 ounce tub. You can fit your whole head in it. Don't be scared Jubjub. It's mama. I would kill everyone in this room for a drop of sweet beer. So Homer, please feel free to tell us anything. There's no judgment here. The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers. I cast thee out! Don't think about beer... Don't think about beer... Don't think about beer... Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug. Nooooo! Thirty days! I'm proud of you, Homie. Marge, I'm going to Moe's. Send the kids to the neighbors, I'm comin' back loaded. You don't have to start drinking right away. I was thinking we could go for a bike ride. But Marge, the barflies are expecting me... Moe, and Barney and that guy who calls me Bill... But you look better... you don't sweat while you eat anymore... and look. You've saved more than a hundred dollars. I found it in your pants. Yoink. Well, well look who it is. Mr. ""I don't need alcohol to enjoy life."" We hate him, right fellas? Moe, gimme a beer. Hey everybody! Homer's back! C'mon Homer. Do it for your old pal Moesy. But Moe. Yesterday you called Homer a worthless sack of... Pipe down, rub-a-dub. Ow. Put it in the fridge, Moe. I got a date with my wife. You'll be back. And so will you... and you... And you! Of course I'll be back. If you didn't close, I'd never leave. RAINDROPS KEEP FALLING ON MY HEAD... BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN MY EYES WILL SOON BE TURNING RED... LA LA LA LA LA LA...
