52,53,"Now, class, I promised you a surprise today... Wow. I knew it. ...And here it is. We're going to take a test. We're going to take a test. All right! A test! It's called the Career Aptitude Normalizing Test, or ""CANT"". Some of you may discover a wonderful vocation you never even imagined. Others may find out life isn't fair. In spite of your Masters from Bryn-mawr, you might end up a glorified baby-sitter to a bunch of dead-eyed fourth graders while your husband runs naked on a beach with your marriage counselor. First question: ""If I could be any animal, I would be A) A Carpenter Ant; B) A Nurse Shark; or C) A Lawyer Bird."" Question sixty: I prefer the smell of A) Gasoline; B) French Fries; or C) Bank Customers."" Well, that was a waste of time. Janey, school is never a waste of time. Since we have fifteen minutes until recess, please put down your pencils and stare at the front of the room. Here for the tests. C'mon Emma. Here's your scientifically selected career -- Architect. Mm, hm. Insurance salesman. Mm, hm. Salmon gutter? Military strongman. Systems analyst systems analyst systems analyst... Systems analyst. Awriigght! Homemaker?! Mm, hmm. It's like a Mommy. Police officer? Well, I'll be jiggered. If you'd like to learn more I could arrange for you to ride along in a police car for a night. Hey, I don't need you to get me in the back of a police car. I really think you should consider this. You know, before I saw these test results I had you pegged as a drifter. Wow, a drifter. Lousy sheriff. Run me out of town. He's lost my vote. Cool. A homemaker! I might as well be dead! Lisa, it's not that bad. So what're you gonna be, boy? Policeman. That's nice, Bart. You know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while. But they said he was too heavy. No, the Army said I was too heavy. The police said I was too dumb. Well, I'm gonna be a famous jazz musician. I've got it all figured out. I'll be unappreciated in my own country, but my gutsy blues stylings will electrify the French. I'll avoid the horrors of drug abuse, but I do plan to have several torrid love affairs. And I may or may not die young, I haven't decided. Honey, if that's what you want, we'll do anything we can to help. Wait a minute. Isn't anybody gonna follow in my footsteps? Can you tell me if I have what it takes to be a blues musician? Sure can. Show me your chops. Uh huh... Yeah. Cool. So you think she has talent? Sure. Do you think she could be a professional some day? Oh, Lord no. But I'll practice every day! Yeah, well I'll be frank with you, Lisa. And when I say frank, I mean, you know, devastating. You've inherited a finger condition known as ""stubbiness"". It usually comes from the father's side. Stupid fingers. You're wrong, you're wrong! You don't need long fingers to play the blues. The blues come from in here! My God, they are stubby. Look, I didn't steal that copper wire. I just thought they were throwing it out. Here, take it. No no, sir, we're here to pick up your son. He's coming on a ride-along. Good for you. Maybe this'll straighten the boy out. Wow! Can I see your club? It's called a baton, son. Oh, what's it for? We club people with it. Well, it's about time. So, you guys like being cops? Oh it's great. You get to run red lights... Park wherever you please... Hot and cold runnin' chicks... And when you go home at night, you know you've made a difference. Hey Bart, you see that Caddy over there? Huh-huh. That's Mayor Quimby's car. Tonight Hizzoner is ""polling the electorate"". How would you like a street named after you? I tell ya, they only come out at night. Dear Log... This will be my last entry. For you were a journal of my hopes and dreams, and now I have none. Do you need straight A's to be a cop? Hey, fellas, let's go shoot some bad guys. Whoa, whoa, it doesn't quite work that way, son. People see movies like ""McBain"" and they think it's all bang-bang, shoot-'em-up, cops-n-robbers. Let's roll! One ocean tango... We are in pursuit of a speeding individual, driving a red... ...car. License number... Eggplant-Xerxes-Crybaby-Overbite-Narwhal. Ohhh, nooo. Coppppss. Ooh, they used nylon rope this time. It feels so smooth against my skin. Almost sensuous. Oh, baby! Damn boxes! He's trapped. Where's our backup? I don't know. Son, this is against every regulation, but would you cover us? Woww! See you in hell, punk. Act Two: ""Death Drives A Stick."" See you in hell, punk. Man, that was close! Good thing this alley got so narrow in the middle. Well, that's nice work, boys. Looks like you just bought yourself a lottery ticket... to jail. He's unconscious, sir. They can still hear things! Sir, I know what I wanna be when I grow up. A cop! Well, until then, son, I'm gonna make you an honorary police officer... Eddie, give him your badge. Hey! Morning, honey. What's so good about it.... Lisa, I know you're down on homemaking, but it can really let you be creative. See, this morning I turned bacon, eggs and toast into a nice smiley face for Bart and Homer. What's the point? They'll never notice. Oh well, you'd be surprised. Now, just relax your hand. Thank you, Ma'am. You've been most cooperative. Bad dog! Very bad dog. Mom, before you blame the dog, I think you should take a look at these surveillance photos. Oh... Oh... Unng... Oh, Bart. Uh, I don't know how that got in there. Lisa, why aren't you at band practice? I quit. Oh, honey, right now you're discouraged. But deep down, you know you love the saxophone. I think you should stay in the band. If you think it's so great, why don't you join the band? Lisa, there are a lot of people in the world who like to tell you what you can't do. But they don't always know what they're talking about. You know what I want to be when I grow up? The girl on the oatmeal box? No, I'm going to be an astronaut. Women can't be astronauts. Why not? They'd distract the men astronauts so they wouldn't keep their minds on the road. There will too be women astronauts! It's true! And we'll all live in cities on the moon. So you see, my sisters were wrong. Except about the cities on the moon. I was wrong about that. So... well, you can see how anyone can be wrong. Sweet vigilant puma. Principal of the mountains. Hi Lis, want to quiz me on the vowels? Janey, I'm about ready to chuck the whole stinking alphabet. Huh? Lisa, what are you doing? That's the bad girl bathroom. A doy. You wanna egg his house? Okay. What're you lookin' at? Nothin'. Then get out, 'cause we're figuring out stuff to egg. Okay, but if you really want to honk Skinner off, I suggest you attack the one thing he truly believes in. I saw some awful things in 'Nam, but you really have to wonder at the mentality that would desecrate a helpless puma. I never thought I'd say this, but the no-goodniks rule this school! God, I could really use a half-day. Think you're big men with your handcuffs and blasted tasers! Get him outta here. I'll get you Bart Simpson, if it's the last thing I do! Now what is this all about? Well, it's quite simple, really. I observed our friend Groundskeeper Willie burning leaves with a blatant disregard for our clean air laws. Bart Simpson on the side of law and order? Has the world gone topsy-turvy? That's right, man. I got my first taste of authority... And I liked it. Hm. Bart, there are a lot of troublemakers in this school... and Lord knows I can't be everywhere at once. Go on. Look, let's can the euphemisms, huh? No more bullspit. How would you like to be a hall monitor? Wouldn't that mean squealing on other kids? That's the meat of it, yes. Hmm. Now, Witness X, will you please tell the court what you saw? I'd be more than happy to. I saw Mr. Montone there seal the late Mr. Palacio in an oil drum and roll him off the pier. I keel you!! Aye carumba! Uh, I don't know. Oooh, now, you get to wear a sash... You've got yourself a narc. Hey, Jimbo, keepin' your nose clean, dude? Attaboy! Hey, Donna, who loves ya, baby? Not in my hall, bub. I think you've had enough, sister. C'mon, let's keep it moving. Pink belly! Pink belly! Pink belly! Allright, break it up, boys. That belly ain't gonna get any pinker. Okay. Wedgie! Oh! Thanks, Bart. Bart's grades are up a little this term. But Lisa's are way down. We always have one good kid and one lousy kid. Why can't both our kids be good? We have three kids, Homer. Maaarge... The dog doesn't count as a kid. No, Maggie! Oh yeah. Now, take some paste and spread it on the construction paper. Ralph, are you eating your paste? No, Miss Hoover. Good. Now, sprinkle your sparkles on your paste. Lisa, you're not sprinkling your sparkles. Shove it. I have never seen a good student take such a slide. Lisa, what are you rebelling against? Whattaya got? And she goes, ""Lisa told Hoover to shove it"" and I'm like, ""No way!"" And she's like, ""Fraid so,"" and I'm all, ""Whooah!"", and she's like... Hey, Lisa, man. I'm like, so impressed. When I was in second grade, I was all ""Hi, there, I'm so good."" Want a smoke? Uh, I'll smoke it in class. Whoa. Bart, you're doing a bang-up job. You know, before there were some corridors of this school you'd just never go down. Now I feel safe anywhere. Every day is a new fight, sir. Bart, the school is a police state. Students are afraid to sneeze. And I have you to thank. Come with me. Madre de Dios! The legends were true! Yes Bart, whenever a teacher confiscates something it ends up here. Salacious halter-tops, complete collections of Mad, Cracked and the occasional issue of Crazy, and this fake plastic derriere. Now, to show my gratitude, I want you to help yourself to an item of your choice. All-riight! Ooo, now, you be careful with that crossbow. I will. Seymour, this is an absent slip signed by Nelson's mother. And this is Nelson's English homework. Notice the identical elongated loops on the d's. Forgery. So he didn't have leprosy. This is a great day for me. I thought I could never teach again. Oh, Things have changed. There will be no mockery of your name, Mr. Glasscock. Hey Lewis, watch this. Ow! Bart, do something. Let's go, Milhouse. Sure, we have order. But at what price! Now let's correct our homework exercises. Lisa, what nineteenth century figure was nicknamed ""Old Hickory""? I don't know. You? Lisa, if you'd bothered to do the assignment you'd know the answer is... The Battle of New Orleans. I mean, Andrew Jackson. Well, you're earning your eighteen grand a year. Stupid Hoover... thinks she's so smart. She wouldn't be so smart without her Teacher's edition. Ladies and gentlemen, the unthinkable has happened. Some sick, twisted individual has stolen every teacher's edition in this school. What'll we do? Declare a snowday! Does anyone know the multiplication table? Please, please, don't panic! They can smell fear. Children, I know this is highly irregular, but for the rest of the uh, day Martin will be teaching this class. I will? But I wouldn't know where to begin. Just do it, Brainiac. Have I ever told you kids about the sixties? I've... got... to get... out... of... here! Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean. I'm leaving the profession again. Oh now Mr. Glasscock, please reconsider. Hunh-uh. Bart, the police haven't had any luck finding the teachers' editions. The dogs have picked up the scent of books. Send in the battering ram. Here we go! We're going to have to re-order every book. Seymour, I'll bet you a steak dinner those books are still here. All we have to do is search every locker. Oh, Bart, I'm not sure random locker searches are permitted by the Supreme Court... Pfft, Supreme Court. What have they done for us lately? Let's move. Hmm... Bah. Lisa. That's right. It was I. Lis, why did you do it? Come on, Bart. In your pre-Fascist days, you knew the giddy thrill of futile rebellion. Yeah, but even I had my limits. You're looking at expulsion for this. I know. I know. The books! Oh, answers! Answers! Simpson, you've just saved the school one hundred and twenty dollars. Who's behind this monstrous crime? I am. I've been so blind. In retrospect, the signs all pointed to a rogue hall monitor. Sorry if I betrayed your trust, Principal Sucker. D'oh. Now Bart, in light of your recent service to the school, I've decided to be lenient. Four hundred days detention. Four hundred days. I can do that standing on my head. All right, five hundred days. Oooh, big man. Six hundred days. Maybe I'll just shut my big mouth. Let's go, Simpson. Bart, why'd you take the blame? 'Cause I didn't want you to wreck your life. You got the brains and the talent to go as far as you want. And when you do, I'll be right there to borrow money. Oh, Bart.
