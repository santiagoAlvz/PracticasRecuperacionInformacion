I'll take fifteen lemonades. Make that sixteen. Lousy dog. If you had your way, I'd walk you every day. Lemonade! Six cups, please. And put it on my tab. Keep moving, deadbeat -- cash only. Fine, lemonade's for babies anyway! I'm going to Moe's, for beer! Have fun drinking your lemonade, babies! Lisa, can Daddy borrow your bike? I guess. Hey Moe, gimme a-- Homer, shush! We're watching Krabappel try to break up with Skinner. Seymour, I have something difficult I want to say to you. I understand. It can be very difficult for a woman to propose marriage. But I am willing to go halvsies on a ring. Seymour... Excuse me. Any of you lugs wanna break up with my boyfriend for me? I'll buy you a beer! Seymour... Edna asked me to talk to you. Splendid! Shall we discuss music, or the weather? No, this is about you. Edna wants to break up. She wants to break up? Yeah. With me? Yeah. Look at it this way: you're a free man... unlike me. You have all your hair... unlike me. No kids tying you down, or a crippling mortgage that you refinanced at twenty-six percent because a dancing internet cowboy told you to... Oh, God, I hate my life! Gee. Compared to you, my life is one big half-day! Exactly. You're good looking, have a decent job... what lonely widow wouldn't consider you an option? Thanks, Homer. I don't think the school pep squad could've cheered me up more. And they were state runners up in nineteen ninety-seven! Homer, that was amazing -- he actually felt better comin' outta the break-up than he did goin' in. Say Homer, you're real good at this. Think you could dump my girlfriend Doreen for me? Doreen? She's cheated on you with everyone -- well, except for me. And I've showered her with gifts! Fancy soaps and massage oils and uh... what have ya... Ooh, here she comes -- work your magic, Homer! Is Lenny here? Oh, I'm afraid Lenny's dead. What? I just talked to him. And you will again. Because he isn't really dead. And now this next piece of news won't seem so bad... Lemonade! We want lemonade! Don't worry, folks. Our master chef is stirring up a fresh batch. Stop that transaction! I'm a part-time field agent with the Springfield Department of Commerce! Great gig. It is a great gig. May I see your vendor's license? Um... I think it's... we don't have one. Thirty-five cents? Where did that come from? Can't be mine -- must be yours. I don't care if it's forty-five cents. I don't want it! Submit this form to the License Bureau. Until then, this stand is closed! Boys? Geez, I'm thirsty. Y'got any lemonade? Not anymore! Come on, come on! I was halfway through an operation when my license expired! I'll get to ya... just as soon as I finish this crossword puzzle. / C'mon! Let's go, buddy. I left bananas in my car! Let's see, uh... ten across: ""Franklin Roosevelt's middle name""? ""EXCITEMENT."" Uh, wait, that don't fit... Maybe you could use some help. : FDR's middle name... ""DELANO."" ""Oxidized surface""... Well that's ""RUSTY."" ""Bartenders serve them 'dirty'""... Ham sandwiches! No, ""MARTINIS"". Oh right. One more word! ""Singer of Yentl"", thirteen letters... um... I've got it! ""ISAAC BASHEVIS!"" Now gimme my license! Give everyone their license! What is a four-letter word for ""hero?"" Hero. Yes, but I meant ""Lisa!"" Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Y'ello! Homer? It's your old roommate, Grady. The gay guy? That's not all I am! Well, it's a lot of what I am. Anyhoo, I heard how good you are at breaking up couples. I need your help to break up with Julio, 'cause I met someone new... Someone much more cool and refreshing. Uh-huh, got it. Marge, I'm going to a hardcore gay club, and I won't be home till three in the morning! Have fun! Ay Carumba! Bart, I've fallen in love with crosswords! It finally happened -- you've gone completely fruit loops. ""FRUIT LOOPS?"" That's the answer to thirty-eight down: ""toucan's delight!"" No, I mean you're loco in the coco! ""COCOA!"" ""Ice rink drink!"" You're losin' it! ""LOSIN' IT!"" ""Risqu√© '80s teen flick!"" Fine, go nuts -- see if I care! ""EYE CARE!"" ""Optician's concern."" Oh, thanks for your help, Bart! ""BART?"" ""San Francisco people mover!"" Speaking of San Francisco people mover: Grady is breaking up with me?! You'll always have a special place in his heart! In his what? Awww. Oh, baby, you are the breakup king. You have made the seven minutes that I'm gonna go without love so much more bearable. Anyone else want me to get rid of that special someone? Okay, everyone. Rotate one to your right. Guess what, Mom? I'm a cruciverbalist! Another religion? You know, you're just gonna drop the whole thing when you go to college and get a Jewish boyfriend. Probably, but a cruciverbalist is a fan of crossword puzzles -- which I am! Me too! I been doin' 'em since Nineteen fifty-eight -- back then we called 'em ""Alphabet Hotels"", 'cause every letter gets its own little room. I still do the Springfield Shopper puzzle every day! Grampa, everyone knows that the only real test of skill is the New York Times puzzle, edited by Will Shortz! ""Will"" and ""Shorts"". Two things I'm no longer allowed to change by myself. Okay, back to the real world. Isn't it beautiful? Sure is. Who's driving the bus? What bus? Sweet Conclusions Break-Up Service. Oh yes, we dispose of your loved one humanely - thanks to our patented TenderDump System. I'll be there in thirty minutes... or your breakup is freeee! Simp-son! What in the blue blazes are you doing to my hopscotching grids? I... I made them into a crossword. Well, I'm a bit of a puzzlehead myself -- they uh, help me wind down after a day of dealing with SKIN-NER! You called? Made reference. My mistake. Lisa, I think you might be ready for this. ""Bald Man's Basketball League""? Sorry, wrong flier. I meant this! Citywide crossword tournament! Ooh, thank you! You're welcome. Now uh, I have to go home and make sure my pool boy is using his skim-mer! You called? You misheard. My mistake. Marge, if I had a hundred dollars for every customer I'd broken up, I'd have exactly this amount. 'Cause that's what I charge! Homie... I'm not sure about this new business of yours. You're making it too easy for couples to break up just because they hit a rough patch. I know this is hard on you, but in time you'll come to see it's for the best. That's one of your breakup lines! What would have happened if there was someone who could break us up every time I had my doubts about you? Who are you? We are the spirits of the relationships you killed! We're the babies those couples would have had! And we're the antiques those couples would have bought together! Get him, chairs and babies! Homie? Marge, I'm getting' out of the break-up business and I don't know if I'll ever sleep soundly again. Well maybe... Wow, so this is what this is. Cruciverbalists from far and wide have gathered here for a no-holds-barred test of skill. Surely some holds are barred. No, none. Well, it sounds really exciting and you're a delightful young lady. Now if you'll excuse me... Hey, what's going on? It's kind of a secret, so shut the door most of the way. We found a way to make this tournament interesting. We bet on the matches. Really? Well, I did bring this envelope full of money. And these days, betting in a bar is safer than any stock, bond or real estate investment. Agreed. So, who are you gonna bet on? I want you to put it all on my little girl. And parlay with the Asian kid. He has a name, you know! What is it? I don't know. He's not my kid. I win! She won! And like any prudent gambler, I know when to walk away: never! Okay, everybody, take a break. Dad, I could actually win this thing! And when you win, I win. I'll explain that to you on your deathbed. My only fear is, I always sabotage myself when I'm on the verge of happiness. You what? In my young life I've seen that every time I'm about to achieve true happiness, some little piece of me says ""you don't deserve this."" And another little piece says ""I agree."" Right, right. But will it happen this time? With my luck, I bet it will. It's practically a sure thing. Contestants to your boards. Wish me luck. Just be yourself. I wanna change my bet... I'm going against my daughter. I'll take your money. But I won't look you in the eye. Fine. I won't look you in the eye. Have I made the bet yet? I got it. We're down to our final two contestants. But before they compete, we would like to pay tribute to all the words that have been removed from the dictionary in the past year. You know, my wife Shirley, she's the real crossword ace in our family. Fills in those letters fast as hail on a tin roof: ping-ping-ping, she's done. Shirley passed away two years ago. But I'm still not over it. Oh, that's so sad! Hey, what can you do? Life keeps changing the music, but you gotta keep up the cha-cha-cha, huh? Let's see, I'll spread some Q's around. That'll get my brain goin'. Aw, I dropped my glasses! Shirley, baby, I let you down. Hey, there are no lenses in these glasses... Let's see, that's ""ENRICO FERMI"", and there you've got the ""PET SHOP BOYS"", and cross the T and zing the Z and skit skat skoodily I'm all the way home. Lisa got hustled! I blew it again. She blew it again! Woo-hoo! Here's your money. Drenched in your daughter's tears. You know, for a bartender-bookie you're awfully judgmental. Boy, Dad seems awfully happy. And there's something different about him. He bought new shoelaces. With fancy metal tips! Dad? Did you come into some money we don't know about? No. You got highlights in your hair! Uh... the sun did that. And your car antenna has been straightened and re-balled. What's goin' on? Well, sweetie, Daddy made a little extra money betting against you in the crossword tournament. You'll understand when you're a parent placing large wagers against your own children. I hope you're not mad. No, I'm not mad. You sure you're not mad? No, I'm not mad. You sure you're not mad? No, I'm not mad. Mr. Teddy, can you ask Lisa if she's mad? What's that, Mr. Teddy? You're saying that you know women? And that when women say they're not mad, they're madder than ever? She's gone. Can you drive me home? I'm a little drunk. Lisa? Lisa? Lisa, sweetie... please, look at your Daddy. You stopped being my Daddy as soon as you bet against me! All I have now is a mom, which is why I'm taking her maiden name! From now on, I'm... Lisa Bouvier! Hey, Mr. S... Lisa B... Nooooooooooooooooo! Would you like to buy some band candy? Yessssssssssssssss! Lisa's mad at me, and now she's using Marge's maiden name instead of mine. Homer, whatever you done to that little girl, you just gotta do something even nicer to win her back. She may never take back your name, but there's still a chance she'll take you back as a Daddy. Wow... nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks. So the name ""Lisa Simpson"" is available, huh? Lotta goodwill attached to that name... I'm gonna take it. Lisa's Tavern, Lisa speaking. Lisa, sweetie, I'm honored that you choose my name, but it's not that great. Back in high school, the boys used to call me Marge ""BOOB""-ier. Hey, Bouvier was Jackie Kennedy's maiden name. Really? I never knew that. Well what did you think her name was before it was Kennedy? Jackie ""O."" Like Spaghetti-o's. I thought that was where her money came from. Look, why don't you cheer up by doing a New York Times crossword puzzle, huh? I'm through with crosswords! My innocence died in those four hundred and forty-one little boxes. It might be a fun way to kill a couple hours. A couple hours? I can do the Sunday puzzle in less than one hour! A couple of hours... ""Last clue: ""Loses on purpose"". Hmmm... ""DIETS!"" Oh, Will Shortz, you clever rascal. And a new record time! Wait a second... ""DUMB DAD SORRY FOR HIS BET."" Wow, it's almost as if Dad planted that message. No, it must just be a weird coincidence...but what if it's not? Oh, it must be...or mustn't it not? Dad, I know this is crazy, but did you plant a message to me in the New York Times crossword puzzle? Well, I had a little help from this guy. New York Times Crossword Editor Will Shortz! And master puzzle constructor Merl Reagle?! I actually wrote that crossword. And I edited it. Now get back to cross-wording! Yes sir. Well I must admit, I'm kind of touched. ""DUMB DAD SORRY FOR HIS BET."" Nice. You didn't get Homer's whole message, Lisa. I didn't?! Take a look at the first letters of all the clues. Dear Lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. Sorry, he told me I needed a hundred and forty-four letters. What was my point again? Oh right. Bouvier or Simpson, I cherish you.
