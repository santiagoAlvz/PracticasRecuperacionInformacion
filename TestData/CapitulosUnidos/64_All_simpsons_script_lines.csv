63,64,"Thanks, Grampa. Where'd you get all the money? The government. I didn't earn it. I don't need it. But if they miss one payment, I'll raise hell. Hey Homer - where's your present? I mean don't worry, son. I forgot to get you a present. But I swear on my father's grave... Hey! I will get you one now! Do you sell toys? We sell forbidden objects from places men fear to tread. We also sell frozen yogurt... which I call frogurt! Well, I need something for my son's birthday. Perhaps this will please the gentleman. Take this object. But beware, it carries a terrible curse. Ooh, that's bad. But it comes with a free frogurt. That's good. The frogurt is also cursed. That's bad. But you get your choice of topping. That's good. The toppings contain potassium benzoate. That's bad. Can I go now? Happy birthday, son! Great Caesar's Ghost! A talking Krusty doll! I'm Krusty the Clown and I love you very much. Oh, Dad, this is the best birthday I've ever had. That doll is evil, I tells ya. Evil! EEEVIL! Grampa, you said that about all the presents. I just want attention. ...And in environmental news, scientist have announced that Springfield's air is now only dangerous to children and the elderly. Woo hoo! I'm Krusty the Clown and I don't like you. I'm Krusty the Clown and I'm going to kill you! Didn't even pull the string that time. I said I'm going to kill you. You, Homer Simpson. Oh yeah? With what? Homer, what's wrong? That doll tried to kill me! I'd say that the pressure's finally gotten to Dad, but what pressure? Don't leave me alone with him. MY BALONEY HAS A FIRST NAME / IS H-O-M-E-R / MY BALONEY HAS A SECOND NAME / IT'S H-O-M-E-R. There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality. Hey, baby. Get comfortable. Relax. It's a little hot for that cheerleader outfit, don't you think? You think your dirty socks can stop me? Well... they are making me dizzy... Goodbye, Dolly. Arrivederci, Vito. I was a fool to think anyone would want nude pictures of Whoopi Goldberg. What the?... And that is that. Guess who, Fat Boy? Marge, Marge, look! Oh my God. The doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's been laughing at me! Ew. Dog water. Your doll is trying to kill my husband!... Yes, I'll hold. EVERYBODY LOVES A CLOWN / SO WHY DON'T YOU? Yep. Here's your problem. Someone set this thing to ""EVIL"". I love you, Homer. Come here you. Here ya' go buddy. Did you walk the dog? Yeah, he buried me a couple a times. Yeah, dogs like to bury old junk. Yeah, you stupid idiot. Oh, what a day. Homer made me give him a sponge bath. But coming home to you makes it all worth while. Here, let me get that for ya. ... So then, his wife comes through the door!!! So? Did I mention she was dead? No. Well, she was. And she hit him in the head with a golf club! And? Don't you remember? He went golfing all the time and it really bugged her. You said he went bowling! Homer, I've coughed up scarier stuff than that. Grampa, why don't you tell us a story? You've led an interesting life. That's a lie and you know it. But I have seen a lot of movies... My name is Marge Bouvier. I'm here about your ad. Single white female wanted for mysterious expedition. Must like monkeys. Non-smoker preferred. Well, you'd be a welcome change of pace from the rest of these crude and uncouth sailors. Arrr! Arrr! Arrr! Arrr! Arrr! Arrr! What do you think Smithers? I think women and seamen don't mix. We know what you think. Young lady, you're hired. Hey, I heard we're going to Ape Island. Yeah, to capture a giant ape. I wish we were going to Candy Apple Island. Candy Apple Island, what have they got there? Apes. But they're not so big. Hey, who's this Homer Dude? He's either a fifty foot prehistoric ape, or a tourist trap concocted by the ape island jaycees. Either way, we're going ashore. Am I going too? Of course. We wouldn't think of going without the bait... uh, that is, the bait-thing beauty -- The bathing beauty. I covered that up pretty well. HOMER... HOMER... HOMER... HOMER... HOMER... Just try to remain inconspicuous. HOMER... HOMER... HOMER... HOMER... Mose tatupu! Mose tatupu! What's he saying? Uh, he's saying, ""We wouldn't dream of sacrificing the blue-haired woman!"" Oh, well, isn't that... Whoa! Smithers, this is a golden opportunity. If we get him alive we can put him on Broadway. Dead, we'll sell monkey stew to the Army! Ooo. You keep your hands to yourself, mister. Now, we don't want to kill him, shoot him around the groin and belly. Hey Homer, cut it out. Come on, quit eatin' me. Ow! Nice shot, Carl. All right, you big ape, get a snootful of this gas bomb. I WAS STROLLING THROUGH THE GAS ONE DAY... Nice work, Smithers. When we get back, I'm giving you a raise. Oh well. What kinda show you got for us, Mr. Burns? Well, the ape's going to stand around for three hours or so. Then we'll close with the ethnic comedy of Douggan an Dershowitz. Sensational! Ladies and gentlemen, in his native land he was a king. But he comes before you in chains, for your own amusement. Presenting Homer, the Eighth Wonder of the World! Wow! Look at the size of that platform! I think you're making him angry. Come on, what's he gonna do, run amok in downtown Springfield? Hey monkey, want a peanut? I said one! ON THE GOOD SHIP, LOLLIPOP / IT'S A SWEET TRIP TO A CANDY SHOP...WHERE BON-BONS... I am dreading the reviews, I can tell you that. Oh hi, Homie. He's sure taking his sweet time. Better refuel. You know, you look a little flushed. Maybe you should eat more vegetables and less people. He's not dead. No, but his career is. I remember when Al Jolson ran amok at the Winter Garden and climbed the Chrysler Building. After that, he couldn't get arrested in this town. Don't worry, Homie. I'll take care of you. Are you with the bride or groom? Right this way. Folks, if you could just stop cleaning each other for a second... Wait! Wait! Marge, I can't find your father. Oh, Homer. Now kids, instead of candy, I thought I'd serve an array of healthy fresh fruits. Fruit is nature's candy! Whoa! Hi fellow Halloweenies! Did I scaredly-dare ya? Garsh darn it. Nice try, Mr. Flanders, but I've got a story so scary you'll wet your pants. Too late. From A-Apple to Z-Zebra, ""Baby's First Pop-Up Book"" is twenty-six pages of alphabetic adventure. Bart, you mean to tell me you read a book intended for preschoolers? Well, most of it. You have to read another book. Find Waldo Yet Again. Man, he's just not tryin' anymore. Gee, never noticed that before! Whoa! Ow! What's this? Evil... Evil... Bad... Beware... Beware... Cool. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Chapter eight, ""Let's Talk Zombies..."" If a zombie bites you, you become a zombie. You must walk the earth feeding on the brains of the living until the spell is broken. Bart, please. Don't you remember that Snowball I died four years ago tonight? Run over by the Mayor's beer swilling brother, Clovis. Hey, maybe there's a spell in here that'll bring her back from the dead. Let's see what we've got... ""How to Get Your Skeletons Their Whitest""... ""Selling Your Soul in a Buyer's Market""... Ah, here we are, ""How to Raise The Dead."" Cullen, Rayburn, Narz, Trebek! Zabar, Kresge, Caldor, Walmart! It's not working. Bart! You cast the wrong spell! Zombies! Please Lis, they prefer to be called the Living Impaired. There. Pretty as a picture. Ach! Zombies. There. Pretty as a picture. Well, howdy strangers! What can I do ya for? Brains... Brains... Why, Sue Dokes, you rascal! I thought you were dead and-- Dad, we did something very bad. Did you wreck the car? No. Did you raise the dead? Yes. But the car is okay? Uh huh. All right then. Martin Prince, report to my office at once! And bring that big, juicy, Chess Club brain of yours along with you! Hey kids, look what you can win in the Krusty Sweepstakes! To enter, send me your parents' brains, or write ""PARENTS' BRAINS"" on a 3-by-5 card, and send it to... Homer, did you barricade the door? Why? Oh, the zombies. No. Spare my family. Take me. Take me! Brains! Brains! I thought dabbling in the black arts would be good for a chuckle. How wrong I was. I should have never read that book. Wait Bart! Maybe the library has another book that'll reverse the spell. It's our only hope. To the book depository! Hey Simpson, I'm feeling a mite peckish. Mind if I chew your ear? Dad, you killed the zombie Flanders! He was a zombie? KZMB! All zombie radio. The zombies have the earthlings on the run. Soon, the human race will wither and fall, like the earth plums we have seen on the observascope. Ow... careful... not the face. Barney! Not you, too! I'm not a zombie. But hey, when in Rome... Wow, George Washington. Take that Washington! Eat lead, Einstein! Show's over, Shakespeare! Is this the end of zombie Shakespeare? Hurry, Bart! Kolchak, Mannix, Banacek, Danno! What's wrong? Uh, I never realized what a beautiful young woman you've become. Ah. Trojan, Ramses, Magnum, Sheik! See ya in hell. / Still pushin' that boulder? / Uh-huh. Excuse me. I'm John Smith. John Smith, 1882? My mistake. The uh zombies that plagued our town are now just corpses rotting in our streets. Yay! Well, I'm sure glad we didn't turn into mindless zombies. Shh! TV! Man... fall down.
