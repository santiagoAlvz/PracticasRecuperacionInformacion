230,234,"Tonight on ""Guinness Book of World Records..."" ...a man who holds the current record for Least Amount Of Faces, with none! Help me! You'll also see... The World's Smelliest Tumor! Ew! These records used to be real accomplishments. Now they're just gross. Plus, you'll meet a dog who can't predict anything! Then, three other things! When we come back, we'll show you the contents of a supermodel's stomach! What an age we live in. Oh, look at all that Sweet N' Low. Hey, remember the fifties? Remember television, Coca-Cola, and Dick Clark? I remember television! Come join me, Wolfguy Jack, at Greaser's Cafe! Where it's 1955 every day of the year, baby! Actual year may vary, consult calendar for current year. A fifties-style restaurant. What a neat idea! Why don't we eat there tonight?! Nah. We'll go next month. Dennis the Menace? Yes. I was America's bad boy. I once hid my Dad's hat. Uh-huh. And another time I accidentally stepped in Mr. Wilson's flowerbed. That was a two-part episode. I have to go. California, here we come! It's not a real car, Grampa. ""Allen Ginsburgers, Un-American Cheese Sandwich, Polio Dogs..."" It's clever how the names remind you of the fifties and at the same time tell you what there is to eat. Wow, look at this old-timey gizmo! I feel like I've gone back in a time machine. Dad, they have those everywhere. What an age we live in. Oh, man. Oh, my throat doctor says I'm not supposed to do that anymore. Okay, is everybody ready for our nightly Dance Contest? Dancing! Oh, no. You're not gettin' me on that dance floor. Don't try and make me. If I have to get a divorce I will. Our grand prize tonight is a vintage 1955 Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Oh! I need a dance partner! What about you? Okay, Daddy-o. Hey, hey! Set your socks on ""hop"" and your tutti to ""frutti"". Here we go with ""Mental House Rock"" by Johnny Bobby. DOCTORS THREW A PARTY AT THE LOONEY BIN / YOU GOTTA BE CRAZY IF YOU WANNA GET IN / NAPOLEON IS PLAYIN' HIS IMAGINARY SAX / THE DANCE FLOOR'S FILLIN' UP WITH MANIACS / LET'S ROCK / DO THE MENTAL HOUSE ROCK / LET'S ROCK / DO THE MENTAL HOUSE ROCK / IF YOU WON'T DANCE WITH THE DOC / HE'LL GIVE YOU ELECTROSHOCK / IF YOU WON'T DANCE WITH THE DOC / HE'LL GIVE YOU ELECTROSHOCK / ZAP ZAP ZAP Wooo! Wow, a fifties nostalgia cafe! Well, well, well, I've never seen such reckless disregard for a wife's well-being in my life. You've just won yourselves a motorcycle! Woo-hoo! It's mine. Finally, I've won the respect of my fellow... Get away from it! Okay hepcats, let's twirl some more platters at Greaser's Cafe, where the fifties are never goin' away! Well, that dream is over. At least we still have each other, right honey? Honey? God. Man, you're bending the hell out of that kick-stand, Dad. Why don't you just take it for a ride? Promise you won't laugh? Yeah, I promise. I don't know how. You're kidding? You don't know how. Will you teach me? Of course. ""YOU SHOWED ME EVERYTHING, YOU TOOK ME BY THE HAND... / PUPPY DOGS AND LINCOLN LOGS AND CASTLES MADE OF SAND / YOU GAVE ME THE COURAGE TO SPREAD MY NEWBORN WINGS / SPREAD MAYONNAISE AND MARMALADE AND OTHER SPREADABLE THINGS / SO I GUESS YOU ARE MY HERO / AND THERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW / I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR SO... / I'M GONNA SING IT SLOW / IF YOU WEREN'T A MAN AND MY FATHER TOO / I'D BUY A DIAMOND RING AND THEN I'D MARRY YOU."" All right, class. Today we'll be sitting quietly in the dark, because teacher has a hangover. Oh, it's like a chainsaw in my head... Later, Homer. Sweet hog, Mr. Simpson. Remember to rebel against authority, kids. Don't listen to him, children. But we already did. Now I can't get it out of my head. Thank you, Nelson. The sermon today is on... John 4:13. I think it was Jesus who said that... blessed are those who... Oh, the heck with it. Church dismissed! Will you turn that engine off? Quiet, Marge. The motorcycle and I are trying to sleep. I know, I know. Just tune her out. And now back to your Tuesday Morning Movie. Oh, I don't know what's come over Jimmy. He won't do his homework, he only salutes the flag with one finger, and he comes home every night with other people's blood on his shirt. He's a rebel, I tell ya. A rebel without a cause. Just like that boy in that popular movie we saw. Look what you've done! You've ruined the display! Yeah, that's the life for me, Marge. Cruisin' and hasslin' shopkeepers. When will you teens learn to be uncool like everyone else? Never, pops. That's right, never! Yeah, you can arrest me, but you'll never defeat the Cobras. Nothing can defeat a motorcycle gang. A gang! That's the answer. Answer to what? Hey, don't make me hassle you, Lisa. You know, if you want to be in the gang, eventually you're gonna have to get motorcycles. Yeah, we know. Hey, Homer! Can I join? This gang's for rebels, Flanders, not conformos. Yeah! Yeah, that's right! Buzz off! Well, if I were a member, we could use my rumpus room as our lair. That guy just don't get it, do he? My rumpus room with the new bumper pool table. / Bumper pool?! / You kiddin' me? You got bumper pool? / I'm there! The first meeting of ""Hell's Satans"" is called to order. I move we reconsider our club name. Make it something a little less blasphemous. After all we don't want to go to Hell. How 'bout the Devil's Pals? N-No... you see... Or the Christ Punchers. The Chri... I-I-I don't think you understand my objection... I'm the president and the decision is mine. We're Hell's Satans. Besides, I've already made our club jackets. Ooh, machine wash warm! Tumble dry, ooh-la-la! Wait up, guys! I gotta empty my grass bag. Hell's Satans, huh? I'm watchin' you punks. Can't hassle us, pig. We're goin' the speed limit. Oink, oink, oink. Yeah! Yeah! Oink, oink, oink! You'll make a mistake some day. And then you're going straight to juvie. You can lock us away, but you'll never defeat the Cobras. Cobras? I thought you were the Hell's Satans. Oink! Oink! Oink! How could I be down a thousand bucks? Get away from my store, you young hoodlums. And what if we don't, Pops? He's got a broom! Hey, let's get out of here! Forget the pennies! Go! Go! You promised me no more brooms. I know this is not your way, but we're in America now. They printed my photo of our gang! Carl looks great. Can't take a bad picture of that guy. You took a picture of me when I was asleep? If you'd've been awake you would have said no. You can see the bind I was in. ""Her turn-ons include thievery and liquor. Her turn-offs include underpants, pedestrians, and justice."" What in the world? We're the Hell's Satans, out of Bakersfield. You're the Hell's Satans? What a fun coincidence. My gang's name is also the... Shut up! You stole our club name. According to our bylaws, we gotta stomp you. Take off that jacket, man. Okay. Now eat it. All right. Hey, hey, chew with your mouth closed, please. Sorry. Done. Okay, Meathook, I think he learned his lesson. Oh man. Now you gotta eat that, too. You got anything else with our logo on it? Caps and frisbees, sir. You gotta eat them, too. And some pogs. You keep it. I think it's great you've chosen to ""crash"" here, but do you have to be so messy? Yeah, it's part of being a lowlife. Hello, police? Can you send a SWAT team to 742 Evergreen Ter... Forget it, Simpson. Those pig noises you made really hurt my feelings -- looking like a pig as I do. But you have so much inner beauty. Well, uh, be that as it may, ah, the gang is wanted in eight other states and we have a little saying around here: ""Let Michigan handle it"". Stop that! If you want some food I'll be happy to make you some breakfast. I'd kill for some waffles. He has. Remember the IHOP in Oakland? Hey, this is a lot better than that rancid filth we find in the dumpsters. Thank you, Ramrod. Marge, how did you get my jacket so clean? I've tried everything to get those blood and puke stains out. I've tried hitting 'em. I've tried yelling at 'em... All it takes is the right cleanser and a little elbow grease. Do you have anything that will get this emblem back on my jacket? I tried spitting at it, ya know, but... Just put it on my sewing pile. Okay, I'm doing another load of bandanas! Hey! Hey! That's a leave-in conditioner! You're done. Next! Dad, I'm tired of bathing in the yard. Plus, I think Rod and Todd are watching. No, we're not. Okay, bikers, that's it. Benjamin Franklin once said that house guests are like fish at... huh? They're gone! Woo hoo! ... And those bikers saw that hard look in my eye -- you know that hard look I get sometimes? -- and they ran away like schoolgirls with their tails between their legs. Way to go Dad. Hey, where's the food? And why aren't I at school? Yeah, someone really dropped the ball here. Marge? Marge?! Dad, there's a note on the back of your head. Really? Read it. Hm. ""Thanks for letting us crash in your pad. We had a very nice time."" Oh, that's sweet. P.S. We've taken your old lady. Could you at least tell me what you're planning to do with me? Oh, don't worry. You're completely safe. None of us finds ya sexually attractive. None of you? Really? I could have sworn that Ramrod... Hm. Well, did you see that picture of me in... And you still don't... Sorry. Well, good. I guess. Now don't worry. I am gonna search high and low for your mother. But just in case I don't find her, I want you to contact this agency. ""Korean Love Brides""?! I just don't want to be alone. Excuse me, has anyone seen a woman wearing... That's more like it. I'm looking for... I'll show you. Okay, we kinda got off on the wrong foot there. Long story short, my ""old lady"" was... Oh, goodness. Mmm, some people never learn. All right, Satans, we roll out at dawn. Where are we going? To the Biker's Jamboree in South Dakota. You'll love it. Mickey Rourke's comin', and we're gonna jump him. You know, there's more to life than boozing and roughhousing. Haven't any of you ever had a dream? Yeah, I had a dream. I was in this beautiful garden, pounding the crap out of a shopkeeper then... No, no, I mean the dream of a good job, a loving family, and a home in the suburbs. Oh man, to get all that, you'd have to kill like fifty people. No, you don't have to kill anyone. Not if you have jobs. And the first step is an eye-catching resumé. I believe it's pronounced resumé. Actually, both are acceptable. Yeah, I did see some bikers ride by here with a blue-haired woman, 'bout ten minutes ago. Said they were gonna spend the night at Crystal Lake Campground, Section K, Space 217. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. I guess I'll never find her. And when you get a job interview, try not to call your employer a ""punk"" or a ""skank."" Makes sense. / Oh, don't call them skanks. Uh, Mrs. Simpson? I killed my pencil. Broke! You broke your pencil. I ""broke"" him. That's right. And what else have we learned? Ooo, ooo. That, uh, violence is wrong. Excellent, Ramrod. Civilized people solve their disputes with words. Homer, stop! No, you don't understand! Marge! What do we do here, Marge? He's using violence. Talk to him. Use your words. Homer, Homer, stop it! We've given up our violent ways. We just want to live peacefully, with your wife. No! My wife is not a doobie, to be passed around. I took a sacred vow on my wedding day, to bogart her forever. Oh, Homie. There's only one reasonable way to settle this -- you and me, in the Circle of Death. Ohh, I just swept the Circle of Death! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Uh-oh. We both knew it would come to this. You and me, chopper to chopper. You know what I'm gonna do after I kill you? Take your wallet. Never! It was a gift from Newsweek! Homer! Give me back my wife! Okay, okay! You win. I don't blame you for wanting her back so bad. A woman like that only comes along every couple of miles. Hey, can we at least keep her till the orgy in San Berdoo? Whaddaya say, honey? No! No dice! Goodbye everybody! Bye, Mrs. Simpson. / Bye, Mrs. Simpson. / Bye Mrs. Simpson / Bye bye Mrs. S. We'll stop at the nearest town and mail our resumés. ""Resumés."" It still sounds weird to me. Why are we stopping here? Taking care of some unfinished business. Hey! Go! Go!
