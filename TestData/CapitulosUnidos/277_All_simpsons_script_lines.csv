273,277,"A library selling books? If I don't want 'em for free, why would I want to pay for 'em? Why do you always wait 'til we arrive to complain? I don't know. Ah, the full Leonard Nimoy cycle. ""I Am Not Spock"", then ""I Am Spock"", and finally ""I Am Also Scotty"". Good heavens. Lisa, you're not buying more than your weight in books. But I have to save them! The books no one buys get chopped up and fed to pigs. Helen Fielding's giving them pigs Bridget Jones' diarrhea. Well, what about this? ""The Duff Book Of World Records."" It's got pictures of deformities. Okay. Oh my God! Wow. Now that's a goiter. Why would Duff Beer put out a book? It was originally published to settle arguments in taverns. She said ""tavern"". I'm going to Moe's! I never agreed to that rule! Well, I say the most clothespins a man could attach to his face is eighty-seven. You counting the neck? You know I am. All right. Outside. Peace, my people. All shall be looked up. Let's see, most clothespins: swallowed, inserted... here we go, clipped to face and neck. One hundred and sixteen. Geez, I was wrong, but I ain't angry. And I'm magnanimous in victory. Wow, that's the best book I've ever seen! No, the best book you've ever seen is Tom Clancy's ""Op Center."" That thing knows me better than I know myself. Ooh, here's a good one: The World's Most Overrated Saint. Francis of Assisi . I've used up all these records. Why don't you try to set a record, Dad? That's a great idea. Do you think I could run a mile in three and a half minutes? Only on Mars. The Simpsons are goin' to Mars, so pack your... Or maybe I'll think of something else. You're a cinch to be World's Fattest Man. No, I'm here for the greatest living actor. I'm here to break a world record. What's the longest anyone's ever done this? Three years. Fine, I'll just play the banjo with this cobra. Wait, wait, wait... Uh, technically, the cobra would get the record. He's the one playing. But it's my banjo. Mr. Simpson, there are thousands of people like you with no discernible talent. Yeah, they're called ""Congress"". Shut up. Okay. All the individual records were set by crackpots who half-killed themselves. The only way someone new can get in the book is with some kind of group stunt. Group stunt? Like that town that made the world's largest omelet. Denver? No, Spanish. Fellow Springfielders. I have called you all here so we can enter the Duff Book of World Records. / What's he talking about? We're going to build the world's tallest human pyramid! Finally, this town will have a real claim to fame. Aye, we can stop all the lies. I haven't seen this much flesh since Elke Sommers' hot-tub party. Seriously, Elke's great. Always there for sick kids. Doin' great things. Okay. Lemme check the specs. Wow, my vision is coming to life! Mm-hm. All right. I'll make a base camp here and try for the summit tomorrow. Yeah, Dad! You can be the world's laziest stunt organizer! Why you little! No mas! No mas! You're about a foot short of the record. Wait a minute. Ha! Ha! We did it! Springfield rules! Not yet. You have to hold it for three Mississippi's. One Mississippi... Two Mississippi... Dude, you're touching my hand! Ow, my hairstyle! Not again! Goodbye, cruel world. Hello, ironic twist. I am so far from my car. Dude, you're lying on top of me. Dude? Wait a minute, look at the scale! Divide by the number of people... Subtract belts and shoes... Everyone, welcome to the Duff Book Of World Records: Springfield is the World's Fattest Town! Woo-Hoo! In your face Milwaukee! Congratulations, fellow Springfielders! This town will no longer be known as ""America's Sorrow"". Today, I declare Springfield ""Fat City U.S.A.""! I can't believe it. Everyone's celebrating their obesity! Haw haw. Now that everyone's so open about being fat, I can finally stop sucking in my gut. I don't know how this town got so fat. Mom, we're out of ""Frosting Gobs."" Here, have one of my fudge-stuffed toaster pies. Mmm... You kids do eat a lot of sugar. But at least Homer can have a nice, healthy grapefruit. Yeah, you can't improve on nature. Look at all the empty calories. Ooo, sugar free donuts. No, that is sugar with free donuts. Oh. Apu, everything in this store is overloaded with sugar. Marge has a point. Sugar is not only fattening, it's also terribly, terribly addictive. Uh, is my carton of Pixie Stix in? No, it hasn't come in yet. Damn it! When they come in you call me at this number. Nine one one. I am sorry, but everything in this store, from the honey-glazed cauliflower to the Choco-Blasted Baby Aspirin, comes from the Motherloving Sugar Corporation. Well, I'm going to have a talk with them. Where are their worldwide headquarters located? Why, right down the street. That's lucky. Yes, I'm Garth Motherloving. Hey, Marge. I'm not up on the current slang, but do the kids still say ""Get the hell outta my office?"" I want you to stop putting so much sugar in everything, or at least warn people that it's so unhealthy. Hm, that'll boost sales. While we're at it, why don't I just change my name back to Hitler? Don't you have any sense of corporate responsibility? Hey! Look, lady. If you have a problem, bring it up with your sewing circle, okay? But we're on hiatus. Everyone's everywhere. Note to Marge: get out. I'll play it later. If you looked up meanie-beanie-fo-feanie in the dictionary, you'd see his picture. Wait. You went to a sugar factory? Were there Oompa-Loompas? There was one in a cage, but he wasn't moving. That company's ruining the whole town's health, and I don't know how to stop them. Why don't you file a class-action suit? Oh yeah, like Erin Brockovich. The prostitute with a heart of gold. I'm not sure I can afford a fancy lawyer. That's okay, Mom. Today's law schools are churning out two point one lawyers for every person in America. Look. Pick me! / No, pick me! Me so litigious. Ah! Pick me! I just passed the bar, see? Aw, hop in. We want to sue the sugar industry for selling a harmful product. We have to sign up plaintiffs, and take depositions from the townspeople. Aw, geez. You don't want ol' Gil going door-to-door. Oh, I've made too many enemies selling suckless vacuum cleaners and Rick James Bibles. Don't worry. I'll do the legwork. I'm filing a class action lawsuit against Big Sugar. Would you like to give a deposition? Sure I'll join your lawsuit. Sugar's made my Ralphie hyperactive. I'm happy and angry! Oh shoot, I'll sign. Figure them sugar folk owe me fer wut they done ta my cousin, Dia-Betty. I'm tryin' to slim down so I can fit into Momma's coffin. That's my re-ward! Now let's see if I can remember how to make my mark. I'll get down with your lawsuit. Disco Stu got hooked on the white stuff back in the seventies. Oh, hello Homer. Well, well. If it isn't the woman who's too busy saving the world to save her own marriage. What are you talking about? Is that dinner? It was dinner. Why didn't you just turn off the oven? I was hoping we could do that together. Hello? Marge Simpson? Who is this? Professor Frink? Oh, what gave me away? Out of curiosity, was it the hoyvin or the mayvin or the whole go-hoy-vy thing that I do? So Professor, tell us about operation ""hoyvin-mayvin."" Well we knew perfectly well it was addictive. Candy was just a sugar delivery system. We thought we were God. Hoyvin-mayvin. Frink, you little weasel, I'll kill you. May I remind you we're in open court? I'll kill you too. I'll kill you all! Mr. Motherloving, that could be interpreted as a threat. I'll kill you while you sleep. Objection! Mm... I'll allow it. Now, Count Fudge-ula, how long were you spokes-vampire for Motherloving's breakfast cereals? Now all my victims have to be mashed up. Awww... Your Honor, I admit it looks bad for me. But I think you might be turned around by some surprising taste-imony. Sir, this is a house of justice, not a sugar-shack. It's Hershey highwaymen like you who made me fat. Well, your honor, the court carries it well. Silence! I rule in favor of Marge Simpson. Oh, I am so proud of you. And, thanks to Marge's Simpson's damning evidence... I hereby ban all sugar products from Springfield -- forever! Get in the car. Good evening. Our top story: Springfield's cake-hole has been shut, forever. Under what has been dubbed ""Marge's Law,"" all forms of sugar are now illegal. Thank you, Erin Choco-snitch. That was a group effort. I was just trying to make this a healthier place to live. Well, good work, Blue-hair 'n' Brocko-witch. Okay, that was mine. So say a bittersweet farewell to such old friends as: Mud Pies, Bite 'ems, Ã‰clairios, Chew 'ems, Kellogg's All-Fudge, Big Red Snack Foam, Milk Chuds, Eat 'ems... And all sugar pills will be changed back to highly-concentrated opiates. That's it, boys. Burn it all. Even this promotional Johnny Depp from the movie ""Chocolat""? We melted for him. Now he's gonna do likewise. All right, time to throw in the Butterfingers. Hm. It's not even singed. Even the fire doesn't want them. Sugar... need sugar! Aye. They're not riding the white horse anymore! My baby! Where's my baby? Nothing left! Nothing left! Ooh, ooh, a sticky spot! Mr. Simpson, you are licking blood and Vapo-Rub. Part of me knew that. There is a small group committed to bringing sugar back to this town. By any means necessary. I'm with you all the way. But first... Cool. Should I take off my shoes? Cool. Gentlemen, I have found the final member of our cabal. Count Fudge-ula? I thought you wanted to get off the stuff. I'm a monster. Don't look at me! Homer, we need you to help us smuggle in sugar from south of the border. Oh, you mean Tennessee? No. The island of San Glucose. Good times. Is it really worth risking your lives just for some sugar? Dessert's on. I steamed some limes! Godspeed. There is the island! It's go time. I'm only doin' this one more time. How's he doing? I think he's grossed-out by some seaweed. Eww. I touched it. Over. Get a grip, Simpson. You're doing fine. Now, do you have your map? Kinda. Come on! Give it! I know, I'll try reverse psychology. I don't want that stupid map. Okay man, there's the sugar. Now you give us the money. That wasn't part of the deal! He's right. Who wrote this thing? Well, we're almost home. Has everyone keistered their personal supply? 'Cause I sure haven't. Hold it right there. Surrender or prepare to be sunk. No way! We'll defy you to the death! Stroke, stroke, stroke! I'm rowing as fast as I can, sir. No, I'm having one! Remember what I told you about running away from your troubles? Yeah. Let's do it. My baby! I like to think we've made a difference today. Good work, Simpson. Before I bring the sugar in, I want to see the Oompa-Loompa. He's right over there. That guy is freaky. Well, here's your sugar. No, Homer! You'll be condemning this town to a life of obesity and diabetes! Don't listen to her, Homer. Oh, they both make such good arguments. Please, Homie. Dump the sugar. For me. Sugar is pouring into the water! Aye, 'tis a sugary brine. Mmm, this sugar shark is delicious. Hey, he bit me back! So that's how it's gonna be, huh? Gee, everyone looks so happy. Indeed, Marge. And, uh, now that I think of it, I wildly exceeded my authority. And I declare the sugar ban over! Can we, Mom? Can we? Please, please, please? Oh, all right. But take Maggie with you. Mm. I guess you just can't use the law to nag. Maybe I should just stop trying to change the world. No Marge, I love when you do that. You're a regular Carin' A-lot-ovich. That's the best one! That's what I told Lisa! Hey, I found some pearls. Oh wait, they're just my teeth. Well, I can still make a necklace out of them.","Ralph Wiggum, Mayor Joe Quimby, Carl Carlson, Blue-Haired Lawyer, Female Executive, Judge Snyder, ELECTRONICALLY-ALTERED VOICE, Audience, Chief Wiggum, Count Fudge-ula, Eddie, Lou, Hans Moleman, Bumblebee Man, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Kent Brockman, Homer Simpson, Townspeople, Sugar Dealer, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Lawyers, Seymour Skinner, Woman, C.
