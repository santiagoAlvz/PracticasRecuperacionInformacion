137,138,"Hello, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such Fox Network specials as ""Alien Nose-Job"" and ""Five Fabulous Weeks of the Chevy Chase Show."" Tonight we're here to honor America's favorite non-prehistoric cartoon family. You'll see long-lost footage...never-before-seen material from your favorite episodes...old favorites you can't see in syndication... So join me, won't you, for ""The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular!"" ""The Simpsons"" began as the brainchild of cartoonist Matt Groening,...the already-famous creator of such comics as ""Damnation,"" ""Johnny Reb,"" and ""True Murder Stories"". In nineteen eithty-seven, Groening teamed up with award-winning producers James L. Brooks...and Sam Simon. And what better place to premier their creation than on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" -- the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes and musical comedy numbers. On April 19th, 1987, America first met... the Simpsons. Well, goodnight, son. Um, Dad... Yeah. What is the mind? Is it just a system of impulses, or is it something tangible? Relax. What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind. Thanks, Dad. Good night, son. Goodnight, Lisa. Goodnight, Mom. Sweet dreams. Thanks, Mom. Sleep tight. I will, Mom. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Bedbugs? ROCKABYE BABY IN THE TREE TOP / WHEN THE WIND BLOWS / THE CRADLE WILL ROCK / WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS / THE CRADLE WILL FALL / AND DOWN WILL COME BABY, CRADLE AND ALL. Sweet dreams. We may be the best parents in the world. Goodnight, dear. Goodnight. All right, climb in. There's nothing to worry about. Now everyone go to sleep. Good night. They haven't changed a bit, have they? As the weeks went on, so did the cartoons! Fresh chocolate chip cookies. Don't touch those yet. They're very, very hot. Aha! No one's around. The perfect crime. Yeow! Do I smell cookies? Where's the cookies? They're all gone. The whole batch. Somebody ate those cookies. Did you eat the cookies, Maggie. I think she's trying to tell us something. Go on Maggie. Go on, Maggie. Go. Go. There's no perfect crime. I've got a great idea. Let's play Space Patrol. I'll be Lisui... the devil-may-care rocket pilot. Maggie can be Maggina, her spunky sidekick. ...and you'll be Bartron, the evil robot from Mars, gone berserk. Do I understand you correctly, Bartron? Do you wish me to release you from the helmet of evil thoughts with my enchanted space wand? I will do it, Bartron. Who knows what mysterious forces will be unleashed? Oh no. Inside, the evil Bartron is a horrible mutant boy. We'll be safe here till Mom and Dad, the evil overlords gets home. As wacky as those kids were, they were no match for Captain Wacky -- later renamed ""Homer."" Wake up everybody! It's World War Three! Quick, down to the fallout shelter! The bombs are dropping! Eighteen seconds, hmph. If this were really a nuclear war, we'd all be dead meat by now. Say, you're all shivering. Are you cold or what? Bart! Bart! Time for your Sunday night bath, boy! Gotta hide. Bart! Where are ya, boy. Oops. Aha! There you go. Now that's not so bad, is it? Ahhhh. Welcome to ze exotic world of undersea explorer Bart Simpson. Come with Bart as he dive into the briny deep, searching for the wily and elusive wash cloth. Suddenly, without warning, the great Bart get more than he bargain for. Help! Help! Clean as a whistle, Homer! Maybe the drawings were a little crude, but all the characters were there: Itchy & Scratchy...Grampa Simpson...and Krusty the Klown! When we return: more classic moments and, for the first time on TV, our private reel of Simpsons outtakes -- including the alternate endings to ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"" In the opening credits, what does the cash register say when Maggie is scanned? It says... ""N.R.A. Forever!"" Just one of the hundreds of radical right-wing messages inserted into every show by creator Matt Groening. Over the six years ""The Simpsons"" has been on the air, we've received dozens of letters from fans wanting to know more about the show. Tonight we'll answer some of your questions. Professor Lawrence Pierce of the University of Chicago writes, ""I think Homer gets stupider every year."" That's not a question, Professor. But we'll let the viewers judge for themselves. Hello. My name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me. Okay, Mr. Burns. Uh, what's your first name? I don't know. Well Homer maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy. Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane! Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic. Well, duh. Yabba dabba doo! SIMPSON, HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S THE GREATEST GUY IN HISTORY / FROM THE TOWN OF SPRINGFIELD / HE'S ABOUT TO HIT A CHESTNUT TREE Hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard. Homer, no! They'll clog the instruments! Careful, they're ruffled! I'll take care of this. Ants! SUBTITLE: PROTECT THE QUEEN! SUBTITLE: WHICH ONE'S THE QUEEN? SUBTITLE: I'M THE QUEEN. SUBTITLE: NO YOU'RE NOT. ...""No TV and No Beer Make Homer..."" something, something. Go crazy? Don't mind if I do. Doctor Linus Irvin of the Sloan-Kettering Memorial Institute writes, ""How does Matt Groening find the time to write and draw an entire 'Simpsons' episode every week?"" For the answer to this, we went straight to the source. Get outta my office!! Of course, what Matt meant to say -- according to his attorneys -- is that he couldn't possibly do it alone. And he insisted that we make time to acknowledge the hard work of everyone who makes ""The Simpsons"" possible. Ambassador Henry Mwabwetumba of the Ivory Coast writes, ""What is the real deal with Mr. Burns' assistant, Smithers? You know what I'm talking about."" Of course we do. ...the preparations for your birthday have begun. I won't get what I really want No one does. Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers. People like dogs, Mr. Burns. Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say? Uh... if you did it, sir?...I'll - uh -print you out a copy. Thanks. Hello, Smithers. You're quite good at turning me on. Um, you probably should ignore that. I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers. You know that dream where you're in bed and they fly in through the window? As you can see, the ""real deal"" with Waylon Smithers is that he's Mr. Burns' assistant. He's in his early 40's, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield. Thanks for writing! We'll be right back. Which popular ""Simpsons"" characters have died in the past year? If you said Bleeding Gums Murphy and Dr. Marvin Monroe, you are wrong. They were never popular. Right about now you're probably saying ""Troy, I've seen every SimpsonS episode. You can't show me anything new"". You've got some attitude, mister. Besides, you're wrong! Because sometimes episodes run long and certain scenes never get aired. So fire up your VCR, because here for the first time ever are the cut-out classics. When Krusty the Klown got cancelled, he tried everything to stay on the air. Here's what you didn't see... If you watch my show, I will send you this book featuring me in a variety of sexually explicit positions. It's not me! I used a stunt butt. Krusty, we're from the network. We have some bad news. I'm afraid your show's been cancelled. I thought this would happen. I just hope you replace me with something as educational and uplifting as I've tried to be. Actually, it's a hemorrhoid infomercial starring Claude Akins. Can I play Hemorrhoid Sufferer #1? Ooh... ooh, that hurts. Is there no relief? I don't think so. Well, how about one of the ""after"" guys? Ah... Ah, that's better. I can ride a bike again Sorry. When Springfield legalized gambling, Homer became a blackjack dealer... and comedy was in the cards! Earlier this year, Homer's long-lost mother returned, and so did a long-lost care package... Twenty. Your move, Mr. Bont. I'll take a hit, dealer. Joker? You're supposed to take those out of the deck! Ooh, sorry. Here's another one. What is this card? ""Rules for Draw and Stud Poker?"" What a pity, Mr. Bont... But, but, It was Homer's fault! I didn't lose! I never lose! Well, at least tell me the details of your plot for world domination... Oh, I'm not going to fall for that one again. Earlier this year, Homer's long lost mother returned, and so did a long-lost care package. Homer, please. You don't have to wolf down that twenty-five-year-old candy just to make me happy. But it won't make you unhappy, right? Hey! Space Food Sticks! Oh, I wish I had these on my space adventure! Did you know I was blasted into space two years ago, Mom? Oh, sure. I read all about it. I mean, it was national news. Do you still work for NASA? No, I work at the nuclear power plant. Oh, Homer. Well, you'll be happy to know I don't work very hard. Actually, I'm bringing the plant down from the inside. When Homer sold his soul for a donut, he found out that Hell isn't all it's cracked up to be, in these never-before-broadcast scenes... Lawyers... lawyers. Ooh, Lionel Hutz. ""Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza's free."" I'd sell my soul for a Formula One racing car! That can be arranged. Changed my mind. Sorry. Cool! Bart! Stop pestering Satan! Your honor, we find that Homer Simpson's soul is legally the property of Marge Simpson and not of the devil. Woo hoo! Ow! Well, I didn't win. Here's your pizza. But we did win! That's okay. The box is empty. If that's what they cut out, what they leave in must be pure gold! Let's watch some more of those fabulous ""Simpsons"" outtakes! Apu living with the Simpsons? It happened! And here's a scene you didn't see... I'm hoping you enjoy this movie. It made every Indian critic's top 400 list. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE / I'M IN LOVE WITH LOVELY JOHNNY... Kuttay! Kaminay! Sooer kay batchay! This movie you rented sucks. No it doesn't, it's funny. Their clothes are different from my clothes. Look at what they're wearin'. A few years back, Bart was adopted by Mr. Burns. In this very special outtake, Homer attempts a reconciliation with his estranged son. Watch. Bart, you're coming home. I wanna stay here with Mr. Burns. I suggest you leave immediately. Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst. My worst, eh? Smithers, release the robotic Richard Simmons. C'mon big boy, shake the butter off those buns! C'mon, c'mon girls! Shake shake shake! Smithers, it's out of control. I'll take him out, sir. SHAKE, SHAKE SHAKE \ SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE \ SHAKE YOUR HINEY! His ass is gonna blow! This past summer, all of America was trying to solve the mystery of ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"" Then they found out it was the baby. To keep this bombshell secret, the producers animated several solutions that were never intended to air... And to keep the show's animators, editors, staff, and hangers-on from leaking the solution, two completely different endings were produced -- one real, one phony. Here's the ending you were never meant to see... The one who shot me was... Waylon Smithers! Nooo! Wait a minute. Yes. With the sun blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world... So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth. I feel like celebrating. Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about? I see. Smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulance. Or so I thought. At the last moment, Smithers, drunk as a lemur, lurched out of the darkness and fired. That's right. Just before I'd shot Jasper. I was busy that night. Stricken I lurched forth in search of aide. But finding only slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial. Then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to W and S. Waylon Smithers. Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and you're recovered and we can all get back to normal. Not exactly. Smithers, for attempting to kill me, I'm giving you a five percent pay cut. But of course, for that ending to work, you would have to ignore all the Simpson DNA evidence. And that would be downright nutty. Yes, the Simpsons have come a long way since an old drunk made humans out of his rabbit characters to pay off his gambling debts. Who knows what adventures they'll have between now and the time the show becomes unprofitable? I'm Troy McClure, and I'll leave you with what we all came here to see -- hard-core nudity!","Troy McClure, Devil, Waylon Smithers, Ant #2, Richard Simmons Robot, Lionel Hutz, Postal Worker, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Ant #1, Homer Simpson, Lisa Simpson, C.
