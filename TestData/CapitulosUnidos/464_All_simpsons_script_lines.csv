457,464,"That is disgusting. Hang on, here's a spot that still looks good. So, do we have a winner? Hmmmm. Not ugly enough. I want something that looks like this...had a baby with this...and it got sat on by this. I think I've come up with the answer. Oh my God. You never fail to nauseate me, boy. Just call me Barf Simpson. I wanted to, but your mother said kids might tease you. Half an hour to show time, your ugliness. Dad, do you realize we've put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined? But if we win this, we get a gift certificate. For what? It doesn't matter. How ya doin'? I need a diaper for my chimp, that won't upset my tiger's stomach if he eats the chimp. Fear not -- our chimp diapers have that nutty cinnamon taste tigers love. Mmm! It's a great time to be a tiger. Mr. Flanders, how did you make these amazing fish? Actually, God made some fish that were pretty close to these, so naturally we selected those for further breeding. So that ""natural selection"" was the origin of this species? Yup, that's exactly... Oh, you almost got me. Not on my watch! This seat taken? Uh yes, I'm saving it for... this soy sauce packet. Aw man, you know you're a loser when they don't even work hard on the excuse. I'll just sit here then. Thanks a lot, everyone. Choke on yourselves. Ah, here we go. Oh no you don't. Uh... that one's so ugly, it reminds me of my ex-wife! That one reminds me of her lawyer... Congress... elderly drivers... commercials... Bella Abzug... Hey clown, we've heard your stand-up, now how about some shut-up! Everybody's a comedian. Except you! Well, why don't you come up here and try to entertain 'em? Entertain us! Well, I guess I could... at least I get a chair... Check it out: two train wrecks connected by a strip of leather! I don't wanna say it's ugly, but PETA called and said we should kill this one. And now, owned by one of the ugliest families in Springfield... ""Satan's Little Helper""! Whoa. Whoa! Even the Koreans wouldn't touch this dog! We have a winner! Ooo, everyone's coming over to congratulate us! Humble faces, kids! Humbler! Lisa, too humble. You're hilarious! / Judge my baby! Say something cruel about me! Would you do my kid's birthday party? Moe! Moe! Moe! Wow, they love me for my bile. And I got a spleenful! Hel-lo! No, no, no -- I don't need your fair-weather friendship. Is what I'll say tomorrow morning! Man, you sure saved that dog show. Moe, you were hilarious. I was just doin' what comes naturally to me -- being mean to animals. Excuse me, sir. I was wondering if you would judge an outrageous beard contest I'm in tonight. Well, anyone can get a laugh at the expense of an ugly dog. But crazy beards? That's where the big boys play. Can you make it sound like girls askin' me? Okay, you crazy dames. I'll do it! Which means this joint is closed for the night. Don't be that way. You can't close! I'll have to go home and drink better beer at half the price in natural lighting! I didn't want to have to do this... Yeah that's right! Scatter, ya cockroaches! Mr. Szyslak, would you like to buy some band candy? That doesn't work on me. Oh yeah? How 'bout this scary face? I can see that down deep is a decent man. Fine. You're home early! Oh, can't a guy rush home from work to see his beautiful-- Moe's is closed, huh? Yeah. Now what am I supposed to do? We can enjoy each others' company. Okay. Still wanna be at Moe's? She's right, Homer. You're happier there. Mr. Szyslak, you want to buy some band candy? Even in the thought bubble I gotta buy band candy. Looks like you ate a Rastafarian and he's comin' back up on ya! Now looky here. I'm no judge of talent, but I am a judge of judging. And in my judge judgment, you have a talent for judging talent. You talk like my ass plays harmonica. You should share your hilarious hate with everyone. I didn't see you come in. Well, since Moe's is closed again, I thought I'd help you cook dinner. Well, I don't need much help... But you can keep me company. You know what? I'll just cook this later. What are we watching? Um, I'm gonna go read a book. After the title page it's Bob Dole's memoirs. This is terrible! I've seen better stitching on a baseball glove! Can I have another corpse? They weren't corpses! Uh-oh. Moe Szyslak? I'm from U.C.A.A., the Uncreative Artists Agency. We represent some of the biggest stars on TV. TV, huh? That crap still on? Yes sir. Never been crappier. Listen, Moe, reality shows are looking for judges, and you're that mythical creature we thought we would never find: you're mean, you're funny and you're not British! I am so not British. Don't let this pasty face and bad teeth fool ya. Perfect. So, what kind of reality shows are we talkin' about here? Well, to name just a few: ""America's Ripest Bananas,"" ""So You Think You Can Judge?,"" ""Who Wants to be a Welder?,"" ""Poodle Versus Elephant..."" ""Leg Swap..."" ""Old People Try to Figure Out Computers,"" ""American Idol,"" ""Dancing With Cars of the Stars,"" ""America's Drunkest Nobody,"" ""Let's Make a Veal..."" Love that show. Somali Pirate Apprentice... Right, yeah, with those guys. Fix Andy Dick... It's about time. ...""Bottom Chef,"" ""My Life On Kathy Griffin,"" ""Pimp My Crypt,"" ""Are You Fatter than A Fifth Grader,"" and ""Grave Robbers of Orange County."" Geez, that's quite a list. Hang on, I'm getting a text. Ooo, those were all just canceled, except for ""American Idol."" Did you just say ""Armenian Idol?!"" 'Cause that's my favorite show! No, no, no, no, no, no, American Idol. Oh, yeah. Who's their Egor Glumov? Randy Jackson. Ah yeah, good enough. Uh, hey driver, could you put on a song about California or Los Angeles? Ah they all suck. But here's a great one about Alabama! Now that I have all this free time, I thought I would do you a huge favor. That's nice. What kind of favor? I organized the kitchen. I labeled everything with a label maker... And I also mixed all the spices together into one super spice! Uh-oh. What kind of ventilating is that? Hyper! Wow, Marge. I can't believe you're taking me to a sports bar. Well, it's been such a... blessing having you around the house, ""making my life easier,"" as you so put it, so I thought you deserved a reward. Watchin' hockey! Watchin' 'em pass that puck! Oh yeah! Lacrosse, idiot. Hey man, can you settle a bet? What was the greatest X.F.L. team that never won a championship? Uh, the Long Island Ice Teas? I think you want the gay bar across the street. As an eight-year-old girl in twenty-first century America, I know how it is to feel insecure about your looks. But you've got so much going for you. I'd kill for your sense of smell... you have a nice firm handshake... And when you wag your tail, it really lights up a room. Now, let's scoot together. Wow, I can't believe I'm here. The place where magic is made. I really appreciate your showing me around, Simon. Always happy to help the newbies. And how do you like L.A.? Oh, it's a helluva city. It's like somebody stepped on New York and scraped it off on the beach. Clever... slightly nasty... very impressive. You know, I don't say this often, Moe -- but I actually think you're quite good at this. Oh, well, oh nuts. Here come the paparazzi. Homie! I thought you were at that sports bar. Well, that place was for diehard sports fans, not guys like me who are only fans when their team makes the playoffs. So, I decided to take apart the washing machine to see where that penny I left in my pants went. Well, I am glad you're spending more time with us, but maybe you should get a plumber to help you with that. Ah, those guys are all crooks. They charge you for parts and labor? Pick one, buddy! I can do this just fine by myself. Don't worry, I got it! Sure is hell to have your husband around all the time, ain't it? At least in Hell the heat still works. Well... I do know something that could occupy his time. A lot of his time. Seen it work with plenty of men my age. Only thing is... you may not get him back. What is it? Golf. Hey there, neighbor. You look as puffed up as a peacock in a... Golf it is. Golf what is? You wanted to see me, Simon? Moe, as you know, over the past few days I've grown rather fond of you. I can't believe you gave me your home phone number. That's not my home number. That's my assistant's work number. Now Moe, I want to give you a friendly warning -- don't do what I did. Don't become the mean judge. But it's brought you everything a man could want -- I bet you throw out your paper plates instead of reusing 'em till the food drops through. That's true. Everything you said is true. But there's a cost. I'm lonely, Moe. No one dares be my friend, for fear I'll say something nasty. But what we do is just kiddin' around, right? People know that. Do they? They've been preparing a bio of you, with interviews of people you've judged. Let's have a look. He's the meanest man in town. Nasty. Uncouth. We hate you! So does Stu! Edit that so it rhymes with something. He's a Wow. I can't believe this, Simon. Simon? Huh. Was he really here, or was it just my imagination? I'm here. My black tee shirt makes me blend into the shadows. I'm here...I'm gone. I'm here. I'm gone. I'm here. I'm gone. I'm here... I get it. I get it. That's your thing. HAPPY BIRTH-DAY TO... YOUUUUUU! This is it, Moe -- America's gonna learn just what sort of man you are. Okay Randy, what'd you think of that performance? A'ight, a'ight -- You know what? I was feelin' that, dog. ""Happy"" was very cool, right? But ""birth"" was definitely a little pitchy, but -- I gotta tell you something -- you worked it out on ""day,"" man. And then when you hit that ""to you"" -- dude, that was the bomb! You blew out all the candles, baby! If you think that answer was a yes, text the number at the bottom of the screen. Giant secret charges may apply. Kara? I have to admit, I didn't think you could come back from last week, when your version of ""Brown Sugar"" made Mick Jagger retire from singing forever. But you rocked it! Ellen, what's your ""ramble"" on this? Ryan, I don't ramble anymore. Although I do love that song ""Ramblin' Man"" by the Allman Brothers. I used to think that they were the ""Almond Brothers,"" which was cool, because I love nuts. Except for filberts, which is weird because I love Dilbert -- 'cause when you're stuck workin' in a cubicle, sometimes you just gotta dance! Now let's hear from the new guy, Moe Szyslak. Uh... well let's see here. Um... Don't become the mean judge. Mr. Cowell, would you like some band candy? Security! Uh, I'm afraid you're wasting your time on this stage... ...because you should be on Broadway chargin' a hundred bucks a ticket! You're a natural talent! I'm gettin' a little emotional here, because your voice, it opened up a little part of me that I thought was closed to truth and beauty forever. If there's a God, I just hope that right now he's votin' your name on that 8-8-8 line. It was, it was really beautiful. Really. Thank you. Okay, that's four thumbs-up. And finally, because this show now has more judges than the Supreme court... Simon, what do you say? Well, that was truly a remarkable version of ""Happy Birthday."" Because when it was done, I actually felt like I had lost a year of my life. But even more objectionable were Moe's insipid comments -- a desperate plea for affection, which fell as flat as the hair on my head. Why are you raggin' on me? I'm doin' just what you said. Hmm... let me think, why would I try to sabotage a new judge who just might do what I do for forty-eight million dollars less? Hey, hey, hey! I've been double-crossed here! You're pretty smart huh, Simon?! Let's see how smart you are with your voice box hangin' out! Label to camera! Label to camera! What?! Oh. I'm Sorry. Sorry. Die, ya bastard! Tees, scorecard, stubby little pencil... you're all set. Have fun, Homie. Looks like Jimmy's starting him off with a three-iron. Now, My first shot was with a three-iron. One shot, and I was hooked for life. Barely saw my family again. Birthdays, anniversaries -- I missed 'em all. I'm missing my daughter's wedding right now. Sweet guy, I'm told. One shot... Hooked for life... Marge! You ruined my shot! Well you can take another -- in forty years! That was awesome. I feel like the Tiger Woods of sex. In the mood for another round? ...I didn't rip out his voice box, but I did stretch out his tee shirt, then they said I ain't allowed back in California no more and I can no longer make judgments about nothin'... Hey Moe, am I okay to drive? Legally, I can't say. To a drunk man that's a yes! Beep! Beep! He seems fine. There is one bright side: I'm also forbidden from ever watchin' Fox. You can't even show it in the bar? That's right -- and business has never been better. Oh hey, how's it goin' there, Mr. Murdoch? Never mind me -- put on the Jay Leno show. Have you seen this? The president says Iran has gotten hold of the most dangerous weapon known to man: the B.P. Oil rig. That's right, ladies and gentlemen. I know how to make that leak disappear -- put it on NBC.","Ralph Wiggum, Carl Carlson, Sports Bar Guy #3, Simon Cowell, Agnes Skinner, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Man With Crazy Beard, Ellen DeGeneres, Pro Shop Clerk, Crowd, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Lindsay Naegle, C.
