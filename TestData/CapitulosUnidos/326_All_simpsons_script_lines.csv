322,326,"Wait 'til he puts his unsuspecting butt on that toilet seat. Where's the ""ee-yow?"" All yours, Homer. You didn't sit on the toilet! Didn't have to, I'm a dude. Butt on bowl, little man! Hey, my-my pants aren't down! It doesn't matter! Ee-yow! Why you little...! Joke's on me, is it...? What's all that racket?! It's old lady Simpson! Run! What's going on? Uhh... I'll tell you what's goin' on... ...I'm taking you all out for pancakes! Yay! Yeah! This place looks familiar. It used to be the ""Leaning Tower of Pizza."" They just painted the tower brown. Either way, everyone who works in the kitchen speaks Spanish. Hey, Apu, what's with the line? It's application day at Miss Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School. Pre-nursery school?! The fast track begins at birth. That's it, claw and bite for position -- only enough tuition money for two. The rest of you: better luck next life! That's a lot of pressure to put on a baby. All they should be worried about is the raspberry monster. You know, Marge makes a good point -- competitive schools aren't for every baby. Are you saying my daughter can't cut it? Just because I owe you fourteen thousand dollars? I'll show you! C'mon, Maggie. You're getting into that school! I will hire a collection agency. Which one? Tri-City? Omni-Pay? Insta-Threat? I've beaten 'em all! The pig says ""oink."" The chicken-- Look, stop right there -- I could go to any Chuck E. Cheese in America and hear what animals say. Do you know what I say? I say ""next."" You're a poopy! You nurse with that mouth? Now what's your name? Maggie! I'm sorry, but why are you answering for her? Maggie doesn't talk yet. Not a word? Oh no no, she says lots of words. Like when she wants something, she says Maggie, we're not a mime school, so we can't take a non-talker, but here's some good news: the Gap will always need sweater-folders. I'm sorry we wasted your time, your Lordship. My baby has no future! Oh, Maggie will do just fine. She'll have plenty of money, 'cause she'll marry a grocer... Grocers don't make that much. ...Who steals from the till, would ya let me finish? Geez. Maggie, you're as smart as any one of those kids. C'mon. Did we ever turn off that shower nozzle? I'm taking you all out for tacos! Yay! Okay, for Malibu Stacy's beach party we've got pita, humus, tempeh, tofu... what other fun foods do we need? Ice? Did you do that? Okay, what's a good side dish? Rice? Why not caviar? Oh my God, you're not just smart... you're brilliant! Mom! Well look who's back, Pippi Non-talking. Just because Maggie can't talk doesn't mean she's dumb -- Einstein didn't speak 'til he was three. And even then, he could only speak German! Fine, I'll give her an IQ test, if only to extinguish all hope. All right, my quiet American, how many eyes do you have? Go on, Maggie, you can do it. Well, congratulations. You're now as intelligent as a pig. Let's see if you can move up to dolphin -- how many people in your family? Woo-hoo! I got that one right too! Okay, last question. Arrange these four arrows to make five arrows. I remind you, you only have fifteen sec-- Oh. Yeah! Philippa, I think you should come in here. Your baby is brilliant. Why, she could already teach at Florida State. Go, Maggie! Go, Seminoles! This better be important, Henry. I was choking on something. Meet Maggie Simpson: IQ 167. 167?! That's amazing for a Christian. But, but my IQ is only 159! Maggie's more intelligent than me? That's right, because 167 is a bigger number than 159. Do you see how that works? Yes, thank you. So our kids keep getting smarter! If we have another one, it could build a time machine, which we could use to go back in time and not have any kids. All our children are smart. Some are just smarter than the others. Welcome to ""The Others."" Maggie, I can't believe how much stuff your new school sent over! Look at these courses you'll be taking. ""Advanced Peek-a-boo"". ""'Got Your Nose' And Other Lies""... ""If you can read this you're almost as smart as my baby."" I'm slappin' this sucker right over ""Support Our Troops."" Look Lisa, there's something in here for you! Really? And Maggie gets a shirt, too! Sweetie, you seem so blue. Did the last of something die? No Mom, it's just that I used to be ""the smart one"" -- now I don't know who I am. Well, I know who you are. And here's something to help you never forget! I already have one of those. Well, then... find a new identity. Your mother's right, honey. Katie Couric didn't just become the world's most famous dwarf, she escaped from the circus and went for it! All right, if I'm second rate as the smart kid, I'll find a new raison d'être. That still sounds like the smart kid. Right, right. Time to show them the new me. No one's happier and more well-adjusted than a standup comedian. How 'bout these entrées? Stuffed cabbage? Can you believe they found a way to make cabbage worse? All right, so what else is goin' on? Let's see... Hey! Why do they call them field trips? We never go to a field! Oh, untrue. Last Thursday we visited a battlefield. Uh, well I... I'm bem-barrassed for you. The following ""haw haw"" is not from amusement, but an expression of contempt. Haw haw! Okay, okay, don't get discouraged. Every me they reject gets me closer to the me they'll like. What are you now, Lisa? An Oakland Raiders' fan? It's called Goth, eternally clueless one. My new name is Ravencrow Never-smiles. Cool, we can be Goth together! We'll go to the cemetery and summon the dark lord by kissing and junk. Okay. But first, you must apprentice by kissing the goddess Ironica, uh... who lives in this rock. Do it for an hour, hour and a half. Yes, my mistress. Oh, none of these feel right. Oh wait, did I try ""soccer player?"" Tried, and failed. I'm a mess. I can't believe I'm jealous of a baby. Hey, I'm jealous of her, too. When you're a baby, you spend all day just rollin' around on the floor. Boy, I miss that. Fine. Roll around on the floor, baby. Floor baby! Floor baby! You're making fun of him for something you made him do. Yeah, well, you're gay. People who accuse others of being gay are often covering up their own latent homosexuality. Bullies rule! The school sent this dealy over for Maggie. His name is Phonic Frog. Aw. Buh. Kkk. Huh. Oh. Muh. Eh. Er. That's me. Huh-oh-muh-eh-er! This-is-Huh-oh-muh-eh-er's-doc-tor. He's-too-sick-to-work-today. I'll be right back. Fine, I'll help you with your stupid flash cards. Aren't you smart. Let's try another one... A little harder this time. No. That's wrong. That's right! This spells ""dog."" Lisa! You were purposely teaching her the wrong word! Lisa, I'm surprised. Your sister just wants to learn and be like you. Well, maybe she needs a better role model. I-agree-with-your-mother. You are a disappointment to Huh-oh-muh-eh-er. I used to be the smart one. Where-is-my-dinner? Maggie, you're such a quick learner -- why don't you learn how to fly! But-I-love-you. Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z... Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z... Goodbye, Maggie. I'm smart enough to know you're better off without me. Two cents... Well, I'm sure a lot of great people have started with less. Nope. Never under a dollar. Lisa's gone! You have to find her! Why can't you just accept the fact that Lisa is old enough to take care of herself? Back off and let her live her life. But she's only eight! Oh, I thought you said ""eighty."" Well, we'll get right on it. Now this may not be the best time, but I'm supposed to give you this survey rating the effectiveness of the Springfield Police Department. ""Somewhat satisfied?"" I see. Well, maybe I'll just ""somewhat"" find your daughter. Huh? Fine. ""Extremely Satisfied."" Lookin' good, boys. Now let's go get some smoothies. Oh, I'm tired, I'm hungry, red plastic sandals are not great running-away shoes... Air conditioning... water fountains... dioramas... and I'll never run into my family here! It's the perfect place to start a new life. No food allowed... you can't hide it in your clothes... would you please step out of the line, sir? Go ahead and search, you'll never find it all. I'm baking muffins as I speak! Some trees are big, some trees are small, but all trees have bark -- except for poplar, ash and maple. Lousy Maggie... thinks she's so great... thinks she knows... I miss them all so much. I hope this typeface catches people's eye. It sure didn't move our old fondue set! Why do you always take the children and not the fondue sets? Why, Santa, why? Good news, Simpsons -- we found your daughter's belongings. Where'd you find these? Giant tongue. Oh, I knew it! We also discovered something very unusual at that museum. Oh my God, what? Well, if you drop a feather and a bowling ball in a vacuum, they'll fall at the same rate. You think you've seen it all in this job, and then something like that comes along. C'mon, c'mon... That's where we found your daughter's things. You look around there while Eddie, Lou and I go ask a few questions. Like, how does a helicopter fly? And what causes thunder? I say it's angels bowling. Lisa... Lisa... Oh no, the giant is waking up! Oh God, we're in a belly. Everyone take off your shoes. How do we get out? Your baby has to press the red evacuate button. Chief, we got a problem here. I see a vase, but Eddie sees two people in profile. This may shock you... but you're both right. Maggie! The red button... Hit the red button! Hit the red button! Maggie! Press the red button! I know, we'll use reverse psychology. Maggie, don't press the red button! Damn it! Marge, I've always loved you. Bart, you were a worthy foe. Mom, Dad! I'm so sorry I got you into this! Lisa! You're all right! Oh good, she's here in time to see us die! Maggie, I'm sorry I was jealous of your special gift. From now on I'm gonna nurture and cherish-- Just tell her which friggin' button to push! Maggie, push the red button! You can do it. Red! Well, Marge, you can't say I never take you anywhere. Uh-hmm. Well, I think we all learned a lesson today: don't try to be something you're not. Namely, food. Chief, now I can't see either one. Well, we're all pretty tired. Let's try a different one. Which figure is bigger? The answer will knock your socks off. I'm sorry I ran off. Being second to Maggie's not so bad. But why didn't Maggie press the right button 'til I told her to? I believe I can answer that. How'd you get in here? Your butler let us in. Play along, I'll explain later. I'm afraid your daughter is no longer welcome at our school. She's as common as an angry woman in an Ibsen play. Zing. Let's just watch the tape, monkey man. Whenever Maggie is asked a question, she looks over at Lisa. Okay Maggie, how many eyes do you have? Go on, Maggie, you can do it. Now rotate and magnify. I don't remember doing that. I would never cheat! Perhaps, but subconsciously, you wanted her to succeed. Watch. Here, you're telling her the answer is ""no."" Here, the solution is a square. Here, you're telling her the answer is ""California condor."" So Maggie's not a genius? She could be... at sweeping up hair. That's my baby, jerk. You call that a punch? I felt it, but it was like ""so what""? Again with the nose. I have a chin, you know. Don't worry, sir. The maid and I will take him out to the curb. C'mon, c'mon. You promised me no one would get hurt! I don't care what they say, Maggie. To me you're brilliant. Not for babies. Do we really need three of these people? Too ethnic, change it. More like Cartwrong! Worst voicing ever. Finally, a real celebrity. Oh good, more producers. Just what they need. Him, I like. Yes, but what's he done lately? Very original. Simon Cowell as Simon Cowell. Well done. I really don't care anymore. All useless. Do credits really have to go this long? Oh, shoosh yourself.","Ralph Wiggum, Interviewer, Chief Wiggum, Lou, Milhouse Van Houten, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Homer Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Phonic Frog, Seymour Skinner, Moe Szyslak, Miss Wickerbottom, Little Boy, Usher, Barney Gumble, Movie Narrator, Bart Simpson, Comic Book Guy, Simon",7.1,589.0,13,2004-02-22,2004,15,Smart & Smarter,12.6,43969.0
