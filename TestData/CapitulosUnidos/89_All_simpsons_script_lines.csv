88,89,"... thirsting for a way to name the unnameable, to express the inexpressible! Tell me more! Keep cool, Simpson. Be in the game, but not of the game. No es bueno! Winners don't use drugs. Oh. I'm out of money. Don't say that out loud. Two Caucasian males out of money in Sector Four. Go to code red. I'm sorry, you'll have to leave. Oh, aw, man, how are we supposed to kill the rest of the afternoon? You mustn't kill time, boys -- you must cherish it! Seize the day! Can I have some change, to go get loaded? Ah, finally a little quiet time, to read some of my old favorites. ""Honey roasted peanuts. Ingredients: salt, artificial honey-roasting agents, pressed peanut sweepings."" Mmmmm. Homer, I have to go out to pick up something for dinner. Steak? Money's too tight for steak. Steak? Sure, steak. Ah! The last peanut - overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers. Uh oh. Something's wrong. Ow, pointy. Eww, slimy. Uh-oh, moving. Ah-ha! Oh, twenty dollars. I wanted a peanut. Twenty dollars can buy many peanuts. Explain how. Money can be exchanged for goods and services. Woo hoo! Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. You know, this is wearing a bit thin. You think so? Bart, look! Maybe a plane exploded. Our prayers have been answered! Hello, gents. What will it be? Apu, give us a Super-Squishee. One that's made: entirely out of syrup. Entirely out of... An all-syrup Super-Squishee? S-such a thing has never been done. Just make it happen. Oh dear... Won't be long. She won't hold! She's breaking up! All done. If you survive, please come again. It's so thick. Your turn, Bart. Wowww... That's good Squishee. What's it like, Bart? Bart? Bart...? Gimme that! Uh. OK... We're young, rich and full of sugar. What do we do? Let's go crazy, Broadway-style! SPRINGFIELD, SPRINGFIELD!/ IT'S A HELL OF A TOWN!/ THE SCHOOLYARD'S UP AND THE SHOPPING MALL'S DOWN!/ THE STRAY DOGS GO TO THE ANIMAL POUND! SPRINGFIELD, SPRINGFIELD--! SPRINGFIELD, SPRINGFIELD--! NEW YORK, NEW YORK--! NEW YORK IS THAT-A-WAY, MAN. Thanks, kid! It's a hell-of-a--- towwwnnn!! Mmmmm... free goo. Hey, don't bogart that Squishee. I don't know where you magic pixies came from, but I like your pixie drink. Ohhh... my head.... Tsk, tsk. The remorse of the sugar junkie. I don't remember anything. Really? Not even this? Oh, no. I must have joined the Junior Campers! The few, the proud, the geeky. Boy, a man on a Squishee-bender can sure do some crazy things. Uh oh. Not again. Okay look, I made a terrible mistake. I wandered into a Junior Camper recruitment center. But what's done is done. I've made my bed and now I've got to weasel out of it. I know you think the Junior Campers are square and... ""uncool,"" but they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies. Marge, don't discourage the boy. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals. Except the weasel. All I've gotta do is take this uniform back after school. You're lucky, you only joined the Junior Campers. I got a dirty word shaved into the back of my head. What is it with you kids and that word? I'm going to shave you bald, young man, until you learn that hair is not a right, it's a privilege. What's in the bag, wuss? Oooh, look! Camper's pampers. Keep-away! Keep-away! Keep-away! Keep-away! Yeah. Whatever. You better pretend you want your uniform back, twerp. Keep-away! Keep-away! What a baby! Oh no. Woe is me, my precious uniform. Guess what, class! Time for a surprise quiz? Well, that's not what I was gonna say, but it's a good idea. Ha. Take out a sheet of paper, books under your desks. But I'm supposed to... I've got to... I'm supposed to... Oh, Warren, I nearly forgot. All Junior Campers are excused to attend their patrol meeting. Um, Mrs. Krabappel...? I'd love to stay, but this uniform carries certain responsibilities. Hey look -- Sergeant Dork! Haw haw! Enjoy your test. Haw ha... ugh. Hel-lo, alternative to testing! Well it's Bart Simpson! C'mon in! You're just in time for ""Sponge Bath the Old Folks Day!"" Help yourself, but stay above the equator. Now, just breathe into him every three seconds. Make sure you form a tight seal around his mouth. Nooo! Should I keep doing it? Well sir, just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary pine cone and you got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir. I'm outta here, man. Okay, now, everybody take out your Junior Campers pocketknives... You guys get to play with knives? Cool! A spork! Don't hurt me. Oop, sorry, Bart, that's a Neddy no-no. You're not allowed to handle a pocketknife 'til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test. Aw, who needs a cruddy knife anyway? Knives are boring. When I say put your beer on a coaster, I mean it. You call that a knife? This is a knife. Down I go. Oh hi, Bart. I'd gladly share these sweet cookies with you, if only you Would help me remove this ribbon. Here's a knife. Oh. Thank you. Now let's all share the goodness. Share this! This man's appendix is about to burst. Luckily, I have my trusty pocketknife. Stand back! Thank you, Dr. Hibbert. Don't thank me: thank the knife. Seems like everywhere I look people are enjoying knives. ""Don't Do What Donny Don't Does."" They could've made this clearer. They won't let you have any fun. Well if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol, boning up on his nerd lessons. Homer, you should be more supportive. You're right, Marge. Good work, boy. Egghead likes his bookie wook! Homer! Just tucking him in. Here you go, your rubber training knife. You've attained the rank of Pussy Willow. Rubber knife? This place is for wimps. Okay, kids, now I'm gonna teach you how to trap wild animals. But this should only be used in a life or death situation. Hmmm... Oooh, floor pie. Hmm. BART!!!! Mmm... apple. The guys who wrote this show don't know squat. Itchy should have tied Scratchy's tongue with a taut-line hitch, not a sheet-bend. Oh, Bart, cartoons don't have to be one hundred percent realistic. Howdilly hey, Camper Bart. Ready for today's meeting? You know-it-know it, Neddy. Okilly dokilly. Now, our annual Father-Son Rafting Trip is next weekend. Oh, no. Me bring Homer on a rafting trip? Dah, I am the captain. My son is Bart. What an oaf. / How embarrassing. Glad he's not my father. Oh Warren, I know your Dad is in prison, but don't you fret. A special Celebrity Dad has been arranged for ya. But my older brother would like to... Sorry, but I'm afraid Ernest Borgnine has already been confirmed. Hiya. I'm sure you kids know me best as Sergeant Fatso Judson in ""From Here to Eternity."" Yay! How was jerk practice, boy? Did they teach you how to sing to trees and build crappy furniture out of useless wooden logs? Huh? Stupid poetic justice...! Actually, we were just planing the father-son river rafting trip. Heh heh. You don't have a son. Look, Homer won't want to go, so just ask him, and he'll say no. Then it'll be his fault. I don't want to go, so if he asks me to go, I'll just say yes. Wait. Are you sure that's how this sort of thing works? Shut up, brain, or I'll stab you with a Q-tip. Dad, I really want you to come on this trip with me! Bart, I'd be delighted to go on your trip with you! Aw, c'mon kid, quit crying! It'll be fun, I promise! Arrr, here be a fine vessel. The yarest river-goin' boat there be. I'll take it. Arrr, I don't know what I'm doin'. Okey-dokey, everybody find a partner. Two dads to a raft. Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders. Well, Homer, looks like we're boat buddies, huh? Want me to Zinc your sniffer? I guess now we know why they call them rapids and not slow-pids, huh? You are not my son. Now what happened to that gosh darn map I brought? Uh, I dunno. But lucky for you somebody here is responsible. Hey, there's a new Mexico. Whoa, Nelly! Oh, quick, Homer! Which way do we turn--? So many Krustyburger locations. Uh-oh... no time. Matthew, Mark, Luke-and-John! Hey, where are the sissy and the bald guy going, HUH? Paddle harder, Homer. We gotta fight the current. Wrong again, Flanders. In a situation like this, you just relax and let the current take you back to land. SUGAR. DO DO DO DO DO DO AWWW. HO--NEY. HO.....NEYYY. DO DO DO DO DO DO. / YOU ARE MY CANDY GIRRRRL Lousy piece of junk! Hey! I got that for my birthday! Now I have to face stupid reality again!... Flanders! My socks feel dirty! Gimme some water to wash 'em! Again? Homer, we have to ration the water carefully. It's our only hope. Oh pardon me, Mr. Let's Ration Everything, but what do you think we're floatin' on? Don't you know the poem? ""Water, water everywhere/ So let's all have a drink."" Homer! No! Ohh... What does it matter? We're doomed! Wrong, we're saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die. Woo-hoo! See that, boy? Your old man was right, not Flanders. We are doomed! In your face, Flanders! Well, at least Ned is trying! What are you doing to help? Well, since you're all such a bunch of big ration-babies, I'll just be in charge of the rationing. Observe, boy. The secret is to take tiny bites, like so: STOP IT! / STOP IT! / DAD! Why couldn't I be on one of the smart rafts. I bet they're having the time of their life. I keep telling you, lady, your husband and son have to be missing for a week before we can start searching. I'd like to help sooner, I would, but we're very, very busy down here. King me. Still no help. You know, it is cougar season. And those things don't mess around. A rescue plane! Get the flare gun! This ain't one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, Flanders. This is the Real Thing... All right, well that's okay. When they come to rescue him, they'll rescue us. Here's our chance! Dolphins always help humans lost at sea. Come back! Come back! Oh, we're done for! We're done for! We're Done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily... Flanders! Snap out of it! Thank you, Homer, I dunno what got-- Dad, I think he's oka-- It's better to be safe than sorry. Sorry. Diddily. You see anything yet? Nothing, Captain. Somebody took all the beer and coldcuts. That's it. I'm not even casting off until we go to the store. You know, Homer, this cheese doodle is our last morsel of food. You'll thank me when we're frying up a big juicy fish. Godspeed, li'l doodle. He'll be back. Here fishy, fishy, fishy. We're waiting. Son, there's something I was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, I want you to have it now. A real Swiss army knife. Cool! I stole it from that Borgnine guy. Don't worry, kids, I'll take care of him with my trusty... Uh... uh... Um.. Uh... Hmm... Dad, I know I've been a little hard on you the last couple of days. If I had the strength to lift my arms, I'd give you a hug. Thanks boy. Now be careful when you... Dad, don't take this wrong, but your expression doesn't fill me with confidence. The foul stench of death is upon us. Mmmm... hamburgers. Hey, wait! I smell hamburgers too. According to this map there's a Krustyburger on an offshore oil rig! That's what you're smelling, Homer! Oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved! Never mind the fog! That way. Steer! There isn't much time! I'm taking a bath on this! We tried to tell you these are unmanned oil rigs. Close the damn thing down! No one's ever gonna come. Give seven hundred Krustyburgers! You want fries with that? You did it, Dad! You saved us! I'm proud you're my father. Go away. Eating. Well, it sure is lucky we stumbled upon this old abandoned Summer camp. Hey, how about a song? THERE WAS A FARMER WHO HAD A DOG, AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME-O...
