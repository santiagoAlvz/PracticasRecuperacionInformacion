243,247,"Now, be careful with those video cameras, children. In order to buy them, the school board had to eliminate geography. This globe will never spin again. Now, class, I want you to be creative with your video projects. I don't want to see thirty ""Blair Witch"" knock-offs. ""Stop Hittin' Yourself"": Take One. Stop hittin' yourself! Stop hittin' yourself! Stop hittin' yourself! Tonight, on the Discovery Channel: ""Inside Lisa's Nose."" What will we find? Boogers... or Nazi gold? Bart, quit it! No way. Bart sleeps with Raggedy Andy. Cut! Cut! Cut! Otto, a red traffic light means what? No time for brain teasers. Today's the day I ask my girlfriend to take a ride on the matrimony pony. Otto's got a girlfriend! Otto's got a girlfriend! That's right, I do. Uh... I know you do. Baby. Otto, since when have you had a girlfriend? We met in the summer of love...Woodstock '99. Quick! I need some water! Eight dollars. Huh. Not in this lifetime! Okay, this is it. Otto? EVERY ROSE HAS ITS THORN / JUST LIKE EVERY COWBOY SINGS A SAD, SAD SONG... Becky, you're my rose. Will you let me be your thorn? Oh, Otto. Of course my answer is... Ooh, wait, wait, wait, wait. This solo is kick-ass. Honey, could you turn it down? Okay, but this better be worth it. Yes, I will marry you. Cool. Homer, look, we're invited to Otto's wedding! Ooh, and such delicate tissue paper. Zig-Zag!? Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! No knife games on the kitchen table! I didn't hit your precious table. Ooh, we're ""cordially"" invited... this Saturday... to join Otto and Becky at... 742 Evergreen Terrace? That's our address! I told Otto he could have the wedding here. Hope that's okay. You should have asked first, Bart. Weddings are hard work and cost thousands of dollars. Hey, it'll be easy. You've still got most of the stuff from Apu's wedding back there. All right, Otto can get married here. But Homer, you have to get rid of that elephant. Let's see. Candles, flowers, place cards, rice... Oh, Mom, you're not supposed to throw rice anymore. Birds eat it, their stomachs swell and they explode. Why am I just learning this now? Son, your mother and I don't approve of this marriage, as we have not approved of any part of your life to date. Well, the important thing is you came. We're leaving. Drive safe! Always a bridesmaid, only occasionally a bride. Lisa, it's time you learned the truth about men. They're pigs? The bitterness is strong in this one. So, any words for the bride and groom? Not now, Bart. I'm trying to urinate. You don't seem to be trying very hard. Dad, the bride and groom are supposed to cut the wedding cake! Oh, that's just superstition. Thank you. Oh, Becky, you look beautiful. I thought you might want to see this bridal magazine. It's got nine hundred tips for the perfect marriage. All ""don'ts."" Oh, we'll be fine. Otto's got a clean police record, and he doesn't do any needle drugs... Well, the real key, according to sexperts, is mutual interests. No prob. We like all the same things. Except... Mm-hmm? Don't tell Otto, but I'm not into heavy metal and he loves it. He refers to our lovemaking as the headbanger's ball. Oh, you can fix little defects like that with gentle nagging. Make it part of the background noise of your relationship. That's how I polished Homer into the perfect... Homer! No, that's ice! Uh, now... as for the matter of my honorarium... Wha? You know, my emolument... Huh? Pay me. Three hundred dollars. Three hundred? I could've gotten Rick Dees for that. OOOOH. YOW! WHOOO!... YEAH!... You got Poison to play at our wedding? We're Cyanide, a loving tribute to Poison! We need a ride home! You expect me to walk down the aisle to a monster ballad?! Let me talk to Otto. Oh, that's okay. I guess this is sort of our song. Well, it doesn't have to be. Otto's just going to have to decide what's more important, his heavy metal or you. Becky, what have I done here? I'm so sorry. In about fifteen minutes I'd take off that wedding dress, or you're gonna look crazy. Moe, can I give you some shrimp for the road? Nah, I'll just take the ring pillow and these uhhh... seven presents I brung. Eh, you know what? Cram some shrimp in, too. Head to tail. That way you can fit more. How 'bout some sauce? Thanks. Becky, I know you must feel awful. But at least this didn't happen after you were married. Yes, better now than when you're too old and fat to get another man. I feel so alone. What am I going to do? Hey, why don't you stay with us? Bart, remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house? Remember that talk we had about you not wrecking people's weddings? It's settled. The stranger stays with us! CH-CH-CH-CHANGES / TIME TO CHANGE THE OIL / YEAH / CHANGES / DON'T WANNA BE AN OILY MAN / A man innocently changes his oil, when... a two-ton car comes crashing down! Crashing down! Who'd have thought you could hold up a car with a wicker basket? Now, Lisa's going through this phase where she doesn't eat any meat. So I usually sneak a little meat juice into her vegetables. Wow, you're a real-life Martha Stewart. I mean, without the evil. May I? Mmm. Yummers. Nobody's ever called my gravy yummers before! Mm. You know what'd be really nuts? A little rosemary. Ooo, ooo, I've always wanted to use rosemary in something. Mom, this gravy tastes better than God's sweat. Thanks to our own spice girl: Becky. Well, Mom, you really brought out the mung in these beans. Actually, that was Becky, too. What are these things in the mashed potatoes? That's the skins. I left them on. Well, nobody's perfect. Let me just pick those out. No! Oh, Becky, your potatoes are the best I've ever had. Oh, God. Stop kicking my baby! Ah, it's cool. We're just putting some Jackie Chan moves into Bart's video project. Yeah, Mom. I need something great. Milhouse has footage of himself falling down the stairs. Well, no kicking. It's too dangerous. Marge, chill out! I have great control. See? That's very impressive, but I still don't... stop that! Hello. HEL-LOOO. We're jamming, Mom. She's painting my music, and I'm playing to her painting. Isn't it wonderful to have a hip female influence in the house? Yes. Well, I guess I'll go roll socks. It's not ""hip,"" but it has to be done. Actually, you could just tie them at the ends. That way, the elastic doesn't wear out. Yes, I hate when things get worn out... hmm... socks... welcomes... ...she's so helpful and everyone loves her and, well, this may sound crazy, but I think my family likes Becky more than me. I wouldn't worry about that. Really? Yeah. You're going to be dead in a week anyway. Dead in a week? What are you talking about? Look honey, never let an attractive woman into your house. All they ever do is usurp your family and then kill you. Like that documentary, ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle."" That was a movie. Look, all we know is she's going to shoot you or stab you or boil you... Or club you with an antique wooden doll. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was a good one. Oh, but first she's going seduce your husband. Becky's going to seduce Homer? It's an act of violence, not love. Oh, I'm sorry, did I wake you? I wanted to return your hairdryer. Oh, and here's your brush. You just enjoy your grocery shopping, Marge. And if you pick up some semolina, I can make couscous for Lisa. It's my favorite! It is? Oh, yeah. You can learn a lot from your kids if you just listen to them. Be right back. Take your time! Why do I always think of the perfect thing to say when it's too late: ""Shut up, Becky!"" Ooh, that would've been sweet. Oh, no. The ""Brakes Cut"" light. It's red! Tough glass. I still say ours is bigger. Our speed bumps are stronger, too. I don't know, Simpson. How do I know you didn't cut your own brakes? Why would I do that? I don't know. Get some attention from a handsome police officer. That's crazy. Look, I know I don't have any proof, but this woman is trying to kill me! Fine. Let me tell you what I tell everybody who comes in here: the law is powerless to help you. Do I have to be dead before you'll help me? Well, not dead, dying. No, no, no, no. Don't walk away. Wait. How 'bout this: just show me the knife. In your back. Not too deep, but, uh, it should be able to stand by itself. C'mon, Becky. Tell us your big news. Well, I wanted to wait for your mother, but okay. I found an apartment, and I'm movin' out. Awww. / Oh, no. Becky, I think I speak for all of us when I say ""When's the ice cream gonna get here?"" And God said, gather ye two of every flavor, anoint them with 62 sauces, whipped cream and nuts, and ye shall call it, ""The Ark."" Homer! Relax, he's gorging. Okay, maybe not. We've gotta save him! Usurper! Usurper! Usurper! Don't mess with me, I've got jimmies! Aagh! I can only see a horrible rainbow! Shut up, Becky! There. I finally said it. Drop the cone, Sugar. Whoopsie. Take her away, boys. I thought you said the law was powerless. Powerless to help you, not punish you. Mmm, 'earned my treat. This isn't over, Becky. I know where you live: My house! Poor Maggie. How many insanity hearings have you been to in your short little life? Mrs. Simpson, before we begin, I just want to assure you that this is not a trial... All right, it's a trial. / Yes! Now Marge, accordin' to this, you recently went berserk in an ice cream parlor. Yes. And Marge, did you ever have an unhealthy fixation on Ringo Starr? It was healthy. He reciprocated. He reciprocated! Excuse me, what are you doing? Oh... I was just praying to God that you'll find me sane. I see. And this ""God"" -- is he in this room right now? Oh, yes. He's kind of everywhere. Marge Simpson, you give us no choice but to declare you utterly-- I'm not insane! You didn't let me finish. Insane! I'm not insane! Run, Marge, run! Pump those crazy legs! Police say escaped mental patient Marge Simpson could be anywhere. Even here at Juggernaut's, where it's wet t-shirt month. But for now, this reporter prays that Mad Marge can be captured before she kills again. Kills again? She hasn't killed once! Shouldn't we be out there trying to find her? Don't worry, she'll show up here sooner or later. To finish off Becky. Then we'll have Mommy back. Come back! Those are prescription pants! Now, Ralphie, what are you going to do if you see Mrs. Simpson? Freeze, you crazy mommy! Attaboy. But you gotta aim a little higher. There ya go. That's a kill shot. Now we've got a special guest. She just flew in from the cuckoo's nest, and boy, is she crazy -- crazy Marge Simpson! Look at that. Hello, Krusty. That's funny. So, Marge. Who's your favorite Native American warrior? Crazy Horse! Oy, oy. Stop it. This bit's dyin'. Let's go to the Mad Marge Dancers. Too soon. Oh, I really miss Mom. The kids are saying if you say Bloody Margie five times, she'll appear. But then she gouges your eyes out. I heard she mates with men, then eats them. I'm sure if Marge were here, and not crazy, she'd be telling you two to do your homework and you to finish washing the dog. Now, let's find out who this Becky really is. I really should read the whole headline before I react. Oh, my. I've been so unfair to Becky. Maybe I am insane. I mean, I am talking to myself. You are? Oh, I thought I'd made a friend. Becky, I want to apologize to you...surper! Why you little...! Cut! Cut! Mom, it's great to have you back, but you walked right into my shot. Shot? Wha? I hope we didn't scare you, Marge. Bart's just filming a music video for his class project. And I'm directing the ""Making Of"" video. Oh. Well, then, I guess there's a reasonable explanation for everything. Except you cutting my brakes! Oh, about that. Uh -- when I changed your oil, I may have drained your brake fluid. I didn't say anything 'cause I thought you'd be mad. Ooboy, my bad. Becky, I'm so sorry I accused you of trying to kill me and steal my family. Hey, no biggie. I was trying to steal your family. I even thought of a good place to bury you, but I didn't have a shovel, so I went to the hardware store, and they have six different kinds... and I was like, ""Later."" Well, that's a relief, too, knowing I'm not crazy. So I guess everything really worked out for the-- Mom! You monsters! You've killed her! No they didn't. Good Lord! We put enough tranquilizers in there to take down Jonathan Winters. Oh, I've got too much to do to take a nap right now. Lisa, get Maggie out of that cage. And Homer, since you're dressed for it, I got some S & M for ya: Scrubbing and Mopping.
