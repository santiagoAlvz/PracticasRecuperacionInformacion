Thank you, Helen. And thank you all for your kind contribu-- . A chocolate bunny?! Who put this wicked idol in the collection plate? Relax, I found it in the dumpster. Perhaps we need a hefty dose of the Good Book... In the beginning... Excuse me, Reverend? It's, ah, hard to hear you with those fans goin'. Well, let's get those off then. In the beginning, God created the Heavens and the Earth... Oooo. What a beautiful garden. It's almost like paradise. Heads up! Well, hel-lo! Uh, aren't you hurt? 'Course not. There's no pain in the Garden of Eden. Hey, you must be Eve. Uh, I guess. Looks like God made you out of my sexiest rib. Speaking of ribs, is there any grub around here? Is there! Good morning, Adam. Any bacon for you, then? Don't mind if I do! Hi-diddly-ho, paradise dwellers! Uh, good morning, Lord. I just have to, ah, compliment you on this beautifully crafted mate. Oh Adam, you're too kind. No, you're too kind. And wise, and righteous... I can't believe you don't have a girlfriend. Oh-ho-ho-ho, please. You're gonna give me a swelled head. I just stopped by to see if you needed anything. Well, some general-interest magazines would be nice. You got it, Eve. There you go. Oh, thanks. Well, I'd better skedaddle. Oh, there's one more weensy little thing -- you see that tree over there? I hate to be a bossy Betty, but I have to forbid you to eat its fruit. No problem, Lord. And it would be even easier to avoid that temptation if I had a few extra wives. Just sayin'... Oh, how cute. Let's call this little guy a ""groundhog..."" Sorry, I already gave him a name. ""Land monster."" Really? Well, what do you call that thing on the branch? Branch monster. Please, please call me Snake. Yo, have you dudes sampled this fruit? It's like God's private stash. But He said it was forbidden. Quite so, mum. I recall one of the dinosaurs had a bite and well, that was the last of -- Egad! Please stop eating that. God's gonna furious. You're pretty uptight for a naked chick. You know what would loosen you up? A little fruit. Well, it is a sin to waste food... And you keep saying we need to do things together... This could really spice up those pies I've been making... What the dickens?! Eve, did you taste of the forbidden fruit? Yes, God. Doggone it, Eve, I think you'd better hightail it outta this Garden! Adam, say something. Uh, um, uh... I think we should see other people? You heard me. Vamoose! Usually a mink massage makes me feel better. But something's missing now. I didn't say stop. Lovely day in paradise, isn't it? Yeah, just like yesterday. Today I'm featuring mouth-watering pork ribs. Tuck in, then! I gave a rib to Eve, and now she's gone forever. One whole rib, and still standing. Well, aren't you the plucky one, sir. Oh, poor Eve. What are you doing out there in that horrible place? I'm toiling! What does it look like? This is my fault. I shoulda stood up for you during that whole ""Applegate"" thing. Well, it's a little late for apologies now. Don't say that! Maybe I can sneak you back in. I mean, God can't be everywhere at once, right? Somebody order a hole? Oooh, that's a tight squeeze. Oh, thank you. Are you okay? I'll be fine. Just give me a second to... ugh... C'mon, Eve. Hurry! Ohhh, my dear, sweet Eve. I love you even more than the butterscotch pond or the porno bush. So! This is how you repay me, Adam! And after I created my fingers to the bone for you I... My unicorn! Oh, what have they done to you, Gary? Oh, there, there, I'm sure he's gone to a better place, Lord. Oh, shut up. You are so banished. Hey, now let's not do anything rash... God is love, right? God, you have every right to flick me out too. But before you... Ohhh, my back. So this must be that pain thing. Oh, yeah. Definitely pain! This sucks. Things were so much better back in the Garden. I'm sure God will let us return soon. I mean, how long can He hold a grudge? ... Forever and ever... ... and ever and... And that concludes Genesis, the first of the sixty-six books of the Bible. Moving on to Exodus... And Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat Jacob and who did he beget? All right, let's go, ya wee Israelites. Back to slavin'. Man, captivity blows. Talk to the whip! On your knees, ya mugs. It's the Pharaoh! Ah, excellent progress, Slavedriver Willie. Kudos on your whipping. Ah, he noticed. Suffering sarcophagus! My tomb! Who did this??! C'mon, confess! Don't make me slay all the first-born males again! Bart did it. I saw him do it. Take him away, boys. No! The bush set me up! As for the rest of you, it's time for a little discipline. Slavedriver, put away the Encouragement Whip and break out the Cruel Whip. Heh, that's that new Omni-Lash, boys. Just look at that snap-back. Yeah, sweet. We can't keep living like this. Moses, ask Pharaoh to let your people go. Oh, now they're my people. Scrub harder, slave. I want to be able to eat off that thing. And make it snappy, it's almost lunchtime. Excuse me, uh, Pharaoh? I think Moses here has something to ask you. Go. Let-my-people-go. Let your people go?! I've never heard such insolence. You call yourselves slaves? Well , the ball's in his court now. All right, read me back what I have so far, Mrs. Krabapatra. Bird. Bird. Giant eye... Pyramid. Bird. Mm-hm. Very good... Ah, giant eye. Dead fish. Cat head. Cat head. Cat head. Guy doing this... What the-- ? Keep that plague coming, Moses. Frogs away! We spent all our money, but it was worth it. Now he's gotta let us go! Mmmm! These are the juiciest frogs I have ever eaten. Ra has rewarded my cruelty to the slaves. It's a plague, you moron! And we've got lots more planned, and there's nothing you can do about it! So long, kids. Give my regards to the British Museum. Do you think we could ever be more than just friends? Not now, Moses. We gotta find a way outta here. I know we built a secret passage in here somewhere. I found it! We're outta here! Uh-oh. Eh, slave labor. You get what you pay for. Our time has come! Follow me to freedom! Hey, Pharaoh, those half-pint slaves are exodusing as we speak. Well, I say good riddance to bad rubbish. Okay, but who's gonna build your pyramids? Well, we cou-- After them! We'll never be able to swim that far. Oy carumba! Screw this, I'm converting. Save us, o mighty Ra! Hey, cut that out! I have an idea. All right, Moses, lead your people. Flush!! It's a miracle! I performed a miracle! I'm a genius! Yeah, yeah. Hurry, everyone! We don't have much time! After them, men! Into the temporarily dry sea! Aw, nuts. Hey, Chief, he splashed me. Look, nobody likes a crybaby. Okay? You just splash him back. Yayyy! Well, Lisa, we're out of Egypt. So, what's next for the Israelites? Land of milk and honey? Hmm, well, actually, it looks like we're in for forty years of wandering the desert. Forty years? But after that, it's clear sailing for the Jews, right? Uh, more or less. Hey, is that manna? Yayyy! / Manna! Whoa-ho-ho! Now we come to King Solomon, whose wisdom was like a drill, boring into the rock of injustice. Boring... Boring... Boring... King Solomon, these men need you to settle a dispute. They each claim ownership of this pie. The pie shall be cut in two. Then each man shall receive... death. I'll eat the pie. Okay, next up... Jesus Christ vs. Checker Chariot. Ohh, Dad, you're sitting on my arm. And after David smote Goliath, the people crowded into the Temple, where a cool breeze blew not, and their hearts were filled with crankiness... I'm bored. Send in my jester. Hey, hey, King David! Ha, ha, how ya doin'? Now I'm not saying Jezebel's easy, but before she moved to Sodom, it was known for its pottery. What else you got? Ahh... yeah... well, wait a minute, I got somethin' on the Canaanites. They are so stupid. Methuselah, my oldest friend. Who did this to you? It was... Goliath. But Goliath is dead. I smote him myself. I smoted him good. No, it was his son, Goliath Two. Nooo... Goliath Two is gonna pay. And this time it's biblical. I'll just give Goliath Two the ol' rock to the head, applause applause, ""ya gotta believe in yourself, stay in school,"" and we're outta here. I don't know, Davey. Quiet, you. Oh, you've gotten pretty fat, Davey... Let's get it on... See ya later, Davey. You killed my best friend. You killed my father. Who was like a best friend. All I need is my trusty sling and one good hard... Say, how's tomorrow for you? What say you now, Goliath? Without your precious hair, you no longer possess your fantastic strength! That's Samson, idiot. Let my proclamation go out across the land: Haw haw! Haw haw! I hope this doesn't get into the Bible. You're King David! I love you 'cause you kill people. Well, get yourself another hero, kid. I'm all washed up. Well, I guess it's up to Ralph to stop Goliath. Goliath Two is really gonna pay. Get ready to meet the first action hero. All right. It's giant slayin' time... Oops. Crap. How am I supposed to get up there? Jonah! You died the way you lived - inside a whale. Hmm... I trampled four giant-slayers today. I think I earned this. Don't you know smoking stunts your growth? Well, well, well. If it isn't the little Prince. I'm not afraid of you, Goliath. Before I was arrogant. But now, my heart is humble, and my spirit is... What do you know? A king fit for a meal. Hope I don't give you heartburn! Great news, everyone. Goliath is dead! Although I haven't seen his body, the blast that failed to kill me, surely killed the giant. Anyhoo, now that I'm your king again... Ralph! I thought you were dead! Nope! Rejoice, good people. Goliath the Terrible shall rule no more! But Goliath was the greatest king we ever had. Whuh? He built roads, hospitals, libraries... To us he was ""Goliath the Consensus Builder."" You're under arrest for megacide. Where's your Messiah now? Everyone's gone! Oh, how embarrassing. Oh, we slept right through church. Eh, it's not the end of the world. Oh no, it's the Apocalypse. Bart, are you wearing clean underwear? Not anymore. It's the Rapture. And I never knew true love. I never used those pizza coupons. Why aren't we ascending into Heaven? Oh, right. The sins. Where do you think you're going, Missy? Dad! Ooh, I smell barbecue! Hey, look! Oh, they're out of hot dogs! And the cole slaw has pineapple in it!
