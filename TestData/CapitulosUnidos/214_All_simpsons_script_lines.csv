210,214,"O'ER THE LAND OF THE FREE... ""... AND THE HOME... HOME OF THE BRA-AVE / OH, AMERICA'S THE HOME OF THE BRA-AVE! THE BRAVE, AMERICA THE BRAVE, THE BRAVE! HOME OF THE BRA-AVE"" Thank you, Springfield! I love you! Peace! Thank you, Cyndi Lauper... Just a reminder, folks, we do have a baseball game today. I am Dennis Conroy, and heeere come your Isotopes! Boooo! Let's welcome two new additions to the team... ... Smash Diggins and Fishbone Walker. Lucky for us, they were sent down from the majors for drug violations. Oh, stupid Isotopes. Hurry up and lose so we can get out of here! Why do you hate the Isotopes so much, Dad? Because, I loved them once and they broke my heart. Let that be a lesson to you, sweetie: never love anything. Even you? Especially me. But you've gotta support the team, Dad. They're already threatening to move to Moose Jaw. That's right. Like my mother always said, you've gotta stick it out, even if you picked a loser. To the bitter end. First pitch of the game... That's a rotator cuff. His career's over. I'm going to warm up the car. But there's only been one pitch! And it sucked! Bases loaded, two outs, bottom of the ninth, and it's do or die. ""HITLER IS A JERK, MUSSOLINI..."" That'll bring up Babe Ruth the fourth. Of course, he's no Babe Ruth the third... but the franchise is very excited about this illegitimate great-grand-bambino... And, what's this? He's pointing to the right field bleachers! Probably at a dying little boy. Mom, am I dying? No, of course not! Is he, Mom? You can tell me. No! Now he's pointing to the ground. Is he indicating a bunt? Yes, he's bunting! Good hustle, kid. NOW IT DOESN'T WORK. So, who won? The losers? No, they lost. Losers. But only by two points. And they didn't resort to stealing bases like the other team, so it's kind of a moral victory. With a little middle relief, they might even make the playoffs. You'll be in your cold, cold grave before that ever happens. Homer, would you please stop talking about the children's graves? What's the hubub? Did Moe finally blow his brains out? Quiet! We're watchin' the Isotopes! Shut it off. They're losers. Where you been? The Isotopes are on fire! Yeah, that sniper at the all-star game was a blessing in disguise. Now we're in the championship game. Championship? Wooooo! 'Topes ruuuule! Well, here's a die-hard fan. Sir, your beloved Isotopes are about to make history. Any thoughts? Oh, it's a great team, Kent... never gave up hope... I want to thank Jesus... and say hi to my special lady Marge... We did it, baby! Wooooo! Woooooo! The inspiring words of a fan who'll always root, root, root for the home team, even if they lose this ga-- They lost? Those losers! No, no, no, the game's not over -- Woo! Not over! Wooooo! There you have it. Woo. Bottom of the ninth, two outs. It all comes down to this. And here's the pitch... Jumping Jesus! He got all of that one! It's going... going... going... Our technical director today was Stan Kadlubowski. It's out of here! 'Topes win! Nobody touched my rumaki. Woo! Rumaki! Isotoooopes! Wooo! Iso-topes! Iso-topes! Isotopes! Hey, a baseball field! Batter up! / Hurray! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! / Whoa baby! Steal second! I think I'm gonna puke! Hey, who's on first?! Touchdown! Slide! Safe! Hey, Carl -- Isotopes! WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS / WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS / YOU GOT MUD ON YOUR FACE / BIG DISGRACE... Whoop! Careful. Wow, you look really hungover, Dad. What did you do last night? Last night? Hello, big Maggie. Yes! Yes! Yes! Someone trashed the school! What the dilly-yo? ... Where this morning the three ""R""'s stand for rowdiness, ransacking, and i-rresponsibility. Any suspects, Chief? None. That's why we're jumping to the conclusion that this was the work of no good punk kids. Kids? Therefore, effective immediately, I am imposing a curfew: any kid caught on the street after dark will be shot. Or returned to their parents, as the situation may warrant. Whoa / Curfew? Serves you little punks right. Maybe next time you'll think befo-- Oh, my God! Look what those rotten kids did to my car! The cops can't just slap a curfew on us. We have rights. Sure you do. You have the right to remain silent. That was cold-blooded, Marge. Yeah. But it's not fair. Adults always blame kids for everything! Well, if kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named after them? Acting childish. Kidnapping. Child abuse... What about adultery? Not until you're older, son. Ice cream truck!!! Hey watch it! / Quit pushing! / Stop! Hey! Hey! Quit pushin'! I was here first! Get out of my way! Achtung, babies! Curfew is in effect... return to your homes immediately... All right, let's see some I.D.s, boys. You two scofflaws are violating curfew. I'm taking you downtown. Oh, uh, sorry to disturb you, Dr. Hibbert. Not at all, officer. What a beautiful night... fireflies, full moon... And here we are, locked inside. Kids, the carnival's in town for one night only! And they've got cotton candy and hats with feathers and there's no lines because all the stupid kids have curfew! So-- Oh, right. Sorry. Why don't you kids play one of your old board games? When was the last time you played Citizenship? Energy Shortage. Hippo in the House. Ooh, ""The Game of Lent."" Can't we just go to bed? It's only 5:30. Fine. We'll play ""Hippo in the House."" Oh, the hippo's missing... You think that's bad. I had to talk to my mom all night. She's got problems. Scary problems. Adults blow. Yeah. Just look at 'em over there... Smoking their cigarettes... Drinking their coffee... Scratching their big butts... Your metabolism will change someday, too, young man. That oughta show little Timmy and Tammy Scumbag who's in charge around here. Gee, Chief, all those gears and motors must've cost a fortune. Well, you gotta spend money to make money, Lou. You wanna hold it for a while? Meh. Marge, kite. Hey, there is one thing we could do. Lis! No! It's prime-time! You robbed me of my manhood! That's petty theft. Oooooh! Don't go there! ""Don't Go There"" will be right back. Oh no, it won't. Wait, there's a commercial! / Ohh, yeahhhh. Forty years ago, a film appeared that was so shocking, so terrifying it was sealed in a concrete vault deep beneath the earth. But even the new management of Sony/Tri-star could not contain the pure evil of... ""The Bloodening."" Milhouse, do you see what's on Channel six? Uh, yeah... i-it's really something. A registered nurse, trained in the treatment of terror, will be on duty during the showing of... The Bloodening. Now playing at the Springfield Drive-In. After dark. Milhouse, spread the word! We're seeing this movie -- tonight! That's right, we're breaking curfew! C'mon. Breakin' curfew, Mom. We're out of Skoal! Due to the likelihood of fear-induced heart attacks, we're offering all patrons million-dollar life insurance policies. Life insurance? Hmmm... Will I be able to borrow against the equity? I don't know, sir. It comes free with the popcorn. Is that air-popped? Skinner! We're losing valuable make-out time! Little help? Sure. Ahhh. Lisa? Nelson. Get off of my moor, ya mischievous weans! Actually we'd prefer to stay. You're thinking about hurting us. Now you're thinking, ""How did they know what I was thinking?"" Now you're thinking ""I hope that's shepherd's pie in my knickers."" Wow! / They showed him! Mannn, I never liked Shakespeare until now. 'Right, you little blighters. We've had quite enough of your evil mischief. But you're the one who's been bad. You've been sneaking puddings. But... but... how did you know? We know all your secrets. And you pilfered the poor-box. And Doctor, we know that you and the bootblack have been rogering the fishwife in the crumpet shop. Lies! / How dare you! Get them! Quickly! We can't have that. Take that you suckers! / Yeah! / In your face, fishwife! / Enjoying the movie, kids? Listen up, punks. The moral of the story is, the adults always win. For cryin' out loud, Eddie. You scared the hell out of me! Sorry, Chief. Don't forget to clean under the jowls! That spot is Club Med for mildew. And let this be a lesson to you. Kids never learn. Oh, that is it. I am tired of being pushed around by grownups! It's time to fight back! Yeah! / Fight back! Man, if we had eye power like those kids in that movie, we could read the adults' minds and tell their secrets and make 'em pitchfork each other and junk! Yeah! / Junk! / Yeah! Wait! We don't need supernatural powers! We already know their secrets. She's right! Homer's done a ton of crap that never made the papers. My Mom shoplifts. All the time. Stuff she doesn't even need. My Dad gets in car accidents on purpose. Great. This is all gold. We gotta spread this stuff around. Let's put it on the Internet. No! We have to reach people whose opinions actually matter. And I think I know how. Why don't we... Attention hemline and midriff monitors -- Willie, get my Windex! Two hundred channels and nothing but cats. So, Marge, ready for another episode of ""Don't Go There""? I'm tired of that show. But I've been hearing good things about ""Talk to the Hand."" Tom Shales says the writing ""snaps, crackles and pops."" Okay, whatever takes my mind off my life. Hey, look what I found. Grampa's old radio. Oh, wouldn't it be grand to gather 'round and have a listen? Well, turn something on. I'm starting to think. Good evening, adults. ... we interrupt this broadcast to bring you a very special presentation. Tonight's program is entitled... We Know All Your Secrets. Bo-ring. Go back to that infamy guy. Constable Wiggum likes to act tough. But he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose? Heh. Heh. Well, It's not like that's a crime. I'm afraid it is, Chief. And Schoolmistress Krabappel has been stealing supplies from the school cafeteria. Edna, how could you? Don't get up. I'll bus my own tray. Now we come to Mr. Homer Simpson... Did you know he likes to eat out of the Flanders' garbage? Oh, Homer... I have a problem. Tune in tomorrow, and every day until the curfew is lifted. Because we'll be revealing embarrassing secrets about Springfield's other adults. Well, at least they've already done me. And we have plenty more on Homer Simpson. I've called this meeting to determine what to do about those blabber-mouthed kids and their creepy English accents. Hey, shut up, Mayor! They're tellin' secrets again! Oh, I hope they don't reveal this is a comb-over. Our top secret tonight: Gay divorcée Luann Van Houten has been cheating on her boyfriend Pyro -- with his best friend, Gyro. How many times have I fought beside you, Gyro -- and this is how you repay me? Pyro, Gyro, settle down. Can't we shut down that infernal transmitter? Can we just blow it up? Go ahead, girlfriend. Settle down, people. As we speak, Chief Wiggum is tracking down those little squealers, using the latest in crime-fighting technology. Ahh, I got nothin'. How 'bout you, Frinky? I have captured the signal and am presently triangulating the vectors and compressing the data down in order to express it as a function of my hand. They're over thereee. And guess who's been practicing medicine without a license... ... that's right, Homer Simpson. Freeze, ya little shock jocks! Brilliant. They transduced amplitude modulation via the concavity of that oversized beverage conveyance. I mean that is some clever goyvin. All right, you kids come down now. We promise we won't kill ya. Speak for yourself! Bart, get down here! I'm gonna spank you back to the Stone Age! You can't make us come down. You adults are always giving us orders! Well, you kids are always disobeying them! Adults treat kids like children! Kids treat adults like cash machines! Adults! / Kids! / Adults! / Kids! / Adults! KIDS! / YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN, NOW WE'VE HAD OUR FILL. YEAH! / YOU'RE ONLY HERE 'CAUSE MARGE FORGOT HER PILL. KIDS! / YOU'RE ALL JUST SCANDALIZING VANDALIZING PUNKS. CHANNEL-HOPPIN' RIT'LIN-POPPIN' MONK-EYS / But please don't quit the fan club. KIDS! / I CAN NAG AND NAG TILL MY HAIR TURNS BLUE... KIDS! / YOU BUM MY SMOKES AND DON'T SAY THANK YOU... WHY CAN'T YOU BE LIKE WE ARE?... OH, WHAT A BUNCH OF BRATS. WE OUGHTA DROWN YOU JUST LIKE CATS! ADULTS! / YOU RUN OUR LIVES LIKE YOU'RE COLONEL KLINK. ADULTS! / YOU STRUT AROUND LIKE YOUR FARTS DON'T STINK! ADULTS! / YOU'RE SUCH A DROOLING SNORING, BOOZING BORING BUNCH / SURLY, MEANIE, THREE-MARTINI LUNCH-ERS. I just ate a thumbtack. ADULTS! / THEY'RE ALWAYS TELLING US TO-- SHUT YOUR TRAPS! OY! WE'RE FED UP WITH ALL OF YOU WHIPPERSNAPS! WE'RE TRYIN' TO GET SOME SLEEP HERE / IT'S ALMOST SIX-FIFTEEN / WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH... DON'T YOU TREAT US LIKE... CAN'T YOU JUST LAY OFF... WE'RE SICK OF ALL OF YOU... KIDS... TOOO... DAAAAY! We're gonna teach all of you rugrats a lesson! Oh yeah? What can you old people do to us? Yeah, you old fogies! Buzz off, you old buzzards! Yeah, we're scared! Someone should iron you. This is Kent Brockman reporting from my own home in accordance with the new curfew for anyone under seventy. I can't believe it passed. I warned you guys that seniors always vote in record numbers. The controversial measure passed by a single vote. You really should have voted, Homer. Pfft. It wouldn't have made a difference. Lights out, you punk kids! Yay! We took back the night! Hey, fellas! Hey, you wanna stop with the kicking? My pills were in that can! Good gravy. I don't kick your things. When you're tryin' to breathe on the machine do I go off and kick it? Aw, now look at that it went down the sewer. You happy? I'm gonna sue now. Now it's time for the lawyers.","Ralph Wiggum, Mayor Joe Quimby, Carl Carlson, Townsfolk, Dennis Conroy, Eddie, Chief Wiggum, Old Jewish Man, Lou, Milhouse Van Houten, Marge Simpson, Wacky Friend, Nelson Muntz, Deep-voiced Announcer, Craggy Farmer, Everyone, Studio Audience, Kent Brockman, Homer Simpson, SASSY TWENTYSOMETHING GAL, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Gary Chalmers, Seymour Skinner, Creepy English Girl #2, Adults, Grampa Simpson, Mrs. Muntz, Sideshow Mel, Lenny Leonard, Krusty the Clown, Rev.
