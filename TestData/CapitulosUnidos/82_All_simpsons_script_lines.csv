81,82,"Human roaches. Feeding off each other's garbage. The only thing you can't buy here is dignity. Welcome swappers to the Springfield Swap meet. Ich Bin Eine Springfield Swap Meet Patron! I need a drink and a shower. Oyster shells, hand painted to resemble Lucille Ball! You'll love Oyster Lucy! Oh Mr. Mooney, I just gotta meet Bob Cummings. Vivvv!!! Oh boy! Free trading cards! Wow, Joseph of Aramathia! Twenty-six conversions in A.D. 46! Whoa, a Methuselah rookie card! Well, boys, who'd have thought learning about religion could be fun? Religion? Learning? Let's get outta here! Hey! Wow an original Malibu Stacey from 1958. Oooh. Yeah. They took her off the market after some kid put both his eyes out. Oh my. ""Prisoner 24601""... Why, I wore this for two years in a Viet Cong internment center. Never thought I'd see the old girl again. Still fits. Small world. It is, it really really is. Ooh, five cents each! Junk... junk... the airplane's upside down... Strad-i-who-vius?... Your teenage son or daughter will think this wishbone necklace is really ""cool."" I doubt my son or daughter is that stupid. What the hell is this? Melvin and the Squirrels. Part of the rodent invasion of the early 60s. STUCK A FEATHER IN HIS CAP AND CALLED IT... RICE-A-RONI! Mel-vin! Bart, look! It's Dad! Dad, when did you record an album? I'm surprised you don't remember, son. It was only eight years ago. Dad, thanks to television, I can't remember what happened eight minutes ago. No, really, I can't. It's a serious problem. What are we all laughing about? Who cares? Anyway, it all happened during that magical summer of 1985... A maturing Joe Piscopo left ""Saturday Night Live"" to conquer Hollywood... People Express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel...and I was in a barbershop quartet... Hello... Hello... Hello... Hello... HELLO, MA BABY / HELLO, MA HONEY / HELLO, MA RAGTIME, RAGTIME GAL / SEND ME A KISS BY WIRE... ETC. Every afternoon at Moe's, Chief Wiggum, Principal Skinner, Apu and I would get together and sing... and the crowds went wild. Yoo hoo! Barbershop! That ain't been popular since aught six, dagnabit! Bart, what did I tell you? No talking like a grizzled 1890's prospector... consarnit! Rock 'n' roll had become stagnant. ""Achy Breaky Heart"" was seven years away. Something had to fill the void, and that something was barbershop... GOODBYE... GOODBYE... GOODBYE... GOODBYE... GOODBYE, MY CONEY ISLAND BABY. That's my son up there. What, the balding fat-ass? No, the Hindu guy. NEVER TO SEE YOU ANY... NEVER GONNA SEE YOU ANY... I'm gonna nail that cop right between the eyes. Right after this song is over. GOODBYE, MY CONEY ISLAND BABE. GOODBYE, MY CONEY ISLAND BABY / FAREWELL, MY OWN TRUE LOVE... Ching, ching. You know, Reverend, this really isn't a hymn. Ned, there's an oil stain in the parking lot that looks just like St. Barnabus. Oh my stars! SO GOODBYE... FAREWELL... SHOP KWIK-E-MART AND SAVE... GOODBYE MY CONEY ISLE / GOODBYE MY CONEY ISLE / GOODBYE MY CONEY ISLAND BABE! Homer, I'm a theatrical agent, and I want to represent your group. Really? Yeah! You've got... it! All except that police officer. Too Village People. You'll have to replace him. Just leave it to me. Where are we going? Where are we going? Run along, boy. You're free now! No! Nooo! Nooo! Principal Seymour Skinner. Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. Never fit on a marquee, luv. From now on, your name is Apu Du Beaumarchais. It is a great dishonor to my ancestors and my God, but okay. The next day, we started auditioning for Chief Wiggum's replacement... OLD MCDONALD HAD A FARM / EE-I-EE-I-O / AND ON THIS FARM HE HAD A CHICK / SWINGINGEST CHICK I KNOW / WITH A WIGGLE WIGGLE HERE AND A WIGGLE WIGGLE THERE... Get off the stage! I want to, but I can't. WHEN YOU'RE ALONE AND LIFE IS GETTING YOU LONELY, YE KIN ALWAYS GO... ACH! DOONTOON! Next! THEEEEME... FROM ""A SUMMER PLACE""... FROM ""A SUMMER PLACE""... THE THEME... FROM ""A SUMMER PLACE""... IT'S THE THEME... Next! IF I COULD WALK WITH THE ANIMALS / TALK WITH THE ANIMALS / GRUNT AND SQUEAK AND SQUAWK WITH THE ANIMALS... Good Lord! Dr. Doolittle is Chief Wiggum! This bird's gonna fly! It was one lousy applicant after another. And then... OVER IN KILLARNEY / SO MANY YEARS AGO... Such a voice! Who is that? ME MITHER SANG THIS SONG TO ME / IN TONES SO SOFT AND ... Barney! JUST A LITTLE IRISH DITTY... Barney, how'd you like to sing for our group? Sure, why not? Now where's me toothpick. TURA LURA LURA -- TURA LURA LI -- WIGGUM FOREVER, BARNEY NEVER! WIGGUM FOREVER, BARNEY NEVER!... SWE-EE-EE-EE-EET ADELEINE. SWEET ADELEINE. MY-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y ADELEINE. MY ADELEINE.... BARNEY FOREVER, WIGGUM NEVER! BARNEY FOREVER, WIGGUM NEVER!... Hey, those girls you paid to scream are doing a great job. I didn't pay any girls to scream. Hanh?!!! Look at this. / We sounded great, huh? / Etc. Only one question remains gentlemen. What do we call ourselves? How about Handsome Homer Simpson Plus Three? I like it. We need a name that's witty at first, but that seems less funny each time you hear it. How about The Be Sharps! Perfect. The Be Sharps. The Be Sharps. The Be Sharps. The Be Sharps. well, can't blame a guy for trying. Aw, you're all under arrest. What'd you kids get? I bought this cool pencil holder. Far out, man. I haven't seen a bong in years. No one bought a wishbone necklace. Well, one of us made some money. I sold a guy our spare tire. It'll be a long time before your Mother gets back with the tire, so why don't I tell you more of the story? Now that we had a name, the Be Sharps needed a hit. Something new, something exciting, something mid-1980's... THERE WAS NOTHING IN AL CAPONE'S VAULT / BUT IT WASN'T GERALDO'S FAULT -- Look what I got. Now people will stop intentionally ramming our car. Hmm... baby on board. BABY ON BOARD / SOMETHING, SOMETHING BURT WARD... This thing writes itself! ... I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S MIGHTY NICE / EACH TRIP'S A TRIP TO PARADISE... WITH MY... BA-BY ON BOARD. Gentlemen, you've just recorded your first number one. Wait'll I tell Marge! Oh yes, Bouffant Betty. Well I would prefer we kept your marriage a secret. You see, a lot of women are going to want to have sex with you, and we want them to think they can. Well... if I explain it to Marge that way, I'm sure she'll understand. Come on, honey. It'll only be till we finish our tour of Sweden. BABY ON BOARD / HOW I'VE ADORED / THAT SIGN ON MY CAR'S WINDOWPANE... That's my boy Homer singing! Paul Harvey's on. ... and that little boy who nobody liked grew up to be... Roy Cohn. Wow! And now you know the rest of the story. BOUNCE IN MY STEP... LOADED WITH PEP... 'CAUSE I'M DRIVING THE CARPOOL LANE... Ah, squiddy. I got nothing against ya. I just heard there was gold in your belly. ... WITH MY BA-BY ON BOARD. Homer, you're going to be famous! Yeah, but I'm not gonna let it change our lives. I'll be the same loving father I've always been. Have you seen Bart? I stuck him somewhere. Look what I got for you, Dad. Oh, Hom... gimme the keys. I have a question for Apu du Beaumarchais. Isn't it true that you're really an Indian? By the many arms of Vishnu, I swear it is a lie. Barney, how did you join the group? They found me on the men's room floor. Principal Skinner... Mm hmm? You've been referred to as ""The Funny One."" Is that reputation justified? Yes. Yes it is. GOODBYE MY CONEY ISLE -- GOODBYE MY CONEY ISLE -- GOODBYE MY CONEY ISLAND BABE! Damned ceremonies. This is time I could be working, Mommy. We'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman. She's 100 years old, and she weighs over 200... ... tons. This enormous woman will devour us all! I meant the statue. Okay...Gilligan, the Skipper and Chief Wiggum. Name three castaways. Hi-yo! Clancy, use the remote. Oh yeah. Can we talk about Chief Wiggum? We had fame and fortune. Now all we needed was the approval of record company low-lifes. And the Grammy for Outstanding Soul, Spoken word, or Barbershop Album of the Year, goes to...The Be Sharps! Congratulations! David Crosby, you're my hero! You like my music? You're a musician? Then came the greatest thrill of my life. Hello, Homer. I'm George Harrison. Oh my God. Oh my God! Where did you get that brownie? Over there. There's a big pile of 'em. Oh man. Well, what a nice fellow. Lisa, did you see the Grammys? You beat Dexy's Midnight Runners! Well, you haven't heard the last of them. Miss you, Daddy. I miss you too, honey. Here's the champagne you ordered, Mr. Simpson. Oh. Thanks. Here. Wow! An award statue! Oh. It's a Grammy. Hey! Don't throw your garbage down here. Wow, look at all this Be Sharps merchandise! Lunch boxes, coffee mugs, funny foam... They took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous. But if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die. Bart! What? I can't believe you're not still popular. What'd you do... screw up like The Beatles and say you were bigger than Jesus? All the time. It was the title of our second album! But we were about to learn an iron law of show business: What goes up must come down. What about Bob Hope? He's been consistently popular for over 50 years. So has Sinatra. Well, anyway, we were all getting tired of-- Dean Martin still packs 'em in. Ditto Tom Jones. Shut up! With your father on the road all the time I tried to compensate for his absence... Hi, kids... I love Meanwhile, the group was having problems of its own... FOR ALL THE LATEST MEDICAL POOP / CALL SURGEON GENERAL, C. EVERETT KOOP / KOOP KOOP ADOOP This is worse than your song about Mr. T. I pity the fool who doesn't like... he. And wher's Barney? Oh, he's with his new girlfriend. The Japanese conceptual artist. Barbershop is in danger of growing stale. I'm taking it to strange new places. Number 8. Number 8. Number 8. Number 8. Number 8. Then came the day we knew we were finished. Gentlemen, US Magazine just came out with its ""What's Hot and What's Not Issue."" Are we hot? We are not. We all went our separate ways. Well William, I'm back. So, how did you spend your summer? I made millions in software and lost it at the track. Ach! It may not be glamorous, but it's good honest work. How much is this quart of milk? Twelve dollars. Hey, Barney, what'll it be? I'd like a beer Moe. I'd like a single plum floating in perfume, served in a man's hat. Here you go. Hey, fellas! I'm back. Ah that's great. Your replacement was getting tired. Hey, Queenie, you can go now. I'll give her a good home. And I did. I'll never forget my five-and-a-half weeks at the top. Man, that's some story. But there are still a few things I don't get. Like how come we never heard about this until today? Yeah, and what happened to the money you made? Why haven't you hung up your gold record? Since when could you write a song? There are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have to wait for another night. Now off to bed. I can't remember the last time we were all together. Last year on that stupid Dame Edna special. And a one and a two and a three... Ba bum bum bum... BABY ON BOARD / HOW I'VE ADORED / THAT SIGN ON MY CAR'S WINDOWPANE... Hello... Human Fly here... C'mon. I stayed up all night dying my underwear. Extra, extra! Be Sharps sing on rooftop! What? Gimme one of those! Wait a minute! There's nothing in here about the Be Sharps. Come back here! Haw haw! It's been done. Pretty, eh, Chief? It sure is, Lou... It sure is. Get the tear gas. ... IT'S A TRIP TO PARADISE / WITH MY BA-BY... ON BOARD! I'd like to thank you on behalf of the group, and I hope we passed the audition. I don't get it.","Mayor Joe Quimby, Paul Harvey, Sidekick, Carl Carlson, Snake Jailbird, Herman Hermann, Paper Boy, Talk Show Host, Chief Wiggum, Lou, Milhouse Van Houten, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, ""Just Stamp the Ticket"" Man, Marge Simpson, David Crosby, Nelson Muntz, Man, Crowd, Old Man, Homer Simpson, Quartet, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, Panicky Man, Angry Man, Groundskeeper Willie, SPEEDED UP VOICES, All, Rev.
