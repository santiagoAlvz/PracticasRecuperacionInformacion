148,149,"Milhouse, d'you ever think about the people in those cars? I try not to. It makes it harder to spit on 'em. Sometimes I wonder about all the people in this town. Do you think anything interesting ever happens to them? I mean, there must be thousands of great stories out there. What do you think, Milhouse? Milhouse? Hunh? Oh, sorry, I saw a convertible. You were saying? Forget it. C'mon, it's 11 o'clock. I need some sugar. I wish you'd come to my party, Apu. You could use some merriment! Listen, serving the customer is merriment enough for me. Thank you. Come again. You see? Most enjoyable. Oh, I guarantee a wing-ding of titanic proportions. You will be there or kindly be square. Well... I don't like to leave the store, but... For the next five minutes, I'm going to party like it's on sale for $19.99! Quick! Quick! No time to cook them -- they will plump in my stomach! Helloo, beautiful! No ring, I see. So, you are only arranged to be married. Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love this song. Let us boogie! I AM A FREAK-A-ZOID / COME ON AND WIND ME UP! Phew, I am hot. Let us get out of here. Don't worry, I'll tell everybody you were untouchable. Oh, Sanjay, never have I partied so hearty! Same time, next year, ya? Made it! And with one minute to spare! You took four minutes of my life and I want them back! Oh, I'd only waste 'em anyway... ""Swing Serenade"" is brought to you by Gorman's Ear Guards. Guard your ears... With Gorman's. Mom, Dad threw his beer can at the Miracle Gro guy on TV. Can I recycle it? Why not. Waaa! Uhh! There's gum in my hair! Mo-om! Someone threw gum in my hair! Are you sure? Maybe it's just shampoo. That washes right out. No, it's somebody's gross gum! Get it out! Ow! Ow! It's pulling out my hairs! Wait -- if I remember my Heloise, the trick to getting out gum is peanut butter. There. Now that gum should lift right out. Hmmm... Maybe it needs a little mayonnaise to get going. Okay, you go sit in the sun and let it melt in. Why me? Yuk! I smell like a sandwich. Gaaah! Smithers, what is the meaning of this slacking off? There's a bee in my eye, Sir. And? I'm allergic to bee-stings. They cause me to, um, die. But we're running out of forward momentum. Uh, perhaps you could pedal for just a little while, sir? Quite impossible. I can try to bat him off if you like. Really, that's oka-- Aaaggh! Holy cats, man, we're starting to wobble! Get me... to a hospital. You have... to pedal. Oh, Tuttle's Sunday trousers! Fear not, I'll get you to a hospital, the only way I know how. Smithers, you infernal ninny! Stick your left hoof on that flange now! Now if you can get it through your bug-addled brain, jam that second mephitic clod-hopper of yours on the right doo-dad! Now pump those scrawny chicken legs, you stuporous funker! One more jostle, you wretched shirkaday! Help me. Holy smokes! You need booze! Hi, everybody! Hi, Dr. Nick. Dr. Nick, this malpractice committee has received a few complaints against you. Of the 160 gravest charges, the most troubling are: performing major operations with a knife and fork from a seafood restaurant-- But I cleaned them with my napkin! ...misuse of the cadavers-- I get here earlier when I drive in the car-pool lane... There's a crazy man with a scalpel in E.R.! He's demanding to see a quack! Hi, everybody. Now tell Dr. Nick where is the trouble. I'm edgy! I got ants in my pants! I'm discombobulated! Get me a calmative! Slow down, sir! You're going to give yourself skin failure. Okay. Now, the symptoms you describe point to ""bonus eruptus."" It's a terrible disorder where the skeleton tries to leap out the mouth and escape the body. Now you're talkin'. Our one chance is trans-dental electromicide. I'll need a golf-cart motor with a 1000 volt capacimator, stat! Doctor, I can't in good conscie-- Now! Now! There's no time, man! We'll have to improvise. Keep doing that every five seconds. Dr. Nick, we owe you an apology. Consider the charges dropped. All right! Free nose jobs for everybody! Yiy! You first. Give me a Van Heflin. Say, ah, Barn. Remember when I said I'd have to send away to NASA to calculate your bar tab? Oh yeah, we all had a good laugh, Moe. The results came back today. You owe me... 70 billion dollars. No, wait, wait, wait... Oh, that's uh, for the Voyager Space Craft. Your tab's 14 billion dollars. Well, alls I got is two thousand bucks. Well, that's halfway there. Huh. Freeze, dude. Move a muscle and I'll blow this wino's head off. I'm behind three inches of bullet-proof glass. Do your worst. All right. No! Stay outta there! Stay outta there! Aw, Good God, no!! Whoa, goodbye student loan payments! Ha-ha! Come back here, you stinkin' -- Hey, I wonder how much air is in here. Well, Seymour, I made it -- despite your directions. Ah, Superintendent Chalmers, welcome. I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon. Yeah. Oh, ye Gods! My roast is ruined! But what if... I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking? Ooh, delightfully devilish, Seymour. SKI-I-NER / WITH HIS CRAZY EXPLANATIONS / THE SUPERINTENDENT'S / GONNA NEED HIS MEDICATION / WHEN HE HEARS SKINNER'S LAME EXAGGERATIONS / THERE'LL BE TROUBLE IN TOWN TONIGHT! Sey-mour!! Superintendent! I was just... eh... stretching my calves on the windowsill! Isometric exercise. Care to join me? Why is there smoke coming out of your oven, Seymour? Ah... oh, that isn't smoke. It's steam. Steam from the steamed clams we're having. Mmmm, steamed clams. Superintendent, I hope you're ready for mouth-watering hamburgers! I thought we were having steamed clams. No, no. I said ""steamed hams."" That's what I call hamburgers. You call hamburgers ""steamed hams?"" Yes. It's a regional dialect. Uh-huh. What region? Uh, Upstate New York. Really. Well, I'm from Utica and I've never heard anyone use the phrase ""steamed hams."" Oh, not in Utica, no. It's an Albany expression. I see. Y'know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones they have at Krustyburger. Oh, no. Patented Skinnerburgers. Old family recipe. For ""steamed hams."" Yes. Yes. And you call them steamed hams despite the fact they are obviously grilled? Y... you know... one thing I sho... Excuse me for one second. Of course. Ahh. Well, that was wonderful. A good time was had by all. I'm pooped. Yes, I should be -- Good Lord! What is happening in there? Aurora borealis. Aurora borealis?! At this time of year? At this time of day? In this part of the country? Localized entirely within your kitchen? Yes. May I see it? No. Seymour, the house is on fire! No, Mother, it's just the Northern Lights. Well, Seymour, you are an odd fellow, but I must say -- you ""steam a good ham."" Help! Help! Helms Calls for Donut Tax?! There. Done and done. Oh, why did I have to stop at the railroad tracks? Better get some change. It's okay. It's okay. I'm back. See, Daddy's here. C'mon, Maggie, maybe if you just squeeze a little... That's it, that's it, I... Okay. Okay. Think, Homer... ... The dog! Okay! Go, boy! Go find help! Go find help, boy! Oh, bad dog! Bad dog! Oh, don't worry, Maggie! I'll think of something! You know, I went to the McDonald's in, uh, Shelbyville on Friday night. The McWhat? Uh, McDonald's Restaurant. I... I never heard of it either, but they have over 2,000 locations in this state alone. Musta sprung up overnight. You know the funniest thing, though? It's the little differences. Example? Well, in McDonald's you can buy a Krustyburger with Cheese, right?, but they don't call it a Krustyburger with Cheese. Get out--! What do they call it? Quarter Pounder with Cheese. ""Quarter Pounder with Cheese."" Well, I can picture the cheese... But, uh, do they have Krusty Partially-Gelatinated Non-Dairy Gum-Based Beverages? Mmm-hmm. They call 'em ""shakes."" Heh. ""Shakes."" You don't know what you're gettin'. Well, I know what I'm gettin': some donuts. Uh, help me outta the booth, boys. Ai, que dia miserable a trabajo! Primero, el attaque del woodpeckero loco! Luego, un disastro de electricidad! E Finalmente, una catastrofia con una pelota de beisbol! Ahh, tiempo para relaxar en paz y quieto ...

This is the spot -- right here. That's a good boy. Good boy. Do your dirty, sinful business. Howdy, Reverend Lovejoy. Nice to see you there ... on my lawn... with your dog. Oh, uh, uh, ooh... bad dog. Look at that. Right on Ned's lawn. Now how could you do such a thing? Good boy, don't stop now. Bad dog! I condemn you to hell! Better get the ol' snow shovel back from Homer, huh? Good boy. Don't stop the music. Marge Simpson -- still making juice the old-fashioned way? No, I've got gum in my hair! Oh, we've tried everything. Olive oil, lemon juice, tartar sauce, chocolate syrup, gravy, bacon fat, hummus and baba ghanouj... My scalp hurts from horsefly bites. Why don't you freeze it with an ice cube and hit it with a hammer? Works for me when I get bubbly-gum in the ol' push-broom. That sounds okay... Ah! Ah! Ah! Stop! Stop! Hmm. I seem to have mashed more hair into it. Oh well. Ice cubes are useless, man. Chewin' gum's gotta be chewed out. Does the whole town have to hear about this? Arrr, have ye tried a Baltic squid? They can suck the bolts out of a submarine's hull. All right! Fangoria will give me twenty-five bucks for this shot. I can give you the name of a good gum-and-hair man. I have a word of advice: don't try to dig gum out with a bone. It just makes things worse. Leave it in as evidence. Bazooka Joe's got deep pockets. Perhaps I can help. My poppa is foreman of the Dusseldorf Gum-Works. SOME FOLK'LL NEVER EAT A SKUNK / BUT THEN AGAIN, SOME FOLK'LL... / LIKE CLETUS THE SLACK-JAWED YOKEL. Hey, whut's goin' on on this side?

Hey, I could call my maw while I'm up here. Hey, maw! Get off the dang roof! ...Yes, and one with extra cheese. Thank you. Can I use your bathroom? No, you may not. The bathroom is for paying customers only. If you purchase an item, you may use the bathroom. Umm...Okay. Um, how about that? That is a rare photo of Sean Connery signed by Roger Moore. It is worth one hundred and fifty dollars. Oh, what can I get for seventy-five cents? You may purchase this charming Hamburglar Adventure. A child has already solved the jumble using crayons. The answer is ""fries."" Milhouse, what's going on?! You said you just needed to use the bathroom. Now, I find you buying comics! Oh, our transaction is completed. You may take the boy. Waaaait! As soon as Zed gets here, the party will begin. There he is now. Who are you? Uh, can my son use your bathroom? You gotta say yes! Okay, but be quick. It's in back. Ah... So... Uh... nice store. Uh, you know, when I was a kid, this used to be a pet store. Yeah, right over there against that wall, there was the cutest little- Get in the corner. Hey, Dad, can we get this, please? Ohmigosh! Sorry, Mister! Want me to cut off the gum or just style it? Cut it off, but be careful. Don't worry, sweetheart, I know how important hair is to a little girl.

Do you find something comical about my appearance when I am driving my automobile? Yeah. Everyone needs to drive a vehicle, even the very tall. This was the largest auto that I could afford. Should I therefore be made the subject of fun? I guess so. Would you like it if I laughed at your misfortune? Huh?! Maybe we should find out. Now march! Hey, everybody, look at this! It's that boy who laughs at everyone! Let's laugh at him! Haw haw! Wave to the people! Blow them kisses! Wah wah! Well, Milhouse, I guess interesting stuff does happen to people in Springfield. Yep, everybody in town's got their story to tell. There's just not enough time to hear 'em all... Oh, sorry I'm late. There was trouble at the lab, with the running and the exploding and the crying. One of the monkeys stole the glasses off my head. No, wait, please, no! Please! I have a funny story -- if you listen -- I even wrote theme music! Yeah, listen! HEY, HEY / PROFESSOR FRINK / PROFESSOR FRINK / HE'LL MAKE YOU LAUGH / HE'LL MAKE YOU THINK / HE LIKES TO RUN AND THEN THE THING WITH THE... PERSON -- Ah, boy, that monkey's gonna pay...
