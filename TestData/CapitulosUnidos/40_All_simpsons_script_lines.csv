39,40,"Here's good news. According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate. Dad, I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and Larry King. Hey, this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine. ""To me bestest bud Milhouse, Happy Birthday, Bart."" Bart, that's so sweet. May I see the card? Hey there ten-year old. I couldn't afford to get you a new drum... ""...so how about a nice pair of bongos?"" Ewww. C'mon, open it open it open it. Uh, maybe a little later, Bart. Aw Milhouse, just cuz your mom didn't let you have a party doesn't mean you can't get a present. We had a lovely time on Saturday, Milhouse. I liked the balloons. I liked the party hats. What are you girls talkin' about? Nothing. Twins. Open your present. They're official Krusty the Clown walkie-talkies. I'll keep one and you keep one. Now whenever you want to talk to me, just call me on the phone and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie. Milhouse, I'd like to express my appreciation for Saturday. Jelly bean baskets, personalized noisemakers -- those little touches are what made it enduring. What's he talkin' about? Uh... hey, look at that dog. Isn't that somethin'? Wow, brown! Whoa, Springfield Elementary, last stop. Oh, and by the way, I'd like to say thanks, and 'applause, applause' to 'birthday boy' Milhouse for his totally bitchin' party on Saturday. And uh, Milhouse, I think I left my pants on your roof. You did have a party. You didn't invite me. And I thought we were best friends. Sorry, Bart. Bye little dudes. Don't learn anything I wouldn't learn. Ah, Monday morning. Time to pay for your two days of debauchery, you hung-over drones. T.G.I.M., Sir. Yeah. so, what did you do this weekend, Smithers? Well, I caught up on my laundry. And wrote a letter to mother. Oh, here's the kicker, I took Hercules out to be clipped. Who the devil is Hercules? He's my Yorkshire terrier, sir. He's kind of tiny, so... you know, it's a joke. Here's a picture of Herkie. Well, Smithers, don't you know how to paint the town red. May I ask how you spent your weekend? Well, a bit overly familiar, but I'll allow it. I took in a movie. An appalling little piece of filth. Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird. Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time. What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets. Sounds like my kind of flick. And how. Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple. Otto! Welcome! Apu! Hey, got a ba-ad case of the munchies, man. Time for a Heat-lamp Dog. Oh, Otto. Otto, did you know there's a small child inside your bus? Ooo, good thing you warned me. I was on my way to Mexico. Call me old-fashioned, but movies were sexier when the actors kept their clothes on. Vilma Banky could do more for me with one raised eyebrow than an entire... Warning. Problem in sector 7-G. 7-G? Good God, who's the safety inspector there? Homer Simpson, sir. Simpson, eh? Good man? Intelligent? Actually sir, he was hired under ""Project Bootstrap."" Thank you, President Ford. Huh? Noise. Bad noise! Five minutes before critical mass. Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don't panic. Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they know how to handle it. Huh? AHHH!! It's my problem! We're doomed!!! Sector 7-G is now being isolated. My best friend shafted me. I'll never get over this, Otto-man. Aw, sure you will. You know, once my old lady ran off and married my brother. Well, it hurt, but here it is a month later and I'm sleeping on their couch. Margarita, I want you. Mr. Devereaux, I can't work under these conditions. Have it your way baby. You're fired. Oh, Avery. Call me Mr. Devereaux, will you. We interrupt Search for the Sun for this special news bulletin... Meltdown crisis: The first couple of minutes. Forget the hair, just give me the blush. Oh, we're on. This station has just learned that a serious crisis is in progress at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Oh my Lord! On the line with us now is plant owner C. Montgomery Burns. Mr. Burns? Oh hello, Kent. Right now, skilled nuclear energy technicians are calmly correcting a minor, piffling malfunction. But, I can assure you and the public that there is absolutely no danger whatsoever -- -- things couldn't be more ship-shape. Sir, where's my radiation suit? How the hell should I know? Uh, Mr. Burns, people are calling this a meltdown. Oh, meltdown is one of those annoying buzzwords. I prefer to call it an unrequested fission surplus. Homie, please be all right. Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT. Uh-huh. It's as fat as a phone book! ""Congratulations on your purchase of a Fissionator 1952 Slow Fission Reactor. Get to the point, man! Ooh, what's this? Who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated! Ninety seconds to core meltdown. Sir, there may never be another time to say... I love you, sir. Oh, hot dog. Thank you for making my last few moments on earth socially awkward. Looks like this is the end. That's all right. I couldn't have led a richer life. After the meltdown we can expect roving bands of thieves to tie up traffic for ours. I don't like this program. Change the channel. Wheel of Fortune! I don't understand anything! When they look up stupid in the dictionary, there'll be a picture of me! Dear Lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, I'll try to be a better Christian. I don't know what I can do... Ummm, oooh, the next time there's a canned food drive I'll give the poor something they'd actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix. One minute to core meltdown. Shut up! Simpson, it's all up to you. It's showtime! Okay, okay, think back to your training... Now Homer, this may very well save your life one day. This, Homer... Yes. Please pay attention. This button here controls the emergency override circuit. In the event of a meltdown, push this button and only this button. Ooh, a side. Simpson? What? Do you see which button I'm pushing? Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it. This is all your fault! Okay, gotta pick a button. Pick a button. Pick a button. Uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... No, wait! Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? No, no! Thirty seconds to core meltdown. Oh, Smithers, I guess there's nothing left but to kiss my sorry butt good-bye! May I, sir? These unfortunate people here will be instantly killed. This circle, which I am sad to say we are in, will experience a slower, considerably more painful death. Good Lord. They called me old-fashioned for teaching the duck and cover. But who's laughing now? Fifteen seconds to core meltdown. Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe. All systems returning to normal. Danger in 7-G neutralized. Have a nice day. Will I ever see you again? Sure, baby. Next meltdown. I'd like to solve the puzzle: ""Three loins in the fountain."" Yes, we've isolated the problem and wouldn't you know? False alarm. It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system. Very good. Well sir, your point about nuclear hysteria is well taken. This reporter promises to be more trusting and less vigilant in the future. Excellent. Well, ""ta"". Hmmm, Smithers, I can still sell 'em snake oil. Now bring me a wine spritzer -- and don't be stingy with the vino. Yes sir. So, Smithers, it seems you've underestimated one Homer Simpson... our next Employee-of-the-Month. Milhouse, a little salt? Sure. Now we're even for your party. C'mon, let's go play. Bart, my mom won't let me be your friend anymore. That's why you couldn't come to the party. What's she got against me? She says you're a bad influence. Bad influence my ass! How many times have I told you, never listen to your mother! But Bart, she threatened to cut off my allowance. Whatever she's paying you, I'll double it. I'm really sorry, Bart. Sir, about Employee-of-the-Month... I-I-if you'll recall, I'm the one who put a five percent ceiling on the Keogh Plan, which saved this company -- Smithers, you bean counter, give it up! Simpson's my man! Hey, way to save our lives. Yeah, we owe you one. Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button. Simpson -- Monty Burns. Come with me. Now, now. That will do. Homer, for your bravery and skill, we award you this ham, this plaque, this discount coupon book, and my own personal thumbs up! And to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our Wall of Fame... Oh, and uh, what's this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. Magic Johnson! Y'ello. Is this really Homer Simpson? Yeah. Wow. Homer, I just used our last time out to call and congratulate you on diverting that nuclear holocaust. Well, thank you. Magic, if you play on that ankle, you'll be in incredible pain. I don't care. Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky? Don't worry. Sooner or later people like that are exposed as the frauds they are. Thanks, Magic. Bart, you're not laughing. Too subtle? Nah. I'm just depressed. Milhouse's mom won't let me play with him any more. Homer, did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham? And what's all this? ""For heroic competence... for narrowly averting a melt-down and proving, without question, that nuclear power is completely safe... Employee-of-the-Month!"" Ohh, Homer! A role model in my very own home. How convenient. Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don't need it here at home. How are you enjoying your ham, Homie? It tastes so bitter. It's like ashes in my mouth! Hmm, it's actually more of a honey glaze -- Maybe you ate a clove. What's your problem, boy? I had a fight with Milhouse. That four-eyes with the big nose? You don't need friends like that. How Zen. What? What is it? What are you doing? Looking at you with quiet awe. Well, as long as it's quiet. Milhouse to Bart, Milhouse to Bart... Please don't hate me. Please? Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he'll never know who did it. Ah Simpson! There's someone I want you to meet. Aristotle Amadopolis, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power facility. Huh? Wha?... It seems Ari's been having terrible worker problems at Shelbyville. They've lost their zest for work. You must help them find their Eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve! Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what? Yeah. We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of Homer Simpsons. But I really can't tell them anything, sir. Oh cut the false modesty, it's getting tiresome. Besides, it's your duty. Employee of the Month isn't all ham and plaques. Well! Smithers, how kind of you to pay us a visit. Couldn't help it, sir. The parking here is terrible. This man has no love for his power plant. Begone from my sight. That one's always been a problem. One... two... three... Community chest. Nah. Nah. Ah. I've won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect ten bucks. Ha ha! You're losing. Bart, don't feed your sister hotels! Don't worry mom, there's tons of these things. I think that game is too old for her. Why don't you go play with Milhouse? I don't wanna play with Milhouse. You mean you still haven't made up with him? It's his mom. She says I'm a bad influence. C'mon Maggie, let's go throw rocks at that hornet's nest. Mrs. Van Houten, I'm Bart's mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint. I remember. Please, come in. Marge, I'm sorry, but I think it would be better if Milhouse didn't see your son. Look, I know Bart can be a handful but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things... Well, Marge, the other day, Milhouse told me my meatloaf sucks. He must have gotten that from your little boy, because they certainly don't say that word on TV! Well, I can't defend everything he does. But let's face it, all Bart and Milhouse have is each other. They're too young for girls. And they're a popular target for bullies. And in the Christmas pageant, they're always sheep. Please, please, let them be friends! I'll think about it, Marge. So the next time somebody tells you county folk are good, honest people, you can spit in their faces for me! I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick. Oh, that's sweet. I used to follow my dad to a lot of bars too. Here you go. One beer, one chocolate milk. Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk. Oh. What's the matter, Homer? The depressin' effects of alcohol usually don't kick in 'til closing time. He's just a little nervous. He has to give a speech tomorrow on ""How To Keep Cool In A Crisis."" What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody. Did it work? I'm a free man, ain't I? Milhouse to Bart, do you want to come over and play? Really? We can be friends again? Did your mom die? Uh, I don't think so. Who cares?! Milhouse, I'll be right there! Sorry Maggie, game's over. Hey Mom, I'm friends with Milhouse again. Well, I knew his mother would come to her senses.. Thanks for sticking up for me. What makes you think I did it? Who else would? You be good. I will. As I look out into this sea of smiling faces, I am filled with a sense of loathing and revulsion. You are not workers, you are a pack of mangy cud-chewing ugly goats! Well, you're in for a treat. We have with us today a real man. Behold the glory that is Homer Simpson! Uh... ladies and... gentlemen... Just picture them in their underwear. Um, Grace under pressure is no... Three minutes to meltdown. Whew! Saved by the bell. Fifteen seconds to core meltdown. Just do what you did before. All right. Eeenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe... If he hollers let him go, eenie meenie minee moe. Crisis has been averted. Everything is super. Thank you Homer for saving my plant with that idiotic rhyming. Do you even know what button you pushed? Sure. Moe. Eenie meenie minee moe / Is Homer a hero? / The answer is... no. I'm Kent Brockman and that was... My Two Cents. Now back to Scott Christian with Laugh and a Half. Thanks, Kent. There was more dumb luck in the news today when our own Police Chief Wiggum foiled a bank hold-up without even trying. It seems the chief had come to the bank to cash in his penny jar. ...48, 49, 50. Good work, Chief. Just doing my job. Yes, it seems the chief pulled a Homer Simpson of his own. Whoa! Huh? A pretzel? Wow, looks like I pulled a Homer! The Lakers have the ball. Magic Johnson's coming down the floor on a fast break. Magic stops. His feet slip out from under him. The ball flies out of his hand, hits the referee in the head, goes in the basket! It's a three point play. The Lakers win! Looks like I pulled a Homer. Our dad... now he belongs to the ages.","Terri Mackleberry, Female Worker, Security Guard, Carl Carlson, Thought Bubble Barney, Waylon Smithers, Magic Johnson, SCOTT, Chief Wiggum, Program Voices, Milhouse Van Houten, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Aristotle, Kent Brockman, Contestant, Homer Simpson, Sherri Mackleberry, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, C.
