193,197,"Homer Simpson, you stand accused of eating half the population of the Planet of the Donuts. As Homer's defense attorney I feel we should be merciful-- hey! Did you just take a bite out of me? Uh, Maybe. I sentence you to death! Mmmmm... Homer. Homer, wake up! It's time for our coffee break. Yep, I earned it. Mmmm, donuts. There's only one donut left! Yeah and you drooled all over it, ya-- Gentlemen, there's only one solution. We place this last donut in the reactor core, exposing it to radiation, thereby making it big. Yeah, it worked on my hand. Oh, wait, it's this hand. Whoa! Uh, sir, we've found the problem. Some idiot threw this in the reactor core. Success! You did this? How could you be so irresponsible? It's my first day. Since I've never seen you before, maybe it is your first day. Very well, carry on. Uh, sir, that's Homer Simpson. He's been working here for ten years. Oh, really? Why did you think you could lie to me? It's my first day. Well, why didn't you say- Whoa! You're fired! Fired. I can't believe it. Next, on Exploitation Theater: ""Blackula,"" followed by ""Blackenstein."" And the ""Blunch Black of Blotre Blame."" Ooh, funky. But first, this word. Daybreak. Jakarta. The proud men and women of the Navy are fighting for freedom. But you're in Lubbock, Texas, hosing stains off a monument. You're in the Naval Reserve. America's seventeenth line of defense, between the Mississippi National Guard and the League of Women Voters. After basic training you'll only have to work one weekend a month. And most of that time you're drunk off your ass! You know Lisa, I've taken a lot from this country. Maybe it's time I gave something back. Are you thinking of joining the Naval Reserve? Would you be proud of me? Eh, sort of. Then I'll do it! Just fill out this form and you're on your way to the Reserve. There's a question that's crossed out. Well, due to a recent presidential order, we're not allowed to ask that particular question. Well, I think I can make it out. ""Are you a homosex..."" For God's sake, don't answer that! I could go to jail! But I'm not a h-- La la la la la la la! I am not listening! La la la la la la la la! Nice fella. I wonder if he's gay? Homie, I really don't think this navy thing is a good idea. What if you get called into combat? Not to worry, honey. We live in a highly technological age, where fighting a war is as simple as turning off a light. We don't have a Clapper. Sorry, can't hear you, Marge. I'm clapping. Nighty-night! Well, guys, I won't be seeing you for a while. Where are you going? I've joined the naval reserve. Well, I'm not gonna let anything happen to my best friend. I'm joining too. Well, I'm not gonna let anything happen to my two best customers. I'm joining too. And although my religion strictly forbids military service -- what the hey, I'm in too. Gee, thanks guys. This is just like ""The Deer Hunter."" ""The Deer Hunter?"" Uh... hah... That reminds me. Didi mau! Didi mau! I'm sorry guys. We're shuttin' down for a while. Sorry. See ya in a week. Good luck, Dad. Although I am morally opposed to the military-industrial complex of which you are now a part. Aw, that's sweet, honey. I'll bring you back a hat. Hey, Homer, bring me back a torpedo. No. But Flanders got his kids torpedoes. Oh, he did, did he? I'll show him! I'll bring you a weapon of unimaginable destructive power! Homer! But only if you're good. Even if you're not. All right you thumb-sucking worms, let's get one thing straight. Your mamas ain't here to help you! Mine is. No way, man! My hair is who I am! I'm a freak! What the--? Tuck in that shirt -- shine those shoes, mister -- oh, for the love of -- Uh, a seagull took my sailor hat. All right, Simpson. I don't like you and you don't like me -- I like you. Um, all right. You like me, but I don't like you! Maybe you would like me if you got to know me. What are you, a comedian? Well, I'm no Margaret Cho, but I do a pretty fair Columbo impression. Ah, one more thing - One- I should get a glass of water. There! The perfect sheepshank. Very nice, Simpson. But next time tie the other end to the ship! Ulll..... Congratulations, sailors, you're all in the Naval Reserve! Congratulations! You are all pastry chefs! Congratulations! You are all World War I Historical Re-creationists! Uh-oh...Uh-oh...Etc. Hey, Bart, check out my new earring! Pretty cool, huh? Milhouse, my mom wears earrings -- do you think she's cool? No, I think she's hot! Sorry, it just slipped out. Hey, look, Milhouse has an earring! Milhouse! Milhouse! Milhouse! Hey, if you want cool, check this out. EVERYBODY IF YOU CAN DO THE BARTMAN! SHAKE YOUR BODY TURN IT OUT IF YOU CAN CAN DO THE BARTMAN YEAH! That is so 1991. Young man, the school dress code specifically forbids the wearing of earrings... unless you're of gypsy extraction. Uh, I'm a gypsy. Oh, really? Prove it. Uh... I vant to suck your blood. Nuh-uh, that's a vampire! But, uh, they're also covered. Carry on. Request permission to come aboard. Permission granted. Marge! I lost this eye in Haiti. I was drinking a Mai Tai and forgot to take the little parasol out. That's not a war story! I'll tell you a war story! I was on PT one oh nine with John F. Kennedy. I was the first to discover his terrible secret. Ich bin ein Berliner. He's a Nazi! Get him! And another thing! When people come up to me and say ""Hey, Little Buddy,"" and hit me over the head with a hat - that's not funny! That hurts! Stop laughing at me! You know Marge, joining the reserves was the best thing I ever did. I feel good about myself, I'm helping my country, and later, I'm gonna get Gilligan's autograph. I'm so proud of you, Homie. Then I'll whomp him with my hat. Can I help you? I'd like to get my ear pierced. Well, better make it quick, kiddo. In five minutes this place is becoming a Starbucks. Hello everybody. Sparkle sparkle. Bart! An earring? How rebellious in a conformist sort of way. What on earth possessed you to get an earring? Milhouse has one. If Milhouse jumped off a cliff-- Milhouse jumped off a cliff? I'm there! Get back here, boy! You're a disgrace to this family and its proud Naval tradition! Well, I'm keeping this earring and you can't stop me! I always thought Lisa would be the one to get her ears pierced. Can I? No! Time to reap the benefits of being cool. I don't believe this! Everyone's got an earring! My neck hurts and my ear hurts. I have two ow-ees. Next weekend we're having our annual war games. Now Simpson, because of your many years as a nuclear technician we're putting you on a nuclear sub. Nu-cue-lar. It's pronounced NU-cue-lar. Be careful, Dad. Oh, Lisa, it's just war games. It's not like a game could hurt me. Damn you, rock'em sock'em robots! Can't we all just get along? Are you sure you'll be okay? We have orders not to fire on anybody but Greenpeace. Well, I guess that's everyone. Except earring-boy. Come on, Dad. Didn't you ever do anything wild when you were a kid? Well, when I was ten I got my ear pierced but this is completely different! Fine. Take it. Attention on deck! Captain Tenille wishes to address you! I'm a man of few words! Any questions? Uh, is the poopdeck really what I think it is? I like the cut of your jib. What's a jib? Promote that man. The Navy has a fine sense of tradition. Whenever an American vessel leaves port, the crew sings this ancient sea shanty. A One! A Two! A Three! A Four! You hear that? The whales are hungry. Homer! Join us. Thank you. Tell me, young man. What do you want out of life? I want peas. We all want peace. But it's always just out of reach. Uh-huh. So what's the best way to get peace? With a knife. Exactly. Not with the olive branch but the bayonet. Ah Simpson, you're like the son I never had. And you're like the father I never visit. Sir, I was running a diagnostic, and there was an obstruction in torpedo tube number one. I'll take care of it. Oh, what the Hell -- Simpson, while I'm gone, you're in command. Me? Him? Yes. Maybe it's the salt water in my veins, or the nitrogen bubbles in my brain, but I've taken a real shine to you. Seaman, open that torpedo tube! You'll never get a response talking to my son like that. You gotta poke him with a stick. I don't wanna go to school today. Oh for God's sake. Contraband! Ooh, comfy. Homer, we've got an enemy sub closing in fast. What do we do? I'unno. Fifteen seconds to collision. We need a decision! Hmm. What would the Captain say in my spot? Don't fire the torpedoes. Fire the torpedoes! Auggh! We've been hit by an officer! If they're gonna fire on us, we'll respond in kind! Fire! Not me! A torpedo! We're losin' power! We're losing back-up power! We're down to mood lightin', here! All right, all right, mellow out, everybody. The Captain'll know what to do. You just shot the Captain outta the torpedo tube. Arrr! That means you're in charge, Homer. I am? Those were the orders. Very well then. I'm a Captain. Mr. Moe -- steady as she goes! Aye aye ya big dummy. Ehhh...what a dummy. Damage report, Mr. Moe. Sonar, out. Navigation, out. Radio, out. Enough of what's out! What's in? Ice-blended mocha drinks and David Schwimmer. Yes, he is handsome in an ugly sort of way. Captain, how are we supposed to get home with no equipment? Don't worry, I've been working on it. Hm... yes... uh huh... carry the two... All right. I can't waste any more time. People's lives are depending on me. Mr. Sulu -- make a left! Aye, aye, Captain. Setting course for Rigel 7... I mean, home. That's it. Left. Left. Steady as she goes. On second thought, go right. Well, sir, treason season started early this year as a nuclear sub was hijacked by local man Homer Simpson. Oh my God! I told him that photo would come back to haunt him. Could Homer Simpson be a communist? His father spoke out on his behalf. My Homer is not a Communist. He may be a liar, a pig, an idiot, a Communist... but he is not a porn star. It's over there. The Soviet Union will be pleased to offer amnesty to your wayward wessel. The Soviet Union? I thought you guys broke up. Yes, that's what we wanted you to think! Must crush capitalism! Children, I'll be frank. In the event of nuclear war, we can only save our best and brightest. Therefore, space in the fallout shelter will be reserved for Lisa Simpson, Martin Prince, our championship kickball team, and Sherri, but not Terri. Haw haw! Captain, the renegade sub is directly below us. Drop the depth charges. We'll either destroy it or force it to surface. Oh my God! We're all gonna die! Y'ello. Mayday! Mayday! The engine room has sprung a leak! It's filling up with a clear, non-alcoholic liquid. You mean water? Yeah, that's it. We've got a pinhole leak and there's no way to plug it! I guess that's it. Ladies and gentlemen... We're in a tough spot and I don't know if we're gonna get out. Please remain calm and think of your loved ones. Oh, Mr. Snookims. Oh, I wuv you so. What are you lookin' at!? Hey, this stupid machine took my money! Don't ever change. Sparkle sparkle! Bart! Pinhole leak. Dad, the earring could plug the hole. I'll plug your hole. I mean, eureka! You saved us, Homer. Mr. Moe, prepare to surface. You wanna stop calling me Mr. Moe? No. Attention, Homer Simpson! You have ten seconds to explain your actions before we open fire! Uhhh... it's my first day! Es mi dia primero. Wuo gang kai shuchun gong chuo Quack quack quack. Seaman Simpson, your actions have given the Navy a black eye from which it may never recover. I would throw the book at you, but I've been indicted in the Tailhook Scandal. Goodbye. I too would punish you, but I'm under indictment for accepting bribes from military contractors. Um, I torpedoed a Carnival Cruise Ship. Impersonating the First Lady. I think you're off the hook. Woo hoo! A dishonorable discharge! It's the best we could've hoped for. You can't spell ""dishonorable"" without ""honorable."" I think you're a hero, Dad. Well, I couldn't have done it without Bart. Boy, I guess I was wrong about that earring. It saved us all. Then can I get a tattoo that says, ""Bite Me?"" You never know when it might come in handy. I don't think so, son. A king cobra? No. Weapons-grade plutonium? Ask your mother. Knock-out drops? No. Ninja death stars? Maybe for Christmas.","Ralph Wiggum, Carl Carlson, Thought Bubble Barney, Young Grampa, Waylon Smithers, Admiral #3, Milhouse Van Houten, WORLD WAR I RECREATIONISTS, Admiral #1, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Head Instructor, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Head Chef, Thought Bubble Bart, Other Kids, Vet, Kent Brockman, Homer Simpson, Big Hand Guy, Grampa Simpson, Naval Announcer, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, Admiral #4, C.
