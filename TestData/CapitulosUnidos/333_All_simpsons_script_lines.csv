329,333,"I don't understand this game, Bart. How come we have to rake your lawn, while you just get to sit there? Because I'm ""it."" Now, whoever finishes first gets a lemonade... Yay! ...for me. Later, when we wash his bike, I'm not gonna do a good job. I'm telling Mr. Bart! Shhh! Hey, guys. Uh-oh. Girls. You guys need your cootie shots. Well, I hate this job, but I love the health plan. Okay, ladies. Don't you have a poodle to dress up? Fine, we'll go. We'll find some other way to entertain our boy-crazy cousin who thinks you're cute. I wouldn't mind pushin' that in the mud. Homer drunk... but how? Hmmm... 'Round and 'round the bottle twirls, I hope it stops on one of the girls. I hope you like the taste of ringworm medicine. Eww! I kissed that sad, weird kid! My beer! You never had a chance to become my urine! Why you little... My first kiss... Stop it, Homer! There's only one way to settle this -- in Simpson family court. What the hell's that? I got the idea from a now-discredited book on raising children. Now up, the case of Simpson v. Simpson. Mr. Simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss? Do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son's little league team? Permission to treat this witness as hostile. Homer, I'll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers, kissin' girls and tippin' dinosaurs. Your father's first kiss was in high school -- with me. Actually, Marge... uh... there uh, was someone before you. It was years ago, when I was ten. Back in the '60s, or '50s, or maybe it was the early '70s... ""Underprivileged?"" You pretended we were poor just to get me into camp? Uh, yeah, pretended. Hey, you must be Homer! I'm Lenny, and this is Carl. Wow, a Negro! We prefer the term ""black."" So cool. Heya, fellas! I'm Moe. I'm your junior counselor. Moe's not really a counselor. His parents dropped him off here like, two years ago and they never came back for him. I sleep under upside-down canoes. That's the girls' camp, right over there. I can't wait to meet the girls! Whaa?! That's right, you're workin' in the kitchen. That's how our camp pays the bills. What bills? We got no water, no heat... we catch our own breakfast... Twelve kids died at our camp. We need the money to pay lawyers. I thought we were gonna play fun games at camp. Oh, here's one. It's called ""Stay Outta My Way."" Idiot. Oh, no! My retainer! I got it! Ooo la la, a girl with teeth. Me like! Oh, thank you! You sound so sweet. That's 'cause I've eaten sixteen pieces of pie. You know, doing dishes has been the best part of camp. Really? Why? Because I talked to you. I couldn't see her through the flaps. But she's my kinda girl... Tell us more about the flaps. To me they were the rubbery gates of heaven, because behind them was the girl of my dreams. Oh man, some day love will come slidin' down my chute. Well, I can ask if she has any friends, 'cause she wants to meet me tonight. Way to go. Outta sight! Now Homer, if you're gonna go, you'd better take some protection. Ooh, a switchblade. I see the switch, but where's the blade? Found it. An eye patch? But I've got a date tonight! Don't worry, chicks love that kind of thing -- patches, scars, stumps... Everything but zits. All right, how should I get there? Hm, I guess it's row versus wade. And it's my right to choose. Are ye lookin' to cross the lake which separates ye from she? Who are you? The sailing instruct-arrr! And on movie night I run the project-arrr! Only P.G., nothin' R. Yarrr. I couldn't believe my eye. She was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. Uh... until I met your mother, who made that girl look like a Godzilla made of garbage. Homer, that girl was me! How romantic. You and Dad were drawn to each other as kids and you didn't even realize it. Yes... and then your father broke my heart. And if I'd known he was you, I never would have married you! Oh, this is so confusing. I'd like a brief recess. Granted. Whee! Recess! Let me get this straight. When you were my age, you had the hots for Mom and didn't even know it? That's cool. Or is it lame? I guess I'll go with lame. You're lame. Why? Because I only kissed one girl in my whole life? That's still one more than you. I've kissed three girls. I'm so lame! You're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while. Well, that stinks. But I still get to kiss you, right? Mom, why are you so mad? I'll start from the beginning. The girls' camp was focused on teaching etiquette and deportment. Now that I've captured your interest, let me continue... By summer's end, I promise you will all walk like ladies, talk like ladies, and hold your liquor like ladies. Now, chin up. Head back. Legs together... Excellent. Girls, see how Marge's legs are slanted? You make Jackie O. look like a splay-legged milk-horse. Now stand and walk. Well done! I'd be proud if you grew up to be my husband's mistress. Thank you. I used to walk like this all the time... until my tendon snapped. They heard it in Shelbyville! Anyhoo... one night we had a special dinner. We were learning to use all thirty-three forks. Young lady, that is not an olive fork. Here's a simple trick to help you remember. Knife and fork together, denied yourself dessert... nice work, Marge. Really. Oh, no! My retainer! I got it! I'd thank you, but I don't even know your name. I bet it's something low-rent -- like Billy Bob! Or Homer. Big, ugly Homer! Oh, I'm sure it's a much nicer name than Homer. Think, Homer, think. What did you say? I'm Elvis. Elvis Jagger. Elvis Jagger Abdul-Jabbar. I told my friends I had a date... What should I wear? Should I paint my toes? And what should I do with my hair? You could iron it. Iron my hair? That's what Leslie Uggams does! Leslie who? Uggams! Ooh, it's really straightening out. I guess I'm going to have to be a brunette tonight. Oh, dear me. One day as a straight-haired brunette. I feel so bad for you. Stupid girl. Please don't be a freak, please don't be a freak-- I MET HER ON THE MOUNTAIN, THERE I TOOK HER LIFE / MET HER ON THE MOUNTAIN, STABBED HER WITH MY KNIFE... Hi. He's cute. And he's got an eye patch. I've never seen a boy so mysterious. You must be Elvis. Elvis? What the Hell kind of name is... oh yeah, right. We've heard the same story two times now. Whose side are we gonna hear next? The Sea Captain's? No, no, I'd best be on me way. I'll just take some Teddy Grahams for the road. There goes a good friend. Now, I'm gonna warn you kids: the next part of the story gets a little ""W-B""... Oh man, I want to kiss her. Wait -- I just thought of the greatest move ever! Oh no, he yawned -- I'm boring him! Do you like music? I do. I like Bobby Goldsboro, Gilbert O'Sullivan, Terry Jacks, Parliament but not Funkadelic... How am I supposed to kiss those things? Interrupt her with something witty! Uhhhh... Ummmm... Yes? Kiss her already. What, are you chicken? Bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok! Is he making chicken noises? Way to go, Dad! The perfect kiss! It was pretty delicious. It was as satisfying as a million Hallmark cards with all the right-sized envelopes. It felt like a cluster bomb wiping out a graveyard full of zombies. But then your father showed his true colors. Whuh-oh. Will I see you again tomorrow? Absolutely. Or my name isn't... whatever I told you it was. So we arranged to meet again at ""Second Date Rock."" I guess he's not coming. It was years before I could trust a boy again. That's horrible. How could you, Dad? Because he's the kind who kisses and leaves you! I can't believe you stood Mom up. Face it, Lis -- men are dogs. The worse we treat you, the more you want us. That's not what dogs do. Ha ha! You said ""dog doo""! She sure did. Now if Lisa is finished with her shenanigans, I'll tell you why I didn't show up... We had just finished our first smooch. And I felt a feeling I'd never felt before: I found this stone earlier. I was gonna use it as a nerd-smasher... but I want you to have it. Oooh! It looks like a heart. Hey, you're right. Give it back! No, I still want you to have it. But every time you smash a nerd with it, think of me. I will. See you tomorrow night, okay? What a kiss. If I died now, I'd die happy. ...ooh, what a view... Good ol' patch, you saved my life! So, you thought you could make a break for it, didya? Well, no one ever escapes from fat camp. 'Cause the only way out is up a gentle slope. What the? Fat camp? I don't belong here! Your boy bosoms tell a different tale. Okay, take a break, ladies. No eating the grass! He didn't say nothin' about this poison oak. Sweet, sweet poison. Uh-oh. I've gotta go, I've got a date! Yeah, you've got a date... with a skinless chicken breast. Somewhere out there she's waiting for me. Hello... I'd like to speak to Elvis Jagger Abdul-Jabbar. Hey, don't you try and prank me with a fake name -- I'll rip out your intestines and use 'em to make a lanyard... Hello? Hello? And that's the origin of that. That boy I kissed wouldn't even tell me his real name! Typical. All boys want the same thing -- to kiss until they're hot and heavy, then vamoose. Trust us. We know everything about boys. Except what they look like below the waist. I have some theories based on a G.I. Joe I bought. Well, I never want to date a boy again! Are you leaving camp because of that boy? 'Cause that's what I've been telling everybody. You're also pregnant. I just can't stay here -- everything reminds me of him. Oh, the pain. Man was not meant to sit up. We've got an emergency here. We need ten CCs, pronto. And by CCs I mean cupcakes. I know what you mean, Bill. I've worked here longer than you. Now's my chance. Love... conquers... all. Snake! Bye-bye! Thank God they're gone. I can't believe I went five minutes without one of these dream sticks. Hey, have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl? If you are who I think you are, that girl is gone and she never wants to see you again. She wouldn't do that -- we shared something special. What, just 'cause she smooched you? Was that special? No. I just blew my first chance at true love. And now that my special girl has heard the truth, I know she'll forgive me. Earth to special girl? You forgive me, right? I guess so. Uh, I think we'll go to bed now. What are you doing? If they fight in front of us, we might get new bikes! Homer, when you nurse a hurt for thirty years, it doesn't go away in an instant. What about now? What about now? No, Homer. What about now? No, Homer. What about now? No, Homer. Marge, I'm really sorry I hurt you. But I've done way worse stuff since then: there was the gun I hid from you, the time I sued the church, ruining Lisa's wedding in the future... remember that? Homie, I know this shouldn't bother me, but a girl only has one first love. I guess it didn't mean that much to you. That's not true! I thought about that girl every day of my life... until I met you. I wish there was some way I could believe that. All right. This is my memory box. I haven't opened it in thirty years. Ooh, a letter from my old pen pal. Someday I'll write you back, Osama. Ah, here's what I'm lookin' for. Oh, Homie! You did care. I sure did. I kept it right next to my IBM stock... king. I kept my heart too. Because somehow you realized I was a good guy after all? No, as a reminder of the hurtful things men can do. But now it can have a second meaning. Oh, Elvis. Oh, anonymous girl who turned out to be Marge.","Terri Mackleberry, Ralph Wiggum, Security Guard, Guard On Walkie-talkie, Chief Wiggum, Ms. Killebrew, Milhouse Van Houten, Marge Simpson, T.J., 10-Year-Old Homer, Boys, Homer Simpson, Sherri Mackleberry, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Homer's Mind, Cookie Kwan, 10-Year-Old Carl, Moe Szyslak, Girl, Selma Bouvier, Young Helen, Captain Horatio McCallister, TEN-YEAR-OLD MARGE, Bart Simpson, 10-Year-Old Lenny, HELEN, Marge's Mind, Comic Book Guy, Patty Bouvier",7.3,587.0,20,2004-05-09,2004,15,The Way We Weren't,6.6,43128.0
