We're sure to be first in line for Duff Days. You set off the smoke alarm to rush us to a beer festival? I know. I'm a character. Now a little beer music to get in the mood. Looking for these? Dee-dee-dee. Drink Duff responsibly. Drink Duff responsibly. Now, which one of you is our designated driver? Twist off, dammit! I guess I'll be driving. Right this way to the Duff Designated Drivers Rockin' Fun Zone. Rockin' Fun Zone? That sounds funnn... I don't see the need for razor wire. Oooh, there's Ulysses S. Grant, Babe Ruth Ben Franklin... Early to bed and early to rise --  You think, you think you're better than me? Huh? Ewwww. Okay kids, who wants to see what it's like to get drunk? Now you're charming! You don't know me. This guy here... this is the guy. All right, Springfield! Belly up for the Duff Beer-tender of the Year contest. Now, fresh from his appearance before the House Subcommittee on Teenage Alcoholism -- Duffman! Are you ready for some Duff Love? All right! Today, we're gonna find out which of these bartenders has the right stuff to dispense Duff. From the Green Potato Pub at O'Hare International Airport -- Michael Finn! From ""Juggernauts"" in Hollywood, California -- Titania! And now the local lug who fills your mug with the drug you chug -- oh yeah! -- Give it up for Moe Szyslak! Hello, Springfield! Howya -- Okay, our first event qualifies for course credit at Dartmouth College -- trick pouring! Go Moe! Boo everyone else! I think we know who wins this round. Titania! Duff beer is brewed from hops, barley and sparkling, clear, mountain... what? Goat? Close enough! Ahhh, you can really taste the goat. Now our final round, which counts for ninety-eight per cent of the total score, making the previous rounds a complete waste. Don't forget, today's winner will be immortalized on our new Duff Calendar. All right, guys. One, two, three. Moo?! Lenny, you were supposed to be ""E"". See what happens when you skip rehearsal? All right, bartenders, toss your drunks. And stay out! Ew! You said if I slept with you, I wouldn't have to touch the drunk. Duffman says a lot of things. Oh yeah! And the winner, Moe Szyslak! Aw, that's great. Thank you, thanks a lot. Ah, I just wanna say that it was an honor for me to compete with the Mick and the uh, the chick with the rack, there. Yeah! All right, Moe! That's my Moo! And now to take your official calendar portrait, Duff's Vice President in charge of Calendars and Fake IDs, Phil Angelides. That's a mug you don't wanna chug. Knock it off, Larry. We can't put this face on our calendar. When I get home there are gonna be a lot of open pickle jars. That one. Kids, would you like a balloon? Yeah, right, Mom. Then I'd like a rattle and a wowwipop. Actually, I would like a wowwipop. Those balloons won't biodegrade for ten thousand years. And if Bart gets a wowwipop, I want a wowwipop. Aw, Maggie wants a balloon and daddy will take a hand stamp so he can get back in. Just kidding. Remember my face. Oh, boy! Moe, the new Duff calendars are out! The ones with your picture! Oh, boy! Move over liquor license. Hey Moe, this license expired in 1973, and... and it's only good in Rhode Island, and it's signed by you. Yeah, yeah, I've been meanin' to get that updated, uh, for this state, and real. Now let's see the poster boy for the new Moe-lennium. They put a sticker over my face! Hey... Viva la... Kiss... What... Ah, for the love of Jeff! Am I really that ugly? Moe, it's all relative. Is Lenny really that dumb? Is Barney that drunk? Is Homer that lazy, bald and fat? Oh my God! It's worse than I thought. See, this is why I don't talk much. I can't believe they put those stickers over my face. I must be the ugliest man alive. Oh, Moe. There's lots of people uglier than you. Like, you ever been to White Castle? Ho, boy -- Pigtown U.S.A.! Aw, c'mon, look at me. I'm a gargoyle. What, with the cauliflower ear there, and the lizard lips... The little rat eyes... Caveman brow... Don't forget that fish snout. Okay, I get it. I ain't pleasant to look at. Or listen to. Or be with. C'mon, Moe. Don't feel bad. There's too much emphasis on looks these days. That's why they won't let Bill Maher on TV before midnight. Hey, Moe, if you're tired of bein' an eyesore, why not get some plastic surgery? Plastic surgery, huh?... Ah, maybe they could dynamite Mount Crapmore here and carve me a new kisser. I-I don't know. Plastic surgery might make you look good on the outside, but you still might feel bad on the inside. But I'd look good on the outside, right? Yeah, but you'd feel bad inside. Plastic surgery it is! Carl Carlson, you just saved my life! Hey, get out of there! Look at her. Must be great to be a baby and be so easily amused. Yeah, wish I could be entertained by two cents worth of rubber, shaped like some colorful animal, dancing and twirling, dancing and twirling... Hey, gimme that! / That's mine! The door! Oh, no! Okay, don't panic! I'll get the bikes. I hope they're hover-bikes. Oh, man. That would be so awesome! It's hopeless, ain't it? No, no, no, I love a challenge. First, we must install buttocks. Nah, nah, nah, no luxury items. Just the face. Okay, I'm gonna move this up... this wider... I'm gonna lose that... I've never even seen one of these... Can the medical mumbo-jumbo. Can you fix me or not? Well, we'll see. You know, most faces need a little remodeling, but this is a total tear-down. Let me clean up this mess I made. Hey, hey, hey! That really burns there! Oh, stop it. You're worse than Faye Dunaway. We've got to get closer! I'm trying! Can't I get on your shoulders? I'm not ridin' a girls bike. Hey, it's gettin' away! Step on it! Ya! Ya! Stop kicking me! Ya! Hooboy, what a mug. Yeah, you should see his genitals. Would you like to see them? I'm awake here. Uh-oh. This isn't anesthetic. It's new-car smell. Oh, sorry, Doctor. Hoo... SILVER BELLS... SILVER BELLS... It's going into that building. Nice suit, Jeeves! Daddy, I'm stealing, I'm stealing! Oh, that's my little dude. We need a symbol. Something that says we're gay and Republicans. A little on the nose, don't you think? Excuse me. We just came to get our balloon. Here you go. And have a bumper sticker. Thank you. ""A gay president in 2084""? We're realistic. Hurry, hurry up! I have to pee! Beautiful. Okay, now do Moe. Well, Moe, now we see if you go on my wall of fame or my blooper reel. What? I'm a monster, right? I knew it. I guess I'll just crawl back to live in the sewer, periodically emerging to sue you. Is that me? Oopsie, we've got some leakage. Let me just cauterize that for you. Bye, Moe! Don't be a stranger, handsome. Bye bye! Homer, did you hear that? She called me handsome. Me. It's like I've gone to heaven... Wait a minute. I died on the operating table, didn't I? Yeah, but just for a minute. It's a funny story; I'll tell you sometime. So this is all real? Oh, you dear, dear man. You're one of us beautiful people now. And your new life begins today. A new life. A second chance... for revenge. That brown patch needs a little H-2-0. Oh, yeah! Hey, Duffman. Let's see how you like a sticker on your face! Yeah. Duffman can't breathe. Oh, no! Oh! Hello. Yeah, hello yourself. I'm Moe Szyslak. Back in high school, I asked you to the Springtime Pumpkin Dance, and you turned me down. Well, I just wanted to show you the face that you coulda been kissin'. Yeah! Oh, I was just a stupid kid back then. And I feel terrible about hurting you. Will you accept my apology? Apology? Uh, geez, I wasn't expecting that... uh... Run! Man, that felt great. Okay, last stop. Channel 6. You're gonna get even with that lottery guy that never picks our numbers. Na, na, na. This is personal. It all goes back to my acting days. I was auditioning for the role of Dr. Tad Winslow on the hit soap, ""It Never Ends."" Angela, I'm afraid I... Thank-you-next! What were you thinking? Well, you said you wanted ""gritty."" In other words, ""ugly."" I wanted Maryanne-on-Gilligan's-Island ugly, not Cornelius-on-the-Planet-of-the-Apes ugly. TV ugly, not ugly ugly. I'd been called ugly, pug ugly, fugly, pug fugly, but never ugly ugly. Well, it's time to get some closure. Extreme closure. But I've been Dr. Tad Winslow for twenty-five years. It's time I got a raise! Oh, shut up, you windy old hack. And another thing -- You have to stop calling me that. Remember me? Twenty-five years ago you said I was too ugly to play Dr. Tad Winslow! I did? Well, that's why pencils have erasers, hon. You're our new Dr. Tad Winslow. Really? You mean it? But there can't be two Dr. Tad Winslows! That's going to... Ohhh... I've been waiting all my life for this moment. Homer, whoa, whoa, Homer. Change of plans. Whatever. Like the cleaning of a house... ""It Never Ends."" With Gabriella DeFarge as Gabriella St. Farge... Allegra Hamilton as Sister Bernadette and Roxy Monoxide... and as Dr. Tad Winslow...Moe Szyslak. I don't know if I'll be able to accept Moe as Dr. Tad Winslow. Well, I'm gonna keep watching as long as they have shocking story twists and endless pillow talk. Cleo, Cleo, you've brought music to my heart, but this relationship can never work. I'm a doctor, and you're a 5,000-year-old mummy I brought back to life. But I love you, Tad. And together we can burn all the cities of the earth. It's against hospital regulations, dammit! And Clive Dancer's just waitin' for me to slip up. So, Lenny, how are things workin' out with you and that girl next door? Eh, it's over. She got a windowshade. Wha?! Whoa, whoa, if you must grope me, ladies, please, a little softer. Okay, now harder. Hey, there are women in our bar! Hey, Moe. Beer me! Ah, I'm a little busy, Homer. Ah, you can pour it yourself. Hmm. This isn't nearly as complicated as Moe made it seem. I didn't bring you back to life so you could make a fool of me at the club. You don't love me. The only thing you love is your ear, nose and throat pavilion. I've dedicated my life to diseases of the head holes. But the one hole I've never been able to fix is the one in my soul. That was amazing, Moe. I'm actually a little turned on. Yeah, hey, I gotta gift. As a child, I was bitten by the acting bug. Then it burrowed under my skin and laid eggs in my heart. Now those eggs are hatching. And I... the feeling is indescribable. I know what you mean. Our dog had that. Excuse me? I've got a delivery here for the producers. ""Top Secret Story Lines?!"" Uh, I'll sign for it. Eh, might as well have a little peek... Hmm. Looks like my character gets back together with that evil Contessa. The one with the amulet? Precisely. Then I get in a skydiving accident and have to be rushed to the... graveyard?! They're killing off Dr. Tad Winslow! What? Let me see that! ""Interior Coroner's Office. Close-up on Dr. Winslow's mangled corpse. Coroner: 'Let's get that brain out and weighed, and call it a day.'"" Yep, that does sound kinda bad. Well, if they're gonna stomp on my dreams, the least I can do is go out in a blaze of sour grapes. I never used to trust you, Contessa, but now you seem so nice. Why don't we celebrate your newfound trust in me, by taking a skydiving lesson? Well, how could I say no to such a captivating... Ding-dong! Whoa, it's the door. Dr. Winslooooow... Why, who are you? I am an angel from the future. Angel? What the fudge? Should I cut him off? No. Let's see where this is going. And what do you have to tell us, oh, Angel of the Future? You're going to die in a skydiving accident. How tragic. Tell me more. Gabriella's baby shower will be invaded by terrorists. With sexy results. Ooh, that's unexpected. What else? Well, Sister Bernadette will leave the convent and start a softball team. With sexy results. What's Dad doing on the show? Who cares? He's dishin' out the dirt. ...and only then do we find out that Professor Gallaway's half-sister is plotting to take over International Perfume and Wine. He just gave away a year's worth of story lines! Cut him off... nnnnnnow. Yes! What the hell are you doing? Stickin' it to you for killin' off my character! Yeah! You idiot! Dr. Winslow was only going to die in a dream! Wha? Pink pages always mean a dream. I thought dreams was on goldenrod. No, goldenrod is for coma fantasies. I see. So, ah, what time tomorrow? Escort these men out. Nnnnnnow. Get ya hands off me. Get off! I don't need your stinkin' show, anyway. With a mug like this, I can get on any soap in Springfield. Oh! Oh, my face! I'm not supposed to put weight on it! What? What? I'm sorry about your face, Moe. Nah, it's just as well. That handsome face was nice, but it was too much maintenance. I had to wash it, rub it with neat's-foot oil... You did me a favor, Homer. And to think I was about to sell the bar to Hooters... Yeah, you were... Well, I guess that wraps it up. Hey, there's one thing I don't get, though. When my face was crushed, why did it go back to my old face? I mean, shouldn't it have turned into some kind of third face that was different? Heh.
