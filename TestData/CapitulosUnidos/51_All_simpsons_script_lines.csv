50,51,"Sorry Jimmy. Without zinc for the rotary mechanism, there are no telephones. Dear God, what have I done? Think again, Jimmy. You see, the firing pin in your gun was made of -- yup, zinc. Come back zinc! Come back... Come back... zinc. Come back... zinc. Zinc! Zinc! What? Oh, it was all a dream. Thank goodness I still live in a world of telephones... car batteries... hand guns... And many things made of zinc. Gross, he's picking his nose! If anyone wants to learn more about zinc, they're welcome to stay... We can talk about anything... I'll do your homework for ya... Ah, ""Chef Lonely Hearts' Soup For One."" One scratch and win, Apu. Mrs. Krabappel, I haven't seen you since we doubled our prices. Still teaching? Let's see. One more day at least. Bingo! Bango! Sugar in the gas tank. Your ex-husband strikes again. Hmp. Hmp. ""A personal Ad?"" Why not? It might be fun, kind of a lark. C'mon, c'mon. Answer the phone. I need a man! Ow! My eyeball! People... people... Allllll right. You know I can wait just as long as you. Knock it off! Now, boys and girls, let's welcome our special guest, Ted Carpenter from the Twirl King yo-yo company. Kids, this is a yo-yo. Kinda dull, huh? Not much competition for a video game. Or is it? Presenting, the Twirl King Champions! Mister Amazing! Sparkle! She's beautiful! Zero Gravity! The Cobra! Those guys must be millionaires! I bet they get all kinds of girls! I question the educational value of this assembly. Hey, it'll be one of their few pleasant memories when they're pumpin' gas for a living. THIS IS THE DAWNING OF THE AGE OF AQUARIUS! AGE OF AQUARIUS! AQUARIUS! AQUARIUS! Now, for our next stunt, what do you say we get your Principal up here! No. Mmm... careful now...ooh... gee that one grazed my ear... Don't move. You could really get hurt. Oh. How much do those yo-yos cost? I don't care! Good-bye! Bye! Bye! Wow, thanks Sparkle. Wait, this isn't you. That's the old Sparkle. All right! Get your worthless butts in the van! We've got three more schools to do. Come on lets go go go. That's your trick? No. Here's my trick! Thank you. Thank you. Marge. Come here. Can you believe it? Pretty soon I'll be able to quit my job and live off the boy. What? Name me one person who's gotten rich by doing yo-yo tricks. Donald Trump? No. Arnold Palmer? No. Bill Cosby? No. After two months at sea, the Pilgrims were running out of food and water... Yes Nelson? Did they have any yo-yos? No, they did not have yo-yos. When they landed at Plymouth rock they were greeted by the friendly Wampanoag Indians.... Did the Indians have yo-yos? No, they did not have yo-yos. That's it. I am sick and tired of talking about yo-yos. From now on I will not accept any book reports, science projects, dioramas, or anything else on yo-yos or yo-yo related topics. Am I making myself clear? Yo. Hey Bart, got any new tricks for us today? Just one. A little something I call Plucking the Pickle. I build up a little steam, and... I didn't do it. Don't worry about your wee fish, Lass. They're going to a better place. Bart, that's one month's detention. Mrs. Krabappel, we're all upset by the untimely deaths of Stinky and Wrinkles. But life goes on. So, if I could just have my yo-yo back... Bart, if I were you, and you were me, would you give back the yo-yo? Here you go... Just kidding. Here you go... Just kidding. Well, would you? Absolutely. What's eatin' you, woman? Your personal ad said you wanted a man. Well, you got yourself a humdinger. I don't know. I guess I expected something different from your photo. Don't let my age fool you. Just cause there's a little snow on the roof... I forget how the rest of that goes. One months detention... She'll pay for this. Yup, there's your problem... someone jammed a Malibu Stacy head down here. Edna, happy hour in the Teacher's Lounge. Just a sec. Huh. One plus one equals two? Recently divorced fourth-grade teacher wishes to meet man age 18-60. Object: save me. Write Edna K, Box 402. Hmmm. Dear Edna, I've never answered a personal ad before, but I found yours irresistible. My name is... ...Woodrow. I like holding hands and dinner by candle light. And oh, yes, I really hate yo-yos. Oh, Woodrow. Maybe we should let the dog in? Marge, dogs love the outdoors. I think he needs a dog house. Yeah, but what're ya gonna do? I'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars. Marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers. I am not! Yes you are. You've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on TV. I know, I'll build him a dog house. Oh, I don't know... Don't worry. I just drew up a little blueprint. Now let me walk you through it. This is the door. He goes through that. This is the roof. And this happy character here is the sun. He shines down on the house, see. How was detention today, dear? Oh, not bad. I'm starting to get the hang of the floor waxer. Yes! ""Dear Woodrow, I must admit I'm intrigued. You're not like the other men I've met."" Yeah. I'm the 28th President of the United States. ""But I've had some bad experiences with these ads. So, I'd like to learn more about you. Please write back soon. Here's a photo that'll get your pencil moving."" You've got a date with a xerox machine. Stupid lumber... Dammit! Son of a -- The hell with this! Fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. Well sir, I gave him three quarters by mistake. Took me the whole afternoon to track him down. Todd, would you like some mixed vegetables? Hell no! What did you say? I said I don't want any damn vegetables. All right, that's it, young man. No Bible stories for you tonight. Weren't you a little hard on him? Well, you knew I had a temper when you married me. Ned Flanders is on the phone. If this is about that stupid quarter again -- Hello, Ned. Sorry to bother you, Reverend Lovejoy, but I'm kind of in a tizzy. Our son Todd just told us he didn't want to eat his ""damn vegetables."" Well, you know kids and vegetables. What was it, asparagus? No Reverend, the point is, he said a bad word. Oh, oh right, yeah. Kids usually pick these things up from someplace. Find out who's doing it and... uh, direct them to the Bible. Where in the Bible? Uh... page nine-hundred. But Reverend... Damn Flanders. Hey, Lis, a moment of your time. Yeah? Suppose I was writing a second letter to a girl and I already used up my A material. What should I say? Mmm! Could it be there's a special someone you're not telling me about? Oh, please. Is it Terri? No. Is it Sherri? No! Is it that girl with the lazy eye patch? No! Is it that exchange student Mx!pa? No! It's not for me. It's homework. Sure it is. Hey Bart, let's do some homework. Golly, Sergeant Carter, I can't fix your jeep. But maybe this will make it up to you. Galveston, oh Galveston... Is this all he watches? Oh, he used to watch ""Davy and Goliath,"" but he thought the idea of a talking dog was blasphemous. Hey Mom, did you save the love letters Dad sent you? Of course I saved them. Although actually there's only one. And it's more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited. ""Maybe it's the beer talking, Marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. They got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? Get outta here."" Wow, a side of dad I've never seen. Penny for your thoughts, Mrs. K. I was just thinking... oh, you wouldn't be interested. Try me. Sometimes it helps to talk. Well, I was just wishing I could meet a man who... likes the way I look first thing in the morning... laughs at my jokes... Uh-huh. ...can fix my car... Oh yeah. Dear Edna: Your photo took my breath away. ""Truly, yours is a butt that won't quit. Yesterday morning, I put your picture up in my garage to inspire me while I gapped my spark plugs..."" At last we've built the mission. Finally, the villagers have a place to pray. Bringing in the Sheaves. Bringing in the Sheaves. ""We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the Sheaves."" He's not getting it from his brother, that's for darn sure. Damn, crappy nails! Super glue my butt! Homer? What is it, Flanders? I'm afraid I have a bone to pick with you. Look, if this is about your camcorder -- I lost it, okay? No, I-I came to talk to you about your potty-mouth. What the hell are you talking about? Look Homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. So, I don't want to be hard on you... but I just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys. Oh come on now, Flanders, I don't complain about your your... moustache. What's wrong with my moustache? Makes you look like you've got something to hide. What? People are talking... lots of people. Okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. I'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay? Aye-aye! Admiral Butthead. We now return to ""Two for Tunsia"" on Colorization Theater. Ah, my love... A million poets could try for a million years and still describe but three-eighths of your beauty. Ohhh, slow down, Frenchy! This stuff is gold. Wow, ""a million poets working for a million years""... You're so lucky. When are you gonna meet him? First, I asked him to send a photo. Uh... huh. If he's got everything where it should be, I'm reelin' him in. Strap on your skates Gordie, you're going in. Hey Marge, do you want to hear something funny? Flanders thinks I swear too much. Marge, you're not laughing. Well, you know, maybe he's right. Well what a surprise. Marge sticks up for Flanders! Can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, Ned Flanders? Actually, Homer, you brought up Ned Flanders. I never said a word -- Look, we're past that. Marge, maybe I do curse a little, but that's the way God made me. And I'm too old to stop now. No, you're not. When my father got out of the Navy, he used to curse a blue streak. It almost cost him his job as a baby photographer. So, my mom put a Swear Jar in the kitchen. Every time he said a bad word, he put in a quarter. What do you think? Well Marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. Bring on the swear jar. Do I have to pay if I hit my hand with the hammer? Yes, Homer. What if I catch on fire? No, Homer. What if I see something really weird in the sky? Yes, Homer. What about when we snuggle? Uh... that's okay. ""Dear Woodrow, it's time for us to meet. Why don't we go out to dinner and afterward we can go to my apartment for some home cookin'."" Huh? Aye carumba! ...Hungrily yours, Edna."" Well, she's dangled on the line long enough. It's time to boat this bass. When I read your letters, I feel as if you are right here watching me... Bart! Eyes down. Yes, ma'am. ""Edna, every second until we meet stabs me like a thousand needles..."" ""Join me at the Gilded Truffle this Saturday at eight. Perhaps later we will smooch up a storm. Sexily yours, Woody."" I can't help but feel partly responsible. Homer, that was a twenty. God -- Ohh, you son-of-a. Hey Homer, Ya know, I owe you one, buddy. No sooner had I shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial. Ah, I tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal. You dirty bas... What do ya think, Lisa? How's the dog supposed to get in? Well, he just goes... Ohhh Oh, Woodrow. How could you stand me up? Mrs. K, whoever this guy is, you don't need him. There are plenty of good men around. Name one. What's wrong with Principal Skinner? Seymour? Huh, let's just say his mommy won't let him out to play. What about Coach Fortner? Glug, glug, glug, glug... Wow! What about Groundskeeper Willie? I'm not even gonna tell you what that guy's into. Bart, you're the closest thing to a man in my life. And that's so depressing, I think I'm gonna cry. Oh fudge, that's broken. Fiddle dee dee. That will require a tetanus shot. I'm not going to swear, but I am going to kick this doghouse down. Dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse. Where'd you get the money? There was more than enough in the swear jar. And if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise. Maggie. Oh. Cute. No, behind her. Beer! How did you know? Where's Maggie? Where's Maggie? There's Maggie! Mom, this is a little ahead of schedule, but I need help with my love life. Oh, my special little guy has a sweetheart. I knew it. All right, Bart, who's your girlfriend? Mrs. Krabappel. Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night. Homer! Bart, you did a very cruel thing. Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth. No, Homer. The truth would humiliate her. Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted to hear. Maybe we should write her another letter. One that says good-bye but lets her feel loved. Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty. ""Dear Baby, welcome to Dumpville. Population: you."" We'll all help. ""Though I'll be inoculating babies in Kampuchea, my heart will always be with you."" That sucks. How 'bout, ""Crocodiles bit off my face."" That's disgusting. And besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face. I may hold you to that, Marge. ""Okay, okay... I cannot see you for the next five years, for I will be farming the ocean floor."" ""I must finish this letter quickly, for I have only four minutes to live."" Three simple words. I am gay. Homer, for the last time, I am not putting that in. ""And any time I hear the wind blow, it will whisper the name... Edna!"" Oh, that's very good, Lisa. P.S. -- I am gay. How shall we end it? How about, ""With a love that will echo through the ages?"" Oh, that's sweet. Ohhh, Homer, you old honey dripper. Why you little... Wait! Wait! ""Dearest Edna, I must leave you. Why I cannot say. Where? You cannot know. How I will get there, I haven't decided yet. But one thing I can tell you, any time I hear the wind blow, it will whisper the name... Edna."" Bart, it's such a nice day today. Let's have detention outside. It's a date.","Miss Hoover, Sound-alikes, Homer's Brain, Dad, Southern Private, Milhouse Van Houten, Romantic Lover Voice, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Helen Lovejoy, Homer Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, Groundskeeper Willie, Teenager, Rev.
