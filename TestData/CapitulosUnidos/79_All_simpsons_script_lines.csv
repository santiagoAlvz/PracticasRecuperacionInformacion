78,79,"Children, we've just been tipped off that Superintendent Chalmers is planning a surprise inspection. So let's clean up this pigsty! On another topic, the following students have won mountain bikes: Bart Simpson... Jimbo Jones... Nelson Muntz... I want you to keep filling your shirt with crud 'til I get back. Yes, sir. You may pick the bikes up in Utility Basement B. Fools! Whoops. Still on. Hey, what do you think he meant by that fools remark? Ah, who cares? Time to get me a mountain bike! Hey, what gives? Where are the mountain bikes? Sorry about the ruse, gentlemen. You're being swept under the rug for the Superintendent's visit. Enjoy! How are we gonna get outta here? And when are we gonna get our mountain bikes? Would the world judge me harshly if I threw away the key? No. But the PTA would tear ya a new arse. Wise council, William. But the potty talk adds nothing. Aye, sir. You bath-taking, underpants-wearing, lily-hugger. Superintendent Chalmers! Welcome! Hello, Seymour. So what's the word down at One School Board Plaza? We're dropping the geography requirement. The children weren't testing well. It was proving to be an embarrassment. Very good. Back to the three R's. Two R's come October. Hm. What do you think of the banners? Nothing but transparent toadying. They were the children's idea. I tried to stop them. It's always the children's fault, isn't it, Seymour? Yes, yes it is, sir. Imagine, a school out there with no bullies. Science geeks not getting beat up... kids using their lunch money for food... I can't take it! Hey, I think I can squeeze through that vent. All right! All right Bart! Do it man. Now, remember little dude, you're our only hope. Ow! Got 'im! Way to go, man! Haw haw! May I interest you in a Jello brick, Sir? There's a grape in the center. Well, I'm not made of stone. You're not made of stone... a brick and you're... made of stone... Ach, my beauty, wait till the Superintendent sees you. Were it not a violation of God's law, I'd make ye my wife. Now there is a lonely man. I'm new in town. Be there a cool loch where a lass could wash her long red hair? Nay, but there's a pool at me apartment complex. There was a rat in the deep end -- but we got him! Ah! Lead on. Forty-eight... forty-nine... fifty. Flag's up to date. Very good, Seymour. Now, are these children as smart as they look? Well let's pick one at random. How about that one? You mean this boy, here? No! No! Lisa Simpson! When was the battle of New Orleans? January 8, 1815. Two weeks after the war ended. First rate. What's a battle? Let's go. Did that boy say what's a battle? No he said what's that rattle. It's about the heating duct. Hm, it sounded like battle. I've had a cold. Oh, so you hear ""R""s as ""B""s? Yes. I understand. Come on Bart. Ride me. I better not. He's insulting both of us. Let's go. Excellent. Not a trace of urine. Seymour, you run a tight ship. Well, you know what they say, sir. ""Where there's no smoke, there's no fire."" What an odd remark. Why, that looks like a fifty cent piece. I'll just bend over and get it. It seems to be caught between these two flowers. NOOOOO! Ow, ow, ow. Seymour I was thinking of promoting you to Assistant Superintendent. But, instead, that plum goes to Holloway. No. But sir, he's a drunk. And a pill popper. If I could just... Silence! And why is a cafeteria worker posing as a nurse? I get two paychecks this way. There's no detention this time, Simpson. This is the end. You are expelled from Springfield Elementary! Tonight on ""Eye on Springfield"": The Munchkins from ""The Wizard of Oz""... Where are they now? And we'll visit a nudist camp... for animals! But first, a look at the local holiday that was called ""distasteful"" and ""Puerile"" by a panel of hillbillies. Whacking Day! Oh no. No! In a tradition that dates back to founding father Jebediah Springfield...every May 10th local residents gather to drive snakes into the center of town and whack them to snake heaven. After exposing Alger Hiss, honorary Grand Marshall Richard Nixon goes after another deadly hiss. Is Whacking Day over? Thank you, thanks for coming out. It's all so barbaric. Hey kids. How was school? I learned how many drams in a pennyweight. I got expelled. That's my boy. Mmmm, beer... What? Look, Dad. I don't need school. I'll make my way as a bootblack. Shine yer boots Guv'nor? No son of mine is gonna be a 19th Century Cockney bootblack. We're gonna find you another school. Now remember Bart. This is a religious school. So be very careful about what you say and do here. No problemo. Now Bart, since you're new here, perhaps you'd favor us with a psalm. How about ""Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit?"" Well, beans were a staple of the Israelites... yes, proceed. BEANS, BEANS, THE MUSICAL FRUIT / THE MORE YOU EAT THE MORE YOU TOOT... Avert your eyes, children, he may take on other forms! I guess that's it. I just can't be educated. I can always get a job testing dangerous food additives. We'd like you to try this new diet cola. We call it ""Nature's Goodness."" What's in it? Two four des-oxy-propheniramine. Sweet. Pleasing taste. Some monsterism. Cool. You're going to get an education. I'm going to teach you myself. Marge, it's too late. The boy's ten years old! Let's focus our energy on Lisa and the other one. What's your problem? Whacking Day is coming. Woo hoo! The greatest day of the year. But killing snakes is evil. Maybe so, Lisa, but it's part of our oh-so-human nature. Inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved. I AM EVIL HO-MER... I AM EVIL HO-MER... I AM EVIL HO-MER... I AM EVIL HO-MER... Have a nice day at school, Lis. I'll just try to make the best of a bad situation. Ahhh... Bart. Get dressed for school. I expect you to be in your seat when the bell rings. I bought a bell. I think I'll unplug that. I'm your new teacher. My name is Mrs. Simpson. I didn't do it. Oh, that's right. I invited a guest speaker to talk to the class. Hello, children! I got separated from my platoon after we parachuted into Dusseldorf. So I rode out the war posing as a German cabaret singer. WON'T YOU COME HOME FRANZ BRAUDER / WON'T YOU COME HOME... Yoo hoo. Ach du lieber! That is not ein a booby! Is that story true, Grampa? Well, most of it. I did wear a dress for a period in the forties. Oh, they had designers then... Look what I got, Marge. A new whacking stick. Whack! Oooh! Excuse me. Whack! Whack! Whack! Oooh! Oooooh! Oooooooh! Bart, I'd like you to read this copy of ""Johnny Tremain."" It's a book I read as a girl. A book? I think you might like this... It's about a boy who goes to war... his hand is deformed in an accident... Deformed? Why didn't you say so? They should call this book ""Johnny Deformed!"" ""Hundreds would die, but not the thing they died for: 'A man can stand up...'"" Wow. Mm-hm, if you'd like to learn more about Colonial times we could take a field trip to Old Springfield Towne. Dad? Dad, everyone likes Whacking Day, but I hate it. Is there something wrong with me? Yes, honey. Then, what should I do? Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time. Like that day I hit the referee with a whiskey bottle. Remember that? Yeah. Your Daddy hit the referee. Yeah. Yeah. Any experience? Yes I played Panicky Idiot #2 in ""The Poseidon Adventure."" Sorry. We're looking for more of a ""Duh, duh"" idiot. But... Oh, I see. Hello, Barney. Are you playing the town drunk? Actually, I'm supposed to be the governor. The enemy surrounded the fort and said that if the captain was sent out the rest would be spared. What did they do? They sent him out. Was he killed? And how! That's why they call it Fort Sensible. This is Jebediah Springfield at the Battle of Ticonderoga. Next. And here he is killing a snake on the very first Whacking Day in 1775. Hey wait a minute. That was the same day he was at Ticonderoga. How could he be in two places at once? Um... Um... Y'see... He'll blow the whole deal. Get him outta here. Roger. If you want to learn more about Whacking Day, there are many fine books in our gift shop. Welcome to your official Whacking Day Headquarters. I've hidden a snake somewhere in this store. The first one to whack it gets a free Squishee. Hey. Hey. Boy, I should have put more thought into my promotion. Aim for the body, men. Right chief. And the Lord said ""Whack ye all the serpents which crawl on their bellies and thy town shall be a beacon unto others."" So you see, Lisa, even God himself endorses Whacking Day. Let me see that. No. OH WHACKING DAY / OH WHACKING DAY / OUR HALLOWED SNAKE SKULL CRACKING DAY... WE'LL BREAK THEIR BACKS / GOUGE OUT THEIR EYES / THEIR EVIL HEARTS WE'LL PULVERIZE... OH WHACKING DAY / OH WHACKING DAY / MAY GOD BESTOW HIS GRACE ON THEE. Here you go. Official Whacking Day parking. Ten dollars per axle. Woo hoo! Hooray! Take that, snake! And you, too! Snakes, snakes everywhere! You getting ready for Whacking Day? What's Whacking Day? Did you bring the pre-whacked snakes? Beautiful. Well, Marge, should I whack slow or fast? Slow... then fast. Uh-oh. Dad please, for the last time, I beg you, don't lower yourself to the level of the mob. Lisa, maybe if I'm part of that mob, I can help steer it in wise directions. Now, where's my giant foam cowboy hat and air horn? And now, to open this year's festivities, here's our Grand Marshall, ""The Prophet of Love""... Larry White! Barry White. No, it says here, Larry White. I know my own name. Yeah, well, we'll see. Ladies and Gentlemen, my unlimited love to y'all. It's truly an honor to be here at this... ... hey, what is this all about anyway? Oh God no! You people make me sick. Were they even listening to me? I uh, don't think so. And now, let's hear it for our own Miss Springfield! Gentlemen, start your whacking. Ew. A bug. If the snakes were in here we could protect them. Well, according to this, snakes ""hear"" by sensing vibrations in the ground. So, if we put our stereo speakers on the ground and play something with a lot of bass, those snakes'll be in here like Oprah on a baked ham. Oh, good idea! Let's see... bass, bass... ""Tiny Tim""... ""The Chipmunks Greatest Hits""... ""A Castrato Christmas""... ... CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOUR LOVE, BABE... Mr. White, can we borrow you for a minute? Anything for a lady. Don't bother the snakes. Leave all the snakes alone. Ah yeah. Oh babe... MY DARLING I... CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOUR LOVE, BABE. GIRL I DON'T KNOW... I DON'T KNOW WHY... CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOUR LOVE, BABE. / SOME THINGS I CAN'T GET USED TO / NO MATTER HOW I TRY / IT'S LIKE THE MORE YOU GIVE THE MORE I WANT / AND BABY THAT'S NO -- THAT'S NO LIE / TELL ME WHAT CAN I SAY / WHAT AM I GONNA DO? / HOW SHOULD I FEEL WHEN EVERYTHING... In here! Hey! Where'd all the snakes go? People of Springfield! Whacking Day is a sham! It was started in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the Irish. 'Tis true! I took many a lump, but 'twas all in good fun. Now wait a minute. How can you people turn on snakes after all they've done for you? I'm an old man. I hate everything but Matlock. Ooh, it's on now. Mrs. Glick, who killed all those rats in your basement? Snake did. And you like snakes, don't you Barry White? I love the sexy slither of a lady snake. Oh baby. Hooray for snakes! Hooray for snakes! Look at this everyone! Twelve dead snakes! I'm sick of you people. You're nothing but a pack of fickle mush heads. He's right. Give us hell, Quimby. Bart, I'm very impressed at the independent learning you've displayed here. Thanks, Seymour. Yes. Anyway, as a reward for your studying, I've decided to welcome you back to our school. You'll be reunited with your chums, Nelson, Jimbo, Dol... Oh dear God! I guess I've always used violence as a way of gettin' attention. Yes, yes, me too! Faster, Willie, faster! Now we give them the bikes, no one sues. What if they're dead, sir? Then we ride these bikes to Mexico -- and freedom, Willie! Freedom! Freedom! . I'll turn ya in at the first toll booth.","Ralph Wiggum, Mayor Joe Quimby, Security Guard, Young Grampa, Chief Wiggum, Lou, Milhouse Van Houten, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Scientist #2, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Man, Richard Nixon, Irishman, Kent Brockman, Crowd, Teenaged Guide, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Gary Chalmers, Seymour Skinner, Dewey Largo, Woman, Groundskeeper Willie, Hitler, Recruiter, Lenny Leonard, Evil Homer, Rev.
