431,436,"Oh, ya hate to see this. I love to see this! Now the other players are joining in. Uh-oh, Someone could lose a tooth! This is no time to pat the bunny, Maggie. Daddy's watching a very important Mid-Atlantic Hockey League Conference Semi-Final do-over game. As we enter the seventh amazing overtime, the members of Sesame Street on Ice wait impatiently to begin their matinee performance. Hold the Black Label, Mabel! The Utica Mohawks' Pete Mavroudis has broken through the 'topes' defense! Stop him, Babando! He winds up for the shot! And Delacroix slides in front! You're supposed to be spending time with your daughter. I will, when it's not sports season. I just want to know how the game ends. And this game is over! Unbelievable! You'll never see anything like that again! So that will do it from Wayne Bockhorn, Jean-Pierre PÃ©tomane, and me, Doc Jacques Lalonde, here at Utica's Kill-Kwik Rat Poison Arena. Wha-wha-what's the score?! Now stay tuned for ""Picking the Perfect Apple,"" it's already in progress. The score, damn you! Once again, today's final score... ...is already in the books. G'night! I will never... know... the score! You want to know the score? I'll tell you the score. Oh, Marge. This is a definite high point for our marriage. Here's the score, Mister: Yes? Your daughter barely knows who you are! That's ridiculous. Who's your daddy, Maggie? Who's your daddy? He is pretty good with her. Look Marge! It's just what you want. Me spending the day with Muggsy. Maggie. Marge, you're not naggy. You just set the bar impossibly high. Can you at least bring a sweater for Maggie? Impossibly high. Now, let's get started on the greatest daddy-daughter day ever! Not even heated up. Typical dog. This is it, Maggie -- the place where Daddy goes every morning. Now, you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while Daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder. Moe, what are you doing? I'm spiffin' up the place! Jeez, can't a guy clean his bar for the first time ever without people makin' polite inquiries? Huh. I got a window here. Hey, Maggie could play out there... while I watch her from in here. Whaddaya say, Maggie? Aw, her first enabling. Hi, Maggie! / Up here, beautiful! / Yo, Mags! It's me! Uncle Barney! Remember I taught you your ABCs. A-B- P-K... So, uh, I s'pose you guys are still wonderin' why I'm cleanin' the bar. Ooh, hey Maggie! Maggie, Maggie, Maggie! Hello Maggie... hello Maggie. Hey Maggie! Maggie look at my face! It all began about a month ago... It was a typical Friday night: me surfing the net at the public library, with occasional drinking fountain breaks. Ah, just how I like it: warm and rusty. I couldn't believe it -- I finally found an intelligent sophisticated woman who hadn't heard any of my knock-knock jokes. ""Orange who?"" All right Moe, give her the punchline nice and easy. Orange you glad I didn't say banana? The gargoyle has landed! ""You're funny. Very nice. Now, how can I put this? Um... ""Are you sure you're not actually some creepy guy in a public library?"" ""No. How 'bout you?"" Actually, there is a much creepier guy right next to me. You know I'm a woman. We used to own a cat together! She had babies! Here's yours! I would do anything to chat with Maya, short of actually purchasing a computer. We decided to take the next big step -- exchanging photos... Okay, this is it. I finally get to see what she looks like. Dast I click on this j-peg? No. I dasn't. Yes I dast! So, what does she look like? Whoa! Yeah, she was a knockout. Which meant I was screwed. Because now I had to send her a picture of me. All right, before I send this, I'd better, uh, un-beady the eyes... de-Neanderthal the brow... smooth out my hate lines... lighten up the ear hair... switch my lips... Then, black tie the whole deal. Aw, I can't build a relationship on a lie. The lies come later. She thinks I'm cute?! Oh frabjulous day! Calloo Callay! So, that's why I'm cleanin' things and flushin' things, and makin' this place look respectable. She's coming to meet me. Here. Tonight. Moe's rat-free tavern! Oh, ah, heya, Marge. Yeah, yeah, Homer's here. Oh, you want Homer. I'm sorry, I thought you meant Himmler. Heinrich Himmler. You know, the guy who invented the Heimlich manure? Those are two different people! Uh, well they're both here, and neither one's your husband. This press conference is over. Ooh, Maggie made some new friends. Aw, burrowing your head into your Daddy. A sign that my baby is happy and confident. Okay, she said she'd be here at exactly eight o'clock. You callin' my girl a liar?! Okay. I've been stood up. Moe, I'm down here. Oh, you're a little person? I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. What's the correct term? Little person. Whoa! Look at me bein' polite! So, aren't you gonna invite me in? Oh of course, of course. Um, I-I just have to -- I have to tidy up the place! Just one second. So Maya. Um, you always been this size, or is this like a Benjamin Button deal? No, I mean is, I just...your picture just made you look more... life-sized. That was taken at Legoland. I was afraid you'd be disappointed in the real me. Are you kiddin' me? You're the best thing to come into this bar since cable TV. And unlike cable TV, I ain't stealin' you from the Chinese restaurant across the street there. I see you watch ESPN Two! I know! Yeah, that's great there, Ling Chow. So, uh, you still want to go out? That's why I'm here. Great. Let me get a car seat. Car seat? I took out the passenger seat to save gas. But I'm gonna use it now. 'Cause we're gonna do the town! ...so instead of getting a new bar sign, I saved three hundred bucks by changing my name to Moe... Moe! You eat alone again tonight, huh? Table for one! Facing the wall! Whoa, whoa, whoa -- not so fast, garlic press. I'm here with my date. She's beautiful! But so far away. Mmm... you're a good kisser. Yeah, I practice by siphoning gas out of other people's tanks. But I never tasted super-premium that was half as good as you. Oh, Moe. Yeah. How'd your date go, Moe? Incredible. I've never felt like this before. It's like my heart wants to do her. Awww. So, when are we gonna meet her? Oh, I can't wait till you guys get to uh... Yep, that's what we'd do! Let me ask you guys somethin': how would you treat a person who's generally dynamite but uh, in some way... a little different? You mean like how we treat Homer? 'Cause he can't remember limericks? I can too! ""There once was this guy from an island off the coast of Massachusetts... uh, Nantucket, I think it was. Anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh... Look at him struggling with the simplest rhyme. It's a-a-b-b-a, dumbass! There you are! Aww. Innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. How sweet. Maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow. Come on, Maggie. Have some grapefruit. She seems upset. Maybe if I lay down a beat on my bongos, that'll soothe her. Dad, do you have any idea what's gotten into Maggie? How would I know? You've been spending so much time with her. I have not! Oh right, you think I do. When you leave your children, do you really know who you're leaving them with? Your little angels are safe with me. Enjoy your second honeymoon! You -- wash me unmentionables! And you! Pre-heat the oven for two children at four-fifty. When you can't be there, Prying-Eye Surveillance can. We take images from your camera, scramble them, beam them to our orbiting satellite, unscramble them, then scramble them again, then unscramble them that all-important final time. Our competitors claim we scramble our images too much. We say, ""Can you love your children too much?"" The only thing better than Prying-Eye watching your children, is you watching your children. And we all know that's not gonna happen. Wait a second, Marge: do you really want to use your baby as a tool to spy on your husband? Yes you do. I wasn't talking to you. When you say it, it's not just in your head. This is where I live. Uh... So is there a knob or an ""open sesame""-type deal, or what? My house is over there. You didn't actually think I lived in a tree, did you? No, hey, a lot of people live in trees... uh, Tarzan, the Berenstain Bears, flood victims... UMPA-LUMPA / WE ARE SO SMALL... Gah! Why should I be watchin' anything when I could look at the most beautiful thing in the world: youse. Mese? Dat's right. Kiss the troll and win a prize. Listen... there's one thing that keeps bothering me. Is it my religion? 'Cause I am a snake handler, but not an observant one. If we have kids, they just have to have a ceremony with a cobra by age three so grandfather will be happy. No, that's fine. It's just that I can't help wondering why you've never introduced me to anyone you know. When your mailman waved to us, you made me hide under that traffic cone. Well, I do know this one couple -- the Simpsons I believe their name is -- that ain't too judgmental. She's a standup dame and he's a fall-down drunk. We'll make a double date of it. Now, let's get back to what we were... Hey. What's goin' on? You've turned into a doll! I just do that to freak people out. Here she is, uh, Homer. The wonderful girl I been tellin' you about. Pleased to meet you. Uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but I have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that I can't help wondering about. In a nuclear power plant, just how is nuclear energy turned into electricity? Well... If I remember my high school physics, the controlled nuclear reaction creates steam which powers a turbine... Man oh man, slap a ring on that! All right, Homer. Let's see what my baby's been up to. Here we are, Maggie. That park you love... Marge! Moe and Maya are here for a double date. Oh! Okay, I'm coming. See you when the moon comes out. Man, that made me thirsty. For you. She's beautiful, Moe. Yeah. She sure is. Here comes ours, honey. Would you look at me. I'm the happiest bartender in the world. Sorry, fellas. Maya... there's something I wanna ask ya, um... I don't know why I'm so nervous... this makes more sense than anything I've ever done... well, other than keepin' all my Netflix movies and sayin' the post office lost 'em. Anyway... Um... will you marry me? Are you asking me to be your... little woman? As long as you don't mind having a small wedding. And we can drink champagne out of an acorn top. Our first dance will be on the head of a pin! I've been hoggin' all the good ones. All right, now you go. But hey, keep it short! What's the matter, Doll? We were just having fun. I stopped having fun about ten jokes ago. And you just kept going. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Forgive me, kitten... I mean cat... I mean, tiger... I mean saber-toothed tiger. I mean-- I think you should go now. Okay. I screwed this up pretty bad and, uh, I'm sorry. How long do you people remember things? Get out. Guys, after all the years I've given you advice, now I need a little advice from you. We never follow your advice. The one time I did, I went to jail for three years. You made some good friends, didn't ya? Just 'cause you're chained to a guy don't make him your friend. Tomato, tomahto. Now how am I gonna win Maya back? Well, if I've learned anything from romantic comedies, is that you've got to make a grand, reckless gesture, the kind that looks like it might blow up in your face. But what if it blows up in my face? With your face, who cares? ...you gotta make me shorter, Doc. What do you mean? I mean take out bones, guts, whatever you gotta do to make me a micro-Moe. What you're asking is completely unethical. No licensed physician would perform that operation. Now close your eyes and when you wake up, you will be a woman. No, no, no, no, no -- I want to be shorter for a woman. Uh-oh, I mixed you up with the last guy! I look nothing like Julie Newmar! Maya is gonna love the new me! Moe, why did you do this?! I ain't done nothin' yet. But I'm considering it because I want to share your world forever. Moe, if you have to be like me to love me, then you're not seeing the real me. Oh, I see you, Maya. I see you every time I look at the moon. I see ya in puddles after it rains. I see ya in the glazed eye of a barfly who's had one too many. So cut me down to size, Doc. And can you wrap up the bones so my dog can have fun with 'em. But Moe, I don't want someone who sees me as short. I want someone who just sees me as beautiful. Goodbye. Okay, no more delays. I've got to watch this. I'll save you, Maggie! I'm telling! Now what? Aw, sweetie, you saved me. Well, I promise that wherever you go in this world, I will always be there for you. Oh Maggie, I love you from the tip of your toes to the bow on your hair with the red blinking light. God bless your mother for making you with me. Whatcha watchin', honey? Homer Simpson, you are a strong finisher. And I'm good at beginnings. What's the matter, Homer? Not a thing in the world. Yeah, I wish I could say the same. Moe, this was a great thing for you. You went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. And sometime when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. And that means someone can love you again. And that'll make you smile. Hey! Homer was right. Who'da thought such a little woman could make me feel so big?","Carl Carlson, Hockey Announcer #1, Maya, Chinese Restaurateur, Marge Simpson, Hockey Announcer #2, Homer Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Nanny, Dewey Largo, Umpa-lumpas, Lenny Leonard, Dr. Nick Riviera, Moe Szyslak, Cat Lady, Announcer, Barflies, Barney Gumble, Thought Bubble Lenny, Luigi, Bart Simpson, Hockey Announcer #3",7.2,604.0,16,2009-04-05,2009,20,Eeny Teeny Maya Moe,6.5,40864.0
