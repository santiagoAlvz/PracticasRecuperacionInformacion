208,212,"And now, the conclusion of our Thousand Dollar Movie -- Roger Corman's... Titanic! We're safe now, Clarice. We made it away from that cursed ship. Now I can relax and take off this stifling bikini. Look out! Behind you! We'll return for the remainder of the conclusion after these messages. Well, I'd rather get a message than see another lousy commercial. People of earth! We have traveled all the way from space to attend the most astro-tastic event in the entire universe. You said it, Phil. It's the Bi-Monthly Springfield Sci-Fi Convention. That's right, it's BI-MON-SCI-FI-CON. Come meet all your favorite stars! Mark Hamill! Alf! And many more! Plus, tag-team robot wrestling! It's the Mighty Robots of Battlestar Galactica vs. the Gay Robots of Star Wars! Ow! Ow! Stop! Please, save me, R2! Oh, you stupid little tramp! You're so boring! I hate you! Ow! Ow! Ow! Remember, it's BI-MON-SCI-FI-CON. Be there and be square! Well, beats work. Yup, beats school. Sorry, we're all full. Are you sure this is the sci-fi convention? It's full of nerds. Hi, Lisa. Hey, Lisa. Güten tag. Hi. People! People! This man has actually been in outer space. Ha! Nobody cares! This is one small step towards firing your ass. Hey, wait. I saw that Lost in Space movie. You are not Doctor Smith. Oh, the pain. The paaain! The pain of it all! You have still got it, Doctor Smith. Silence, you nickel-plated nitwit! My dear boy, I'd be happy to show you my resume, if you'd care to meet me later in the food court... Danger! Danger, Bart Simpson! Someone has mixed an ""Amazing Spider-Man"" in with the ""Peter Parker The Spectacular Spider-Man"" series. This will not stand. Pardon me. But I wish to tender a serious cash offer for this stack of water-damaged Little Lulus. ""A"", that is not water, it is diet Mr. Pibb, and ""B"" I-- Tell me, how do you feel about forty-five-year-old virgins who still live with their parents? Comb the SweeTarts out of your beard and you're on. Don't try to change me, baby. Welcome futurists, cyberphiles, and the rest of you dateless wonders! And now to push this convention into hyperspace, the man who put the star in ""Star Wars,"" a real burr under Darth Vader's saddle, Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill! Hey, thanks everybody. You know, I'm here today as Luke Skywalker. But I'm also here... to talk about Sprint. As you can see, you stand to save up to seventeen cents a month over the more dependable providers... Ahhh, talk about ""Star Wars!"" / Yeah! / Star Wars! You stupid nerds! He's trying to save you money on long distance! ""Star Wars,"" huh? Well, let me ask you this. How many of you have ever dreamed of being in that movie? Well, you're in luck. 'Cause we're gonna act out a scene and I'll need a volunteer to play Obi Wan. Kenobi?! Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark! Pick me! My whole life has been leading to this moment! Aw, like hell it has! If anyone's gonna play Obi, it's me! All right, step away, you foolish amateurs. Keep back! Keep out of it! The role is mine! With the acting and the groupies and the ""Luke! Luke! Save me!"" with the lightsaber and the vwing, vwing, vwiing. That's not how you vwing! We're doooomed! Doooooomed! Oh God, can't this town go one day without a riot? Gadzooks! Where are my bodyguards? Is there anything fluffier than a cloud? If there is, I don't want to know about it. Oh, dear. Oh, my. We're screwed. Use your light saber. What, and break it? You know, George Lucas makes me pay for these. Take him! He's the one you want! Not the hair! Back off, you freaking dweebs! Oh, poor Mark Hamill. That swarm of nerds is gonna kill him! Neeerrrds! Get out of there! Mr. Hamill, Mr. Mayor, come on! Who are you? Homer Simpson -- nerd buster. And I'm gettin' you out of here! I can't, Homer. I twisted my ankle. You guys go on without me! Never! Follow me. Oh, how was I supposed to know it's not a real spaceship? Dad, over here! Oh, my God. Someone has to go back in for Maggie! Forget Maggie! She's gone! I've got Maggie. Wow, that was close. Well, thanks a lot, Homer. Well, it's all-- Hey, I thought you twisted your ankle. Oh, yeah, well, see, the thing about that is... Hey, boss, we were just talking about you. You call yourselves bodyguards? You're fired! Fired, huh? Who else are you gonna find to take a bullet for ya? Or have his genitals hooked up to a car battery? I'll tell you who. Him! Woo hoo! Homer, I don't think you were listening to what he just-- I said, ""woo hoo."" As a bodyguard, your only loyalty is to your pro-tectee. Not to your family. Not to your country. Not to Moohamed. Even during Ramadan? Shut your sass-hole, boy. These melons represent your pro-tectees. Throughout this course, you will pro-tect your personal melon as if it was paying your salary. Wha? Okay, listen up! My goal is to assassinate that watermelon. Your job is to take the bullet. Go! Go! Go! Go! Pow! Nooo! Well, your dive wasn't bad. But I just didn't believe your ""Nooo!"" You gotta sell it. Remember, your ""Nooo!"" is what gets you your next job. Now drop and gimme twenty. Nooooooooooo! Better. You ladies are without a doubt the most sorrowful clique at the dance -- not one of you fit to guard a Russian rock band! However, your checks have cleared, so you all graduate. Congratulations. And now, in honor of your achievement, here is the theme song from the hit motion picture, ""The Bodyguard."" ""AND I-I-I-E-E-I-I-I-E-E-I-I-I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOOOUUU!..."" Ha! Clear! Oh, for Pete's sake. The pig is in the poke. You know, I really don't care for that code name. Look out, Marge! Cat! Nah! I know you're excited about starting your new job, but could you just relax for now? Hold it! What's your clearance? We just want to get a snack. Access denied. But, Da-- Homer! I don't want you using your new sleeper hold on the children. They'll be fine in half an hour. That's not the point. And another thing. I asked you to take out the garbage three days ago and you still haven't-- Hmm, still half an hour till dinner. Oh, well... It's a real honor to be guarding your body, sir. Just remember, you represent the office of the mayor, so always comport yourself in a manner befitting-- Quick! Honk at that broad! Good work, Simpson. I couldn't be happier with the way that went. Hey Homer, I told you not to come 'round here no more till you paid your tab. Or at least cleaned up that mess you made in the bathroom. Now y-- Mayor Quimby?! Homer, why didn't you say you was with the mayor? Shove off, puke-holes. Get out of there! These stools are reserved for the mayor and his cronies. Heh. Here's a couple of Düffenbraus, on the house, of course. Semi-imported. Keep 'em comin'. Your generosity is greatly appreciated, especially during this health inspection season. Oh yeah, yeah, right. Health inspection. That reminds me. Your change, sir. We're workin' on that roach situation, I swear to God. Eh, you should see the hospital. ... And after Moe's, we went to Krustyburger and the mayor got some more change, and I ordered a double double, but they gave me the double double double double. And then Apu gave the Mayor lots of change for... Dad, don't you see what's going on? That ""change"" was a bribe. Oh, honey, don't be so naive. That's how the world works. Sure, the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time. No he doesn't. Trains are regulated by the Federal Department of Transportation. And recent studies have shown that... Homer! Thank you, Mayor Quimby, for honoring us with the school milk concession. Well, the good children of Springfield need their milk, and I need my... Please accept this kickback as a token of our esteem. Thank you, Fat Tony. However, in the future, I would prefer a nondescript briefcase to the sack with a dollar sign on it. So, how'd you get the nickname ""Legs""? Well, that's an interesting story. It seems President Kennedy's father... Oooh, mini-cannoli! Hey! I called that! I saw it first! Come back here! Milking room? I hope you cows are decent. Oh! Crap on a crutch! They're milking rats! Milk-ing rats! Rats? I'm outraged. You promised me dog or higher. Bart, no! Hey, my milk! I traded my math book for that! Dad! What a nice surprise. Oh, get that away from me! Kids, I don't want you drinking any more milk. Ever. Can I still drink it? Go nuts. All right! You... monster! How could you do that to the children?! Those wacky gangsters. What are you gonna do? And to think, I respected you! And defended you! You wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me! Okay, we'll call it even. Oh my God, I killed the mayor. All right, stay calm. I'll just use the body to stage an elaborate farce, à la ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" and... Help! Help! His corpse is climbing the building! I'm alive, you idiot! Pull me in! A-- Wait a second. I'm not saving you unless you promise to get that rats' milk out of the schools. But the gangsters will kill me. You're forgetting, you've got the best bodyguard in the business. Now promise, or I'll let you fall to your death. All right! All right, I promise. Shake on it? Relax, you're in good hands. Now come on, I'll pull you up. Not so fast. I can see into the interns' restroom from here. Did you know that this is how FDR met Eleanor? All right. Pull me up. Six queens. Read 'em and weep. Not so fast. Seven queens. Freeze, goombahs! We're shuttin' ya down, ya filthy Italians. Oh right, right. Filthy Italian-Americans. Gentlemen, if you would simply consult my dear friend, Mayor Quimby, I am confident this can be-- Not this time, Fat Tony. The mayor's office is not for sale. Can you, uh, edit out the laughs? I am not so much disappointed as I am blinded with rage. Ooh, the Mafia guy's all mad. Oh, what are you gonna do? Call your Godfather? Huh? Ooh, Godfather. Break it down! It's pure. Pull the plug, boys. Run free, little vermin. The city is yours! ... And so, as the rats' milk is returned to the sewers, the circle of life is complete. Ah, Fat Tony. Do you have any comment? I don't get it. Everyone loves rats, but they don't want to drink the rats' milk? Huh. Any words for the mayor? Hello, Mayor Quimby. I would like to remind you that accidents will happen. Like the killing of you by us. Aren't you scared, Dad? I mean, if I were Fat Tony, and God willing someday I will be, I'd just be stewing in my jail cell, gettin' madder and madder. Oh, don't worry about that, boy. He's already out on bail. Well, I'm off to work. You're guarding the mayor tonight? After Fat Tony swore revenge? It's my duty, Marge. Besides, those mobsters don't scare me. Bart, would you go start Daddy's car? Homer! What? There's nothing to worry about. Well, then you start it. All right, fine. I'll take a cab. Homer, I'm, uh, not sure it's wise to go out right now. I was thinking of a quiet evening at home with the, uh... wife. Oh, I get it. You're worried about those mobsters, aren't ya? No, no, I truly do want to stay home with the... wife. You've gotta snap out of this funk, Mayor. I'm gonna take you someplace where you can relax and forget all about gangsters. Uh, excuse me... Nnyyeeeeeesss? Do you have a table for the mayor? Nnyyeeeeeesss. Why do you talk that way? I had a stroooke. Dear Lord, please make tonight's production better than ""Othello"" with Peter Marshall. Okay, Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, what's-his-name... Fat Tony?! All right, Fat Tony. If it's trouble with Quimby you're after-- Please, I am only here as a devotee of the lively arts. But I do have something for the mayor that perhaps you could deliver. Mayor, Fat Tony asked me to give you this-- You moron! That's the Kiss of Death! Oh no. Wait... maybe I didn't do it right. Never mind that, just go patrol the perimeter. Ah, au gratin potatoes, that's a quality side. Nooooooooo!!! Potatoes are clean. The poison must be in the steak. ""... GUYS AND DOLLS. WE'RE JUST A BUNCH OF CRAZY GUYS AND DOLLS. OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, GUYS AND DOLLS...!"" ""AND OH THOSE DOLLS! WE'RE DANCING, YEAH, YEAH, YE-AH! AND GAMBLING, YEAH, YEAH, YE-AH!"" This is a conceptual nightmare. I mean, Nathan Detroit would never wear this. And this song isn't even in the show. I don't have time for this. I've got seventy five shortcakes to strawberry. Now get out there, Luke. ... GUYS AND DOLLS. WE'RE JUST A BUNCH OF CRAZY GUYS AND DOLLS! ""OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, GUYS AND DOLLS!"" ""AND HOODS AND MOLLS! WE'RE DANCING, YEAH, YEAH, YE-AH! AND GAMBLING, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAAAH!"" I want the mayor dead... I want his wife dead... I want his cat and his dog dead.... Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, who was before the cat? Just kill the mayor. You're not mad at me, are ya? ""... LUKE, BE A JEDI TONIGHT. JUST BE A JEDI TONIGHT..."" DO IT FOR YODA WHILE WE SERVE OUR GUESTS A SODA... ""AND DO IT FOR CHEWIE AND THE EWOKS, AND ALL THE OTHER PUPPETS..."" LUKE BE A JEDI TONIGHT. Hey! You're in this number. Get out there and shake that money maker! But I'm just here to kill... Wha-- That guy with the knife sure can dance, huh? He looks awfully familiar. I think I saw him in ""Rent,"" or ""Stomp,"" or ""Clomp,"" or some piece of crap. Hey, pal, that's my head shot up there next to the pepper steak, and don't you forget it! You're all talk, Hamill. You never even finished Jedi school. Show's over, Mayor! Look out! Gimme that knife! No, it's mine! Homer... use... the forrr... The force?! The forks... use the forks...! Oh. Yesss! Nobody messes with the mayor when Homer Simpson's on -- Aw, crap. Oh, Fat Tony. What? What did I do? I checked with the doctor. He said Mayor Quimby's gonna be fine... and I was electric as Nathan Detroit. What did you think of me? Ohh, I'd say you were luminous, magnetic, incandescent. Ohh... cheer up, Homer. I think you made a great bodyguard. Really? Would you say I was magnetic? Absolutely. Aww... Mr. Skywalker! Mr. Skywalker! Homer, I think you know what to do. Shoot! I forgot my light saber.
