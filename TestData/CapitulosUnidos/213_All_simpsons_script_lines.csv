209,213,"This is Kent Brockman live at the Monty Burns Casino. Moments from now, the house that social security checks built will be demolished to make way for a casino-themed family hotel. This must be heartbreaking for you, sir. I'm just thinking of my employees -- all the card sharps, bottom dealers, and shills. Where will they go? They're managing your chain of nursing homes, sir. Excellent. Gone are such headliners as ""Little Timmy and the Shebangs,"" ""The Shebangs,"" and ""The New Shebangs featuring Big Timmy."" Remember how excited we were when this place opened? Then a week later, we just forgot about it. I'm surprised they bothered to move it when they moved the town. Oh, I can explain that. You see... Five... four... three...two.. All right! Here comes the implosion! Implosion? But I thought you said... Hockey puuuuucks... Don Rickles zinged you, Marge. Dust!!! Eat my dust, dust! Dad, we hit Don Rickles! I'm okay. But the Puerto Rican guy's trying to steal your hubcaps! Just kiddin'. ""I'm a nice guy..."" We'd better stop and get the car washed. Aaah, what's the rush? Might rain next week. Hey, Homer. Car's kinda dirty. Really? You think I should get it washed? Yeah, maybe. You listen to your friends, but you never listen to me. Hey, that's great. All right, young'uns, bath time! Cover up your eyes and drop your britches. Who wants wax? Yayyy! I insist you take special care with my collection of valuable and humorous bumper stickers, particularly this one... which was given to me by a Harrison Ford look-alike. No hablo Ingles, senor. Wow, you can't find this stuff anywhere! Seals and Crofts, Pablo Cruise, Air Supply, Ohhhh, Loggins and Oates! And it's free! I've never heard of these bands, Mom. What kind of music do they play? Crap rock? No... Wuss rock? That's it. Ten dollars?! What is this, a car wash for millionaires? Throw hot wax on him, Dad! Howdy, Homer. Five dollars, please. Hey! How did Churchy La Femme get half price? Senior citizen's discount. Senior citizen? Flanders? Well, we'll see about that. ... And once again, tithing is ten per cent off the top. That's gross income, not net. Please people, don't force us to audit. Now we're going to pass this around a second time. Brother Ned, if you'll do the honors. I wouldn't do that, Reverend. You see, ""Saint Flanders"" is as crooked as you or me! / What's he talking about? / What's he saying? / Who is he? / etc. That's right, it's my sad duty to rat out this man for defrauding a car wash. How, you ask? With a phony senior discount card! Well, that's not quite true-- Did you or did you not use a senior citizen discount card at said car wash? Well, I did, but-- Now I'm not a fancy big-city lawyer... But it seems to me that a senior citizen has to be over 55. Isn't that so? Well, yes. And you are how old? I suppose, if you must know... I'm... well, I'm... I'm sixty. / My God, he looks so good. / He looks terrific. He looks so young. / Oh, really? What's your secret, Flanders? Goat placenta? Monkey sweat? Some kind of electric hat? Holy water? It's holy water, right?! Aaah, it burns! L-Listen, folks, there's no magic formula. I just follow the three C's: clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of Vitamin Church. / Oh, well... And, of course, I resist all the major urges. All of them?! You mean, you've never splurged and, say, eaten an entire birthday cake, then blamed it on the dog? You've never licked maple syrup off your lover's stomach? You've never snuck out of church to break into cars? No, no, and double-no! I haven't done any of those things, folks. You name it, I haven't done it! Geez, Flanders. You're 60 years old, and you haven't lived a day in your life. Yeah, even the boy in the bubble had a deck of cards. Oh, can you believe it? It almost seemed like those folks were, were, were making fun of old steady Neddy. Well, you may be a bit cautious, but what's wrong with that? Some people like chunky peanut butter, some like smooth. Mmm-hmm. And some people steer clear of that whole hornet's nest. I'll stick with just plain white bread, thank you very much. Maybe with a-- Glass of water on the side for dippin'. Gosh darn it! Am I that pre-diddley-dictable? I've wasted my whole dang diddley life. Hey there! Look at that! Everyone's living it up except Ned. Help! We're being carjacked! Don't get clever, old man. Now take us to Dress Barn. Where've you been, Neddy? In the bathroom. Not trimmin' my mustache. Whaddaya think? Do I remind you of troubled troubadour David Crosby? No, you remind me of silly billy Ned Flanders. Would a silly billy sit like this? Rod, call Doctor Stein. All right, Bart! Fire in the hole! Okay, no more gasoline. Full power! Never a dull moment, huh, Homer? You got that right. Throw on the mesquite, Bart! Mesquite it is! Here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, Homer. But I, I was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun. Well, well, well. So flawless Flanders needs help from stinky-pants Simpson. Yeah, I, I guess I do. Welly, welly, welly... Mr. Clean wants to hang with Dirty Dingus Magee. How 'bout it, Homer? Will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life? Wellity, wellity, wellity... Stop that! Will you help me or not? Let's do it. So what about all this meat? Eh, the Missus will clean that up. Now it's Marge's time to shine! First of all, I get five dollars a day plus expenses. Seems fair. And I'll need your signature... here, here, aaannnnd... initial here. Heh, you're not really giving my father power of attorney, are you? Of course I... Oh, my stars! I can't do that. Well that's unfortunate. It really is. All right. Congratulations! Welcome to the Homer Simpson Program. So, what happens next? One day soon I will come for you, and then the game will begin. Could be in the middle of the night. It could be when you least expect it. Or whatever's good for you. I don't care. Okay, Homer. I'm ready to learn. What's the first lesson? Just give me the topic sentence. Gimme that! That's your problem. You're living up here. You gotta live down here. In the impulse zone. If you want to be like me, you gotta make snap decisions. Like this. We're going to break the bank at the Monty Burns Casino! Homer, they blew that up yesterday. Oh yeah, right. Then we're goin' to Las Vegas! Which is actually back in that direction. ""Nobody's goin' to take my Ned / I'll teach him to have fu-un / Ooh, he's a Flanders machine..."" That sure was a fun trip to Las Vegas! Eh, too many kids. Ooh, it's goin' on eight-thirty. I'd better call Maude and tell her where I am. Relax, I called her from the gas station. Thanks, buddy. Sucker. Oh, gee, Homer, this all looks so garish. Oh, the lights, the noise, the letter X -- i-it's all designed to inflame the senses. I'm overstimulated! I gotta get out of this town! I don't think so. I think you'll find escape is quite impossible. No, I got it. Oh! Oh! Would you like to be in the audience for my infomercial? Help me! My daughter's not talented! Hey! Lance Murdock! If he's not careful, his scooter could roll right down that ramp. He's a daredevil, Ned. He laughs at death. Oh, when I wanna laugh, I'll take Bob Saget, thank you very much. And now, the indestructible Lance Murdock will jump his SuiCycle over an audience member. And he'll do it while attempting to open a locked safe on his head. Any volunteers? Ooh, ooh, ooh, pick him! Pick him! No, Homer, no! I wanna do something exciting, but I can't just go from zero to thirty like that! I-I could be killed. Fine, I'll do it. Where do you want me? On the X. You mean that one with the red paint? Uh, yeah, paint. Now, it's of critical importance that you don't-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll figure it out. This isn't rocket science. Well, actually, there are several rockets mounted to the-- Bo-ring. Okay, he's cleared the ring of fire! Past the ring of ice! Over the dog doo stick! He's cracked the safe! Hey Flanders, Don't spill my beer! Oh God, lay down! Lay down! Clear! He's all right, folks! Okey-doke, let's hit the tables. God Homer, watching you risk your life turned my beat box all the way up to .. Rumba! Yea, I was praying you'd be safe but to be honest, part of me wanted to see ya get splattered. Oh, I think someone just had his first taste of blood loss. Let's see... what's Marge's birthday? Barney is July fifteenth, same as Lassie's, so Marge's must be... fifty... oh, forget it. Flanders, what's your birthday? Aw, leave me out of this, Homer. Games of chance are strictly forbidden by Deuteronomy seven-- Seven, eh? Seven a winner. Way to go, Flanders. The Bible's finally pulling its weight. Got any more holy numbers? Oh, I got a bunch, Homer, but I just don't feel right ab... Oh, Lord, what should I do? Keep gaming. J-- What? It means gambling. Keep gambling. Oh, righty-o. One betting disk please. ""One betting disk please."" Watch and learn. Aaand, fourteen black. Well, there you go. Now how 'bout a drink? How do you do it, Homer? How do you silence that little voice that says, ""Think""? You mean Lisa? Oh no. I-I mean common sense. Oh, that. That can be treated with our good friend alcohol. You might want to write that down. Where the hell's your notebook? You threw it out the... Oh, never mind. Just pay attention. Slave girl? Oh, slave girl? More libations, my imperial conquerors? Whuh? More booze? Oh, yeah. Two more of these, please. And for you, Ned? I'll have a Shirley... no, a virgin... no, make it a children's... Oh, what the heck, you only live once. Give me a... White wine spritzer! Oh my goodness, Homer. Wake up! Look at this place! We must have really painted the town last night. I have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like vomit, and I don't remember a thing! Welcome to my world. Oh, I did it! I conquered my fears and I made up for a lot of lost livin'. And I owe it all to the Homer Simpson program. The what now? Well, it's about time you two woke up. Well, of course a-- Who are you? Who am I? I'm Mrs. Ned Flanders. Hey, smooth move, Flanders! And I'm Mrs. Homer Simpson! Here comes that vomit again. Eeech. Okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay. Okay, you're saying that Ned and me married you two? Oh yeah, we're hitched, all right. 'Til death do us part. Mm-hm, I'm workin' on that. Ned, no! Think of your wives! Wait a minute. This could be some kind of scam -- or possibly, scam-ola. We would remember if we got married. Boy, you did have a lot to drink last night, Homeo. Take a look at this. Ahh, precious memories. I okeley dokely shmokely do! And do you, Homer, take this cocktail waitress you just met to be your lawfully wedded wife? What did you call me? Do you want to get married? Married! Sure. Sock it to me, baby. By the power vested in me by the Chicago Outfit, I now pronounce you husbands and wives. We are so dead. Ladies, we want to do the honorable thing. So breakfast is on us, with full waffle-bar privileges. But first, I'm afraid we have some bad news. The waffle bar is closed. I'm sorry. I'm so very-- Homer! The bad news, ladies, is we already have wives. Well, you can't be very happy with them if you married us. You two fellas are the nicest husbands we've ever had, and we're not giving you up without a fight. But Ginger, honey, I am not the catch I appear to be. Ginger's my wife. Are you sure? Oh, rats. No offense, Sweetie. Homer, why don't we go make the girls some custom omelettes? Geez, I've never seen anyone so whipped so fast. What are we gonna do, Homer? My kids are gonna be traumatized! And then there's Maude. And then there's Maude! I don't know, Flanders, having two wives could have its advantages. Chop, chop, dig, dig. Chop, chop, dig, dig. Chop, chop, dig, dig... You know, Homie, there's so much more two wives could do for you. I hear digging, but I don't hear chopping. Ooh, a friendly bee. Ow! Ow, that sting hurt so much. We gotta get outta this, Ned. Well, do something! This is all your fault. You and your stupid program. Blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the program. The program is rock solid. The program is sound. Yoohoo. Oh, those awful women want their omelettes. Ginger throws Ned a kiss. How are we going to get outta this mess in an honorable and decent-- Ooh, nuts. I don't know. Omelettes have a lot of fat in them. Forget it, you're married. Let yourself go. Hey, they're running away! How can a fat man run so fast? No, the fat one's mine. Yea. Come on baby, show Gil a four. Craps. Oh no, why did I bet the company payroll? Ohhh, ol' Gil's in a lot of trouble. Somebody help! Our husbands are trying to ditch us! Someone dishonoring their marriage vows? Not in Las Vegas! Attention all employees. We've got two runaways! Stop them! Oh no! A lion! Drederick Tatum! Your behavior is.. is unconscionable! The Moody Blues! Cold-hearted Homer ditching his wife / While ancient Ned runs for his life / Chips of red and blue and white / But we decide... Can the poems, it's ass-whuppin' time. I want fatty. What if we switched wives? Would that help? For the last time, no! Hel-lo. Our ticket to freedom. So long, su-- Get out and stay out! Las Vegas doesn't care for out-of-towners. Take your money and go someplace else. Why did he disrespect us? And don't you ever try to marry us again! We found some guys who know how to treat a woman. But Amber, I can change! Will you shut up? All right, let's get our stories straight for Marge and Maude. We were out buying them fabulous gifts... What's the occasion? Because we love them, Jackass. Anyhoo, we came out of Walmart, when suddenly one hundred spaceships... Homer! You're right, you're right. Fifty spaceships, beamed us aboard. They gang-probed you, while I discovered an invention that blew their heads up and saved America. Uh, do I have to be gang-probed? Would you rather tell Maude the truth? What did the aliens look like? Well, I only saw them from the back, 'cause they were so busy gang probing you. Hello, little birdie. Ah!!
