246,250,"Here you go, boy. Soup's on. Hey, if you're out here, then who's in there? Whoa, a badger! Sorry man, you can't crash here. C'mon, let's go. Well boy, looks like you've got yourself a roommate. C'mon, Lis. There's gotta be a way to lure that badger out. Well, according to WhatBadgersEat.Com, ""Badgers subsist primarily on a diet of stoats, voles and marmots."" Hmm... stoats, stoats... Stoats are weasels, Bart. They don't come in cans. Then what's this? That says ""corn,"" Bart. Must you embarrass me? Here we are. ""In a pinch, badgers have even been known to eat woodpeckers."" Perfect. Hey, Todd! Can we borrow your woodpecker? I guess so. But we need him back by six. It's his birthday. Okay. Ha ha ha ha ha. Television broken? No, there's a badger in there. Badger, my ass. It's probably Milhouse. Milhouse? Milhouse? It's a badger all right... Or possibly a griffin. Bart, do you have any dynamite in your room? Tons. Get it. No, Dad! We don't want to kill him! Let's call animal control. Great idea. Then we should call the doctor about this. How did the badger do that without ripping your shirt? What am I, a tailor? Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please make sure you have the correct area code. Area code? But it's a local call. The phone company ran out of numbers, so they split the city into two area codes. Half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939. 939?! What the hell is that? Oh, my life is ruined. Geez, you just have to remember three extra numbers. Oh, if only it were that easy, Marge. Go away. We've got bigger problems now. I'm not gonna stand for this. I'm gonna call the newspapers, the TV stations, the gas stations, everybody. I hate this new area code. Like I don't have enough to remember already. Don't you miss the old 636, Carl? I'm not sure which one's better. The 6 is closer to the 3, so you've got convenience there, but the 9 has less to do with Satan, which is a plus in this religious world of ours. What really burns me up is they didn't give us one word of warning. What do you mean? They ran those TV commercials about it. And that big radio campaign. Don't forget the leaflets they dropped from the space shuttle. And the two weeks we all spent at Area Code Camp. Not a single word of warning. ... and traffic's all backed up, due to a mattress on the freeway. A mattress?! Uh-oh. Joan Collins must be in town! Oh, behave! Joan Collins? That girl sleeps with everybody! Okay, time to give away freeeee concert tickets! Whachu talkin' 'bout? What we're talkin' 'bout, Gary, is the Who. We're giving away tickets to next week's concert at Springfield's historic Yahoo Search Engine Arena. The Who? I love bands! And now we'll dial our big winner at random. DIALING... AT... RANDOMMM! Okay, let's start with 5-5-5... ... 0, 1, 1... aaannnd 3. That's my number! Ahoy hoy. Hey, that's not me! Dad, we're not in their area code anymore. Congratulations, you're gonna rendezvous with the Who! It's not fair! I've been a fan of the Who since the very beginning, when they were the Hillbilly Bugger Boys. You should call that radio station and let 'em have it. Good idea. Why you little... I know that some of you are upset about the area code change... especially those of you covered with dynamite... First, let me reassure you your fears are groundless, and your complaints moronic. That's good. This film will explain everything to you in words that you can understand. Hi. I'm Phoney McRingring, mascot and president of the telephone company. And I'm here to explain why the convenience of one area code in... Your town. ... has been replaced by the convenience of two area codes. Uh, I have a question, Phoney. It's a movie, Dad. Quiet, honey. Daddy's asking the man a question. You're probably thinking, ""Sure, more area codes are great, and I don't mind paying the extra hidden fees, but how will I remember all those numbers?"" Well, scientists have discovered that even monkeys can memorize ten numbers. Are you stupider than a monkey? How big of a monkey? Of course you're not. Well I'm convinced. A professional- looking film like that has gotta be right. I agree. Two area codes is more convenient. I like it. Wait a minute! We haven't heard from me yet. The nut with the dynamite. The phone company is bamboozling you! I accuse the phone company of making that film on purpose! Well of course we did... Now, I'm not one to make trouble... but it seems to me that everyone who got to keep the old, or ""classic"" 636 area code, lives on... the rich side of town! Poppycock! I never! And as usual, we Joe Twelve-Packs get the royal screw job. Homer's right! We're gettin' the Joan Collins special. / He's right. / We're gettin' it but good. Well, I've had it! You rich snobs aren't pushin' us around anymore! What are you pathetic slobs gonna do about it? Well, I... Nice wiring, Bart. It worked on the test-corpse. Okay, Plan B. Fellow 9-3-9'ers, I say we break off and form our own city! Yeah! / Our own city! / Screw the snobs! / Yeah, let's go! Viva la revoluci√≥n! Now who's stupid? There. We're officially a city. Now we just sit back and wait for an NFL franchise. Say, I couldn't help but overhear. I represent the Arizona Cardinals... Keep walkin' Good decision there, Homer. You showed a lot of poise. Yeah, maybe you oughta be Mayor of New Springfield. Mayor, eh? The Mayor... Starring Homer Simpson. I reluctantly accept this highly-paid, glamorous job. Presenting our new plaque. I say the time for bitterness has passed. Let us extend to our brothers in New Springfield the olive branch of... New Springfield rocks! Go ahead and laugh! We have a better town bird! Oh yeah? What is it? The bluebird. Damnit! More wheat cakes, Mr. Mayor? Read my lips: Yes. Dad, you got syrup on your sash. No problem. If you ask me... Stop right there. ... it's stupid to divide the city over something as silly as an area code. It would be like you and mom splitting up every time you have a fight. Sweetie, you know your mother and I only stay together for the sake of my political career. That's not true. Big grins! That'll play great in the sticks. Oh, that was fifty already? Go long! Hey, look what I found! A novelty flying disc! Give it back! That's my novelty flying disc. You're in Olde Springfield now. Everything on this side of the park belongs to us. Hey, his pants are in our park, too. Get 'em! My homework is in your park. Let's do it! What does freedom mean to me? All right, root beer, bananas and toilet paper... Fifty percent Out-of-towners' Tax... Out-of-towner Tax?! I'm sorry Mrs. Simpson, but we have to charge you foreign devils more. All right, but this better be the best toilet paper I've ever had. Oh, no worries there. That's Henderson's Toilet Paper! Ooh, why didn't you say so? Hey, is there a bathroom here? Not for you. I don't know why, but I just didn't feel comfortable until I was back here in New Springfield, with my own kind. Mom! They were looking at me. With their eyes. As expected, New Springfield's bold experiment in slob rule is a disaster. Hey, the TV man is talking about us! A study shows their crumbling economy is due to their lazy attitude and shoddy work. How the hell did they find that out? Scientists say they are also less attractive physically. And while we speak in a well-educated manner, they tend to use lowbrow expressions, like ""oh yeah?"" and ""c'mere a minute."" Oh yeah? They think they're better than us, huh? Bart, c'mere a minute. You c'mere a minute. Oh yeah? Dad, I don't think this is such a good idea. Thank you, Marge. Now, let's see how Olde Snobfield does without electricity. Woo hoo! Oh no, you can't do heart surgery in the dark. Sounds like a wager to me. I'll take a piece of that. I will now transport Sir Isaac Newton into the modern day. Warning. Power failure. Oh, sweet glayvin! Sir Isaac's legs are hurting. In retaliation for the power outage, Olde Springfield patriots have intercepted a beer truck bound for New Springfield and dumped all the beer in the river. Those rich, snobby Indians. Oh, there's nothing like revenge for getting back at people. I don't know. Vengeance is pretty good. Woo hoo! Flood from water! They've got us now. Without water, we're doomed. Wait a minute. That gold-colored substance in the riverbed... Why that's gold! We're slightly richer! Eureka! With the money made from the gold, Olde Springfield was able to buy the Evian water factory and fly it over here from France. Thanks, Mayor Simpson. Because of you, we're all taking golden showers. What? We can't go on fighting with Olde Springfield. These people are our neighbors. We see them every day. You're right. We've got to block them from our sight with a giant wall. Like the one in Berlin? Good idea. We should call the guys they used. Homer... It's ringing. And I'd like to thank Low Ball Construction for building this amazing wall... From ninety percent recycled materials. I'm so conflicted. 'Bout what? Loyal citizens of New Springfield. You stayed on my side of town despite a total lack of hospitals and schools, and a sewage nightmare that threatens to consume us all. How will we get our food? All the roads are blocked. Don't worry, we have plenty of supplies to get through tomorrow. And then a wave of disease should help to -- hey! Stop streaming over the wall! At least wait till I'm through talking. Okay, now as for food, the following breeds of dog are edible... Bye Homer. I can't believe all those rats fled my town. Guess it's just us and the tumbleweeds. Well, Dad, you're mayor of a ghost town. I can't believe those traitors abandoned us. They couldn't take one lousy famine. Dad, you're bleeding. No problem. Anyhow, those rats'll come crawling back... We've got the Who playing here tonight. Dad, the arena's in Olde Springfield. Don't give up, Dad. Maybe we can get The Who to play here instead. Hey, maybe we could. But we'll need some liquid persuasion. C'mon, Bart. We're gonna bring back The Who. Can I help you? Uh... Dad, the chloroform! Huh? Oh, right. I'll give you this bottle of chloroform if you'll take us to The Who. Oh, so you want to see The Who, huh? Well I'll take you to The Who. Here's your Who. I thought we fired that guard. Oh, yeah, right. I got fired by The Who. Whatever you say, pal. Wack-o... Wow, The Who! Woo! Rock 'n' roll! What the hell are you doing?! Duh. Trashin' the hotel room. But we promised the desk clerk we'd be good. Yeah, we don't want to lose our pool privileges. Whatever. The point is, I'm Homer Simpson. The mayor of New Springfield? That's right. The crazy mayor of New Springfield? That's right. And I implore you to move your concert to our town. Don't play Olde Springfield, or as it is sometimes known, Sun City. But we have a handshake agreement with a concert promoter. And that's a sacred bond. Sacred bond. C'mon, what happened to the angry, defiant Who of ""My Generation,"" ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" and ""Mama's Got a Squeeze Box""? We know our songs, Homer. But those Olde Springfield squares are just gonna make you cut your hair, turn down your music and wear frilly shirts like Keith Partridge. Keith Partridge? Who Huddle. We'll do it. Just send a cab for us. Somethin' wrong with your legs? You're right. The walk will do us good. I opened for the Who at Woodstock! I came out in a Beatle wig with a ukulele. Hendrix said he almost plotzed, his exact words. I never tire of that story. Smithers, why did you iron a crease in these dungarees? I look like a square. Uh, that crease is in your leg, Sir. Oh, so it is. Yes... Hmm, it's not like the Who to be tardy. I'm worried. What's that? Yarrr! 'Tis the Who! By my reckoning they're in the scurvy depths of New Springfield. Homer stole our rock performance. That fat, dumb and bald guy sure plays some real hardball. Who's ready to riot?! I WON'T GET TO GET WHAT I'M AFTER / 'TIL THE DAY I DIE! How ya doin' out there, New Springfield? To be honest, it's a little chilly. Get outta the way, Marge. We were expecting a bigger crowd. Oh, don't worry. They'll be here soon. And then they'll see who's got the better town. Now these are the tunes I want you boys to play. Wait a minute. Homer, a lot of these are Grand Funk Railroad songs. And we don't know ""Pacman Fever."" Oh, c'mon, it plays itself. ""Pacman Fever / A do do do do / It's driving me crazy."" Look Lisa, Daddy's in the Who! Give us back our concert, Simpson! So, New Springfield's lookin' pretty good now, isn't it? With our ample parking and daily Who concerts. Daily? We'll talk. All right, enough chit chat. Let's see how ya like flaming garbage! Ha-ha. You hit the tire fire! You'll have to do... Why me? People, please! What's all this fightin' about? Apparently, they have two different area codes. Well, I'll be chuggered! That's the sticky wicket? Why not just buy telephones with auto ring-up? Or as you Yanks call it, speed-dial. Radio Shack has some great ones. Uh, says you. ""Magic Bus""! Yeah! / ""Magic Bus""! Okay, we'll play ""Magic Bus"" if you tear down this wall. ""Pinball Wizard""! Oh hell, I'll do it myself... Well Marge, looks like your insane experiment is over. My experiment? You're the one who came up with this whole idea...","Mayor Joe Quimby, Security Guard, Carl Carlson, John Entwistle, Waylon Smithers, Chief Wiggum, 939'ers, Milhouse Van Houten, DOLPH, Pete Townshend, Bumblebee Man, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Jingle Singers, Marge Simpson, Wealthy Dowager, Kent Brockman, Homer Simpson, Townspeople, Grampa Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, CARTOON MAN, C.
