216,220,"Mmm. So I said to that nurse, ""You can take your free tetanus shot and shove it."" Well, you told her, Dad. You better believe I did. You still haven't told us why Lenny bit you. Well, I really gave him no choice. Y'see... Lousy meat-eating scum. Huh? Not you. I'm going over to protest this disgusting new restaurant called ""The Slaughterhouse."" It's decorated with hanging steer carcasses and a fountain of blood. Ooh, I heard about that place on ""The Red Grocer."" The worst part is, you pick out your own cow and they kill it right in front of you! Well, maybe the animals don't mind, honey. They might enjoy being the center of attention. I think I read somewhere that cows like being killed. Wait. There's a place like that in Springfield?! Then why are we eating this crap? C'mon, everybody, we're going to the Slaughterhouse! You didn't need to knock the food on the floor. Didn't I? Wow. It's even more wonderful than Lisa said! Ooh-woo. A complimentary basket of hooves. Beef salad, beef on the cob, beef-fried beef, uh... Is there anything on the menu that isn't meat? Ha, not likely. Cool. Even this menu is made of meat. It's an entire chicken pounded flat. How clever! The kids' menu's on the beak. Mm, I think I'll take... Ooh, that one. No, he's a bit listless, isn't he? Give me... Ooh, that spirited fellow... Oof. Well, he didn't put up much of a fight. Uh, why don't you pick one for me? On second thought, I'll just have a glass of milk. From that cow. Wait a minute. Is this the biggest steak you've got? 72 ounces? I thought this was supposed to be a steakhouse, not a little... girly... underpantsy... pink doily... tea party place. Well, there is one steak that's only available by special request, uh... We call it, uh, ""Sir Loin-A-Lot."" It's, uh, the size of a Boogie-board. Oooh, I'll have that one. And to drink... ... meatballs. Very good, sir. Ladies and gentlemen... This brave man has accepted the Sir Loin-A-Lot challenge. He will pit his stomach against sixteen pounds of indomitable tenderloin. They like me because I'm brave. Only two people have ever finished the whole thing. Uh, if you want some friendly advice, pal, I wouldn't tackle the big'un right away. Oh yeah? What do you know about it? Y-- It's you! You're him! You're Tony Randall! Red Barclay's my name. I'm a trucker, and I've eaten steaks from coast to coast, with taters and toast. Take my advice, this one's not for greenhorns. Greenhorns! Who's a greenhorn? What's a greenhorn? It's an insult. Sock him, Dad. Sock everybody. Oh, you're just jealous 'cause you don't have the belly for it anymore. Mr. No-Belly... Mr... Hasn't-Got-A-Belly... Well... I have just finished a whole lamb, but, uh, I reckon I could take you to school. You're on, boy. Is it safe to eat that much food, Dr. Hibbert? You know, I wouldn't have thought so before I bought 12 per cent of this restaurant. But now I feel a balanced diet can include the occasional eating contest. But what if he chokes? Not to worry. We have the latest Heimlich machine. On your left, the pride of the American trucking industry, Reliable Red Barclay! And on your right, Homer somebody! Go Dad! Yeah, c'mon Homie! Go! Go! Go! Gluttons to your marks... Annnnd... gorge! Chew! Chew! Chew! Chew! Chew! Chew! No, Homer! Don't fill up on bread! Huh? Oh, right. The steak. Come on, Dad, pick up the pace. Chew and swallow, no savoring. Must eat beef... must defeat guy I just met... So much steak... lungs filling... sinuses packed with meat... Come on, Dad, just twelve more pounds. Oh, humans are so ridiculous. He's not even halfway through Walter and he's already hallucinating. Lousy drunks. I'll show them. What's happening to me? There's still food... but I don't want to eat it. I've become everything I've ever hated. The winner and still champion, Reliable Red Barclay! My hat's off to you, Red. You're a true American hero. And you did it with style and dignity and... Hey, you're not breathing. Don't people usually breathe? This man is dead. Looks to me like beef poisoning. Probably from some other restaurant. You'd better take one of these too. He's eaten quite a lot. There goes the finest trucker who ever lived. He called me ""Greenhorn."" I called him Tony Randall. It was a thing we had. In 38 years, he never missed a shipment. But I guess this is one delivery ol' Red won't be making. Oh yes he will! And on time, too! Oh no. Oh, no... I've got to, honey. I owe it to ol' Red, as both his friend and his killer. Oh, lemme go with you, Dad! Don't you have school? Don't you have work? Ah, touché. Bye, Marge! Aren't you gonna say bye? Good-bye, Homer. That didn't sound like you meant it. Oh, all right. Good-bye, sweetheart, have a nice trip. That's more like it. So long, suckers! Why you gotta... Come on! Ah! Now I'm gettin' the hang of this thing. I don't know why I didn't become a trucker before. Well, you're not really a trucker now. Oh, yeah? My left arm says different. Well, according to Red's schedule, we have to make it to Atlanta in three days. Piece o' cake. Just need a little truck-driving music.

62486,220,103,""Bart Simpson: No Ohhh. That little punk. Lisa, we got another postcard from your father! ""Wish you were her."" How many of these is he going to send me? Wow, Dad and Bart have been everywhere! They've eaten submarine sandwiches, grinders, and hoagies. It's not fair. Your father always gets to have such exciting adventures. Maybe it's time we took a walk on the wild side... We're buying a new doorbell? A musical doorbell! So many doorbells... I'm in way over my head. Ohhh, great, look at my shoes! And today's my evaluation with Señor Ding-Dong. Excuse me, mister... Trainee, I'm trying to find a musical doorbell. Well, you came to the right place. We got your ding-dang-dongs, and your do-re-mi's, and your uh... ha-cha-cha's, uh? I'm trying to find a particular tune. It's the one that goes like dah-da-dahhh dah-da-dahhh. Mom, is this the one you want? Yes, that's it! Lisa, you oughta be a doorbell salesman! Oh, that's just what I need, another piranha in the tank. A little more high-test, darlin'? Sure thing, Gwenn. I'll be right back with your pie, hon. Aww... that's a nice, friendly gal. Yeah. Wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop? Watching all the people come and go. You could have a different best friend every day. I suppose. Great. I'll write your mother and tell her the marriage is off. And then when the paperwork is done, I'll make Gwenn my wife. Will that be all, sweetie? For now... The light's on. All systems are ding-dong! Come on, Mom, let's take it for a test drive. Uhp. It's not a toy, Lisa. We'll just have to wait until someone comes. Anyone? Anyone at all? Oh, Milhouse is selling seeds! And he's coming this wa... Oh, the birds got him. Oh! Oh! Not the face! If your father was here, there'd be process servers, repo men, and bounty hunters to beat the band. Wait, people are coming. I think they're Jehovah's Witnesses. Yess!! Wait, Marlon. You know, I just had a thought. Maybe we're bothering people by trying to change their religion. What if we don't have all the answers? You're right, Noreen. Let's go get real jobs. I would have feigned interest. Still no visitors! It's time we opened up a can of whup-tushy on this situation. What's the number for Luigi's? Dad's got it on the speed dial under ""Fire."" This is it, honey. We did it. Dammit! Ring the bell! Why? You already know I'm here, don't ya? Just do it. Nothin' doin', missy. Now do you want your half-order of garlic bread or not? No, but if you'll just ring the-- Oh, that's it. I'm putting an end to this. Lisa, no, no, don't! It won't be the-- Ohhh, it's heavenly! ""Why do birds suddenly appear... over there, over here..."" Why is it playing over again? Who cares?! No one could ever get sick of this song. ""Suddenly appear..."" Hey, get that truck outta here! You mean... it ate Patrick, too? It ate everybody. What about... Erika? It ate everybody. Stupid! I bet ol' Red caught himself a mess o' catfish with these fishing sticks. Uh-huh. Bet he used bait, too. Relax, boy. We're ahead of schedule. Actually, we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours. Ten hours?! We gotta roll! Uh, yeah. I need something that'll keep me awake, alert, and reckless all night long. Well, Congress is racing back to Washington to outlaw these... Sold! Hey! You can't take that many pep pills at once! No problem. I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills. Okay-We're-All-Set-Let's-Put-The-Pedal-To-The-Metal! I whole-heartedly-agree. Oh-man-I'm-really-wired. This-is-a-big-mistake-I-can... Ohhh, here comes the sleeping pills. So drowsy. Pep-pills-perking-up-again. I-could-drive allll Niiight... I fell asleep at the wheel! But we didn't crash. It's a miracle! You'll never believe what happened. I fell asleep at the wheel and the truck drove here by itself. Yeah, that Navitron Auto-Drive System's made our jobs cushier than ever. The what now? You know, this thing. With this baby drivin' your truck for ya, all you gotta do is sit back and feel your ass grow. The trucks drive themselves? Sh-hey-hey-hey-sh! Didn't your union rep tell you about the scam we got goin'? Well, I'm not really a trucker, so I don't talk to the rep that often. Now listen pal, here's the deal. You stumbled on a secret that only truck drivers are supposed to know. Hey. Pay attention and stop looking at that squirrel. We get 40 bucks an hour to drive these rigs. You think anybody'd hire us if they knew we weren't really drivin' the trucks? Wow! You guys are even lazier than me! Well, don't worry. I'll keep your secret. See that you do. Hey, Bart, watch me run down this old lady. Dad, no! The second I let go of the wheel, this little wonder kicks in. And if scaring old ladies don't float your boat, watch this! C'mon out, boy. It's windy. Wow, you're right, Dad. It is windy. Hey look! Nobody's driving. Well, well. / What's that? / Will wonders never cease? Relax, everybody! The Navitron Auto-Drive System is driving the truck for me! But keep it a secret! It's a big scam! Okay? What the hell...? Breaker, breaker, looks like we got us a ten-thirty-eight. Uh, Ten-thirty-eight. Ah, let's see. Ah, ""outsider blabbin' about auto-drive system."" Well, we'll have to teach our friend some discretion. Yep, just like we did to Jimmy Hoffa. Hey, shut up! Callin' all big rigs. Motor mouth on Highway Seven. You know what to do. Ten-four. / That's a big ten-four. / Ten-four. Mom, I need to get some sleep! I have a test tomorrow in birds suddenly appear. I mean, English. Okay, okay! Let me just get the wire cutters. Oh, your father traded our tools for M&M's again. Ah, the heck with it. Look, son. It's one of nature's most beautiful sights -- the convoy. He hit us! Oh, I shoulda known. They're hazing us, to initiate us into the truckers' fraternity. Thank you sir, may I have another? Dad, they're trying to kill us! Oh, why do all my trips end like this? Eat water, good buddy. Aaiieeee!! Whoa, look at him roll. Oh! My good knife! My wife's gonna kill me. I think we lost 'em, Bart. Dad, stop! Well, well, well. Looks like we've got ourselves a showdown, boy. All right. What are you doing? I'm keeping a promise to an American roadmaster. Huh? Red. The trucker. Big fat guy, couldn't handle his steak? Oh, yeah. We'll get past that barrier somehow. Ol' Blinky here will find a way. I'm afraid I can't let you do this, Red. The risk is unacceptable. I'm not Red, I'm Homer. Gotta go. Dad, do something! Something better! Woo hoo! Now that man is a genuine, steel-belted, gear-jammin' rig jockey. That's a fact. / Boy howdy. / Boy, you can say that again. / Yeap. You know, boys, I been thinkin'. Maybe it's time we ditched the high-tech gizmos and went back to drivin' like our daddies did. Drunk? No! N-no, using our hands and our wits. Yeah, sure it's hard work, and it's lonely as hell, but it has meaning and dignity. Huh, whattaya say? Nah. Let's just find some other scam. Hey! How 'bout bootlegging Beanie Babies? Sounds good to me. / Oooh, I like that. Yep. You're gonna make it, Dad. And somewhere up there, I bet Red is saying thanks. Ten-four, dead buddy. This is Red Barclay's shipment. On time, as always. All right, let's see... Artichokes... aannnd migrant workers. Lookin' good. So, where is ol' Red anyway? Well... the last time I saw him, he was in a big plastic bag. Yeah, that sounds like Red, all right. Well, son. I guess it's time to go home. Any thoughts on how we're gonna get there? No, but I'm sure the good Lord will provide. Are you crazy? I'm not driving a trainload of napalm to Springfield! Thank you. / Simpson, you'd better turn that thing...! I'm really sorry, everybody, but I've tried everything. I'm afraid we're just going to have to learn to live with it. No, no, no, no dice. All right, chimey, this time, the bell tolls for thee. Ay yay yay, Señor Ding-Dong! I thought you were just a marketing gimmick. There was a time when that was true. But now, I am so much more. Oh my. Gracias, Señor. De nada. If you ever need me, just ring. Does anyone have any jumper cables?
