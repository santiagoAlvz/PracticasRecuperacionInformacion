254,258,"Homer, get up! Up, up, up! Oh no! Whuzzit... My juice box! Sorry, Homie, but you promised to take me to the Apron Expo today. Just give me ten more hours. C'mon. You and the kids always wanna do fun stuff, but today we're doing something I like. They're unveiling a combination apron/smock. It's called a ""Smapron."" Did you say ""Smockron""? No, ""Smapron."" Oh. C'mon, it'll be fun. Man, that was a good Apron Expo. I'm gonna wear my apron on the Fourth of July. And this lead apron will keep me safe downstairs. Heh, heh. ""Grill Power."" I'm a little disappointed. There were too many aprons. It was great, all right. But all I wanna do right now is hit the adjustable sack with a good juice box. Because when all is said and done... Prison rodeo!? Today! Welcome to Waterville State Penitentiary. The contestants you'll see today are actual prisoners on a break from their telemarketing duties. Now, here comes our first outlaw! Yee-ha! Ooo, doggie! Well, don't feel too bad for him, folks. He's in here for erecting a Nativity scene on city property. There's so much evil in the world. Nexxxxt! No, Delbert. We're not slaughtering the animals. It's not like that, Warden. We was just havin' a conversation. Ain't that right? Next up's a real lowlife. Bob Dylan wrote a song to keep him in prison... Say hello to Jack Crowley. Yee-ha! Go, bull! Toss his salad! Oooh, he's down. And it looks like Ol' Tornado wants to caramelize his creme brul√©e. Yeah! Do that! Somebody help him! Relax, they've got rodeo clowns. Is my lipstick even? Go like this. Hey! Hey, over here! Here, bully, bully, bully, bully, bully! That's not gonna do it, Marge. You need something red. Hey, Toro! Here's something to gore! Da-ad! Not now, honey. Daddy's busy. Now, for a little calming blue. Hey, where's your blue shirt? I don't have a blue shirt. Maybe it's the tear gas or maybe this was the best damned prison rodeo ever. How's your back, Homie? I can't complain. Naw, that's for the prisoners. You can complain all you want. Oh God, my back! It hurts so much, and my job is so unfulfilling! Try to focus on something else. Umm... You like Jimi Hendrix, right? Uh-huh. Well, look at that painting. Wow. The artist really captured Jimi's passion and intensity. And his fondness for the guitar. Thank you kindly, ma'am. They won't give us art supplies, so I had to paint it with pudding. A convict painted that? Yep. Well, I studied art, and this guy's got a real gift. You kiddin'? Look, he painted a unicorn in outer space. I'm askin' you, what's it breathin'? Air? Ain't no air in space. There's an Air in Space Museum. Oh God, my back... Let's get outta this gosh-forsaken heck-hole. What a waste of talent. A sunset! They are coming back for us, aren't they? I'unno. How's your back, Dad? Well, there's a dull ache, certainly. And overlaid on that is a club sandwich of pain. Only instead of bacon, there's agony. Marge, can I have a BLT? What are you looking at? Oh, nothing... How would you feel if I did some volunteer work at the prison? First I'd feel like having a BLT, then proud of you. Oh, Homie. I knew you'd support me. My back! Mrs. Marge Simpson. I'm here to teach an art class. Ooh, art class. La dee dah. This is Ike Pross. He's going to solitary. Ooh, solitary. La dee dah. Welcome to ""Freeing the Artist Within."" Not literally, of course. Okay. Now, I wanted to paint fresh fruit, but the prison cafeteria would only give me sauerkraut. That's depressing. Let's let a little sunshine in. Question? Can I smell your dress? Hey, you show some respect. This one here is not for smellin'. Why, thank you, Jack. No problem. Now, let's paint. Hey, can I smell your clothes? Your spine is more twisted than Sinbad's take on marriage. So? Just gimme some drugs and surgery. Oh, I'd love to. But, ah, to be honest, modern medicine has a lousy record of treating the back. We spend too much time on the front. Yeah, there's some neat stuff on the front. I'm gonna send you to my chiropractor. Hey, I thought real doctors hated chiropractors. Well, that is our official stance. But between you, me and my golf clubs, they're miracle workers. That's charming, Sardonicus, but try to use less of a stabbing action and more of a brushing stroke. Yeah, see how much better that feels? Yes. Much better. Oh Jack, that's so soulful. How did someone so sensitive end up here? Well, if you really gotta know, I shot a guy named Apu. Oh. Well, you know, lots of people shoot Apu. It's just a hundred-dollar fine now. Maybe I belong in here. I got a lotta anger. I don't see any anger. I see a yearning for freedom... Um, do you have a title? A Time to Kill. Titles are hard. Hello, Homer. I'm Doctor Steve. Please lie down. Wake up, Homer. Less yakkin', more crackin'. Now Homer, we don't actually ""crack"" backs. It's merely an adjustment. Okay, you're gonna hear a loud cracking sound. There we go. Hey, it feels a little better. Mm-hmm, I thought it might. Now, I'll need to see you three times a week for... many years. So, how was it in the slammer? Terrific. Bart, Sideshow Bob says he'll be seeing you real soon. That Bob. Oh, and guess who's up for parole? My diamond-in-the-rough. That scary guy? Scary talented. And I'm gonna make sure the parole board knows it. You gonna bribe 'em? I might grease the wheels of justice with some cookies. Oh, can I have some? Not till you finish your sundae. Is that enough? Two more bites. I'm sure your macaroons are scrumptious, Marge. But I've seen this warden turn down brownies. Honest to goodness brownies. Next. Oh, it's you. Well, just let me ink up my old ""denied"" stamp. Warden, please. This man is a gentle soul. I know he's made mistakes, but someone with his talent belongs on a boardwalk doing caricatures. Not behind bars. Lady, I know he charmed you with some ""pleases"" and ""thank yous"", but he wasn't so polite to the guy he shot. Actually, he was. He waited with me till the ambulance came, then ran like a deer. Well, that's mighty nice. But, if I let this creep out, would you like him skulking around your neighborhood? Honestly, it wouldn't bother me. Well lady, I'm gonna call your bluff. The prisoner is hereby paroled into your custody. Oh, my Goodness! I'm free? Oh, Mrs. Simpson... Oh. Geez, I'm sorry. Sorry. You won't regret this. I hope this is okay. It's not very prison-y. It's more than I deserve, ma'am. Now, which way is Mecca, 'cause I gotta do a little prayin'. Uh, Mecca? Well, let's... I'm just yankin' your chain. I'm Jewish. Ow! Owww, my back. Dr. Steve didn't do anything. Did you do those exercises he gave you? Yeah, right. I did 'em while you were studying. Dad! Are you okay? Yeah... In fact... I feel fantastic! That trash can must have unkinked your back. Not ""trash can,"" son. Dr. Homer's Miracle Spine-O-Cylinder! Patent pending. Okay, okay. And as you can see, the unique dents in my invention perfectly match the contours of the human vertebrains. Patent pending... Patent pending... Patent pending... Hey, who's this guy? You remember Jack... He's that talented painter who had a little brush with the law. You brought a convict to live here, near my unpatented idea? I seen your idea and I don't want it. All I need is three squares and a job. That's right, a job. I know just where you can get one. So, Homer, you think you can fix my sciatica? Hmm. I don't know what that is, so I'm gonna say yes. Now, go limp. I'm limp. One, two, better-not-sue... Hey, it worked! My searing leg pain is now a gentle numbness. Next! Yes, uh, my car seems to have broken down and I was wondering if I could use your... That's a forcing motion... Simpson, you're not a licensed chiropractor. And you're stealing patients from me and Dr. Steffi! Boy, talk about irony. The AMA tries to drive you guys out of business. Now you're doing the same to me. Think about the irony... You've been warned. Stop chiropracting. Not unless you think about the irony. I read in the Daily Fourth Gradian that you need someone to paint a mural. Yes, school spirit is down 3.4 percent! Well, Jack here will do great work for you. Oh, any references? Well... to be honest with ya, I've spent the last six years in Waterville State... It's a small liberal arts college. Very law-abiding. No convicts at all. Well, the only other one to apply was Moe Syszlak, and his stuff scares the hell out of me. How could anyone consider that making love? All right, Jack, you're hired. I'll clear you out a cubby. You told a lie for me. I know... But the Lord will forgive me if it helps you get a second chance. Actually, Marge, it's the third if you count that farm couple. Farm couple?! But I got a good feelin' about this one, Marge. I really do. That is awesome. Finally, art that doesn't suck! Dear Lord! What are you doing? You don't like it? No, no, it's all wrong. The shapely female form has no place in art. But, uh, what I thought is... I sketched out exactly what I wanted. Yeah, I know. But see what I was going for here... Did you even look at the napkin? Oh, I was in the zone that day. Yeah, ya see, I didn't wanna go so cutesy wootsy... Because...? Because it's not my style. Well, if you want to keep this job, you'll make it your style. All right. You're the bossman, ain't ya. Darn right, I'm the boss. Don't forget, I can send you back where you came from... college boy. That punk Skinner. I had more freedom back at the joint. Oh, Jack. I know you hate to betray your artistic vision, but just do it. I guess I could bend a little. Just till you make it. Remember, I believe in you. Thanks, Marge. Listen, if you're done with that washing machine, can I make some booze in it? Not until you finish your sundae. Yes, ma'am. What's wrong with my sundaes? Careful, I'm frail. Okay, that should do it, Moe. Hey, it don't hurt no more. Heh. Now I can focus on my crippling emotional pain. Oh, Daddy, Daddy, why? Why won't you hug me? You hug the mailman. Excuse me, sir. Is this El Cl√≠nico Magn√≠fico? Ah, you saw our bus ad. We'd, uh, like to invest in your spinal adjustment device. We might be able to do business. We'll need to take some photographs. Hey, where're you going with that? Wait a minute, no investor could bend like that. They're chiropractors! C'mon, c'mon, let's go! Nooo! My Spine-O-Cylinder! They'll pay for what they did to my can. Forget it, Homer. It's Chiro-town. You know, when Superintendent Chalmers suggested a school mural, I almost thought he said a school Muriel. Muriel's his sister. And uh... Thank you, Bruce Vilanch. Whoopi would have made it work. And now, I present ""Puma Pride"" by a college-educated artist... Jack Crowley. Man, is that wimpy! What happened to the cool one? Well, my original idea was... Jeepers, that's sugary, even for my taste. Yeah, but Skinner said I had to... Skinner! How are we going to raise school spirit with this sappy hokum? I know, sir. It's an embarrassment. This isn't what I wanted! Where's the edge? I followed your napkin... No napkin could wipe the crumbs of failure from your mouth. Oh, don't fight. All great art is controversial at first. But years from now, people will point to these cuddly little creatures, and say, ""That's a Jack Crowley."" Now, ah, pizza's working well on Thursday, but I think the kids will follow it to Tuesday. That's what you said about the stuffed peppers, and ye lost the young males. Principal Skinner! The school's on fire! Spread! Spread! Spread! Spread! Spread! Spread! It's crystal clear who did this: Jack Crowley. Now wait, you don't know that Jack did this. Just because he's an ex-con... Crowley's an ex-con?! Dear Lord, I've peed in front of him! Hey, check it out! Ha! Now that's a mural! It's so passionate. It almost leaps off the wall. That felon could have torched the whole school... were it not stuffed with asbestos. We'll catch Crowley. And then he'll learn the ""fine art"" of police brutality. Psst. Marge, over here. Oh, Jack... You threw it all away, over a stupid feud with Skinner. Look, I'll admit I hate Skinner. But I didn't start that fire. Then why are you hiding? C'mon, Marge. With my rap sheet, they can't wait to send me back to prison. And you can't believe the foul language in that place. So you really didn't do it? Marge, look in my eyes. I swear to you, I did not do it. I believe you, Jack. Now let's get you out of here... Wait for my signal. Oh, Chief! I found some evidence that points to the real arsonist. Well, let's see it. Not yet. You have to guess what it is. We don't have time for guessing games. Nah, let's try it. It might be fun. Is it DNA? So, it's like DNA... Umm... A hatchet? You had a turn. I want to guess. Oh, geez... My car! Puma pride! Puma pride! Catch the fever, Skinner! You crumb-bum. You looked me right in the eye and lied to me. Marge, this is the God's truth. I burned the mural, but I did not burn Skinner's car. I just saw you! Get him outta here, Chief! Yes ma'am. My wife and I like watching that ""Oz"" show on HBO. Uh, is prison really like that? Wouldn't know, we only get basic cable. Ouch! I also like that ""Sex and the City."" None of those girls look like my wife. Sportscenter's not bad. Eh, I never got that show. What's to get? They just tell the scores. Yeah, I s'pose. Hey, you ever meet any mob guys? Are they really like ""The Sopranos""? I told you, we just get basic cable. Oh, right, right, right. Listen, if I'm gettin' too chatty, just uh, just tell me to shut up. Nah, I'm enjoying it. Hey, you ever watch that strong man contest? They're pretty good. Those guys look strong. All the guys in prison say they're gay. But I don't know. They look strong to me.","Convict, Jack, Man #2, Chief Wiggum, Prisoner, Milhouse Van Houten, Man #1, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Homer Simpson, Bruce Vilanch, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Gary Chalmers, Seymour Skinner, Groundskeeper Willie, Lenny Leonard, Moe Szyslak, Ned Flanders, Dr. Steve, Kids, Rodeo Clown #2, Rodeo Clown #1, Guard #2, Guard #1, Professor Jonathan Frink, Bart Simpson, Sardonicus, Edna Krabappel-Flanders, Warden",7.3,760.0,10,2001-01-14,2001,12,Pokey Mom,15.0,51024.0
