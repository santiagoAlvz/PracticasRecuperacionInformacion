177,181,"Hey there, Meathead. What are you watchin'? Oh, I thought I'd check out the Warner Brothers Network. WE'RE PROUD TO PRESENT / ON THE WB / ANOTHER BAD SHOW / THAT NO ONE WILL SEEEEE! I NEED A DRINK. It's the TV movie of the year! ""The Krusty the clown Story: Booze, Drugs, Guns, Lies, Blackmail And Laughter."" Starring Fyvush Finkel as Krusty the Clown. I went through a five year orgy of non-stop pills and booze with nothing to show for it but four Emmys and a Peabody Award! All right! They're gonna show his disastrous marriage to Mia Farrow! Chan Ho--your mother Mia and I are getting a divorce. Chan Ho is over there. I am Chin Ho. Whoever you are, just pass it along, kid. What a bad father. Lisa, knock off that racket! But Dad, I'm supposed to practice an hour a day! I'll practice you! You'll practice me? What does that mean? Is it supposed to be some sort of threat? Bart, make her stop. Look, Bart. I have to practice my saxophone and you can't stop me. Oh yeah? My dear Lisa, you are eight and I am ten. And in my two extra years on this planet, I've learned a few tricks. Gimme that sax! No! I said gimme! I said no! Haw haw! Aw, Lisa, it doesn't look so bad. Oh yeah? Lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better I'll destroy something Bart loves. Hey! Don't worry, son. If that bothers you, I'll destroy something Maggie loves. Dad, you don't understand. This saxophone is like my oldest friend. I've had it for as long as I can remember. You don't remember how you got it? Nuh-uh. Oh, well, it all happened in 1990. Back then, the artist formerly known as Prince was currently known as Prince. Tracey Ullman was entertaining America with songs, sketches, and crudely-drawn filler material. And Bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school... Look, Mama! Oh, honey, I can't right now. Bart's gonna be late! Now, son, on your first day of school, I'd like to pass along the words of advice my father gave me... Homer, you're dumb as a mule and twice as ugly. If a strange man offers you a ride, I say take it! Lousy traumatic childhood. Ooh, there's the bus. Goodbye, sweetheart! School will be fun! Welcome kindergartners. I'm Principal Sinner... Skinner. Well, that's it. I've lost them forever. Now I'd like to introduce you to Lunchlady Doris, who will serve you healthy, nutritious meals... Yeah, right. ...Miss Phipps, the school nurse, who will provide ointments and unguents...and Jimbo, the school bully who will administer noogies and nipple twisters. I look forward to whaling on all of you. THERE WAS A FARMER HAD A DOG / AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME-O! B-I- -O B-I---O B-I- AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME-O! Added extra clap. Not college material. Hey! Wee Bairn! Hie ye hence from me heath! Can't ya understand English! Hi honey! How was your first day of school? Honey? BART WAS FEELING MIGHTY BLUE... IT'S A SHAME WHAT SCHOOL CAN DO. FOR NO REASON HERE'S APU -- THOSE WERE THE DAYYYYYS. And that, my children, is the story of Bart's first day of school. Very nice. Yeah. Yeah. Except you were supposed to be telling the story of how I got my saxophone! Homer, I can't get the baby to burp. Could you try for a while? No problem. I'll just give her a sip of beer. Come on Maggie -- it's Miller time! Yes-it's-Mil-ler-time! Homer! Oh, my father gave me beer as a child. Till I wrapped my little red wagon around a tree. Let's never drink again. And we never did. Mom, can you tell me the story of how I got my saxophone and not have it turn into a story about Bart! Sure, honey. Bart had just completed his first day at school. And Bart just... Mom! Hey, she's just giving the public what it wants. Bart by the barrel ful. Sorry, Lisa. It's just how the story goes. No matter what Bart tried, he just couldn't fit in at school. A, B, C... Uh... line? D. D, E... Um... line? F, Bart. And believe me, you'll be seeing plenty of 'em. Bart, would you like to read a book? No. Would you like to color something? I did. That's damn fine coffee you got here in Twin Peaks. And damn good cherry pie. Brilliant! I have absolutely no idea what's going on. Homer, I want you to look at this drawing Bart did. Oh, it's beautiful! Oh! Oh, let's put Bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge! Homer stop! Would you please look at the drawing? Oh, all right. What a- Burn it! Send it to Hell! I think we're going to have to get Bart some help. Get it away! Bart, son. You wanna play catch? No. When a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is seriously wrong. I'll play catch with you, son. Get the hell out. I'm gone. Mrs. Simpson, physically your son is as sound as a dollar. I'm afraid Bart's severe emotional dysfunction stems from a deep-seated psychological trauma. With nowhere else to turn, we went to see the school psychologist... Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, there's nothing to be alarmed about. Public school can be intimidating to a young child, particularly one with as many flamboyantly homosexual tendencies as your son. Bart's gay? Bart? Uh, whoo, wrong file. Uh, look, th-the point I'm trying to make here is that Bart must learn to be less of an individual and more a faceless slug... Hmm. Lisa, how old are you? I am three and three eighths! Hm. Lisa, if I have five apples and I take away three apples, how many apples do I have left? Two apples! Wait a minute... she's right! Heh, very good. Marge, Homer, I believe your Lisa may be gifted. That's wonderful! But still, can't you do anything for Bart? Marge, he's five. His life is over. Lisa's the wave of the future. Wave of da future! That's right, honey. If you nurture her gift now, there's no telling what she can do. Wow. Just think of the possibilities. Lisa Simpson has won the Nobel Prize. Nah. Lisa Simpson has won the Nobel Prize for Kickboxing. Hm. Uh... I'll give you the address of a nice pre-school. Cross my heart and hope to die / Here's the digits that make ""pi."" Three point one four one five nine two six, five, three, five eight nine seven nine three two three eight four six... I can assure you our preschool is of the highest quality. Over seventy-five per cent of our graduates go on to first grade. Well, our little girl has a gift and we're willing to do what it takes to help her. Very good. Once we receive your six thousand dollar tuition check, she's in. I'll give ya fifty bucks. Our fee is non-negotiable. Seventy-five. Look, I knew private school would be expensive but I was hoping we could get a scholarship of some sort. Sorry. I don't have anything to offer you unless you're a member of a minority group. Excellente! Muchas gracias, Se√±orata! Sorry. Ah so. Come on, honey. I guess this is a world you'll never know. Our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever. Bart was miserable at school, and Lisa's gifts were going to waste. Uh, Homer? It's five years later and I'm still miserable at school. And my gifts are still going to waste. And sometimes I feel so smothered by this family I just want to scream till my lungs explode! Uh... I'll go start dinner now. You do that. Hello! Dad, what are you doin' here? Looking for my teeth. Gimme those! Better wash these off. Ah, the hell with it. Well, Grampa, as long as you're here, we were telling a story that took place when Bart was five and Lisa was three. Oh, I know this story! The year is nineteen-aught-six. The President is the Divine Miss Sarah Bernhardt. And all over America, people were doing a dance called the Funky Grampa! Oh I'm the -- Yeeesss. Well, as if our troubles weren't bad enough, Springfield was going through an unseasonable heat wave... And so, Springfield's heat wave continues with today's temperature exceeding the record for this date, set way back four billion years ago when the earth was just a ball of molten lava. Ohhh. So hottt. Homer, have you seen the frozen peas? Uhh... you keep 'em. Now listen. If we can't afford private school, maybe there's some other way to encourage Lisa. Umm, an art class... ballet lessons... they have some fun things you could do at the Museum on Saturday... Uh-uh. Forget it Marge. There is no way I am spending my Saturdays at a Museum. Unless... Museums don't have foosball, do they? You lose, Michelangelo's David. Who's next? Meeee! I guess it doesn't matter. All these things cost money and we just don't have it. Unless... Unless what? Well, there's that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the new air conditioner. Oh, Marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! And our stopgap solution is getting cranky. I cannot believe this. I'm trying to give our daughter a head start in life and you aren't helping a bit. Marge, name one successful person who ever lived without air conditioning. Balzac! No need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one. But Balzac is the name-- Up up up up up up up. If ""ifs"" and ""buts"" were candy and nuts y... how does the rest of that go? Please, just promise you won't buy an air conditioner till we've figured out a way to help Lisa. All right, all right, I promise. There must be another way to get an air conditioner... Mmmm... re-circulated air. Uh... Homer? What, Flanders. Well, sir, I hate to be a Suspicious Aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner? Well, I admit it looks bad, Flanders, but haven't you heard of ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"" Got him, Dad! And so, just as things looked their worst... ...I realized I could make money selling my medication to Deadheads! Grampa, what are you talking about? Uh, nothing. As I was saying, things couldn't be worse for Lisa or Bart... And the ugly duckling was amazed to realize it had grown into a beautiful swan! So you see children, there is hope for anyone. Even me? No. Uh... hi. Hi. I have soy milk. The doctor says the real kind could kill me. I wish I was interesting like you. You're funny. I am? Yeah, and the world needs a clown. Hm... Doody. Booger. Man, that is killer material. Skinner is a nut! He has a rubber butt! Young man, I can assure you my posterior is nothing more than flesh, bone, and that metal plate I got in 'Nam. Now, I want you to knock off that potty talk right now. The principal said potty! You listen to me, son. You've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your life. Now what do you say? Eat my shorts! All right, I'll eat--eat your shorts?! Yeah, eat my shorts. Buttman... da da da da da da da da... Buttman. Buttman!? He's the greatest showman since that kid who eats worms. My fifteen minutes of fame are over. Well, Moe, this is it. Today's the day I get my new air conditioner. Congratulations. Who's the little chick? I'm Lisa! She has a gift. You have thirteen pickled eggs in this jar! And one cockroach! Who are you, sweetheart, the health inspector? No, but I am. Uh... here, have a margarita. Uh, that's a parasol. Oooh. Help us, Homer! Yeah, help us, ya fat yutz! Wowww... A musical instrument? Could that be a way to encourage a gifted child? Just give me a sign! Eh, works for me. So what do you like, Lisa? Viomalin... tubamaba... obomoboe? That one! Ohh! Saxomophone. Two hundred dollars! Oh, I'll take it. Would you like an inscription, sir? Yeah. ""To Lisa. Never forget your Daddy loves ."" ...and that inscription is still there today. Wow. So that's how Lisa got her sax. Next, I'll tell you the origin of Maggie's pacifier. What ""origin""? We get 'em for a dollar ninety-five down at the Safeway. Well, I really liked that story. But it still doesn't fix this. You know, Homer... I think we have some money in the air conditioner account again, hmmm? Ohhhh, but Marge! Am I doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating like a pig? Yeah, not to mention lookin' like a pig, eatin' like a pig... Don't forget the smell! Will you get off my front lawn? Why don't you make me? Why -- oh, I give up. Well, don't worry about me, Dad. It's not how it looks, it's how it sounds. Well, sir, we got a scorcher today. And to cool off, nothin' beats Fruitopia, the iced tea brewed by hippies but distributed by a heartless multinational corporation! ""Dear Lisa, May your new saxophone bring you years of D'oh!"" You're a good father. I learned from the master. Where's Maggie? Where's Maggie? I'm not kiddin'-- I can't see! My retinas have detached again! He's blind as a bat! Lisa!
