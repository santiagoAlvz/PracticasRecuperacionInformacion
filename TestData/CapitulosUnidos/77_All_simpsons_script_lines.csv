76,77,"Oh no, I can't see! I'm blind! Blind! Haw haw. April Fool's. Haw, haw. April Fool's! I've been keepin' that carton of milk next to the furnace for six weeks! Sucker! You're goin' down, Homer! I'm gonna fool you! You talk better than you fool. I'll fool you up real nice! You couldn't fool your mother on the foolingest day of your life if you had an electrified fooling machine. P.U. Ahhh, what noble visionary thought up April Fool's Day? Like Halloween and Christmas, April Fool's Day traces its origins to pagan ritual. God bless those pagans. April first used to be the Pagan New Year. Blood for Baal! Blood for Baal! The Christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn't. Happy New Year! Hi-ho pagans! New Years was three months ago, but here's a present anyhoo! It's ram's blood for your Godless ceremony! April Fool's! Now who's laughing? Now who's laughing? And that's the story of April Fool's Day. Dad! I was telling the story. Oh, right. Thar she blows! The catch of the day! Arrrr, harrrr, harrrrrr! Why, ye mutinous dogs. From this day, I be requirin' hair nets! Arrrr... arrrrrr.... arrrrrr.... I've got to fool him before the day is out -- but how? He must have a weakness. Ah, beer. My one weakness. My Achilles heel, if you will. Beer! Beer is the cheese. But how to use it... Whew! It's a good thing that beer wasn't shaken up any more, or I'd have looked quite the fool. An April Fool, as it were. Hey kid. That's for customers only. Uh, did you know there's a guy outside handing out free Stridex pads? Wow, I'm in pizza-face paradise. Moron. Ay, no es bueno. So thirsty... Eh. What're you gonna do? The following is a public service announcement. Excess of alcohol consumption can cause liver damage, and cancer of the rectum. Mmmm... beer. April F... That sounded like an explosion at the old Simpson place. Forget it. That's two blocks away. It looks like there's beer coming out of the chimney. I'm proceeding on foot. Call in a Code eight. We need pretzels! Repeat! Pretzels! Mrs. Simpson, I'm afraid your husband is dead. April Fool's! He's very much alive... although I'm afraid he may never walk again. ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT, GENTLY DOWN THE STREAM... Homie! Marge! Homer has many, many horrible problems. These shadows are brain lesions resulting from numerous blows to the head... And his brain waves are disturbingly erratic. ...You are wired in to the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock-- Arrrgh! Just testing. Arrrgh! Bart, how could you shock your little sister? My finger slipped. Arrrgh! So did mine. Bart! Lisa! Stop that. Arrrgh! Arrrgh! Arrrgh! Arrrgh! Arrrgh! No, no. No! No, wait a minute! Wait! Wait! Folks! Folks, if I could... Not yet! This is not the way to get healthy! Mrs. Simpson, can you think of anything to account for all this? I have no idea. Unless it was that time he kept falling down the cliff. I won't jump anymore, I promise. Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God. I love you, Dad. I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right -- I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I-- Hmm. That still wouldn't explain what I'm seeing here. You look familiar. Have we met before? Clear! Ugh... Clear! Doctor... he's gone. This is the part of the job I hate. You're a veterinarian? That's right. And for an extra twenty dollars I'll give Homer a tick bath and then spay him. Here ya go, Doc. Bart! Shop around. You can't beat that price. You guys must have been pretty worried about me. Hey, we know you're tough, Dad. Remember that time you got lost in the forest? This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy. Shhhh! Just watch. Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him! Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him. Right, Dad. Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! It's true. You have good coping skills. The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly. And there's one Itchy and Scratchy cartoon I don't think we'll ever forget. Why'd you bring that up? It was an amusing episode... of our lives. Thanks for coming to visit me, Moe. I brought you a little present. No! No! Beer bring pain! I can't stand to see him like this! He really needs a girlfriend. Oh, Marge, what if I wind up as some vegetable, watching TV on the couch? My important work will never be completed. Society's loss, I suppose. But our marriage has been through hard times and we always pull through. Marge! What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right? Of course. Hey! Way to go, Homer. Way to go. Hey, what'll I tell the boss? Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won't be back for ten minutes. You can do it, Homer. Stand up. I can't. He just won't budge. I've tried everything. Nothing can reach him. Mmm... chocolate. Wow. Chocolate -- half price! Mmmm, chocolate. Can't breathe... sweet chocolate... cutting off air... ...Mmm, nuts. Oh, yeah. Poor Homer. This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you. Ahhh! Kill it! Kill it! Grampa, please. He's in a coma. Coma? Why, I go in and out of comas all the... French toast, please. Is a coma painful? Oh, heck, no! You relive long lost-summers, kiss girls from high school -- it's like one of those TV shows where they show a buncha clips from old episodes. Yeah, well, anyway, I wonder what he's thinking now. This man is costing my health plan five thousand dollars a day. I demand that he die with dignity. Now look, I'm the doctor here! Well, I demand a second opinion. Hi, everybody! Hi, Dr. Nick! Oof. Oh, dear. I see no signs of life. Just to be safe, we better pull the plug. Yoink. Mr. Burns, how can you be so cold- hearted? You have no idea, woman, what that man's put me through. Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money. Please, do go on... I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick... Oh, please, continue... I thought maybe you... Oh. Well, thanks for your time. I have an unorthodox solution: a ""fantastic voyage"", if you will. Three scientists... One a beautiful woman... will be shrunk to microscopic size. They will then rendezvous in Mr. Simpson's lower colon -- Eww. Well, we have had a little trouble finding volunteers... I wish I'd gotten to know you better, Dad. But there were times when we really connected. Hi, Dad. Want me to cut out this infernal racket? No. Let me hear you play. Why? Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay? Yeah, that's more like it! ""OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE... OVER THERE."" I wrote this for you, Dad. Dad, I'm so sorry. I know I haven't been a perfect kid... Why you little... What the... I know that I got you mad once in a while... And sometimes I got into trouble... Bart, you can't go on like this. I know. ...but you always looked out for me. Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys? They're fine. And no matter what happens, I'll never forget the advice you gave me. Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave. ...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave. Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave. Dad, it's all my fault! I shook up that can of beer! It was just an April Fool's joke. Why, you little -- Homie! You're all right! We're a family again! This calls for a celebration. We're all going to Hawaii! Gotcha! It's April Fool's for two more minutes! Dad, it's May 16th. You were in that coma for seven weeks. Uh-huh. You lost five percent of your brain. Me lose brain? Uh-oh. Why'd I laugh?","Chief Wiggum, Pagan Simpsons, Lou, Specialist, Bumblebee Man, Marge Simpson, Vet, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, C.
