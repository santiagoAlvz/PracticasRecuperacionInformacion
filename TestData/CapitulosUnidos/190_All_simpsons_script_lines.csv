186,190,"Come onnn. You have to go outside to do your... business. The experts say that if you want an animal to do something, you should do it yourself first to show him how. I'm not going to the bathroom in the backyard. Sor-reee, your majesty. Hmf. Why don't you want to go out there? The kids were supposed to be keeping this yard clean. Oh, Ned! I'm so sorry! Oh-ho-ho. No problem, Marge. Oh. Turn on the TV, Lis. You turn it on. I turned it on yesterday. Allowance Day. Ding ding ding ding ding. You don't deserve an allowance. Sure we do. Ding ding ding ding ding. Ding ding ding ding ding... Ice-cream-man-Ice cream-man! That backyard is a disgrace. Now get busy. That's a good suggestion, Mom. We'll take it under advisement. But I can't go out dressed like this! What if someone sees me? You're just going into our backyard. No one will see you. Haw... Haw! Aw, man. Look at all this stuff: ""Pull weeds, mow lawn, scoop and bag 'dog business...'"" There's gotta be a way out of this. Lisa, chop off my hands! No! Then who'd chop off my hands? All right, you chop my hands half way off and then I'll still have enough strength to chop... Get to work! Kids, I made some lemonade for you. Sounds great. Bring it in here. What the? What are you doing inside? Work was hard, so we quit. What?! Hard work made us quit. I see. Well then, no chores, no allowance. Okay. We get our room and board free anyway. And Santy Claus provides the rest. The Carnival! We need money fast! Well, well, well... Looks like somebody's gonna have to do some yard -- It's carnival time! Here's money, kids! Take what you need! Oh boy! / All right, free money! / Wow! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Oo! Oo! I want to see Lobster Boy and Shrimp Girl! I want some Fried Sugar! I wanna go on the Yard-work Simulator! But when we ask you to do yardwork... Wow, the Tooth Chipper! Oo! Oo! Me first! You can't go on that. You have a heart condition. Heart condition? Get outta here. You had a quadruple bypass. You nearly died. Don't you remember? Obviously, I don't. Now if you'll get out of my way... But it doesn't look safe. And the guy running it looks a little seedy. No offense. None taken. He's not just some ""guy,"" Marge. He's a carny, and part of a noble tradition. Carnies built this country. The carnival part of it, anyway. And though they may be rat-like in appearance, they are truly kings among men. Okay, let's go, fatty. Yes, sir! Ow, my heart! Fear! Fear in the pit of your stomach! No surgeon can save you! No Bromo can soothe you! Do you dare enter the Screamatorium of Dr. Frightmarestein? Only two tickets left! Two tickets? Whoa, what a break! This isn't very scary. I vant your blood. Um, I think that one's broken. That was just confusing. Behold the ravages of age. Boo. Exit to your left. Sorry. And they're off. There they go.. Looks like number one is gonna blow... Why does this always happen when I stand here? What is it about this exact spot? It's happening again! Three rings for a dollar. Who's ready? Who's ready? See any pigeons yet dad? Do do do do do... Do do do do do... How 'bout you, Lucky! Who, me? Hey, Saw-Top, want your Dad to win you a TV? Quick, Dad. Before somebody else wins it! Ooh, almost... Rats, too hard... Oh, that was close... Wow, what a scam. Sorry, son. Daddy failed. Oh, listen pal, I gotta son of my own. Here. A novelty comb! Kings among men... You're looking at Adolf Hitler's personal limousine. It's roomier than Bonnie and Clyde's Death Car and was the first automobile to come with fahrvegnugen! Wow, it's fuehrer-rific! There are some who say Hitler's skeleton is in the trunk. Others say just his spare tire. I'm a busy man, so I haven't checked yet. Hm... One of these must activate the flame thrower. Uh oh. Bart! What in the name of high school football?! Out of my way! I'm Hitler! Ow! Ow! Man, that hurts. Oh, I can't stand it. You are... ...in grave danger. You wrecked Hitler's car. What did he ever do to you? Why, you just damaged the main attraction of my carnival, son. Hey, I thought I was your main attraction. Well... I... Ah... Oh... Oh, you are, Humphrey. You are. Hey, he's getting away. Not so fast, pardner. You owe me some money. Hey, come on! He doesn't have any money. Look at his clothes. Hmm, well, I still can't let him off the hook. You're gonna work off your debt right here. At the carnival? Cool! Hey, that's not fair! I wanna be a carny, too! Can I, mister? Huh? Can I? Please? I don't know... You gonna get drunk and start a lot of trouble? Sure, anything you want. All right, see you tomorrow. Six a.m. And you're gonna work like you've never worked before. Woo hoo! We just saw the most amazing camel! It was wearing a hat! Son, if you don't finish your cotton candy, you won't get your Sno-cone. Aw, heck. Hey, you lost your money fair and square. I didn't scam nobody. Oh-ho, put down your stick. We're here to work. Starting today, we're carnies. Just like you. Well, in that case, let me show you how I scammed you. Have a seat. Spud, throw a couple more apples in the caramel. Aw, now don't worry. That's just to scare off thieves. Hmm... Yeah, he's telling the truth. Thanks for the food, Mister... Name's Cooder. This is my boy, Spud. And there's no need to thank us. We carnival folk look out for each other. That's the Carny Code. Did ya hear that, Bart? The Carny Code. Bart, did you hear that? Yes! Ah, there you are. You two ready to work? Yes, sir! So what's our first job, huh? Test the roller coaster? Fry up some cheese? Hose down the freaks? Somethin' like that, yeah. Ohh, this isn't fun... Maybe if you didn't go to the bathroom so much, you wouldn't be so small. Please, folks. Hold your fire. The water level is dangerously low. Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ow! My leg! All right, now this geek bit is pretty straightforward. You just bite the heads off the chickens and take a bow. Go on, give it a try. And remember, big smiles. Oh. Bart? Yeah, Dad? Do I like chicken? Does it matter? I guess not. Hey, boss. Uh, me and Spud gotta duck out for our AA meetin'. We need someone to cover for us. Okay. Simpson, you and your boy'll be taking over the ring toss. Dad, we're saved! Buddy, you're the luckiest chicken in the world. Ya see, the trick here is, the rings won't fit over the good prizes. Oh, we'll see about that. Gimme ten rings. So, anyway... uh, the main thing is to bring in the rubes. Do whatever it takes. Sweet talk, insults, slang from the 30s that no one uses anymore... Like ""rubes""? Now you're on the trolley. Well, we gotta git. Here's the money box. Uh, any questions? Ah, yes. How do we handle refunds? I'm gonna give this to you. Good move. Gimme ten rings. Lookie, lookie, hey, hey, wocka, wocka! I got rings and you want 'em! Win a genuine Ronex watch. Just like a real moogie star! Hey, there's a sucker. Aw, c'mon, Dad. Get on the trolley. Hey, highpockets! Win somethin' for your girlfriend? Seymour, I want that lamp. Win that lamp for me, Seymour. All right, Simpson, be honest with me. Is it actually possible to win this game? If I like ya, it is. Hot dog! Let's go! No, throw it over the peg... Well that's no good... Oh, no... Are you blind? I'm trying, Mother. It's hard! You're failing, Seymour. What is it about you and failure? We're natural born carnies, Dad. If only we weren't tied down with a family... Yeah, we could start our own game, where people throw ducks at balloons, and nothing's the way it seems. Ah, I hate to interrupt your fun, boys... But I got a few complaints that your game is crooked. And how... Gee, I'd hate to close you down. Maybe we can reach a little, ah, ""understanding"" here... I understand. Um, hey, Dad, I, I think he wants a... Not right now, son. Daddy's talking to a policeman. Uh, let me put it this way. I'm looking for my friend ""Bill."" Have you seen any ""Bills"" around here? No. He's Bart. Listen carefully and watch me wink as I speak. Okay? Okay. The guy I'm really looking for, wink, is Mr. ""Bribe,"" wink, wink. It's a ring toss game. All right, that's it. I'm shutting this game down. Well, ain't that somethin'. Our game! Our home! Wh-what happened here? Cops took it. What?! Why didn't you bribe them? I was trying to, but the opportunity never came up. Oh, good Lord. Our whole life was in that trailer. What are we gonna do now? Can't you stay in the Whack-A-Mole game? Naw. Fantastic Dan lives there. Did-ja call me, Spud? Look at 'em, Bart. If a carny can wind up homeless, it can happen to anyone. I'm goin' for a corn dog. You want one? Yes, but first there's a little matter of the Carny Code. Cooder, Spud. Get off that hog. You're coming to stay at our house. Why did you shudder just now, Mom? I don't know. You certainly have a nice house here, ma'am. It must have taken you years to win all this stuff. Let me get you a coaster for those feet. Hey, check this out. I can unhinge all my joints at once. Doin' anything tonight, blue eyes? Ewww! How long are those roustabouts going to be staying here? Oh, it won't be long. Once their resume gets out, they'll have all kinds of offers. The older one can pull out his left eye. Little help? Here's a little trick my grandmother taught me. Wow. Can you do that again? Ech, not for a little while. So Mr. Cooder, how long have you been in the traveling amusement industry? Aw hell, the Cooders have been carnies ever since we came here in 1620, clingin' to the side of the Mayflower. Thanks for dinner, Mom. I love you. Aw, aren't you sweet? Hey, my pearls! Spud taught me that. Good one, Spud. Well, sure is awful kind of ya to take us into your beautiful home here. I just wish we had some way to repay ya. Yeah, good thinkin', Spudford. Ah, you folks ever been on a glass bottom boat ride? 'Cause we just happen to have some tickets. Ooo, what a nice surprise! This is so generous of you, Cooder. Now who's the filthy sleezebag, uh Marge? The undersea world certainly is full of wonders. Ooo, look at that. / Ooo. / Mmm. That's our sister ship, the Athena. Went down with 88 souls just last week. I wonder how that happened? Hey, come on, Sharky. / Hey, you want a piece of this? / You call yourself the king of the jungle? / Etc. That was fun. I wish we had a glass bottom car. I can't help but wonder what we're missing. I was wrong about the Cooders, Dad. They're the nicest of all the transients you've ever brought home. And how. / Heck yeah. / Yes they are. / You betcha. That's weird. The key doesn't fit. Hey, someone's boarded up our windows! Check this out! What's going on? Cooder! What have you done to our house? It's ours now. Tell us where the extra sheets are and get off our property. They're squatting in our house? You can't do this to me. What about the Carny Code? Carnies took over our house. You've gotta help us. Well, well, look who's here. Mr. No Bribe. Sure, we'll help ya. Just sit down and wait for Detective Like-I-give-a-damn. Thank you so much. Dad... Honey, Daddy's waiting for the detective. I found some food for breakfast. I hope everyone likes the red things that grow on this tree. Bart, you're brushing your teeth with my twig. So. I let you use my leaves. That Urkle's a hoot. Listen to 'em, watching my television, sittin' on my couch... You better not be in my ass-groove! Homer! It took me years to forge that groove. Ugh! One of them's playing my saxophone! Oh, no! The spit valve! Release the spit valve! Over the sink! Over the sink! Hey, look at me! I'm a millionaire! Wow, Dad! You look like James Bond! Ha, ha. Hey, it's gettin' a little cold in here. Throw another one of them photo albums on the fire. Which one? ""Precious Moments"" or ""Treasured Memories?"" Quit your yappin'! I'm freezin'! Good Morning everybody. Homer!! Stupid Gravity. We can't just give up our home. There's gotta be a way to get those guys out of there. I say we set fire to the house. Kill 'em that way. We don't want to kill them, Bart. We just want our home back. Well... if we did set fire to the house... No fires! I've got it! No fires. There must be a way to outsmart them. Aw, you can't outsmart carnival folk. They're the cleverest folk in the world. Just look at the way they sucker regular folk with those crooked games. That's it! Fire! Or... Cooder residence. I've got a proposition for you, Cooder. Yeah, I'm listenin'. One game of ring toss. If I can throw this Hula Hoop onto the chimney, you'll give us our house back. If I miss, I'll sign the deed over to you. Homer, no! Oh, you'll never make it, Dad! So we'd own the house legit? That's right. Deal. Oh, I can't watch. Now! What...? Hey, they just ran into the house. That Homer fella grifted you good, Dad. Well, there's no shame in being beaten by the best. But he didn't seem all that... We were beaten by the best, boy. I'm so proud of you, Homer. You got us our house back. Way to go, Dad. You actually outwitted someone. Yeah, I guess your old man is smarter than you thought. Look at 'em standing out there. No place to go. Heh, heh. Poor guys. Hey, what if we let 'em stay here for just a few days? Mom. Get him away from the window. Homer... My groove! They mushed it all out of shape. All right, better put on a pot of coffee, Marge. This could take a while. Come on now, just a little more. Little more to the left... to the left there. What did he do this thing? Almost...
