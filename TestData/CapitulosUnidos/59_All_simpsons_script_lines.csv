58,59,"Forgot there was a physical today, huh? Yeah. Hey, Homer, can I borrow your underwear? Nah. This can't be right. This man has 104% body fat! Hey, no eating in the tank! Go to hell. How was your day at work, dear? Oh, the usual. Stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough... Sir, I'm afraid Homer Simpson is sterile. Who? One of your cabbage heads from Sector 7-G. Take a look at this sperm sample from his recent physical. Ewww. Now, compare this with a normal sperm sample. Hm. Oh yes. I'm afraid radiation from the plant is the reason he's shooting blanks. He could sue us for millions. Mother of pearl. Call my lawyers! Before you begin, let me make one thing clear to you. I want your legal advice. I even pay for it. But to me you're all vipers. You live on personal injury. You live on divorces. You live on pain and misery...... but I'm rambling. Anybody want any coffee? I'll have some coffee. Want it black, don't you? Black like your heart! It's so hard for me to listen to you, I hate you all so much... I'm sorry. It's my problem. I'll deal with it. Please continue. If you offer Mr. Simpson a token sum -- say, a couple thou -- he'll be so dazzled, he'll sign anything you shove under his nose. Oh, brilliant. A cash settlement. I could have figured that out, you button-down maggot. Do you have any cream? Oh yes, of course. Where are my manners? Yeah... I used to be rich. I owned ""Mickey Mouse Massage Parlors"". Then those Disney sleezeballs shut me down. I said, ""Look, I'll change the logo, put Mickey's pants back on"". Some guys you just can't reason with. Well, I used to own a successful car company. My strategy was givin' them Japanese names. You guys ever drive a Tempura Hatchback? Yeah, life was sweet. Then I found out I had a long lost half- brother. Homer! Herb? I let him design a car that would make or break my company. Presenting... The Homer! I'm ruined! Forbes Magazine called it the ""Blunder of the Century."" A little overblown, don't you think? What about new Coke? Hey, I invented that. Yeah, but all that's in the past. Because this is America and in America you're never finished as long as you've got a brain in your head. Because all a man really needs is an idea. Well, I'm lit. Me too. And now, the next event...in our Living Room Olympics... the always controversial, couch vault. I do this for Stain Master Carpets. Proud sponsor of the Living Room Olympics. What the hell are you two... Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat... the dream is over. All right, who did this? We were just sitting on the couch, quietly chatting, when we heard a creaking noise. We leapt off just in time to see it collapse. There, there. You're safe now, little sister. Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!? Oh, goodbye, old girl. We've had a lot of great memories. ""That's right, I shot J.R."" ""Except for huge gaps in the Western states, Hands Across America was a complete success."" Hands across America... ""Well, I never thought I'd see it. They're dancing on the Berlin Wall. These lithe and lively lovers of liberation..."" Boring. Sorry I ruined your date Sergeant Carter. Pyle! Well friend, you're going back where you came from. The curb in front of Flanders' house. Let's see, I need an idea... idea... idea... What's the matter with me? I used to have hundreds of ideas. What do you want? I just changed your diaper. Are you hungry? Are you cold? Do you want to go home? Lady, you just gave me the idea of a lifetime. How do I thank you? Please don't hurt me. Consider it done. Hey pal, I heard about the couch. Yeah, you gonna to be okay? Yeah. You know, my life just can't get any worse. That's right. There's no way my life could possibly get any worse. Simpson! Report to Mr. Burns' office at once! Is this the one with the lazy sperm? Hmmm hmmm. Ah, Simpson, you big virile son-of-a- gun. How would you like a check for two-thousand dollars? Would I! All you have to do is sign this form. Wait a minute. I'm not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it. All right, well, it just explains that you've won -- yes, that's it -- won the first annual... uh... Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for... a-a-a Outstanding Achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, Excellence! Don't I get some kind of trophy? At a big award ceremony?

17670,59,90,Singers: (SINGING) EXCELLENCE! Yess... that was Bonita De Wolf and the Springfield Nuclear Plant Soft Shoe Society. This Award is the biggest farce I ever saw. What about the Emmys? I stand corrected. And now to present the award, here's former heavyweight champion, Smokin' Joe Frazier. Webster's Dictionary defines excellence as ""the quality or condition of being excellent"". And now, the winner of the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award For Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence. Please please please please please... Dad, you know you won. Don't jinx it! The winner... Homer Simpson! Oh, my God!! Woo hoo! I win! Keep those pickled eggs comin', Moe. You cleaned me out Smokin' Joe. What's the matter Homer? Cummerbund too tight? I miss my couch. I know how you feel. You lost a couch. I lost a heavyweight championship. Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There's like three of those. That couch was one of a kind. Homer, I know things are tough now. But one day you'll be walking along and you'll see a piece of furniture that you can love just as much. Hey, Frazier, shut up! Barney, you've been riding my back all night. Oh yeah? Care to step outside? Let's do it. I think I'm gonna take a walk. All right! A peanut! I'm telling you, all a man needs is an idea. And I've got an idea. Then how come you're still a bum? All right. A man needs two things, an idea and money to get it off the ground. Hello, what's this? ""Local man, Homer Simpson, receives award and $2,000 check."" Hmmm... Any of you guys know which freight goes to Springfield? Uh-uh. Nope. Nope. That's the one. I feel so empty. So alone, so... couchless. Wow. The Spine Melter 2000. Give me full power. But sir... Dammit, I said full power! Dad? Dad? I'll take it. This chair is $2,000. We could buy a whole living room set for that. Marge, there's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer. This money was a blessing. We can't just spend it on some creature comfort. All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky. Yes? Oh... uh... sorry, I must have the wrong house. Ho, ho, that's where you're wrong, friend. Aren't we in luck? Today's our tithe day and we've got ourselves a transient. Come in my friend. Let us feed and bathe you. Hey wait a minute... Dad, can I anoint the sores on his feet? I think it's Mom's turn, son. Ah, no fair. Thanks for the suit. Well, if you ever want to spend the night, Maude and I can sleep on card tables. ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS... ""MARCHING AS TO WAR, ETC..."" They're singing again. Lousy neighbors. Wish I was deaf. What am I gonna say? This is the guy who ruined me. But on the other hand, he's family. So many conflicting emotions. How to express them... Herb! Unky Herb! Bart... Lisa. I'm so glad to see you. You weren't so glad to see me. I'm sorry, Homer. But I'm still mad at you. Every word you say just makes me want to punch you in the face. Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt? I'll try, but I'm not making any promises. Herb! How have you been? I've been living in a cardboard box, sleeping on grates, eatin' out of dumpsters. You? Can't complain. Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode. On... off... on... off. Homer, he knows how to work a light switch. Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know what this switch does. This is really great, Marge. I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Counsel. They do good work. Unky Herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself? Discarded pizza boxes are an inexpensive source of cheese. Lisa, aren't you happy to see me? Why didn't you write, Unky Herb? Hey if I wrote to you what was I supposed to say? ""Dear Lisa, last night I used a rat for a pillow thanks to your pop. I see your point. WHETHER YOU'RE DRIVING NEAR OR FAR / POWELL MAKES A POW-POW-POWERFUL CAR! Maggie, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. You're gonna make me rich again. Yes-oo are! Yes-oo are! One, two, three... Ventnor Avenue. And while on Ventnor Avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous Hotel Lisa. A valet will be around shortly to park your thimble. Of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the bill. Get to the point. Eleven hundred and fifty bones. That's all I got. Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. I guess you're just not much of a businessman. Maybe we should play another game. Why are we playin' games when we got two grand in the bank!? Remember when Dad won the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence? Well, I think we should invest in a set of the great books of Western Civilization. Look at this ad from ""New Republic for Kids."" Each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: ""Paradise Regained,"" ""Martin Chuzzlewit,"" or Herman Melville's twin classics ""Omoo"" and ""Typee"". Wait, Marge. Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair? That was your idea. I think we should get a machine gun. We could use it to hunt game, spell out things, or ring in the new year! Well, I really think we need to replace the washer and dryer. How would you like to spend two thousand dollars to give a broken man a second chance? Nah. Homer, wait. Herb, what're you talking about? Up-up-up-up. Not here. Come into the dining room. I want to give you a twenty-minute presentation that will change the world. Twenty minutes?! Okay. Now, before I tell you about my idea, I'd like to show you this. It's drinking the water! Take it easy, Homer. Now this is an example of how one little idea -- carefully marketed... This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars! No, Homer. That invention is out already. I'm just using it as an example. It's going back for more! Homer, this is my invention. Now, of course, with these blueprints you'll have to use your imagination. It's a baby translator. It measures the pitch, the frequency, and the urgency of a baby's cries. Then it tells whoever's around -- in plain English -- exactly what the baby is trying to say. Everything from ""Change me"" to ""turn off that damn Raffi record."" That's a very clever idea! All I need is a couple thousand dollars to build a prototype. You'll have your money back in thirty days. I swear. I think we owe a debt to Unky Herb. He took us into his home and Dad destroyed him. Dad, you know some shyster's gonna bilk you out of your money. It may as well be your brother. All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother. Nope. Okay, then just give me the drinking bird. Now, let's see... What could you be trying to say? Nothing downstairs... You just took a nap... I want to suck your nose. Ooga booga! Ooga booga! I'm scared. Hmm... the amplitude of the sine wave is insufficient for ""Burp Me"", and this saw-tooth formation is something I've never... Eureka. Now, I bet you're all wondering what lies under this sheet. Not really. We peeked inside while you were in the john. Oh. Well, here it is again. My ""Baby Translator!"" Whoooa!! Marge, you don't have to humor me. Well, it's pretty ingrained. What do you think, Homer? Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks. Homer, could you stop thinking about your ass! I try, but I can't. Lavish attention on me and entertain me. Maggie, you talked! You see! It tells you exactly what's on the baby's mind. Maggie! Maggie! Where did you go? Peek-a-boo! Oh, there you are. Very amusing. Well, Homer, now what do you think? I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something. Homer, every mother in the country is going to want one of these. I have soiled myself. How embarrassing. I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear. Don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. He is your brother. Well, when is he gonna act like it? This radio controlled plane gives your baby the chance to fly, just like my son here. He can execute the barrel roll... loop-de-loop... then bring it in for the perfect landing. Whoop, oh dear. My wife is going to kill me. I only want to eat candy! Then that's all you'll get. This leash demeans us both. I'll take two. I'll take a dozen! I represent the ""Precious Baby Discount Stores"". I'll take 50,000. I'm rich again! USA! USA! USA! Homer, here's a check for two-thousand dollars. But I also wanted to give you each a little something for believing in me. Lisa, this is the first volume of The Great Books of Western Civilization. You'll receive a new one every month. From ""Beowulf"" to ""Less Than Zero."" Finally, a copy of ""Ethan Frome"" to call my own. Now Bart, I know you're too young for the machine gun you wanted. But I'm gonna give you something that'll make sure when you're old enough you can still buy one. A membership in the National Rifle Association. Wow! The NRA. Can I be get armor piercing cyanide-tipped bullets, too? It's in the Constitution, son. Maggie, who brought me my fortune I'll give you anything you want in this world. I want what the dog's eating. I'll get you somethin' nice. Now Marge... Herb, I appreciate your generosity, but I don't need any gift from you. You're too late, Marge. I got you a new washer and dryer. And I sold the old ones for fifty bucks. Come on washer! Oh, you stupid dryer! Herb, I don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me. Homer, walk me to my car. What do I get? What do I get? It's not another punch in the face is it? Because if it is, I don't want it. This is what you get, Homer. I forgive you. You can call me brother and I can do the same. That's it? That's it. I see your point, brother. Gimme a hug, brother. All right... but I never really hugged a man before. Homer, I bought you the damn chair. That's enough already.
