You smokers disgust me. Hey 'Pu, you got a breakfast cereal for people with syphilis? Hands up, scuzzbag. No, not you. The smoking scuzzbag. Ho-ho, chill out, dude. I'll pay the fine. Not this time, you won't. This is your third strike. First you torched that orphanage, then you blew up that bus full of nuns... Hey, that was self-defense. Well, you'll be seeing lotsa nuns where you're going, pal: hell! Because the penalty for strike three is death. Ho-ho, you'll never make it stick, dude. Will too. 'Cause this place is full of witnesses: Apu... that scuzzbag Moe... I'm not going to forget this, dudes. I'm going to totally kill both of you. And, uh, don't forget Bart Simpson. He's a witness too. Right, Barty? Oh, you are soooo dead, little dude. Thanks a lot, Chief. You kids crack me up. Hi, I'm Ed McMahon. Tonight on Fox, from the producers of ""When Skirts Fall Off"" and ""Secrets of National Security Revealed,"" it's... ""World's Deadliest Executions!"" Making his first appearance on our show, heaaarrrs... ""Snake!"" Boooo! / / Spark him! / Fry him! Fry his ass! / Fry him! / Plug him in! Plug him in! Thank you, Chickie-pies. The chair? How come they only do crucifixions during sweeps? Snake played Lecross at Ball State University. So long, Snake. You'll never harm another person with second-hand smoke. Yaaaaaahrg. Duuuude. Hi-yo! All right now, let's get this carcass over to the hospital and carve it up for organs. Dibs on the liver! Woo hoo! Marge, they found a donor! I'm saved! Boy, you're getting this transplant just in time, Homer. This is genuine human hair. This is legal, right? Yeah, sure, whatever. These drugs will make the operation seem like a beautiful dream. Ahhhhh. Hi, everybody! Who wants to see their sexy new daddy? Whoa! Whoaaa, Daaad! Ooooh-woo! Wow. If your fly weren't open, you'd look just like Roger Moore. Later, chickie-pie. Ooh. Ooo-la-la Simp-son. Huh. What can I do for you and your new do? You sent me to the chair. Snake? But you're dead. I know you are, but what am I? No, no, noooooo! ... And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. Oh, my God! Oh, man! Gee! I can't believe it. That's horrible! Who'll run the Kwik-E-Mart? I'm afraid we have no leads, but I can safely say Apu did not suffer. Looks to me like he suffered a lot, Chief. Aw, geez, Lou, how long were you gonna let me keep drinkin' this thing? Who'd do such a thing? Ah, morning, Homer. Ah, you're looking unusually focused this morning. Shut your squeal hole, booze jockey. I'm gonna, like, totally waste you. Well, somebody's a Grumpy Gus. What's-- Yoink. Ooh! Ah, for crying out loud. Another of Springfield's beloved citizens was murdered today. Filthy old bartender Moe Szyslak has watered down his last highball. Oh my God! Everyone Snake swore revenge on is being murdered! It's almost as if he's killing from beyond the grave. I told you capital punishment isn't a deterrent. Don't you get it? He swore he'd kill me too. I'm next! Don't worry. I'll protect you... Little dude. There. Now no murderers can get in... or out. Dad? You are sooo dead. Nooo! Come here, you little-- Stop it! You're killing me. My school picture!! Daddy would like a word with you, Barty! Help! Dad's trying to kill me! It's hammer time, Snitchy. That's Snake's voice! Of course... the transplant! Somehow Snake's hair must be controlling-- Oh please, Lisa. Everyone's already figured that out. You've got to fight the hair, Dad! But I look so youthful and hunky. The kid's gotta die. But I love my son. More than a lush head of hair? Don't make me choose! Nooooo! I love you, son. I love you too, Dad. Get off of me. I'll show you, hair! Ow! That's my face, you idiot! Idiot?! Why you... little... ... Show you... ... I'll Kill you! Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for the murders of Moe Szyslak and Apu Nahasa -- pasa -- Uh, just Moe, just Moe. It wasn't me, it was the hair! Freeze, hairball! Now that's what I call a bad hair day! May I remind you that two people are dead? Oh, wait. I just got it. Bad hair day. Bleh! Hey hey! Tonight I'm going to suck! Your blood! Okay, get ready for the violent-est, disemboweling-est, vomit inducing-est Itchy and Scratchy Halloween Special ever--! What the-- Hey! Sorry, but if I let you watch one of these gruesome Halloween cartoons, I'd be a pretty lousy mother. Why don't you kids come trick-or-treating with Maggie and me? Nah, it's too early. I need to work under cover of darkness. Oh, Homer, you're not going as a hobo again? Going where? Well, we're leaving. And remember, no Itchy and Scratchy. I better take these batteries just to be sure. Mama took those batteries / She took 'em away / Mama took those batteries / Size double A... There's gotta be some batteries in here somewhere. Hmm... Ohh, Bart, that's plutonium. It's highly unstable. Don't you ever get tired of being wrong? Trick or Treat. What's wrong with the TV? Color's screwed up. Whoaaa! Cool! Bart, quit it! Hey... gim... ah... ah! Hey Lis, we're characters in a cartoon! How humiliating. Look! Why are you laughing? Hey, they're laughing at your pain. That's mean. Let's teach them a lesson. A cartoon axe. I love it. Help! Police! To protect and sever? Ooh. How are Bart and Lisa gonna get out of this one? Sorry. It happens. Hey, hey, wiggly, wiggly, Poochie's in the house! We're done for, Bart! Not if I know cartoons! Whoaaa! Phew, that was close. Uh, Bart? Not now Lis, I'm trying to relax. Bor-ing. I'm telling you, this cilantro really gives it a zing! Reeg, there's no cilantro in it. Oh, for the love... this soup is outta control! My-my eyes! My beautiful eyes! Oh, that's it, I'm going home! Dom DeLuise can interview himself. Itchy's house. This is where we came in. Look! Dad, you gotta get us out of here! Use the remote! Huh? Oh, okay... Let's see... ""pause,"" ""three,"" no ""fa-fa""... Hurry, Homer! Oooh, that is gonna hurt tomorrow. Dad! Push exit! Lisa, look out! A skeleton! Oh! Hee hee hee hee. Look how cute they are. Look at him go. You're beauty-ful. Aww, somebody's in love. That means you'll have to be neutered. Noooooo! Here comes the flying saucer! What's wrong with stinky? She's teething. Look... her very first baby tooth. Ohh... Ahh... Oh, that's disgusting. Oh, geez! I just lost my appetite. Me too. Wait, mine came back. I know how to cheer you up. This little piggy went to Kwik-E-Mart, this little piggy went nuts, this little piggy went surfing, and this little piggy went-- Ooh! Look, Marge! Maggie lost her baby legs! Oh my God! Homer, do something! The ceiling's not a safe place for a young baby! All right. I got it. Come on. Get... off the... Bad baby! Oh, she's entering the terrible twos, all right. It's probably nothing, but we just wanted to be sure. Is there anything you can prescribe, doctor? Fire, and lots of it. Oh, that's your cure for everything. Poor Maggie. If only you could tell us what's happening to you. Commander Kang! Receiving transmission from Infant Pod 13. Holy phlerking schnit! What's the message? Larval stage completed... Standing by for orders... Experiencing terrible rash. Over. Ensign Kodos, set coordinates for the obscure T-shirt producing planet known as Earth. It's time I paid a visit to... MY DAUGHTER! We'll return with ""How Dracula Got His Groove Back."" Hello-- Oh, great. Mormons. Actually, we're Quantum Presbyterians. And we've come to see... MY DAUGHTER. Oh, Lord. I was hoping this day would never come. Huh? What are you talking about? You mean you never told him? I guess I've been in denial. Homer... Kang is Maggie's father. You intergalactic hussy! How could you?! Was he better than me? It all happened about two years ago... There I was, having a great time in the back yard, when without warning, I was abducted by aliens. Warning! Warning! Prepare to be abducted! Congratulations. You have been selected for our cross-breeding program. To put you at ease, we have re-created the most common spawning locations of your species. You may choose either... the back seat of a Camaro, an airplane bathroom, a friend's wedding, or the alley behind a porno theater. I absolutely refuse to go along with this. But since I have no choice, I'll take the alley. Initiate fertilization procedure. Oh, you look lovely this evening. Have you decreased in mass? I tried to resist, but they applied powerful mind confusion techniques. Look behind you! Insemination complete. Really? That seemed awfully quick. What are you implying? Nothing, nothing. Whoa. Wow, look at the time. I'd love to stay, but I have an early meeting tomorrow. You're a super girl, though. I'll call you some time. Nine months later, I gave birth to Maggie. And now she must return home to Rigel 7, where she will be guaranteed a lucrative civil service job for life. Well, we can't compete with that, but-- But nothing. Get your slimeless hands off her. People, people. Space monsters. This is going nowhere. There's only one man who can settle an argument this bizarre. Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Okay, we're back. Homer, how did it feel to learn your baby was fathered by a drooling space octopus? It made me angry, Jerry. Angry and tired. Well, you're about to get a whole lot angrier... because we have the extramarital extraterrestrial backstage in a soundproof booth where he can't hear us. I hear all. Ladies and gentlemen, meet Kang. One-eyed, two-timing ! I'm gonna ! Oh yeah? Well, hyperbolic paraboloid yo mama! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! Yeah, I got a question for that gross thing, whatever it is... Homer. Nah, the green dude. If you're that baby's daddy, where you been at? Yeah. You know, somebody needs to learn your green ass some responsibility-- Now hold on, Kang. You can't bully my audience with your fancy ray gun. And now for my final thought. Nobody wins when parents put their petty squabbles above the welfare of a child. Let's hope they put their differences aside and do what's best for Maggie. Ow! What the fu-- Get the baby off Son of a bit-- I am so -ing embarrassed. I can't believe it. Jerry Springer didn't solve our conflict. And now he's dead. Anyhoo, this is your last chance. Turn over the baby now. Or we will destroy all your leaders in Washington. Oh, you couldn't destroy every politician. Just watch us. Don't forget Ken Starr. Suckers. C'mon, Maggie. Let's go home. Very well. I'll drive. I need blood. My eyes!
