108,109,"Well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there. Homer, did you remember to lock the front door of the house? Well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there, again. When you locked the front door, did you remember to lock the back door? Oh no! We left Grampa back at the gas station. What about Grampa? ""Hello."" ""We're here."" ""Hi."" etc. Oh goody, the Sea Monkeys I ordered have arrived. Look at them cavort and caper. Sir, they're the new winter caretakers for the lodge. Yes, they work hard and they play hard. This house has quite a long and colorful history. It was built on an ancient Indian burial ground, and was the setting of satanic rituals, witch burnings, and five John Denver Christmas Specials. John Denver. Hmm, that's odd. Usually the blood gets off at the second floor. Hey, I found a short cut through your hedgemaze. Now, now. Go easy on the wee one. His father's gonna go crazy and chop them all into haggis. What's haggis? Boy, you read my thoughts! You've got the ""shinning."" You mean ""shining."" Shhh! You wanna' get sued? Now look, boy. If your Da' goes ga-ga, you just use that ""shin"" of yours to call me and I'll come a-runnin'. But don't be readin' my mind between four and five. That's Willie's time. Yes, by cutting off cable TV and the beer supply, I can ensure an honest winter's work out of those low-lifes. Sir, did you ever stop to think that maybe it was doing this that caused the previous caretakers to go insane and murder their families? Hmm, perhaps. Tell you what. We come back and everyone's slaughtered, I owe you a coke. Hm, cable's out... Think I'll have a beer. Hm, not a drop in the house. What do you know? Homer, I'm impressed. You're taking this quite well. I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you! Homer! Sorry, sorry. Don't worry, there's plenty I can do to keep myself occupied. Maybe I'll check out that axe collection. See ya later. Mom, is Dad gonna kill us? We're just gonna have to wait and see. So what'll it be, Homer? Moe! Give me a beer! No. Not unless you kill your family. Why should I kill my family? Uh, they'd be much happier as ghosts. You don't look so happy. Oh, I'm happy. I'm very happy. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. See? Now waste your family and I'll give you a beer! Homer! Homie? Hm... what he's typed will be a window into his madness. Feelin' fine, well, that's a relief. This is less encouraging. So, what do you think, Marge? All I need is a title. I was thinking along the lines of ""No TV and No Beer Make Homer..."" something something. Go crazy? Don't mind if I do. Stay away from me, Homer! Gimme the bat, Marge. Gimme the bat! Gimme the bat! C'mon, gimme the bat. Gimme the bat ba-bat! Heh-heh. Scaredy-cat... You stay here 'til you're no longer insane. Mmmm, chili would be good tonight. Homer, it's Moe. Ah, look, some of the ghouls and I are a little concerned the project isn't moving forward. Can't murder now. Eating. Oh, for cryin' out loud. C'mon. Noooo! Heeeeere's Johnny. Daaaa-vid Lettermaaaan! Hi David, I'm Grampa. I'm Mike Wallace. I'm Morley Safer. And I'm Ed Bradley. All this and Andy Rooney tonight on ""60 minutes."" Hello, police? This is Marge Simpson. My husband is on a murderous rampage. Over. Oh, well thank God that's over. I was worried there for a second. No answer. Don't worry, Mom. I can use my ""shinning"" to call Willie. And that was the first time she'd ever flown a plane. Uh oh. The little fat boy an' his family're in trouble. I'm comin' to rescue the lot o' ya. All right, looney! Show me what ya got. Heh, is that the best you can do? Oh my, I hope that rug was Scotchguarded. Must kill family. . ...have been given rifles, but no ammunition. Reportedly there was a hardware store along the... Dad, look! Television! Teacher, mother, secret lover. Urge to kill fading, fading... Fading... Rising! ...Fading, fading, gone. Come, family, sit in the snow with Daddy and let us all bask in television's warm glowing, warming glow. Live from Broadway, it's the Tony Awards! With your hosts, Tyne Daly and Hal Linden. Homer, change channel! Can't. Frozen. One!... ONE / SINGULAR SENSATION... Urge to kill rising. Y'know, Marge, I've had my share of troubles but sitting here now with you and the kids, in our cozy home in this beautiful, free country, it just makes me feel that I'm really a lucky guy. Dad!! Your hand is jammed in the toaster!! Dad!! Daaadd!! Homer!! Get it off! Get it off! Get it offf!! Dad, it's in there again! This shouldn't be too hard to fix, with the right tools. There! Better than new! Now to take her for a test toast. What the-? Look at that! I'm the first non- Brazilian person to travel backwards through time! Correction, Homer, you're the second. That's right, Mr. Peabody. Quiet, you. I've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos. OK. Don't panic. Remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day... If you ever travel back in time, don't step on anything, because even the tiniest change can alter the future in ways you can't imagine. Fine. As long as I stand perfectly still and don't touch anything, I won't destroy the future. Stupid bug. You go squish now. But that was just one little insignificant mosquito. That can't change the future, right? Right? Phew. I'm back. Oh, my loving family. Nothing's changed. Hidilly ho, slave-a-reenos. Okilly dokilly. Hey, what the hell is that geek Flanders doing on TV? Oh, I see by the big board we've got a Negative Nellie in Sector Two. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask the whole family to kinda freeze and prepare for re-Neducation. Don't you remember, Dad? Flanders is the unquestioned lord and master of the world. Okay, everybody. Let's see some big smiles. Just relax, let the hooks do their work. What the hell are you smiling at? Now, in case all that smilin' didn't cheer ya up, there's one thing that never fails. A nice glass of warm milk, a little nap, and a total frontal lobotomy. It's not so bad, Homer. They go in through your nose. And they let you keep the piece of brain they cut out. Look. Oooo, hello. Hello there. Who's that big man there? Who's da? Join us, Father. It's Bliiiiisssss. Nooooo! Oh no! They're gaining on me. Wait, I have an idea. These wieners will give me the quick energy I need to escape. I gotta go back... Fix future... This time I'm not gonna touch a thing. Mustn't crush. Mustn't kill. Made it! Oh, I wish I wish I hadn't killed that fish. Hey, where is everybody? Hey, there's a bug that looks like dad. Let's kill it. Okay. This is gonna cost me. I mean, Heeeyy. Good morning, father dear. Hope you're well. Are we taking the new Lexus to Aunt Patty and Selma's funeral today? Hmm. Fabulous house. Well-behaved kids. Sisters-in-law dead. Luxury sedan. Woo hoo! I hit the jackpot. Marge, dear. Would you kindly pass me a donut? ""Donut?"" What's a donut? Hmph. It's raining again. You're still not in your own world, Homer. I can get you home, but you have to do exactly as I tell... This is indeed a disturbing universe. Don't touch anything?!! I'll... touch... whatever... I... feel like!! Foolish earthling. Totally unprepared for the effects of time travel. What happened to us, Kodos? Quiet you. Good morning, dear. What's my name?! What color is the sky?! What of donuts? WHAT?! For the love of God, tell meeeee!!! Homer! The sky is blue. Donuts are plentiful. Friday is TGIF night on ABC. What's gotten into you? Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's just eat. Eh. Close enough. Hey everybody! Let's all turn our desks backwards before Mrs. Krabappel shows up! Yeah / Cool / Great idea/ etc. Eh? Alright, backwards boy. Back your butt down to detention. Over here, Simpson! The detention room is dangerously overcrowded, so you'll be serving your time in the cafeteria. Oxygen running out... Yes, you should have thought of that before you made that paper airplane. This overcrowding in detention is becoming critical. It's a powder keg waiting to go off in an explosion of unacceptable behavior. Don't bitch to me, boss man. Thanks to the latest budget cuts, I'm down to using grade F meat. Wouldn't it be wonderful if there were some sort of common solution to both our problems? That would be great! Hey, Bart, watch this. Drats. Oh no! My favorite outfit! Jimbo, this is by far the worst... Hmmm. Hmmm. Uh, Jimbo, why don't you ""assist"" Lunchlady Doris in the kitchen. Bite me, Skinner. Well might we. It's hard for me to clean this giant pot when you keep spilling meat tenderizer all over me. Oh great, now I gotta work in the dark. Mmmm. Mm-mmm. This sandwich tastes so young and impudent. Seymour, what's with the good grub? Hmmm. Well, perhaps I ought to let you folks in on a secret. Do you remember me telling Jimbo Jones that I'd make something of him one day? Are you saying you killed Jimbo, processed his carcass, and served him for lunch? Ha! Hmm, I wonder where Jimbo is today. He should've beaten us up for our lunch money an hour ago. Frau Lunchlady, please to have another Sloppy Jimbo. Das is good, nein? Now, that's your third helping, young man. It's making you fat and soft... and tender. Hmmm... Uh, you just cut in line, didn't you? Report to detention, Uter. For how long? Oh about seven minutes a pound should do it. Okay, I got your German grub right here. Bart, does it strike you as odd that Uter disappeared and suddenly they're serving us this mysterious food called Uterbräten? Oh relax, kids. I've got a gut feeling Uter's around here somewhere. After all, isn't there a little Uter in all of us? In fact, you might even say we just ate Uter and he's in our stomachs right now. Wait. Scratch that. Mom! Mom! You've gotta help! They're cooking kids in the school cafeteria! Listen, kids. You're eight and ten years old now. I can't be fighting all your battles for you. But Mom! No buts. You march right back to that school, look them straight in the eye and say ""don't eat me."" Okay. Since so many students have been put on ""permanent detention"" , we've merged everyone into a single class. I trust there are no objections? Detention. Uhm, uh..psst-- hey you guys, I was just thinkin' that any one of us could be next, so what d'ya say we make a break for it? Easy there, young man. You'll only make yourself tired and stringy. Now to check on the free-range children. Hold on kids! I'm comin' to rescue the lot of ye! I'll ju- Oww! Ach, I'm bad at this. I'm going to enjoy devouring you, Bart Simpson. Yes... I believe I'll start, as you've so often suggested, by eating your shorts. Don't worry, guys. Something always comes along to save us. Nevertheless, I remain confident that something will come along and save the two Simpson children. Relax, honey. You were just having a crazy nightmare. You're back with your family now, where there's nothing to be afraid of -- except that fog that turns people inside out. Huh? Uh oh, it's seeping in! Stupid cheap weather stripping. ONE -- CHORUS LINE OF PEOPLE / DANCIN' TILL THEY MAKE US STOP / TWO -- MANY DANCING PEOPLE/ COVERED WITH BLOODY GLOP.../ JUST ONE SNIFF OF THAT FOG AND YOU'RE INSIDE OUT / IT'S WORSE THAN THAT FLESH EATING VIRUS YOU'VE READ ABOUT....
