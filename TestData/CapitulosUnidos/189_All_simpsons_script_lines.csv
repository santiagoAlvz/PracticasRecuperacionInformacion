185,189,"We got the popcorn! Did you get ""Waiting To Exhale?"" Well, they put us on the ""Waiting to Exhale Waiting List."" But they said don't hold your breath. Did you get ""Emma?"" Did you get ""Emma?"" Did ya? Did ya? Did ya? Huh? Whoa. Whoa. Calm down, little lady--Take it easy--Take it easy. No. What did you get? Something very close, exactly along those lines--A Clint Eastwood - Lee Marvin shoot 'em up western! So prepare yourself, for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of Joshua Logan's, ""Paint Your Wagon!"" With blood, I bet! Hey, that's a pretty sorry lookin' wagon you got there, Mister. I reckon' it could use a coat of paint. Well, what are we waitin' for! GONNA PAINT OUR WAGON / GONNA PAINT IT GOOD / WE AIN'T BRAGGIN' / WE'RE GONNA COAT THAT WOOD. THEY'RE GONNA PAINT THAT WAGON / THEY'RE GONNA PAINT IT GOOD / THEY AIN'T BRAGGIN' / THEY'RE GONNA COAT THAT WOOD. They're singing! They're singing, Marge! Why aren't they killing each other? Yeah, their guns are right there! Wait, wait, wait. Here comes Lee Marvin. Thank God. He's always drunk and violent. Eh, what the hell is going on in my town? We're just paintin' this wagon. You gotta problem with that? As a matter of fact, I do. Ya missed a spot. Well, grab a brush and join in! GONNA PAINT YOUR WAGON / GONNA PAINT IT FINE / GONNA USE OIL BASED PAINT / 'CUZ THE WOOD IS PINE. PON-DER-RO-SA PINE! OOOOO! Mm! Who knew that Lee Marvin could do such marvelous splits? He's dreamy. Ooh, why did they have to screw up a perfectly serviceable wagon story with all that fruity singing? I thought it was toe-tappin' fun. Singing is the lowest form of communication. Homer, you sing all the time! No I don't, I hate to rhyme. You like musicals, don't you Dad? NO I DON'T, I THINK THEY'RE BAD / THEY'RE FAKE AND PHONEY AND TOTALLY WRONG. WAKE UP DAD / YOU'RE SINGING A SONG! I WOULDN'T / I COULDN'T / I HATE THAT STUFF! NOW HOMER, LISTEN, I'VE HAD ENOUGH! / IN OUR FAMILY VIDEOS, WE HAVE PLAINLY SEEN / YOU'RE A SINGING, DANCING, ENTERTAINMENT MACHINE! MOM WAS RIGHT, YOUR SINGING'S A SIN / YOU'RE AS LES MISERABLES / AS LEE MAR-VIN! SURE YOUR DAD'S SINGING / COULD MAKE YOUR HAIR CURL / BUT YOU TOO BART / HAVE SUNG AND DANCED LIKE A GIRL. Eep. THAT WAS PRETTY BAD, BART / BUT IT COULD'VE BEEN WORSE / YOU COULD HAVE BEEN CARRYING A SEQUINED PURSE! I HATE TO DANCE AND PRANCE AND SING / THAT'S REALLY MORE OF A MILLHOUSE THING! I THINK YOU MOVE LIKE A YOUNG BARYSHNIKOV! NOBODY MOVE OR I'LL BLOW YOUR HEADS OFF! OOOOOO. OOOOOO... IT'S A DESPERATE CRIMINAL / ON THE RUN FROM THE LAW / PLEASE SPARE MY CHILDREN! AND THEIR DAMP-TROUSERED PA. A SINGING FAMILY! IT'S WORSE THAN I FEARED / FOR HOSTAGE PURPOSES / YOU'RE JUST TOO WEIRD. / BYE! SEE? ALL THIS SINGING SCARED HIM AWAY / IF WE JUST TALKED LIKE NORMAL, HE'D PROBABLY STAY. MANY PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN / SING LIKE WE DO / THERE'S MISTER BURNS, THERE'S KRUSTY, AND EVEN APU. BECAUSE HE WAS SINGING, WE OVERHEARD HIS PLAN / AND COULD SAVE THOSE DOGS FROM THAT MEAN OLD MAN. IT STILL WASN'T WORTH BURNS' SONG AND DANCE. I'M BACK, SO RESUME WETTING YOUR PANTS. Okay. BECAUSE OF YOU ALL, I GOT A TUNE IN MY HEAD / AND THE ONLY WAY TO STOP IT, IS TO MAKE YOU ALL DEAD. I knew I should've shut that window. SAY YOUR PRAYERS AND THEN IT'S KA-BLAMMO! UH-OH, I'LL BE BACK WHEN I GET SOME AMMO. / BYE! EVEN THE CRIMINALS ARE BEGINNING TO CROON. HOMIE, THIS WHOLE TOWN RUNS ON A TUNE! / OUR CHURCHES, OUR CLUBS OUR GOVERNMENT TOO. SPRINGFIELD SWINGS LIKE A PENDULUM DO! WE CAN'T EVEN GET ANY LOCAL LAWS PASSED / WITHOUT EVERYONE SINGING LIKE A BIG BROADWAY CAST. ALL RIGHT MARGE, YOU'VE CONVINCED ME, THERE ARE MORE TERRIBLE THINGS / THAN MUSICAL COMEDIES WHERE EVERYONE SINGS. THERE IS SOMETHING WORSE... AND IT REALLY DOES BLOW... WHEN A LONG RUNNING SERIES, DOES A CHEESY CLIP SHOW! I'M BACK TO COMMIT FELONIOUS ASSAULT / BECAUSE YOUR INFERNAL SINGING JUST WOULD NOT HALT. ACTUALLY, WE'RE DONE. Done, done. And not a moment too soon. Oh, okay then. Well, then I got no beef with you. Haw! Okay, who wants dinner? Me! Me! / I do! I do! I do! Well, let's get eatin'. All right! All right! Sorry! Yo, I told you to stop the music, dudes! I'm serious! Oh, oh, oh, you're so not listening. Okay I hear that. I hear that dude! You too crazy music dude.
