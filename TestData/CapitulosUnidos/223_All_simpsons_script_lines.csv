219,223,"Ah, but Paris would make a tr√®s bon site for the next Olympic Games. And, ah, why is that? We don't have to explain ourselves to the likes of you! I await your reply. I recommend Moscow, where the American dollar buys seven rubles. Twelve rubles. Sixty rubles. One thousand Rubles? I must go! I suggest Motown. Detroit? No, no. Mongolia Town. Home of the Motown Sound: You are all crazy! The answer is Buenos Aires. Hokkaido! / Cleveland! / Uganda! / Bangkok! People, people, please! You're forgetting what the Olympics are about: giving out medals of beautiful gold, so-so silver, and shameful bronze. I have here a letter from a little girl named Lisa Simpson. She says her town might not be important enough to host the Olympics, but she asks if the torch could just pass by so she can experience the glow that we feel every day. Well, I say we don't bring her the torch. I say we bring her the Olympic Games! Who is with me? Well, I don't care, it's my decision. Springfield was shocked today to learn it will host the next Olympics. Economists predict our city will experience the same boom that Sarajevo enjoyed after the 1984 games. And it's all because of your letter, Lisa. Well, actually, I just wrote it for a school assignment. Everyone else wrote to the Back Street Boys. To honor the arrival of our foreign friends and enemies, Channel Six is sponsoring a contest to find a Springfield Olympic Mascot. The winner will join such other memorable mascots as the Atlanta ""Whazzit""... and the Montreal ""Vampire."" A mascot contest?! I'm sure to win that. Unless one of you jinxes me. No one's gonna jinx you, Homer. In fact, we're rooting for you. Yeah, go for the gold, Dad! Shut up, shut up, shut up! Well, you said I couldn't do it, but here it is! Meet Abby the Olympic Tabby. How'd you get the eyes to move? You papier mache'd my cat?! Just for the prototype, honey. Knowing you always hate my first idea, I prepared a backup. How about a big Olympic hello for Springy, the Springfield Spring! Those aren't the dog's eyes, are they? Hey, that's cute. Good work, Dad. It's fun for the whole family. And the ends are razor sharp to protect our nation and its interests. Ow!! God bless America! Hit the road, Lefty. You too, Rizzo. Aw, Cinnamon. Don't make this harder than it already is. Bravo, Springfield! I've never seen such a clean sewer. And we are positively inspired by your solar power plant. Yes, love that sun, man! And we will do anything, including but not limited to anything, to make your stay here tolerable. Yes, you'll be completely above the law. Uh, women, guns, cash, uh, whatever you need -- it's yours. And that's not all. We've just chosen our official Olympic mascot. Oh! / Springs! They picked Springy! In your face, Patty and Selma! Well, we still love you, Ciggy. Yeah. Mm, that glue really gives it a pop. And now, because the children are our future, here are the children of Springfield Elementary with a song they call ""The Children are our Future."" Children? ""Children, children, future, future..."" Are you ready for the... ""Children! Whoa, whoa, whoa!"" The future is a... ""Coming! Hey, hey, hey! Children, children, future, future..."" I've never wanted a beer worse in my life. I love you, honey. Are you talking to me or the beer? To you, my bubbly, long-necked, beechwood-aged lover. Children! Children! Children are the future! Kids! Yayyy! Bravo! / Magnifique! / Sehr gut! Sehr gut! Sehr gut! Muy bueno. It gives me great pride to officially declare the next Olympics will be held right here in... Wait! Wait! We have one more act! The patriotic comedy stylings of Bart Simpson! Thank you! Thank you! So, uh, you're from Russia, huh? Da! You drunk yet? Da. Poland, eh? Ha. Too easy. How you doin', Germany? Here's my impression of an East German woman, ""Kiss me or I'll crush you."" He says what we're all thinking. I'm not thinking that! Hey, Swiss Miss. There's no missin' you, babe. Heh, heh. Lay off the cocoa. Now I'd like to say one last thing to our Olympic representatives: if there was a medal for horrible audiences, you'd get the gold. Peace out. Skin-ner!! How could you put this boy on with that horrible material? Well, it really did seem funny in rehearsal. And he didn't even get to his Ubangi routine. Ha, ha, ha. Laugh it up, ya punks. 'Cause you and Jan Murray here just cost our town the Olympics! Hey, Chalmers, where are you from? I-- Oh. Well, I was born in Queens, went to Ball State, then made the move to Intercourse, Pennsylvania. Eh, why do you ask? Uh, don't worry, sir, I'll teach these children some respect for their town. I'm assigning each of you twenty hours of community service. / Oh, community service?! / Nooo! / Intercourse? What if we refuse? You won't pass to the next grade. I fail to see the threat. Skin-ner! Good idea. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to my vacation at Lake Titticaca. Let's see you make a joke out of that, Mr. Smart Guy! All right, Martin. For your community service, you'll be setting up a midnight basketball program for inner-city street gangs. All right, gang. Shirts and skins. Let's hustle! Milhouse, do you like the beach? Who doesn't? Good, I want you to pick up all this medical waste that's washed up on the shore here. Ow! I pricked myself. Well, just keep working. You'll prick yourself with the antidote sooner or later. What are you gonna do to me? Bart, not all community service is gang warfare and dangerous infection. And to illustrate that point, here's where you'll be working. The Fireworks, Candy and Puppy Dog Store?! No, no, no. Next to it. Settle a bet. Boil or mole? Ewwww. Okay. Just breathe through your mouth and don't ask how they're feeling. Oh, man... Aren't you a cutie-petutie. / Let's pull his skin. / I'm gonna touch his head. Yahhh! Oh, be a dear and snap my support hose to my girdle. Two o'clock. Recreation time. Phew, saved by the bell. Whoa! Where do you think you're goin'? Oh no, Lis! They got you, too? ""Got me?"" What are you talking about? I've been volunteering here for a year. Hello, let's hear some numbers. I got a nice diagonal goin'. B-3. You sunk my battleship! G-52. You sunk my battleship! Oh, I got a bingo! What do I win? A banana! A whole one? Yep! That's the prize?! A banana? Their natural mushiness prevents choking and promotes regularity. They're not babies, Lisa. Give 'em something fun, like cigars or booze. We tried giving them eggnog at Christmas, but it led to widespread de-shawling. And that's what they get for wearing such tight little shawls. Okay. Four o'clock. Nap time. You tell them when to sleep? Shhh. Don't wake them. While they sleep, we suck up excess dirt and crumbs. Here you go. Make sure you get into every crevice. Cool. Grampa, Homer. Grampa, Homer. Don't play with the faces. So, Bart, how was your first day of forced volunteerism? That place sucks! The nurses don't let Grampa do anything. They practically chew his food for him. Lucky stiff. I'm working my ass off here. Good steak, honey. The elderly aren't like you or me, Bart. They thrive on consistency, predictability, and a life with no surprises. Sounds good to me! I'llgetit. Delivery for Homer Simpson. Woo hoo! My springs! They finally came! But we lost the Olympics to Shelbyville. Yeah, but I should have no problem selling a thousand springs. To who? Idiots! Ooh, these are fun! Oh, Rhett. Rhett! Oh, Rhett. Where will I go? What will I do? Frankly, my dear... I love you. Let's remarry. Oh, what a lovely ending. Yes, sweeet. They cut out the best word! Didn't that movie used to have a war in it? C'mon. You've been warned. Picture yourself on a beautiful sailboat. Ahhh, can't you just feel the sea breeze in your hair?... or scalps? Say, I hear a foghorn. BOR-ING... C'mon, Bart, we don't want to over-stimulate these people. They just had pudding. Hello, little girl, is your mommy home? You'll need to ask her for five dollars to buy Mr. Bouncy Best-Friend. I know you. Your little smart-mouthed boy cost this town the Olympics! Who is it, Mother? Bart Simpson's father. Oh! I'll be right down. Boy, Lenny, you sure look hungry. Have some nuts. Hey, thanks. Ow! My eye! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Now if you want to be the life of the party like Lenny here, just place your order for this hilarious novelty item. Homer, get outta here. Boy, Moe, you sure look angry. Here, have some nuts. Hey, thanks. Ow! God, my eye! Ow! Get it out! Geez! Ow! Don't pull! Don't pull! I said don't pull! Don't! Now we're pulling into port. And who's waiting for us at the dock? Why, it's all your childhood dogs! I see Petey and Blackie and Schnoodle and... Oh no! Pirates! Pirates?! Ahoy mateys, it's me, Long Bart Silver and I'm gonna rip you a new I.V. hole. Bart, what are you doing? I'm just trying to liven things up around here. These people need to ride motorcycles and play rockin' electric guitars like the old people on TV. Excuse me, but when those pirates boarded, I swallowed my wedding ring for safekeeping. Get me some ipecac. I'd like to expunge it. Okay, she's gone. Let's break out of here and have some fun! If I get up, somebody'll take my chair. Got that right. It's the only one left with padding. Padding... What about you, Chief? Don't you want to be free like the eagle? I don't live here. I'm just dropping off Indian casino pamphlets. Vote yes on Prop 217. You know, the door was open! Chief Break-everything! Come on, people. You don't want to stay in a place where they vacuum you while you sleep. They do what now? Now's our chance. Let's go! Oh no, Bart has stolen the elderly! Forgot my hat. Ow! Today's grass is far sharper than the grass in my day. Hey, everybody! How'd you like to go on a real boat trip? / I'm there! Arrr, not a looker among 'em. Full speed ahead! Damn the torpedoes! What did he say? Put on our tuxedoes? I want some taquitos. Welcome to the Kitchen of Tomorrow today! Marge, how much would you pay for a self-flipping hamburger pan? Nothing. Don't answer yet. Watch how easy it is to flip hamburgers with the help of God's greatest creation, the spring. Now, watch this... Ow! Ohhh... Are you okay? Some second degree burns, but some first class burgers. I want you to get rid of these springs. But you haven't seen the Baby of Tomorrow! Ta-daa! Now if I drop her, no more tears. Give me my baby! ""D"" it up, Marge. I'm goin' to the hole. I want these springs out of our house today. You flush one down / It swirls around / Nine hundred and ninety-nine springs to flush down... You're not flushing those springs down our toilet, are you? Of course not! ""Nine hundred and ninety-six springs to flush down / Nine hundred and ninety-six spriiings..."" Oh, Abe, you dance divinely. I haven't felt this relaxed and carefree since I was watch commander at Pearl Harbor. Aw, geez, this place used to be crawling with Russian subs. Now there's just four. Sea hag! Bart Simpson! Bart, are you crazy? You've got to get the old folks home to the Old Folks Home. No way! They're finally having some fun! How low can I go? That's it. Gee, Bart, maybe you were right. They don't even seem to care that it's medication time. Medication time? Hot dog! Gimme, gimme, gimme! I want some pills! / Blue ones! / I want pills! But I've set you free. No more nap time, no more bingo. You can do whatever you want! Let's play bingo! Yeah, let's play bingo! You sunk my battleship. Now Smithers, you say you painted all your Navy buddies this way? Until I was discharged, sir. I don't get it, Grampa. If you guys like all that boring stuff, why did you follow me out here? Gotta do something 'til bingo. Oh no! How could you miss that huge boat coming right at us? Ohhh, two glass eyes. Oh, it's not fair. I'm not supposed to die now. I'm supposed to die in a foolish motorcycle stunt at the age of fifteen. Ha, ha! You're not dead yet, you pudgy little pisher. Jack LaLanne! Don't worry. I'll save you the Jack LaLanne way. Uh-oh. This is all Bart's fault! Let's get him. / I blame him. / I want some taquitos. Leave him alone! Sure, Bart's responsible for our deaths, but he gave us the most fun we had in twenty years. So before we go to our watery graves, I think we should... What the heck's going on? A hundred and thirty-five springs to flush down. A hundred and thirty-five springs... What a shame. Not a looker in the bunch. So, you workin' tomorrow at the home, Bart? Well, I finished my community service. Ohhh, right. But I could swing by after school. I'll bring the limbo stick. Hot diggity! Hey, stop shaking the harness.
