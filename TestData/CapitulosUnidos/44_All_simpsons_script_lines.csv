43,44,"Products you could only imagine before. The Foam Doam...the Jet Walker...Mr. Sugar Cube... That baby changed our lives. I'm actor Troy McClure. You might remember me from such TV series as ""Buck Henderson, Union Buster"" and ""Troy and Company's Summertime Smile Factory,"" but I'm here to tell you about... Spiffy, a Twenty-First Century stain remover. Let's meet the inventor -- Dr. Nick Riviera. Thank you, Troy. Hi, everybody. Hi, Dr. Nick. Troy, I've brought with me the gravestone of author and troubled soul Edgar Allan Poe. One of our best writers. Yes, but unfortunately, a century of neglect has turned this tombstone into a depressing eyesore. So, what, I guess we're gonna throw it away. Not so fast Troy! With one application of Spiffy, you'll think the body's still warm. Quoth the Raven, ""What a shine!"" Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone. Hey, Dad, you got a power drill? In the garage. Check. I'm offering three bottles -- enough to clean one thousand tombstones -- for only thirty-nine ninety-five. I'm afraid you're gonna have to do better, Doctor. Yeah, give us a break, Doctor. But Troy, how can I make it lower than thirty-nine ninety-five. Find a way. Hey, Homer, I can't find the safety goggles for the power saw. If stuff starts flying, just turn your head. Oh, check. Okay. I'll throw in a fourth bottle, the applicator glove, and a state of Kansas Jell-O mold -- twenty-nine ninety-five. Okay, okay, calm down. Homer, can you get the door? It's my sisters. Homer, be nice. Okay, I will. I will. Patty, Selma, what a pleasant surprise. What do you know, he's wearing pants. I owe you a lunch. Ugly... ugly... butch... What's the matter, can't you find a hair style you like? No... Hold the phone. That's the one for me. Ed Asner? No, next to him. Mary... Tyler... Moore. ... Expiration date: June, 1999... Uh, 2012, yeah. Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again? Shh! They'll hear you. Who's using the power tools? I don't know. Some guy I guess. Well, we're going to the beauty parlor. Maybe you should do something with the kids while I'm gone. Oh sure, great idea. I'd love to -- Did you hear that? Yes. How much? Everything. What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you? Uh... take us to the video store. Anything for my little girl. Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid. Ooooooh, McBain. Hey McBain, you keep eating them hot links and you'll never make it to a pension. C'mon, live a little, Scoey. No, thanks. Got me a future, partner. I'm two days away from retirement, my daughter's graduating from college -- Little Suzy's growing up. And as soon as we nail Mendoza my old lady and I are gonna sail around the world like we always wanted. We just christened the boat. Yes, sir, everything's gonna be just perf... Aw, damn, damn, damn. McBain... Yes? I'm not gonna make it. Stop talkin' crazy. No, no, no. Just do one thing for me... Get... Mendoza. Mendozaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!! You want to rent it, sir? Why? I just saw the best part. Oooh, ""Death by Knockout,"" ""Blood on the Ice"" Oh, oh... ""Football's Greatest Injuries"". Lisa, we're going. But, Dad, I can't find ""Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town"". Just grab something. All these movies are great. Look at this. ""Test your F.Q. -- Fatherhood Quotient"". Maybe you should try it on Homer. He'll fail it. Uh-huh. In a second. I don't know. Now Henry Winkler, there's a father. Listen to what he told a close friend. ""I don't always keep my cool like `The Fonz', but my love for my kids has given me plenty of 'Happy Days'."" ... They called him ""The Galloping Gazelle."" His habitat: the frozen tundra of Soldier Field. For six seasons and two pro bowls he grazed on the tasty green turf of the end zone. Until one fateful Sunday in November when the gazelle was stopped in his tracks by a big cat named Wayne Kychezski. Homie, we're back. Don't mind that clod, Patty. You could turn the world on with your smile. Homer, could you turn off the TV? There's a little test I want you to take. Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman. This is from the National Fatherhood Institute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father. Oh Marge. Question one: ""Name one of your child's friends..."" Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets. They want a name, Homer, not a vague description. Okay. Hank. Hank?! Hank who? Hank... Jones. Homer, you made that up. Question two: ""Who is your son's hero?"" Steve McQueen. That's your hero. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."" Next. What are your son's hobbies? Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord. He hasn't done that since he was two. Then he has no hobbies. Oh really? Well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see. Bart!... BART!!! What? You don't have any hobbies, do you boy? No, not really. Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing? Building a Soap Box Derby racer. Oh, that's a hobby! Hey, so it is. Oh, my God. I don't know jack about my boy... I'm a bad father! You're also fat. I'm also fat! National Fatherhood Institute. Please hold... AND THE CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON / LITTLE BOY BLUE AND THE MAN IN THE MOON / WHEN YOU COMIN' HOME DAD / I DON'T KNOW WHEN... National Fatherhood Institute. Dave speaking. I'm Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero. Good Lord, a zero! Lona, cancel my one o'clock. Mr. Simpson, we'll send a wood paneled station wagon over for you immediately. Hey Bart, where'd you get the lumber? Well, as three-time soapbox derby champ Ronnie Beck says, ""Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine."" A conventional design. Oh, yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin? In between some other projects. Well, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I've booked some time at the wind tunnel. Goodbye, son. Hey Bart, I think they're finally hauling your dad away. Maybe it's for the best. For starters, Mr. Simpson, won't you take this complimentary copy of ""Fatherhood"" by Bill Cosby. Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold. Mr. Simpson, if you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son. Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son? Why don't you ask him yourself? Homer, meet Dave Jr. Huh? How's your research coming, son? I think we're near a breakthrough. Good work. Thanks, Dad. Oh, how I envy you! Homer, that easy back and forth that you just witnessed didn't happen over night. It took years of effort. I've never been afraid of a little hard work. Aw, that's the spirit, Mr. Simpson. Now step one is to find an activity the two of you can share. Does the boy have any interests? What boy? Your son. Find something he likes to do and share in it. Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer. Aw, that would be perfect. Dear God! Not again. Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer. Thanks, but I'm almost done. Why don't you get back on the couch and watch TV? Okay. No, I'm gonna do it. Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad's help. But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree. What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you. Come on Dad, it'd be weird. Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second. Hmm... ""Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" Huh? Don't you get it? You gotta use a reverse psychology. Oh, that sounds too complicated. Okay. Don't use reverse psychology. All right, I will! Son, I don't think you should let me help you. Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes. Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons! You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit. I like our chances, son. Ugh. Your father is not supposed to help build your racer, but you should at least consult him about it. You're in heat four. Whoa, where's your helmet, son? Helmets are for wusses, Sir. I don't think I can let you go without a safety helmet. This is my son and if he doesn't want to wear one you can't make him! Okay, fine. I want to get out of here sometime today. Attention, everyone. I say to those who question the value of the space program... Behold! Aye carumba! Hey, you're not supposed to smoke in the pit area. Fine. Hey, Simpson, where's your loser-mobile? Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute! It's over there, Nelson. Whoa, talk about your pieces of crap. You know, Bart, I don't care who wins, as long as one of us beats that guy. Careful, boys. It took me months to steal that bumper. Help! Help! What was that? You didn't hear nothin'. Are you nervous son? Don't worry, Dad, as three time Soap Box derby champion Ronnie Beck says, ""Gravity is my co-pilot."" Hey boss, just in case you need it. Thanks guys. Now get out of here. Oh my. I didn't realize this hill was so high. Could I have another minute -- Aaah! Aieee! Deploy, damn you, deploy! It hurts! It hurts! Owee-owee-owee-ow! Young man, I'm afraid this stress fracture will require you to be in a cast for six weeks. But that means I can't possibly race! Son, you're lucky to be alive. Save your palliative cliches for the next poor sap, Doctor. Is it okay to visit? Of course. Hey man, cool crash. Way to cheat death. Thanks, Bart. You had the best stick out there, man. I wish I could build 'em like you. That racer transformed me into the twisted creature you see before you. I'll never race again. If you don't race, then Nelson'll win! Even if I wanted to, I'm in no shape to do it. Unless... Bart, will you drive my car? Oh, I don't know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone else's it'd kill him. On the other hand... I'll do it. Okay Bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks... Dad... I don't know how to say this, but I don't want to drive your car. It's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart... Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we're Team Simpson. Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win. When did I ever teach you that? Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martin's car I can win. I'm sorry, but... Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad. I'll just sit here in ""Li'l Lightnin'"" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son. Ow. Dad, can you take me to Dr. Hibbert's office? Why? What's wrong? Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there. Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa? Martin, your bone is healing nicely. Tell me something I don't know. Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker! Mr. Simpson, you have every right to be angry. But rest assured, your son loves you... You certainly gave that boy the heebie-jeebies. Dad, aren't you coming? No! Now, don't pout. I'm not pouting, you are. Dad, you gotta come. I just got your hat out of the fridge. Sorry. Don't you at least have something to say to Bart? No. Can't think of a thing. Homer! I've always said you were a good father. I've always defended you when people put you down. That's for sure. She ain't lyin'. But I guess I was wrong. You are a bad father. Leave me alone. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to an event that harkens back to the carefree days of the Great Depression -- The Soapbox Derby. In just minutes, these junior Al Unser Juniors will lock horns. ""Name your son's hobbies."" Building a soapbox racer... ""Name your child's friends."" Martin... Martin! I'll curse that name 'til the day I die... Huh? ""Who is your son's heroe?""... Three-time Soapbox Derby Champion Ronnie Beck! Wow, I'm one question away from being a perfect father. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."" Hey ho Simpson. Shut up Flanders. Flanders! Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating? Well sir, there are two schools of thought... Great, thanks. I talked to Flanders about parenting. I'm a perfect father. Hold on, son, I'm-a coming! My friend and I have a bet -- Are you Mary Tyler Moore? Wow, it really is you. Bart, if she breaks up on you, steer away from the grandstands, or else you might kill hundreds of innocent spectators. Bart what did I just tell you? Kill spectators. What is the matter with you? It's my dad. Lying there on the couch drinking a beer, staring at the TV. I've never seen him like that. Forget about your father. You're driving for me now! Do it for your old man, boy! Simpson, prepare to die. Let's rock. Ladies and gentlemen, to drop the checkered flag, our beloved Mayor, Diamond Joe Quimby. To everyone participating today, I salute your vigor. Check out the rack on the blonde in the fourth row. ... like the arrogant Roman and Judah Ben Hur, these modern charioteers battle ferociously. No quarter given, none asked. The world has not seen the likes of this since the French carried Lucky Lindy off on their shoulders from Le Bourget Field. And now, to present the trophy, three time Soapbox Derby Champion, Ronnie Beck. Congratulations Bart. Seeing you out there brought back a lot of memories. Thanks, Mr. Beck. I was alone out there, but someone was riding with me in spirit... This is for you, Dad. No, son, you earned it. I might remind you both, I did design that racer. The driver is essentially ballast. The better man won, Simpson. You can really drive. Thanks, Nelson, put her there. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Loser! Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah! Bart, you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner. Mom, I never won before. I may never win again. Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah! That's my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!","P.A.
