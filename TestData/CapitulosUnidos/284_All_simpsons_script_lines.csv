280,284,"Wow, everything is so high-tech. Dialing Murray Hill 5-6309. So I says to Myrna, I says, ""that guy's a bum!"" Ooh, that's the Movie Phone guy. The movie we've selected plays at 8 PM, at Springfield Cinema 6. Thank you for dating Mr. Movie Phone. Our evening will be rated ""R"" for brief nudity. Ma'am, would you be interested in changing your long distance service? Huh, what? She hung up on me. What did I do? Hello. I'm your customer service rep, Lindsay Naegle. We've met you many times, Ms. Naegle. Why do you keep changing jobs? I'm a sexual predator. Oh. Now, how may I best dispense with you today? We've been charged for calls to Brazil that we didn't make. We are not paying this bill. Fine, I'll cut off your service. Fine, I'll cut off your ponytail. Homer! Marge, it's called negotiating. Ooo, fascinating. I need to call Janey, but I can't get a dial tone. We're not paying our bill, so the phone company shut off our service. Why must you fight with every utility? I told you, I have too much time on my hands. Homer, we were cleaning out a cooling duct at the plant and found a box of old taco shells! Why didn't you call me? Oh we tried. But a recording said you were a bunch of deadbeats. That's it. They have awoken a sleeping giant. Homer, what are you going to do? Crazy scheme, crazy scheme, crazy scheme... Get me tools and beer. Yes! Free service, here we come. All right, let's try the red one. Okay, I'll try the green. Let's try the red one again. Not again! Ow! Let's try 'em together. Maybe the red one... How did I get here? We found you smoldering in the bushes. That's it. We're just going to have to pay for that call to Brazil. What call to Brazil? The one I didn't make and Marge didn't make and Bart didn't make and hence no one in the house made. Uh-oh. You made that call? But you're the good one. Yeah, the one we both like. Why did you do it? Please don't be mad. I've been sponsoring an orphan boy in Brazil. Oh, aren't you sweet? Sharing your allowance with a poor Brazilian boy. Don't you know the boys from Brazil are little Hitlers? I saw it in a movie. Whose name I can't remember. Ronaldo used to send me a letter every month, but then they stopped. That's why I called the orphanage, but they said he'd disappeared. How come you talked for four hundred dollars? Well, then they started pressuring me for more donations. And you can't hang up on a nun. That's right. They have powers. When I sent my first donation, the charity mailed me this video. Hi, Lisa. Thank you for your donation. Because of your generosity, I bought sturdy shoes that will last for a thousand sambas. Awww. He's so adorable. Can we have another baby? No way. I still haven't lost the weight I put on from the last one. And with the money left over, the orphanage was able to buy a door. Now the monkeys cannot bite me. Uh-oh. I am like sugar to them. Oh, that poor little boy. We've got to find him. How many people live in Brazil? A hundred and fifty-six million. Well, we've got to find him! What? I'm really concerned. Fine, I want to meet monkeys. I don't know, it's awfully expensive to fly to Brazil. Not if we buy our tickets on the internet. It's really cheap if we change planes in Phoenix, Honolulu, Sun City, and East St. Louis, spend a night in a haunted house and leave right now. Then it's settled. The Simpsons are going to Brazil. Then I'll have been on every continent. Except Antarctica. The Simpsons are going to Antarctica. Next year. This year, Brazil. Okay, here's some travel tips: only drink bottled water... don't get into an unlicensed taxi... and remember, they have winter during our summer. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So in August... it's cold? That's right. And in February... it's hot? Mm-hmm. So it's opposite land. Crooks chase cops, cats have puppies... No Dad, it's just the weather. So hot snow falls up? Yes. Woo hoo! Get ready, Brazil. I now speak fluent Spanish. Well done Bart, but in Brazil they speak Portuguese. Ay caramba, que mujer tonta! Veinte horas estudiar por nada! Forget every word, boy. It's useless. But Homer... I said forget it! All gone. This is your Captain speaking. The local temperature in Rio de Janeiro is hot, hot, hot, with a hundred per cent chance of passion. Bernardo, you make that joke every time. It was that joke that made you fall in love with me. Hey Maggie, how ya doin' back there? Oh, so helpless. Look, it's the giant statue of Christ on Corcovado. Wow. It's like He's on the dashboard of the entire country. It says here we can get anywhere we want by taking a conga line. Way ahead of you, Marge. TAKE ME TO THE HOTEL / MY HANDS ARE ON A GUY'S ASS / BOY THIS DUDE MUST WORK OUT... Hey! Hey! Boy, they sure love soccer here. Look Marge, I'm Brazilian. How to Loot Brazil? I got it, I got, I got it. Bart, what are you watching? Kids' show. Ribbeet-o. Ribbeet-o. Too-key! Too-key! Too-key! Too-key! Too-key! Bert and Ernie left it to your imagination. Look, the room came with a fruit hat. Hey, and a mini-bar hat. I'M CHIQUITA BANANA / AND I'M HERE TO SAY... ...I WILL EAT THIS TOBLERONE / AND I WILL NOT PAY! Guys! While you're singing and dancing, somewhere out there Ronaldo is waiting to be found. There he is! It-- Oh wait, you said brown hair, right? What a charming neighborhood. Mom, these are slums. The government just painted them bright colors so the tourists wouldn't be offended. Works for me. Yeah, check out the rats. Ooh, they look like Skittles. Here we are! 123 Papaya Street -- this is Ronaldo's orphanage. Excuse me, we're looking for this little boy. Ah yes, Ronaldo. He went out months ago and we haven't heard from him since. Every day we light a candle for him. Have you tried looking for him? That's plan B. We're never gonna find him. Now Lisa, it's not as bleak as that. Can you fly me over town to look for him? We nuns cannot fly. Oh, too much junk in the trunk, eh? Yes. Have some meat on a sword, Lisa. It'll cheer you up. You know I'm a vegetarian. But you're on vacation, honey. I'm not wearing my wedding ring! Homer! Okay, on this map I marked all the places that Ronaldo liked to go. If we split up, we should be able to search them all. We'll do our best, honey. Now let's get goin'. Check please. Ah, si? Does that include tip? Ah, si! Hey look, there's Copacabana beach. The heart and soul or Rio. Excuse me, Americans... How did you know?! There is a dress code on this beach. But we can help you. I feel so European. Mine keeps disappearing. Oh, well. I hope they're goin' somewhere good. Okay boy, let's strut our stuff. I GO TO RIO"") I'M IN RIO / AND I'M WALKING ON THE BEACH / I'M IN MY SPEEDO... Excuse me, we think this boy might be here. Okay, this is a samba school, this is not a lost and found. This is where we invented the lambada and the macarena. We are now developing our most powerful dance: the Penetrada. It makes sex look like a church. I don't think my daughter should hear this. You can't protect her forever! You stupid lady. Gimme a drink with all your sweetest Brazilian fruits mixed together. Here you go. Sweet. Sweet! SWEET! Ahhh... There's gotta be a million kids here. We'll never find Ronaldo. Ronaldo?! You know him? No, no. I was just distracting you while my children robbed you. Aw, look at all the stuffed coatimundi. I bet Maggie would like one. I'll just get her this bracelet. Everything here is something. Hey, Bart. How many more places do we have to search? Just one, and it's across town. Taxi! My American friend, I'm afraid that this is a kidnapping. So that means I don't have to pay the fare. I suppose. Woo hoo! I'm afraid you don't appreciate the seriousness of the situation. Fine. Take me, but let the boy go. I'm afraid he has already gone.","Lifeguard, Mr. Movie Phone, Nun, Co-pilot, Marge Simpson, Telemarketer, Homer Simpson, Lindsay Naegle, Lisa Simpson, Woman, Frog, Lenny Leonard, Taxi Driver, Pilot, FLAMINGO, Teacher, Bart Simpson, Ronaldo, Waiter, Female Robot, Patty Bouvier",7.0,670.0,15,2002-03-31,2002,13,Blame It on Lisa,11.1,50694.0
