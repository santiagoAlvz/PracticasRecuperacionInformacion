96,97,"See because of me, now they have a warning. Hey, Dad... sell you these for fifty bucks. Woo hoo! Sold! Those aren't tickets to the game, Homer. What do you mean? It says right here: ""Free wig with every purchase of large wig. Downtown Wig Center."" Why you little... Hmmm... Free wig. I love you, Homey. Heh, heh, heh. I don't need her at all anymore. Heh-heh-heh, I did it. Second in line and all I had to do was miss eight days of work. With the money you would have made working, you could've bought tickets from a scalper. In theory, yes. Jerk. Give me uh, thirty-thousand tickets. That'll be nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars, please. Look, the thing about that is, I only got ten dollars on me. Can I pay you the rest later? Sure. That was Bobby McFerrin's new one, ""I'm Worried, Need Money!"" Okay, if you want two tickets to the big Pigskin Classic just get to a phone and be our thirteenth caller! Get tickets. Must get tickets. Find phone. Yes! Oh stupid sheep. Still waiting for that caller. Oh, we have a winner! What's your name, sir? Ned Flanders... Not Flanders. Anybody, but Flanders. Oh golly, if that doesn't put the shaz in shazam. Oh listen, what's the cash value of those tickets so I can report it on my income tax? I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE / WON'T YOU PACK YOUR BAGS TO LEAVE TONIGHT / I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE / I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE... Excellent guitar riff. Why am I such a loser? Why? Well, your father was a loser. And his father. And his father. It's genetic, man. What's so special about this game anyway? It's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between Springfield and Shelbyville. They built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall. They made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall. Heh, heh, heh. Yeah they swore they'd get us back by spiking our water supply. But they didn't have the guts. Oooh, the walls are melting again. Personally, I think I'm overdone. God, if you really are God, you'll get me tickets to that game. Hidilly ho, neighbor. Wanna go to the game with me? I got two tic... Why do you mock me, oh Lord? Homer, that's not God, that's just a waffle that Bart tossed up there. I know I shouldn't eat thee but... Mmmm... sacri-licious. Homer! Huh? Are you planning to hit Ned Flanders with that pipe and take his tickets? Y- No. Flanders, I decided I'd like to go to the game with you. Well, get out the Crayolas and color me tickled pink! Oh, what's with the lead pipe? Were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'? Well, yeah. Duck! I can't let the boys see me with you! What? Hi. Hey look, Homer's got one of those robot cars. One of those American robot cars. Men, there's a little crippled boy sitting in the hospital who wants you to win this game. I know because I crippled him myself to inspire you. Well I hope they win, or Mr. Burns said he's coming back. Wow, these are amazing seats, huh Homer? Yeah. Hey everybody, here comes fun! Heh heh. Ow. I'll take two dogs, two sodas and uh two ice cream bars. What the hell happened to my dogs? I want answers. Well, I guess I should pay my share... Relax, Homer, I keep tellin' ya, you're my guest. Ooh, you brought me a nacho hat. Thanks, Ned. NACHO, NACHO MAN / I WANT TO BE A NACHO MAN. If anyone can pull it off, it's Stan ""The Boy"" Taylor. Stan, Stan, he's our boy, if he can't do it, no one ...will. We won! We won! Flanders, we won! Heh-heh, yeah. Losers! Losers! Kiss my big Springfield behind, Shelbyville! I am invincible! Invincible! Ow! Hey, somebody sign an autograph. Please, somebody!? Sign an autograph. Hey, would you sign... You fat, stupid jerks! It was him! Ned? Is that...? Ned Flanders? Hidilly ho, Stanster. You know Stan Taylor? Know me? Ned Flanders saved me. I used to party all night and sleep with lingerie models, until Ned and his Bible group showed me that I could have more. Professional athletes. Always wantin' more. Ned, they gave me the game ball. I want you to have it. Stan, tell you what -- Homer Simpson here is just about the biggest Atom fan that's ever graced God's green earth. I bet he'd enjoy it, even more than me. Sure. Anything for Neddie. Here you go. Wow, thanks. Now I have four children. You will be called ""Stitch-face."" Wow, Flanders, this is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. Ooo, I guess it's time for me to duck again. No! I want everyone to know that this is Ned Flanders... my friend! What'd he say? I dunno. Somethin' about being gay. Homer, that's our wedding photo. Marge, quit livin' in the past. Heydilly ho, window buddy. Just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl. I'll be there. And this time you can be the nacho man. Dad and Ned Flanders friends? What's next... ""A's"" on Bart's report card? Hey. Uh, be careful there, Homer. That is sort of a new table. Watch this, Ned. They don't call me Springfield Fats just because I'm morbidly obese. Now you got a law suit on your hands. Just kidding. What's wrong, Jeremiah? It's not fair. My brother Joseph has a sin to confess. I wish I had one too. Oh don't you see? You do have a sin to confess - the sin of envy. That's all well and good for sheep, but what are we to do? Boring. Let's watch something else. Aw. Now, boys, Mr. Simpson is the guest. He gets to decide what to watch. Yeah. Hey what gives? I thought you had a satellite dish. Sure didilly do. Over two hundred and thirty channels locked out. Okay, boys, time for bed. Say good night. Good night, Daddy. Good night, Uncle Homer. Aw, Uncle Homer. Ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, I want you to get to know my family. Hey everyone! I'd like to introduce Ned Flanders, my best friend. Hey, I don't want no people in here with their evils of alcohol rap. Wait a second. You're the man at the hospital who reads to sick children. ... And truly she was my friend Flicka. If this gets out, the next words you say will be muffled by your own butt. Honey, I'm so glad you're home-- Can't talk... see Flanders... later sex. ...Bless the grocer for this wonderful meat, the middlemen who jacked up the price, and let's not forget the humane but determined boys over at the slaughter house. Hiya, Flanders! Oooh... dinner! May I join you? Homer, I-I'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night I do my charity work. Oh, yeah. A judge made me do that once, too. Stupid lack of public urinals. Hey, just so you don't have to suffer alone, I'm comin' with ya. Oh... well... that sounds super duper. Oh, you poor, unfortunate man. Let's get you out of those clothes immediately. And we'll do whatever we can about the smell. But... all right. C'mon! We've been here for fifteen minutes. Can't you see they're sucking the life out of us? Homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at Moe's tonight. Ah, for some reason, Moe's is always closed on Wednesdays. ...And then they realized they were no longer little girls, they were little women. Come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. Oh, I can do it faster that that. Wow! Look at that enthusiasm! This is front page material! Homey, I'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending too much time with Ned? Your family needs you too. Oh of course you'd say something like that, Marge. You've hated Ned for years. In fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe. That was you! Love, Marge. Don't hate. Love. The Flanders are a buncha geeks, man. The Flanderses are not geeks! Okay, Rod and Todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. But we've got to give this thing a chance. I want the two families to take a trip together this weekend. No way, Jos√© ! Yes way. Don't worry, Bart. It seems like every week something odd happens to the Simpsons. My advice is to ride it out, make an occasional smart-alec quip and by next week we'll be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure. Ay caramba! That's the spirit. Don't worry, I brought my Rappin' Ronnie Reagan tape. It always makes the trip go faster. WELL\WELL\WELL...W-W-W-WELL\WELL\WELL... Ha, ha. You know something, he did say 'well' a lot. WELL\WELL\WELL\ W-W-W-\WELL\ WELL\WELL\WELL\WELL\WELL More. No, no, keep comin'. More... more... right there! Let her go! Okay, let's go boating! How are my boys doin', Homer? They're fine. There. I hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch. We got the recipe from the Fruit Punch Advisory Board. Oh gosh, I'm sorry, our boys don't eat sugar. But, why would the Advisory Board give us bad advice? No sugar! Thank you, but we're not allowed. Aw it's okay, there's no sugar in pixie sticks. Trust me. Okay. Don't hog it all, smellyhead! Go to hell, zit face! I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the Simpsons and the Flanders. If this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the Flimpsons. So, here's to my best friend, Ned. Eh, well sir. My entire family is very touched and-- Food fight! Yeah! Whatcha doin'? We're headin' back. Todd's got Zesty Italian in his eye. Okay. But at least let me take the boat out for one last spin! Oh, I don't know... Too late. Oh Lord, please give me the strength to endure Homer Simpson's friendship. Humph, your car. Boy, what are the odds, huh? Cheers to Homer Simpson for all his recent charity work. Jeers to this rusty tailgate. There's Homer. There's Homer too. That's also Homer. That's Homer. What's the matter, Ned? I -- I think I hate Homer Simpson. Marge! I think I hate Ted Koppel. No wait, I find him informative and witty. 'Nite. Off the rim! Oh! Almost. Boy that was close. Hey, what's up for today, Neddie? Ah, uh, Homer, we're gonna visit the boys' grandmother. Family only. You know? Right, no reporters. No, I-I mean just the Flanders family. O-okay. Oh boy! Gramma! We're not going anywhere. But you said. Sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, we have to say things that aren't exactly... Lies made baby Jesus cry. Neddie, Neddie... Let's get in a quick nine down at the pitch and putt. Neddie? NEDDDDIEEE! He's gaining on us! I'm scared! C'mon Ned! Move this thing! I can't, it's a Geo! Hmmm. Guess he didn't see me. We did it, we got rid of... I told you, officer. I'm not ""hepped up"" on ""goof balls."" Yeah right. Ned Flanders, I never would have imagined. High as a kite, everybody! Goofballs-- Where's your messiah now, Flanders? I can't do it, Maude. I can't face their accusing eyes. Oh don't worry, Ned, this is a house of love and forgiveness. There he is, Ned Flanders. The fallen one. The evil one. I'll bet he's the one who wrote ""Homer"" all over the bathroom. I think we should leave. Hey Flanders, over here. I got us some kick-ass seats. Before I get started on today's sermon entitled , ""What Ned Did,"" I'd like to publicly congratulate Homer Simpson on his recent charity work. I live to give. That's beautiful. We appreciate the kisses. Now, let us bow our heads in a silent prayer of thanksgiving. Stop it! Breathe through your damn mouth! Oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! He's annoying. He's very, very annoying! Well Ned Flanders is just jealous! Aw, the guy's hepped up on ""goof balls!"" Let's sacrifice him to our god! C'mon, we did it all the time in the thirties. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that! He's a wonderful, kind, caring man. Maybe even more so than me. There have been times when I've lost patience with him, even lashed out at him. But this man has turned every cheek on his body. If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for heaven. We'd already be there. Um... Well I think we all owe Ned a heartfelt apology. We were wrong to doubt him. Hey, that guy's right! That was a very nice thing you did, Homey. Thank you. Thank you so much, Homer. You really are a you're a true friend. Right back atcha, buddy. Now how 'bout that game at the Pitch 'n Putt? Just try and stop me. I don't get it, Lis. You said everything would be back to normal, but Homer and Flanders are still friends. Yeah. Maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures. Guess what, everyone?! My great uncle Boris died and left us his old country house. There's only one catch they say - it's haunted. But I'm sure we can prove him wrong by spending the weekend there. Hi-diddly ho, neighbor. Get lost, Flanders. Okilly-dokilly. See, I told ya. There's nothin' to worry about.
