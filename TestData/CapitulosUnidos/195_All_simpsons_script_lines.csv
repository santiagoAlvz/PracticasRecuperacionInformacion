191,195,"Ugh, Salisbury soup again! My Joe isn't sloppy enough! And talk about weak coffee! I'll take that. What are they doing with our forty-five cents? I bought my lunch at the gas station. It's the kind John Glenn eats when he's not in space. Wow, just like the commercial! There's a brain-teaser on the back! Professor Provolone's Picto-Puzzle. That's a tough one. Got it. Is this it? Excellent, Milhouse! How 'bout this? Nice work, Bart. How about you, Lisa? I'll get it in a second. Don't worry. Ooh, of course! It's... Yeah! Champion of the world! Answer this, Professor! Hey, some of us are still trying to solve it! Just you... Maybe I can't concentrate because of all your cooties. It's called ""lice"" and it's nothing to be ashamed of! Okay, let's see, it's not Egyptian. It's not Prince's names. Wanna hint? I don't need a hint, Ralph! But you're suffering! So, Lisa, did you get that brain-teaser yet? For your information, none of your business! You look tired. Are ya tired, Lisa? If you're suggesting I stayed up all night trying to solve that childish puzzle, you're right. Ugh! Now I can't remember my combination! Look at my aggieculture project. It's a piece of a cow. The project! I forgot all about it! Very nice, Janey. Good use of pipe cleaners, Becky... Don't open it, Ralph. I'll just give you a C minus. Yay! Not finished, Lisa? I'm finished. I've just got to...oh... there! It's a pig! It's an eraser with push pins. And a spring for his curly tail! Huh-huh. Oink, oink, oink...Huh-huh! This is terrible, at best. I'm surprised at you, Lisa. Me, too. Oh, looks like somebody's ""hoggin' dazs"" ice cream! Oh, I should write these down. More comin'. Um, I'm looking for something in an after-dinner burrito. You'll have it in forty-five seconds, sir. Oh, forget it! To pass the time, please enjoy this novelty pen. Well, why would I want to look at a pen with a... Oh no, her clothes are coming off! Heh, heh. Hey, you know who would love this? Men. Five, four, three, two, one, lift-off! Look at this mess! Where is that elderly old man? Old man? Old ma... Hey, hey look, a freezer man! Wait a minute... There is a note! I have frozen myself so I may live to see the wonders of the future. Thaw me out when robot wives are cheap and effective. P.S. Please alter my pants as fashion dictates. Now you're swingin', honey! Darn it!! No, no, no, noo! The George Raft look is dead. I want an Audie Murphy! Mm, if you'd just apologize to Louie, you could get your hair cut the way you want. No apology. Not until he admits he's a jerk! Mom, I think something's wrong with me. I can't do anything right lately. Um, you're just having a bad day. I had one last week. I burned the roast, my cake fell, and I ran out of butter so I had to spray the English muffins with PAM. Maybe you're just a lousy cook. OW! I'll go get the Bactine. It can't just be a bad day. I feel like I'm getting dumber by the minute. Oh, ain't no big deal. All Simpsons start to lose their smarts around your age. What are you talkin' about? Well, I'll show ya. Follow me. Wow, Dad was a good speller? Oh, your dad used to be smart as a monkey, but then his mind started gettin' lazy, and now he's dumb as a chimp. Grampa! Hey, I am, too! And your brother's comin' along nicely. Look at Bart's homework. Back when he was your age, he was smart as a chimp. This is just two years ago! That's right, then the Simpson genes kicked in. This is crazy! Just because you and Dad and Bart went downhill doesn't mean it's gonna happen to me... does it? Sure! But it doesn't mean you can't live a long and pointless life! Dear Log: Can it be true? Do all Simpsons go through a process of dumbening? Wait, that's not how you spell ""dumbening."" Wait, ""dumbening"" isn't even a word! Oh... I've got to find out more... That makes 22 to 16. Time is running out. So you're worried about your genes, uh? Well, does it hurt when you go like this? No. Then will you turn this projector on for me? I think the film should answer all your questions. Have you ever wondered why fat parents have fat children? Or why Chinese parents have Chinese children? It's no coincidence. It's because of... D - N - A. Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such medical films as ""Alice Doesn't Live Anymore"" and ""Mommy, What's Wrong With That Man's Face?"" But Mr. McClure, what is DNA? What the...? Oh, hi, Billy! Let's find out together. DNA is God's recipe for making you. You take a dash of Dad, a pinch of Mom... Then we bake for nine months and... Mmmm, that's good, Billy! Mr. McClure, what does DNA stand for? That didn't answer anything. I need more information. Would you like to see it again? Isn't there any way I can change my DNA, like sitting on the microwave? Mmmm, not according to any movie I've ever seen. I'm afraid you're stuck with your genes, Lisa. Hi, frozen body! Hm, he's got a ""lub"", but I don't hear a ""dub"". Oh. Ha, there it is! You're lucky he's still alive! This freezer is an attractive nuisance. Just look at all that ice cream. It's damn near irresistible! Well, we better leave him in there. Moving him now could kill him and tire us out. Check it out! A freezer geezer! Please, young customers! Ignore the frozen gentlemen and return to your impulse buying. Ah, but we want to stare at the ice dude. We'll give you a buck. No! This is a convenience store, not a freak show! A dollar twenty? Come one, come all! See the amazing frozen man! Also, gaze at the Frito found in a bag of Doritos! Marvel at the floor that just won't come clean! Dear Log: My worst fears have been confirmed. I've hit my mental and creative peak at the tender age of eight. What will my life be like after I descend into mediocrity? Well, Ralph seems happy enough... Maybe I should just give up now and settle into a mindless, happy stupor... We now return to ""When Buildings Collapse!"" on Non-Stop Fox!! Hey, Lis. Wanna join us? Room for one more... We're watching the TV. Man has always loved his buildings. But what happens when the buildings say ""No more?"" Yes! Heh, heh! / Ha! Ha! / Woo hoo hoo heh heh! / Woo! / Oh! Oh! Yeah! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! / Ha! Ha! All right! Ha! Ha! Ha! Hee! Hee!/ Woo hoo! Ha! Ha! / I didn't think it was gonna fall over. Ha! Ha! Yeah! Ha! Ha! Ha! / Woo! Woo! Woo! The best part was when the buildings fell down! Yeah... Huh, huh, huh, maybe people got hurt! Hey, yeah. And now a Channel 6 editorial reply... Bo-ring! And now... ""When Surgery Goes Wrong!"" All right! Sounds good! Behold the ""Can Of Mystery."" The label vanished many years ago. What strange wonders lie inside? Treasure? Dog food? Whoa, some things man is not meant to know. Show - me - your t... Hey! It says ""Show me your tie."" It's cute. C'mon, let's go. Me and Frostillicus go back a long way. I used to share a bathroom with Frostillicus. In fact, I got a real funny story about that. Actually, it's not so much funny as it is long. It seems that there was this... Oooh, what a gold mine! Oh, my goodness! Boy, seeing that stomach surgery made me hungry! Marge, we need five thousand CC's of snacks, stat! No snacks! Dinner will be ready in three minutes! If she started dinner three minutes earlier, we wouldn't be in this mess! Relax, Lis. Dad and I always have a Plan B. Pretty neat, huh? But those candy bars are all squished and melted. Whuh? C'mon, Lisa, join the family! Quit it... quit it... quit... You kids knock it off! Mama's watchin' her stories! Hi, honey. It's me, your husband, Ralph. Hey, angel pie. Can you drive me down the libarry? I wanna rent us up some movies. Wesley, get Mama's pryin' bar. Easy does it now... easy... little more... yea... right... that's the spot... ooah! I'll git your coat. No!! ""No"" what? I don't want to turn out that way! What way, angel pie? Like you!! Lisa! Come on! Your tomato soup is getting a skin on top! Fine, she doesn't get her skin! Lisa insulted us, Mom. She thinks she's so great. I'll dance on her grave. Bart! What? Oh, napkin, right. Dear Log: It won't be long now before my mind melts into a soft Simpsony sludge. Soon, the arts and literature I love will be replaced by talk radio and vulgar mud flaps. It's time to give my brain its last meal. Oh, Kenny, look at the interplay of light and shadow. It's so luminous and vibrant. Ha! Ha! Thanks, Lisa. I painted that one. The real one's in my garage. Hmm... It sounds like she's hitting a baby with a cat. You have to listen to the notes she's not playing! Pff... I can do that at home. Son, I represent a group a oil tycoons who make foolish purchases. We already bought us a stained-glass bathrobe and the world's fattest race horse, and now we need your Ice Man. Oh no, I could never sell him. He is like a frozen father to me. How much for just the head? By gum, it worked! I've awakened in the future! ""Moon Pie."" What a time to be alive! Hey, who unplugged my freezer? Return to your state of living death at once, sir! Is that you, Apu? Whoa... time has ravaged your once-youthful looks. Ah, well, Sanjay, that is the end of our freak show. We must relinquish the giddy glamour of show business and return to the humble pleasures of the neighborhood shopkeeper. Time-traveler discount? Come on in! Great set! Thanks. But the crowd kept looking at me like I was using too many augmented ninths. Ah, they just came for the buffalo wings. But you really got through to me. Oh, good. I figure if you got something special to say, you have to share it with the world. Yeah, while you still can... Thanks! Damn, that felt like a sale... I'm sorry, little girl, we don't just put people on TV... unless, of course, they're replying to an editorial. Uh, I am! I'm strongly opposed to... Proposition, uh, 3-0-5... You're against discount bus fares for war widows? Uhh, you bet I am! Okay... Make-up! I'm getting worried about Lisa. She's been gone for hours. If I were her, I'd be buying me a great big chocolate apology cake. Authorities believe the wave of towel snappings will get worse before it gets better. And now with an editorial reply, here's a small girl. Hello. My name is Lisa Simpson. I'm supposed to talk to you about Proposition 305... Moochin' war widows... ...but I have something more important to say. For reasons beyond my control, I will soon become vapid, sluggish, and slow-witted. So before that happens, I want to share some things with you that have really meant a lot to me... What is she doing out there?! I'll cut off her mike. No, no, no, let her speak... I'm trying to get fired. And please don't deprive yourself of wonderful books like ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", ""Harriet The Spy"", and ""Yertle the Turtle"", possibly the best book ever written on the subject of turtle-stacking... She's got that right. Beauty is all around us, and not just in pageants and parlors. You can find it in the swirl of galaxies or the swirl in the center of a sunflower... That's a good idea. Let's go out for some frosty swirls. Homer, your daughter is pouring her heart out! We'll tape it! Why is she saying all this? Is she dying? Oh, she's just upset 'cuz I told her her brain's turnin' to mush. You know, on account of the Simpson gene. ""Simpson gene""? That's just foolishness. Nope. Baldness, too! So, please, I beg you, don't take your brain for granted. It's the best friend you'll ever have... Little girl -- likes her brain. What's your opinion? Pff... ""Simpson gene!"" Somebody's got to set that girl straight. And I know how to do it. Marge, get me your address book, four beers, and my conversation hat. Lisa. Lisa honey, wake up! Why bother? Because your father has a big surprise for you! I'm adopted? Better. Come look. Lisa, it's me, Daddy, your father. I rounded up every Simpson in the tri-city area, so I can prove to you there's nothing wrong with the Simpson genes. This is your Great-Uncle Chet. Go ahead, Chet, tell her what you do. I run an unsuccessful shrimp company. Oh. But... you run it, right? Oh, yeah. Okay. Uh, this is your second cousin Stanley. Uh, I shoot birds at the airport. Everybody hates birds! ...Right! Well uh, you look pretty successful. Thanks. I play a millionaire at parties. At least, I'd like to. You probably should've researched this first, eh, Dad? What about you? Well sir, I step in front of cars and sue the drivers. I beg celebrities for money. I'm a prison snitch. Jug band manager. My legs hurt. Oh, Lisa's right. We're nothing but a big bunch of losers. Show's over, folks. Go home. What about our five bucks? You get it after you leave. Now get out of here. Wait a minute, Homer! You didn't ask everybody. What about the women? Fine, fine. What do you do... ""Dr. Simpson""? Doctor? That's right, I'm Chief of Complicated Surgery at The InvasiCare Clinic. That means you went to college, right? You have to if you want to be an architect. Or an environmental lawyer. Or Regional Sales Coordinator for the third largest distributor of bunk and trundle beds. Ooo... Did you hear that, Lisa? So all the Simpson women turn out okay? That's right, sweetie. The defective Simpson gene is on the Y chromosome, so only men are affected. So I'm not doomed! Oh Dad, I've never been happier to be your daughter. Oh well, thanks, honey. Remember, there's nothing that says you can't be a Simpson and a success. Unless you're a man. So, wait a minute. This means I'm gonna be a failure? Yes, son. A spectacular failure. Enh. Dearest Log: I am me again! And I feel like there's nothing I can't do...except this stupid brain teas... I got it! Woo hoo! I mean... splendid.","Ralph Wiggum, Dr. Simpson, Security Guard, Miss Hoover, Troy McClure, Billy, Director, Chief Wiggum, Stanley, Milhouse Van Houten, Great Uncle Chet, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Station Manager, Kent Brockman, Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, Relative #5, Relative #3, BIG TEXAN, Dr. Nick Riviera, Relative #1, Ned Flanders, Martin Prince, Well-dressed Relative, Simpson Woman #2, Relative #2, Square Guy, Todd Flanders, Jasper Beardly, Announcer, Relative #4, Narrator, Simpson Woman #3, Otto Mann, Musician, Jimbo Jones, Bart Simpson, Simpson Woman #1",8.0,957.0,17,1998-03-08,1998,9,Lisa the Simpson,10.4,21608.0
