530,537,"SKINNER! SKINNER! / HE PATROLS THE SCHOOL HALLS... SKINNER! WHEN YOU SPIT, HE'S GOT THE BALLS! AS YOU MOSEY THROUGH THE SCHOOL / ALL THE KIDS SAY YOU'RE SO COOL AND YOU EVEN MADE BART SIMPSON SPILL HIS MILK! SKINNER! SKINNER! YOU'RE THE MASTER OF YOUR FATE! Skin-ner! SKINNER! / YOU SURE LOOK GOOD IN CHAPS... SKINNER... Wake up! You're on! Children, I have some exciting news. I'm here to tell you about a field trip so amazing we've put ""sign here"" stickers on the permission slips. As you recall these stickers came from last year's field trip to the ""sign here"" sticker factory. But thanks to my old navy buddy -- we both love to shop at Old Navy...the students of this school will be taking a ride on a nuclear-powered, attack-class submarine -- the U.S.S. Tom Clancy! So you're all excited, eh? YAY! Well that's too bad, because many of you will not be going. There is limited room on the submarine, so only the best-behaved students...as determined by me...will go on the trip. Woo hoo! Well I get to go! To increase the tension, everyone starts with a clean slate. But from this moment on... I am the law. I hold the red pen. SKINNER! Pranks, inside use of outside voice, off-color whistling, and you're stricken from the list. And once crossed off, you stay crossed off. That's what pens do. Help! I'm trapped in space with a man I don't like! Aooga! Submerge! Periscope! Aooga! Aooga! Die, Nazi octopus, die! Sweetie, about the submarine... what's your favorite food to eat when you're disappointed? I'm going shopping tomorrow. Ice cream sandwiches. Why? What your mother is trying to say is we don't think you can be good that long. Mom, is that true? Well, that's sort of what I was trying to say. But... What your mother is trying to say is-- No, you're wrong! You're all wrong! I didn't say anything. Were you thinking it? Yes. Get real, ding dong! You've already done so much bad stuff, Skinner's never going to let you on that boat. No, Skinner said I had a clean slate. So right now, I'm as good as any other kid. Good one, ding dong! Mom! Don't listen to them. They're the ding dongs. Bart, sweetie, this is an opportunity for you to turn things around, yet again. And I believe in you. Yet again. Thanks, Mom. I'll start by taking my plate to the dishwasher...wherever that is. Marge, I love Bart as much as you do but actually not. And that kid cannot go one week without getting in trouble. Now if you'd be so kind as to start my car for me, I'm going to Moe's. Ooh! Thank you. What are you doing? To avoid temptation, I'm getting rid of all the things that could get me in trouble at school. I buried all my whoopee cushions in the back yard. What the? That's not where I buried them. Come on. Don't take my custom limo! At least let me sniff my coke out of the floor mats! Oh, hi little girl. What brings you to see Uncle Krusty? Krusty, are you broke? Yeah. All it takes is some bad luck at the ponies, worse luck in the bitcoin market, heavy investment in a high-end bookmark company... You could do what ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" did. Go off the air while I'm still good? That horse has left the stable, gone to the glue factory, and has been used to make art projects. I mean you could sell foreign rights to your show. Even SpongeBob did it. Buon compleanno, Squiduardo! No, no, no, Roberto! E 'una mina della seconda guerra mondiale, che farà saltare in aria e... Calamari?! Nooo! Cute stuff. But I'm still broke, girlie. Not my Monet! I only looked at it once! What I'm saying is, you could produce foreign versions of your TV show with actors from other countries... Okay, I'll do it! Not my Shetland dolphin! Although I won't miss the constant yapping. Pa-pa! Not anymore, he ain't. Gum on the floor. Off the list. Unauthorized meat-a-pult. Off the list. Lips touching the fountain. Off the list. It's not my fault there's no water pressure! Excuses are like handkerchiefs -- everybody's got one. I don't have a handkerchief. Off the list! Firm but fair, sir. Don't want any troublemakers on our submarine. Not bad, Simpson. Did you wash your knees? Front and back, sir. Principal Skinner? I object to this arbitrary use of power and request I be taken off the list. Off the list! Thank you. Aw man, five days without pranking. I'm getting strange red marks. But I'm gonna make it. Uh-oh. Something's wrong with my long yellow car. Any of you kids got a triple A card? What?! No! I'll be late! Skinner will cross my name off the list! All fixed up! Off the list. For what? Muddy footprints on the school floor. I've broken a ten-year-old's spirit. Time to celebrate... with a fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt. Plain, plain, plain, plain, fruit! No, mother, I did not use any of your talc. I don't know why the bottle feels lighter. Maybe you're just getting stronger! Some days I could just kill you. She heard me? Hello? Hold for the President. This is... Barack Obama. Is this a prank? No. That's... offensive. I want to... talk about... submarines... and trips. Simpson... has to go. Simpson... has to go... on the... submarine. On the... submarine. On the... submarine. Of course. This is Barack Obama. SO IN LOVE WITH YOU... I like Ohio State... you can put lipstick on a pig... SO IN LOVE WITH YOU... Welcome. Welcome foreign market Krustys. If you examine your ""Krusty Kit"" you're gonna find un-removable green hair dye, a used red nose, and a guidebook on how to capture a monkey. But now, the man they call Mr. Monday Afternoon... Krusty! Hey-Hey! Hai-hai! / Hu-hu! / Heil-heil! / Rødgrød med Fløde! Now there're many words for what I'm looking for... rubles, renminbi, baht... but they all mean money, which rhymes with funny, which you can be if you want. I don't care. Just do the Krusty show in your country and send me ten percent. Then send me another sixty percent. Then five percent more and you're good. Nice job, Simpson. You even got my Suze Orman tape unstuck from the cassette player. She's the reason I was able to purchase a new watch band. Always braggin' about his fancy watchband. If only I could tell time. Okay, I washed your car like you asked, I did your paper route, and I'm sorry. I really am. This could be the turning point of my life. Where you, as a school guy, made a difference. What do you think? Can I go on that sub? Sorry, Simpson. Take her down! Yay! Yay! Yippee! Poor Bart. Rasta hey hey, on the left-hand side. As my mother used to say ""Wanti wanti can't get it, getti getti no want it"". Now here's Itchem and Scratchem, mon. THEY SMOKE / THEY TOKE / THEY SMOKE AND TOKE AND SMOKE / SMOKE, SMOKE, SMOKE, / TOKE, TOKE, TOKE / THE ITCHEM AND SCRATCHEM BLOW! Eye and eye say good-bye! The blessings of Jah upon you all. Nice. You're a hit all over the world! There's Chinese Krusty with Sideshow Mao... Even Irish Krusty. Me ma she had twelve children, but only three lived. Then they closed the mill. Hey hey. And it's all thanks to you, kid. To show my appreciation I'm gonna bring you with me next time I entertain the troops. Warning, they're not American troops. Hello, boy. At times like this there's not much you can say... especially if you don't know what happened... Skinner didn't let me go. Really? Hey, I bet that submarine isn't so fun anyway. You think so? Fire that torpedo, Milhouse! Aye-aye! Where'd it go? It was just imaginary. I know a kid should never turn to his father for help, but I got screwed. Is there anything you can do? As I always say, don't get mad, get dinner. Then get even. With Skinner. You'll really help me get revenge? Yes. What's Skinner's weakness? Everything. Good. We can use that. SKINNER! SKINNER! / YOU ARE FEELING PRETTY SMUG! SKINNER! SIPPING COCOA FROM A MUG! WHEN YOU'VE REACHED THE MOUNTAINTOP / YOUR NEXT STEP IS A DROP No, no, no, no, nooo! SKINNER! I'll be right there! Just saying goodbye to mother! Seymour! I'm going out for a walk! See you in several months at the soonest! We have a problem, Seymour. I did everything for you and you stabbed me in the back. Wait a minute... I knew you were a neat freak, Skinner. But you beat your rug till it bleeds? All right, I'll come clean. I woke up and, surprisingly, mother wasn't there beside me. She was dead. Still, I can't be sure I killed her. Well, I'm sure our town's police force will handle this competently. Now I could investigate further, but you don't want to sit in jail all weekend. Chief, that was awfully arbitrary. Not compared to this. Let me handle things. Just go upstairs and shut the door. There are some things only a boy should see. Now do you want to dispose of this jelly-soaked pillow? Just call me ""The Cleaner."" Um, where's the body? She's in a better place. The deed is done. I wish you'd asked me before you... Look, you kill them, I get rid of them. That's always been our deal. But I do have one question: do you want the head? No! No! God no! Well if you change your mind it'll be in my freezer. But only for a week. Got a lot of ice cream comin' in. If this were a movie mother wouldn't let me watch it. Now, I'm afraid it's time to start your new life. You'll be hunted... on the run... searching for the man who killed your mother, which is you. So avoid mirrors. Krusty... I have some very bad news. The foreign Krustys are all hotter than you. Irish Krusty's got a show on Broadway. Oy, where's your monkey?! There never was a monkey! I was just tellin' stories to forget me consumption. Hey, you see there, they need to hit the word ""monkey"" harder if they want to get a laugh. Don't you get what I'm trying to tell you? You are now the least popular Krusty in the world. What about Romanian Krusty? What, you mean President-for-Life Krusty? I still get a piece, right? Putz! You're the least successful version of you there is. A piece! Now let's see where this goes. Irish Krusty, this is your baby! The only thing working 'round here is your libido! Now I know why ma walked into the sea with her pockets full of rocks, on Christmas! Why doesn't this material work for me? Seymour! The cops are on their way! Here's a bus ticket to Juarez and your fake I.D. Oh, come on. I don't look anything like this... ""Dick Fiddler."" No you don't. Yet. I don't want to sound ungrateful, but could I eat one of the potatoes? Sorry, but Dick Fiddler is allergic to potatoes. I understand. Dad? Thanks for stickin' up for me. Someday I may have to fake my own death. And maybe you can help me with that. Sure, Dad. Someday soon. As in, what are you doing this Friday? Dick Fiddler! Gentlemen, I can't run away from what I've done. I accept that I killed my mother. My whole life she's belittled me! Maybe deep down... I'm glad. This has gone far enough. I'm starting to think this ""school project"" is more than meets the eye. Mother! You're alive?! Seymour, when this fat guy and his kid asked me to fake my death to punish you, I said, ""Sure, that's something to do."" You know, when you glare like that you look really beautiful. But when I just heard you say you were glad to see me dead... I thought, now I'm gonna be meaner to you than ever! How is that possible? I've stopped taking those pills that keep me nice. FIDDLER! FIDDLER! YOU LOOK STUPID IN THAT BEARD. FIDDLER! FIDDLER! THIS DREAM IS GETTING WEIRD... But instead, we're giving you something even better: I will do a guest shot on each of your shows! Eh? Eh? Twist him like a balloon! Cut off his hey-heys! Let's slice him up and cook him in our traditional dishes! Krusty, can't you think of something? Uh, you know, why did you even become a clown?
