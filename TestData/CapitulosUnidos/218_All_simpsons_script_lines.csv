214,218,"WEEE'RE PROUD TO BE TEACHERS / KNOWLEDGE IS OUR GAME / BUT WE'D SELL OUR MOTHERS / FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES OF... FAME! NOT GONNA TEACH FOREVER GONNA GIVE SHOWBIZ A TRY... TRY! I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks and blows. THAT'S FAME!!! Whew. Mercy. Good evening. Our old friend Noah Webster defines laughter as the act or sound of laughing-- Haw haw. Well illustrated, Nelson. And now, fasten your funnybones for Groundskeeper -- oh, or should I say Grinskeeper... No, I'm sorry, Groundskeeper was correct -- Willie! How many of ye hail from the fair city of Edinburgh? So have you noticed how North Edinburgh golfers putt like this and South Edinburgh golfers putt like this? Eh? Eh? Oh, I see. Willie's not funny unless he's down on his knees, scoopin' up your little brats' puke! Thank you! You've been great! ""YOU GIVE ME FEVER"" ""WHEN YOU TOUCH ME, FEVER WHEN YOU HOLD ME TIGHT"" ""FEVER -- HA!"" Kill me. Well, Seymour, it seems we've put together a baseball team, and I was wondering -- who's on first? Yes. Not the pronoun, but rather a player with the unlikely name of ""Who"" is on first. Yes, well, that's just great, Seymour. We've been out here six seconds, you've already managed to blow the routine. Sexless freak. Well, seems as though we're just about at the halfway point, so why don't we call it intermission? Oh! Don't go too far. If you like cafeteria workers in Beatle wigs with tennis racquet guitars, you won't wanna miss the second half. Oh, no let me out! Let's get outta here! You drive. I eat. Dad, you were supposed to pay for those snacks. I saw Krabappel's butt. I paid. Oopsie. Mm, this could take a minute. There's an opening, Mom! I don't know... I, I hate to change lanes once I get going... that's really for race car drivers. Mom, to your left. He's letting you in. Go! C'mon, Mom / Flanders, woman! No, no, as soon as I get over, that lane will stop moving. Erma Bombeck said so, and Dave Barry agrees. Ohhh, you suck, Marge. C'mon, move it, you clowns! What in blazes? So long, schlubs! Wow. Did you see that thing, Marge? So powerful. So commanding. So forceful and raw. It didn't ask, it just took. Canyonero... Go ahead, drool all you want. Ya can't hurt that finish. Now, rain water, that'll strip it right off. Sa-- Aw, and I shouldn't have said that. C'mon, Gil. Hey, a red one! Can I buy that? Please? Well ya... if ya... Really? Wah! Ha! Hot dog! A sale! I'll take it from here, Gil No, wait! Ah, no, ya can't take my sale! My wife's gonna leave me if I don't start bringin' in the green. Come on, lemme have this one, Stan. I'm beggin' ya. Look at me. I'm beggin' you, Stan. Mm-hm, let's go write this up, shall we? Honey, you shoulda seen me with my last customer, I... No, but I came so close. This guy was... eh... Whose voice is that? Is that Fred? Ah, ya said it was over!... No, don't put him on. It... Hello, Fred! Hi! Okay, you've got the undercoating, clear coating, rust proofing, underguard spray, gravelguard XJ, Vita-seal, Repelzit... but if you wanna protect the paint, you better keep it in this tent. Will do! Okay, here's how your lease breaks down. This is your down payment... then here's your monthly... and there's your weekly... And that's it, right? Yup. Oh, then, after your final monthly payment, there's the routine C.B.P., or crippling balloon payment. But that's not for awhile, right? Right. Sweet... Woo! Hello! / Woo! Hey baby! Sorry Homer. We thought you were one of those hot-to-trot Soccer Moms. Yeah, you don't see many men driving the F series. Huh? See? Instead of a cigarette lighter, it's got a lipstick holder. Aw, crap! It's a girl's car. I can't drive this. Oh, sure you can, doll face. A pretty thing like you can do whatever she wants. Shut up! Screw you guys! Where's your keys? I'm takin' your car to work. You cashed in your 401 to buy that stupid Canyonero. Why can't you drive it? Are you saying I'm gay? Because if that's what you think, then just come right out and say it. I don't think you're gay. I just have to do my grocery shopping. Now please gimme my keys. Fine. Sucker. Good lord. How am I supposed to get in this beast? Well, that's a nice feature. Not much headroom, though... Ooh! Oh, I guess I can drive it for a little while. But Mom, I read that sport utility vehicles are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents. Fatal to the people in the other car. Let's roll! Hang on. The manual says I need to log on to the onboard computer. M-A-R-G-E. Hello, Marge. Where would you like to go today? No one has ever asked me that before in my life. Well, that's a first. I've never been able to fit thirty-two grocery bags into one car before. Eww, why is Courtney Love on the Wheaties box? Hmm, I thought it was Sandy Duncan. Uh-oh. Gridlock at twelve o'clock. Oh, crud. And we're so close to the house. Um, I don't want to alarm you, but the ice cream's startin' to go south. Hey, give me some of that. Mom, Bart sprayed whipped cream in my eye! I did not. Kids, cut it out! All right. Hey! C'mon, Mom, just cut across the field. Oh, I don't know... It doesn't seem right. Do you want to spend your whole life doing what's right? Of course not! Let's do it. Whoooa! You the man, Mom! Outta my way, nature! CANYONERO! Look at me, Lis! I'm Baron von Chicken Pants. Bart! That's tomorrow night's dinner. You're tomorrow night's dinner. Mom! Bart took what I said and turned it into an insult! That's nice, dear! A three-chambered peanut! Marge, look what I did! Come quick! Hurry! Marge? Marge, you've been out there all morning. So? So... lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if you aren't around to see it. Oh, I'll come watch you do nothing after I try out my new high-intensity halogen headlights. Nobody will ever cut me off again! Aw, please come in. Maggie smells bad. And the cat wants something, but I don't know what. I'm almost done. And tell Bart to get out of my purse. S.U.V. coming through. Open up for Marge. Thank you! Whoaaa! Daylight! C'mon. C'mon. Geez! Try the gas pedal, Gramma. It's right there, next to the brake. Oh, forgodssa-- Go back to New Jersey... C'mon! C'mon! Get that corpse off the road! The streets are for the living! Slow down, you maniac! Show some respect for this coffin full of bricks representing a young man lost at sea. Hey! Oh, great. What'd I do? This better be important. Can the sweet talk, Thelma and Louise. You have a serious mental illness. The technical term is ""road rage."" I'll see you tomorrow morning at traffic school, Speedy. Now you've got exactly five seconds to get out of my sight. Why are the pretty ones always insane? Okay, I assume you all know why you're here. That's right. You're all angry, sick people. But over these next eight hours, you will be broken down to the level of infants, then rebuilt as functional members of society, then broken down again, then lunch, then if there's time, rebuilt once more. All right, roll it, Lou. Hello, I'm Sergeant Crew. And I'm here to talk to you about Rooad... raage... Duh! Quiet, fatso, the sergeant's talking! Go on, dear. In these modern hectic days of fast food, answering machines, and one night stands -- people are getting angrier. Now, what you're about to see is not pretty. Cut me off, will ya? Take that! Learn to drive, dimwit! I sentence you to kiss my ass! Look familiar? It should. Anger is what makes America great. But you must find the proper outlet for your rage: fire a weapon at your television screen, pick a fight with someone weaker than you, or write a threatening letter to a celebrity. So when you go out for a drive, remember to leave your murderous anger where it belongs: at home. And as if that film wasn't enough, we have a special guest: why, it's Curtis E. Bear, the Courtesy Bear! For the next three hours, this bear will take your verbal and physical abuse with good nature and aplomb. So if you'll all just grab one of these two by fours... Uh, Chief, can I at least shield my crotch? Bears can't talk, Eddie. Well, Simpson, did you learn something today? Ooo, did I ever. And that herbal anger rinse just washed the rage right out of me. Ah, remember, Midge. You feel the need to rage, you call me, right? I won't even get sexual or nothin'. Unless that's what you want. That, that's not what you want, right? No thanks. But thanks. After you, sweetheart. Oh, no. You first, ma'am. Well, somebody go first. Well, not me. I'm not going until she goes. Oh, for crying out loud... I-- Oh, oh, okay, calm down. Just think: what would Curtis E. Bear do? Move it! I gotta return this suit! Get out of the way! Whoa-ho-ho! Thanks, chick-dude! Well, I hope you're happy, Simpson. Those prisoners were one day away from being completely rehabilitated. I'm tearin' up your license! Aw, geez, darned laminated... would you mind? I got stubby fingers. How could they take away my license? It feels like I lost a limb. Well, that's a turn-off. Hey, why don't you come to the Wild Animal Park with us? No, your father drives like an old lady. At least I've got a license. C'mon, kids, I went too far. Oh, what a gyp. They're all just lying around. Do something! Bart, they're not here to entertain us. I've seen plays that were more exciting than this. Honest to God. Plays. I don't wanna pay four bucks to watch some monkey wannabe lay in the sun. But Dad, lemurs are nocturnal. Don't worry, honey. Daddy will fix that broken animal. No! I'm not gonna hurt him. I'm just gonna wake him up. Uh-oh. Here's your slingshot, Lisa. I told 'em a chainlink fence wouldn't hold rhinos. Oh wait, no I didn't. I meant to tell 'em. Don't worry, kids. I know just what to do. Jumanji! Does anything from the movies actually work? Aw, nuts. Isn't there anybody who can round up these thunder lizards? Well, they'd need a pretty rugged vehicle. And a heart to match. I'd like to help you, Chief, but my license was revoked. Seems I'm full of rage. Then do it for this adorable little puppy. Look at the puppy, Marge. That's your hat! She's good, Chief. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some dust that needs busting. This is Kent Brockman at the scene of a Level 3 Rhino Alert. Authorities say there's no immediate danger to anyone except those three luckless people, whom we'll identify once the rhinos spit out their wallets. Back! Back, I say! Oh no. I'm out of popcorn. Throw your peanuts! You throw your peanuts! Look, it's Mom! Outta the way! Move it or lose it! Get going, you! This oughta hold 'em. There's one missing, mate! If we don't find him, it'll be my ass on the barbie! Get in! Get in! C'mon, Homer! Jump! Ohhh, when will Detroit build a sun roof for the husky gentleman? Marge! Hey, anybody seen Homer today? There he goes. Oh, thank you, God. And thank you Porta-John. You really saved my... Who's out there?! Oh, I'm gonna die! Jesus, Allah, Buddha, I love you all! Nice rhino. Oh, no! She's not gonna make it! Looks like it's time for Plan B. One, two, three, ""B""! It's okay, Homie. You can come out now. Ah, give me a minute... Oh, Marge, you saved me! Wow! You are so much cooler than Milhouse's mom. Yeah. Way to channel that rage, Simpson. How'd you know your plan would work, Mom? Thanks for asking. Well, I was watching Dateline and Stone Philips said S.U.V.'s always roll over when you turn sharply, and the gas tanks explode at the drop of a hat. And she also knew that if a rhino sees a flame, he'll instinctively try to put it out. Stone Philips again! Is there anything that guy doesn't know? Why, this Stone Philips sounds like quite a bloke. What television network is he on? Why, NBC, of course. NBC has lots of great shows, and their news and sports coverage can't be beat! Do you think there's anything great on NBC right now? Oh, I'm sure of it! But there's only one way to find out! I'd like to read the following statement, but I do so under my own free will. It has come to my attention that NBC sucks. I apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as many FOX shows as possible. So in summary, NBC bad, FOX good. CBS great.","Miss Hoover, Carl Carlson, Judge Snyder, Teachers, Snake Jailbird, Eddie, Female S.U.V.
