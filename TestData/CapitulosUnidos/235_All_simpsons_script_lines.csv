231,235,"Our top story: The ozone hole that devastated Brazil last summer is apparently wintering in Springfield. Woo! Springfield rocks! Residents are advised to stay inside, unless you wear sunscreen or are very, very, hairy. Experts recommend a Class Nine or Robin Williams level of hair coverage. Help! Somebody! Let me in, for the love of...! Are you okay? I've been better. Oh, I am so bored. I can't wait till we're teenagers. Then we'll be happy. Well, we could play Clam Traffic Jam... Or the game of County Seats! Aw, the zoning disk is warped... All right, Silly String! Look, you're Milhouse. Who wets their bed now, Milhouse? I'll be in my room. There's gotta be something fun in my parents' closet. Wanna dress up like ladies? Uh, wouldn't that make us kinda... fruity? What's the matter, scared you might like it? I'll show you who's scared. Oh, wow, this really hides my thighs. Sis-ters are doin' it for themselves! Hey, why is this door locked? Oh, no! It's Dad! What's going on? And I want the non-gay explanation. Uh, we're drunk. Really drunk! Oh, thank God. Clear! Why are you doing that? Oh, it's good for the batteries. Now, I'm afraid your son has cracked his coccyx. Sorry, how long will he take to recover? He'll have to wear this fanny cast for quite some time. But don't worry, son. It fits snugly under your clothes. Do all these people have to watch me? Now, son, this is a teaching hospital, which is why I equipped the seat of your cast with a viewing window. Uhh, little help? Bart, stop fooling around. Principal Skinner, I thought public schools were required to have access ramps for the disabled. Technically, yes. But the building costs would be astronomical. Did I hear the word ""astronomical""? If so, my construction outfit, Valdazzo Brothers Olive Oil, is poised to help. No, no, no, no. We're not building anything. How can you say that when construction has already begun? How did those trucks get here so fast? In order to avoid certain legal complications, the trucks are always rolling. Now, for the ground-breaking ceremony... Good Lord! Do we really need all those ramps? Who's to say? Does a peacock need all those feathers? Look, you're getting a little philosophical for me. I suppose so. They say it happens in the autumn years. Well, be that as it may... Get your hand off my car. This is a proud day. Now, when people ask if we're in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1975, I can say, ""We are closer than ever before!"" Thank you. To inaugurate our ramp system, here's the first of what I hope will be many disabled students. Bart Simpson! / I'm proud of you, boy. What the...? Bart, where's your wheelchair? Don't need it anymore. Doctor says my butt-bone's stronger than ever. Tah dah! Well, at least we're prepared for the new millennium. My God, the whole thing's made of breadsticks! ... And paint, and shellac. It's all itemized in this bill. Two hundred thousand dollars! Are you mad? I don't get mad. I get stabby. The good news is, we need no longer fear vicious mob reprisals. But due to lack of funds, Springfield Elementary is closed forever. Oh, you're cheering now, but some day you'll... I'm just gonna stop trying. How could you close the school? What will become of our kids? Where are the refreshments? Now, you keep asking me that. And I keep telling you, over there. As for the school, we are exploring various options to raise the two hundred thousand dollars we need. I've got a motorhome I never use. Maybe we should raffle it off. Maybe you should shut up. Well I... Okay. We could try sellin' liquor. I'm doin' great! Please, sir. Put some shoes on. What, you don't like my bags? People, these are all good ideas... No, they're not. They're terrible, terrible ideas. You're right. It's hopeless. No one has that kind of money. What about Mr. Burns? Maybe he'll help us out. Forget it. He releases the hounds on every charity that comes to his door: Feed the Children, Save the Whales, even Release the Hounds. Uh, well, maybe we can pry open his wallet with a slick, professional pitch. A school play! Welcome to the world premiere of ""The Nice Man Giveth."" Focus! It's a play, sir. Hmmm, which one of these is the salt? Too bad I'm an idiot 'cause my school closed. Oh, well. No, that's the rat poison! Aaaaaand freeze! Now, who in Springfield will eat the poisoned broth? Whoo, it could be anyone, even Mr. Burns. This play really speaks to me. I can't take Mr. Burns to the ho'pital 'cause I'm too dumb to read a map. Oh, why did my school have to close? Hello, I'm Doctor Stupid. I'm going to take out your liver bones. Oops, you're dead. I never liked that Dr. Stupid. Mr. Burns, I'll be honest. We had a hidden agenda tonight. No!! The holiday season is approaching and these children need a school... Charity, eh? Yes, I'd be more than happy to... Oh, it's doing that thing again. We now return to ""Donde Esta Justice?"" El Ford Escort que me vendio es un limón! No, no, no, no, no. No es un limón. Es un carro fuerte! Hmm. Limón -- fuerte. Limón -- fuerte. Limón. F-- Ay yi yi yi yi! Mi estómago. Daytime TV is muy estupido. Hey, our school's on TV. Springfield Elementary has reopened its doors! I'm with Jim Hope of Kid First Industries, which has generously stepped in to educate our children. That's right, Kent. Ya know, when public schools drop the ball, it's up to the private sector to fall on that fumble and run for the end zone. Will you be replacing the current teachers and administrators? Very much so, Kent. But they've already received an extremely generous severance package. Valencia?! These are juice oranges! Howdy, children. I'd like to welcome you back to school. You know what. I agree. Wha? Your old school was boring. That's why it failed, right? Well, we're not gonna make you memorize facts and dates. No, no, no. I'm gonna find out what you really love in life and teach to that. What are you passionate about, partner? Boogers. Boogers. That was great. You know, humor is a sign of intelligence. You're not mad? Hey, I'm here to make sure that you get a ""kick"" out of education. He's rekindled my love affair with books! Check it out. I'm breaking books at a sixth-grade level. Get 'em, boy. Hit those smart-ass books. Why don't you kick some books, Lisa? Bart broke all my books. You know what our homework is? Find a toy and bring it to class! Boy, that sounds fun. I know, but I'm still not gonna do it. Since Christmas is coming soon, I thought we could talk about our favorite toys. Milhouse, what've you got there? My Busy Box. It's got everything! Vroom, vroom, vroom. I'm calling Daddy. Good for you, not being bound by the ""recommended"" age. What are you talking about? Oh, geez. How 'bout the rest of you? What do you like about those toys of yours? They're special. They're challenging. Very good. Now, I want you all to imagine the perfect toy. What would it be like? It should be soft and cuddly. Yeah. With lots of firepower! Its eyes should be telescopes. No, periscopes! No, microscopes! Can you come back to me? It should be full of surprises. It should never stop dancing. It should need accessories. Now that's market research you can take to the bank. The money bank. I just wish those second graders would stop jerkin' us around. Fun toys are fun. Well said, Ralph. But we're trying to come up with the name for a toy. Mrs. Fun? Not bad. Fun? Ralph, there are no right or wrong answers, but if you don't pipe down I'm giving you an ""F"". The before teacher yelled at me, too. No one's yelling. We're just brainstorming names... Lisa, any ideas? Oh, a name with ""fun""? Um... Fungus, Funzo, Attila the Fun... Lisa, are you doing math? Uh, just a few Venn diagrams. There's more under her chair! Lisa in trouble. Ha! The ironing is delicious. The word is ""irony."" Huh? Don't you think there's something weird going on here? We spent all day selecting fabric swatches, and then our guest speaker was ""Phil from Marketing"". Alls I know is I'm gettin' straight ""A's"". And that ain't not bad. That's not funny... Huh? They're spying on us. Why would they do that? I see you! Give me a hug.... This better be important, Lisa. I left Ralphie alone in the bathtub. Daddy, I'm ready to get out now. Over. This broom closet is not what it seems. It's a secret surveillance room, guarded by a tiny, evil robot. Uhh. Is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open the door and everything's normal, and we think you're crazy, but then there really is a killer robot and the next morning you find me impaled on a weather vane? Is that what this is, Lisa? To be fair, not all evil robots are killers. Listen, when you see what's inside this... I don't understand. I could swear it was right here. Yeah, right, mop top, and I'm Ed Sullivan. Really big shew. No, no, I can do it better. Really big shew. Really. That's it. Well, folks, that's the end of Krusty's Nondenominational Holiday Fun Fest. I wanna thank my guests Tea Leoni... Beck... The Dixie Chicks... Merry Christmas, y'all! And Patrick Ewing as the Genie. So have a Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Kwazy Kwanzaa, a Tip-Top Tet, and a Solemn, Dignified Ramadan. And now a word from my God, our sponsor. I see you. Give me a hug. That's the doll that attacked me! This Christmas, everybody wants Funzo! Funzo? I said that name in class. Funzo's soft and cuddly! With lots of firepower! Haw haw! Funzo! Funzo! Funzo! If you don't have Funzo, you're nothin'! Mom! I know what I want for Christmas. Bart, they lied to us. Instead of giving us an education, they tricked us into designing a toy. Aren't you outraged? No, but if you're gonna throw a spaz, I'll come with. Good. Saddle up the bikes. Get down. Security guard. Hey, it's Gary Coleman. But the menu said Galaxy of Prawns. Three prawns are hardly a galaxy... Whaddaya mean your hands are tied? Let me talk to Mr. Kwan. I want to see how this turns out. The phone's not even plugged in! All right, you listen to me, Kwan... Hang on. I got another call. Yes, Mr. President. I can be in Washington right away. You people took advantage of trusting schoolchildren! How did you get past Gary Coleman? Let's just say he's a few prawns short of a galaxy. I'm sorry, Gary. There's no longer a place for you here. Whatchu talkin' 'bout, Ms. Naegle?! That is so adorable. You're rehired. Sucker. I knew exactly what she was talking about. Lisa, I know you're mad, but just for a damn minute try to see this from a product positioning standpoint. Do you have any idea how much pressure we're under to come up with the new Furby or Tickle-Me-Elmo? And thanks to you, Funzo is the first doll designed by children, for children with all the profits going to children. Really? Yeah, well, we're all somebody's children. But hey, we did screw you a little. So here's a free Funzo. Deal! Oh, brother. And I want Funzo's dream fortress, Funzo's lower-back-pain chair, Funzo's European voltage converter... Why not get three?! Ah, three it is. Thanks, Funzo. You rock! All righty! It's always a party with Funzo! I admit it's kind of cute, but it'll never take the place of Malibu Stacy. Did you see that? Yeah. Funzo makes playtime fun! Hey, kids! It's... Hey! Why is it destroying other toys? They must have programmed it to eliminate the competition. You mean like Microsoft? Exactly. Come on, Bart, we've got to warn everyone. Boycott Funzo. He's a toy-killing machine! That shy little imp? I have a flower for 'oo. Awwww... Oh, man. I've gotta get me one of those! Hey, I'm not waitin' till the store opens. Wow, only twenty-two seconds from muttering to door smash. That projects to a profit of three hundred and seventy million dollars. I'd still sleep a little easier if I saw some trampling. Ow! Ow! Ow! Now why would you wear cleats to a store? Well, I guess that's it. Come Christmas Eve, there'll be a Funzo under every tree. Unless... So, who am I beating up? Nobody! You're just gonna break into everyone's house and steal their favorite toy. Thus saving Christmas. Now, let's see. This will make three Christmases I saved versus eight I ruined... two were kind of a draw... Dad, Dad, you're driving on the sidewalk. Sorry. Joy to the world / the Lord is come. / Let Earth receive her King... Let ev-ry... Season's Greetings. Peace out! Si-lent night... Ho-ly night... All is calm / All is bright / Round... Writhing Funzos / In my sack / Makes me happy / Makes me hurt my back... Just dump 'em in the fire, Dad. Yes. The madness ends here. Hah! If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that... I'm vewy mad at 'oo. Well, what do we have here? Looks like the biggest rip-off since ""Webster."" Please, Mr. Coleman. We can explain. I'm listening. Your toy company is evil. Well, isn't it possible for an evil company to make people happy? Are you saying the end justifies the means? That's a very glib interpretation. Hey, don't talk to my sister that way. No, Bart, he's right. I did oversimplify. Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics. I think what Lisa meant to say is... And so, Gary Coleman and the Simpsons argued long into the night... And then, as day broke, the spirit of the season entered their hearts. Let's just agree that the commercialization of Christmas is at best a mixed blessing. A-men. L-U-V-V-V! KILL! Hey, look out! Well, there's something you don't see every Christmas. Hey, it is Christmas. We'd better get home. Hey, Dad... What if we... Um, uh... Mr. Coleman, I've been thinking... My wife always makes too much stuffing and sweet p'taters and all, and... Aw, heck! Would you like to spend Christmas with us? No way! I'm having Christmas at George Clooney's house. Gary... All right. I'll come. And Gary Coleman was as good as his word. As for old Mr. Burns, he was visited by three ghosts during the night, and agreed to fund the school with some money he found in his tuxedo pants. Thank you, thank you. Humbug. While Moe, seeing what the world would be like if he had never been born, pulled his head out of the oven...and replaced it with a plump Christmas goose. Here, Happy Holidays, there. Merry Christmas, Moe! Uh, listen, I kinda banged up that Jeep in the driveway. Whatchu talkin' 'bout, Moe? Whatchu talkin' 'bout, every one.","Terri Mackleberry, Ralph Wiggum, Carl Carlson, Waylon Smithers, Fat Tony, Chief Wiggum, Milhouse Van Houten, JANEY, Bumblebee Man, Marge Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Kent Brockman, Crowd, Homer Simpson, Sherri Mackleberry, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Seymour Skinner, C.
