12869,76,2,78000,Senator Mendoza,Mansion,To human misery.
147994,76,3,89000,McBain,Mansion,Ice to see you.
12870,76,4,91000,Senator Mendoza,Mansion,McBain!

12873,76,9,127000,Bart Simpson,Mansion,That is one evil dude.
12874,76,10,129000,Homer Simpson,Mansion,"It's just a movie, son. There's nobody that evil in real life."
12876,76,12,131000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Eh.
12877,76,13,141000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Smithers, where's that union representative? He's twenty minutes late."
12879,76,15,145000,Waylon Smithers,SMITHERS' OFFICE,"I don't know, sir. He hasn't been seen since he promised to clean up the union."
12881,76,17,149000,Receiver,Football Field,Whoa! What the hell?
12885,76,19,153000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Well let's look at the contract ourselves. Benefits... perks... a green cookie on St. Patrick's Day? Oh, it didn't used to be this way, Smithers. No, it didn't used to be this way at all..."
12887,76,21,175000,Burns' Grandfather,SPRINGFIELD POWER WORKS,Come on! Come on! Crack those atoms!

12890,76,24,188000,Teenage Boy,SPRINGFIELD POWER WORKS,"You can't treat the working man this way. One day we'll form a union and get the fair and equitable treatment we deserve. Then we'll go too far, and get corrupt and shift-less and the Japanese will eat us alive!"
12891,76,25,200000,Burns' Grandfather,SPRINGFIELD POWER WORKS,The Japanese!? Those sandal-wearing goldfish tenders? Bosh! Flimshaw.
12892,76,26,209000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD POWER WORKS,"If only we had listened to that boy, instead of walling him up in the abandoned coke oven. Well, I'm going to avenge my grandfather. We'll take on that greedy union and get back our..."

12897,76,31,235000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist's Office,Why must you turn my office into a house of lies?
12898,76,32,239000,Ralph Wiggum,Dentist's Office,"You're right, I don't brush. I don't brush..."
12899,76,33,243000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist's Office,"Let's look at a picture book, ""The Big Book of British Smiles."""
12900,76,34,257000,Ralph Wiggum,Dentist's Office,That's enough. That's enough.
12901,76,35,261000,Bart Simpson,Dentist's Office,Doctor Wolfe likes to pull kids' teeth so he can sell them.
12902,76,36,264000,Kids,Dentist's Office,To who?
12903,76,37,265000,Bart Simpson,Dentist's Office,You know that rattle when you shake up spray paint? That's a kid's tooth.
12904,76,38,275000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist's Office,Maggie's teeth are coming in crooked. Has she been sucking on a pacifier?
12905,76,39,280000,Marge Simpson,Dentist's Office,Uh... not to my knowledge.
12906,76,40,282000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist's Office,Liar!
12907,76,41,284000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist's Office,I'm also afraid Lisa is going to need braces.

12909,76,43,293000,Marge Simpson,Dentist's Office,"Are you sure, Doctor?"
12910,76,44,294000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist's Office,"Well, judge for yourself. Here's Lisa today..."
12911,76,45,298000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist's Office,"Without treatment, here's what she'll look like at age eleven."
12849,76,46,302000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist's Office,Age fourteen.
12883,76,47,304000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist's Office,Age seventeen.

12915,76,51,313000,Marge Simpson,Dentist's Office,Bart!
12916,76,52,314000,Bart Simpson,Dentist's Office,"We can stick her in a trailer, drive her around the South, and charge two bits a gander."
12919,76,55,318000,Mc,Simpson Home,"Now stay tuned for professional wrestling, live from the Springfield Grapplarium! Tonight, a Texas death match... Dr. Hillbilly vs. the Iron Yuppie. One man will actually be unmasked and killed in the ring!"
12920,76,56,331000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I hope they kill that Iron Yuppie. Thinks he's so big.
12921,76,57,334000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, Lisa needs Braces."
12922,76,58,337000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't worry. We won a dental plan in the strike of eighty-eight. That's where I got this scar.
12924,76,60,343000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What do we want?
12925,76,61,345000,Workers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,More equitable treatment at the hands of management!
12926,76,62,347000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,When do we want it?

12928,76,64,350000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito?
12931,76,67,356000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Then I got this scar sneaking under the door of a pay toilet.
12933,76,69,363000,Carl Carlson,UNION HALL,"Welcome brothers of Local 643. As you know, our president, Chucky Fitzhugh, ain't been seen lately. We're all praying he'll turn up soon, alive and well."
12934,76,70,375000,Carl Carlson,UNION HALL,"All right, all right, but seriously, we have to vote on Burns' new contract. It's basically the same deal, except we get a free keg of beer for our meetings."
12935,76,71,383000,Carl Carlson,UNION HALL,"And in exchange for that, we have to give up our dental plan."
12936,76,72,388000,Lenny Leonard,UNION HALL,So long dental plan!

12956,76,93,434000,Guy,UNION HALL,Yoink!
12957,76,94,435000,Lenny Leonard,UNION HALL,Hey!
12958,76,95,436000,Homer Simpson,UNION HALL,"And Gummy Joe, where would you be without the dental plan?"
12959,76,96,441000,Gummy Joe,UNION HALL,"I wouldn't have old chomper here, that's for sure."
12960,76,97,447000,Homer Simpson,UNION HALL,You know what I think of this contract?
12962,76,99,459000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Who is that firebrand, Smithers?"
12963,76,100,461000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"That's Homer Simpson, sir."
12964,76,101,462000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Simpson, eh?... New man?"
12965,76,102,464000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Actually sir, he thwarted your campaign for governor... you ran over his son... he saved the plant from meltdown and his wife painted your portrait--"
12966,76,103,473000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Doesn't ring a bell.
12968,76,105,475000,Workers,UNION HALL,Homer! Homer! Homer!
12969,76,106,478000,Carl Carlson,UNION HALL,I move that Homer Simpson be our new union president. All in favor...

12973,76,110,486000,Carl Carlson,UNION HALL,"Congratulations, Homer!"
12974,76,111,490000,Homer Simpson,UNION HALL,"Hey, what does this job pay?"
12975,76,112,492000,Carl Carlson,UNION HALL,Nothin'.
12977,76,114,493000,Carl Carlson,UNION HALL,... Unless you're crooked.
12978,76,115,494000,Homer Simpson,UNION HALL,Woo hoo!
12980,76,117,500000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"President of the union! I'm so proud of you, Homie."
12981,76,118,504000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,This is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.
12982,76,119,507000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And make life-long connections to the world of Organized Crime. Hmmm... organized crime.
12983,76,120,519000,Donut Vendor,Simpson Home,"Don Homer, I have baked a special donut just for you."
12984,76,121,526000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Mmm. Gratzi.

12988,76,125,543000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's-a-nice-a-donut.
12989,76,126,545000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Do you think you can get the dental plan back?
12990,76,127,548000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, Mr. Burns or me."
12991,76,128,552000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I'll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol' danish."
12992,76,129,556000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Done and done! Heh, heh, heh."
12994,76,131,563000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist's Office,"Lisa and Marge, these braces are invisible, painless, and periodically release a delightful burst of Calvin Klein's Obsession for teeth."
12995,76,132,574000,Lisa Simpson,Dentist's Office,Mmmm.
12996,76,133,575000,Marge Simpson,Dentist's Office,"Doctor, we don't have a dental plan right now. So we'll need something a little more... affordable."
12997,76,134,582000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist's Office,These pre-date stainless steel so you can't get them wet.
12999,76,136,591000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hmm, he's a worthy foe. Look at him, Smithers. Exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine."
13000,76,137,600000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back?"
13001,76,138,604000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Okay, but it's the last time."
13003,76,140,610000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"We don't have to be adversaries, Homer. We both want a fair union contract."
148543,76,141,615000,Homer's Brain,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Why is Mr. Burns being so nice to me?
13004,76,142,617000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"And, if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours."
148544,76,143,621000,Homer's Brain,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Wait a minute. Is he coming on to me?
13005,76,144,624000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what's the harm?"
148545,76,145,628000,Homer's Brain,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh my God, he is coming on to me."
13006,76,146,631000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"After all, negotiations make strange bedfellows."
148546,76,147,637000,Homer's Brain,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yikes!
13007,76,148,638000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no."
13009,76,150,648000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist Office,"Lisa, so you won't be scared, I'll show you some of the tools I'll be using."
13010,76,151,653000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist Office,This is the scraper. This is the poker. And this happy little fellow is the gouger.
13011,76,152,660000,Lisa Simpson,Dentist Office,Uh huh.
13012,76,153,663000,Dr. Wolfe,Dentist Office,"Now, the first thing I'll be doing is chiseling some teeth out of your jaw- bone. Hold still while I gas you."
13013,76,154,697000,Mop Top #1,Dentist Office,Look fellas! It's Lisa in the sky.
13014,76,155,700000,Mop Top #2,Dentist Office,"No diamonds, though."
13015,76,156,701000,Mop Top #3,Dentist Office,Look out for that campy drawing of Queen Victoria!
13016,76,157,706000,Mop Tops,Dentist Office,"For the love of God, help us!"
13017,76,158,712000,Lisa Simpson,Dentist Office,The mirror. The mirror!
13019,76,160,727000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, you look fine."
13020,76,161,739000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who is it?

13022,76,163,741000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who?
13023,76,164,742000,Goon,Simpson Home,Hired goons.
13024,76,165,743000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hired goons?
13027,76,168,756000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Ah, Homer! I hope Crusher and Low Blow didn't hurt you."
13028,76,169,760000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"You know, you could have just called me."
13029,76,170,763000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Oh yes, but the telephone is so impersonal. I prefer the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons."
13030,76,171,769000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Hired goons?
13031,76,172,771000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,This is the largest TV in the free world.
13032,76,173,778000,Bumblebee Man,Burns Manor,Aiiee! Un gato malodoro!
13034,76,175,785000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,This is a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters. Soon they'll have written the greatest novel known to man.
13035,76,176,789000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Let's see. ""It was the best of times. It was the blurst of times?"" You stupid monkey!"
13037,76,178,801000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Ohh, shut up."
13038,76,179,805000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,And this is my basement.
13039,76,180,808000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms."
13041,76,181,810000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Yes, I really should stop ending the tour with it."
13042,76,182,814000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Now, let's get down to business."
148547,76,183,816000,Homer's Brain,Burns Manor,"Oh man, I've really got to go to the bathroom. Why did I have all that beer and coffee and watermelon?"
13043,76,184,822000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Now, Homer, I know what you're thinking and I want to take the pressure off."
13044,76,185,825000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"It doesn't take a whiz to see that you're looking out for number one. Well, listen to me and you'll make a big splash very soon."
13045,76,186,833000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Which way to the bathroom?
13046,76,187,835000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Oh. It's the twenty-third door on the left.
13047,76,188,838000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Nope. Nope. Nope.
13048,76,189,841000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Ah, he wouldn't even hear me out."
13050,76,191,845000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Find the bathroom alright?
13051,76,192,846000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Uh... yeah.
13053,76,194,857000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Well, you've won this round Simpson, but I'll grind you into the earth like a bug!"
13054,76,195,866000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Simpson, be a dear and rub my legs till the feeling comes back."
13055,76,196,870000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"A bug, I tell you! A bug!"
13056,76,197,876000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna resign. I don't know why they made me Union President in the first place.
13057,76,198,882000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Because they love you down at the plant.
13058,76,199,884000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, you're right. Guys are always patting my bald head for luck... pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh..."
13059,76,200,892000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That doesn't sound like they like you at all.
13060,76,201,895000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ya know, I think you're right. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm gonna punch Lenny in the back of the head."
13062,76,203,905000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Batten down those cowlicks... straighten that part... uncross those eyes, Mister."
13063,76,204,910000,Quigley,Springfield Elementary School,But I can't.

13065,76,206,913000,Photographer,Springfield Elementary School,"Come on, honey, smile."
13066,76,207,916000,Photographer,Springfield Elementary School,I bet you've got a beautiful smile. Why don't you share it with the world?
13067,76,208,921000,Photographer,Springfield Elementary School,"We can always stick in a ""Photo Not Available"" card."

13082,76,223,982000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Smithers, get me some strike breakers like the kind they had in the 30's."
13084,76,225,986000,Grampa Simpson,Burns's Office,"We can't bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways."
