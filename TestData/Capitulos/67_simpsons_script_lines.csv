10192,67,17,142000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you're not listening!"
10193,67,18,145000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That medicine's not for you.
10194,67,19,147000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Marge. Maybe I'm not getting enough ...estrogen."
10195,67,20,151000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Gimme that.
10196,67,21,153000,Captain,Simpson Home,"Ahoy, maties. Had your fill of tacos? Would ye sooner eat a bilge rat than another burger? Then come for all-you-can-eat seafood at the ""FRYIN' DUTCHMAN."""

10199,67,24,168000,Wife,Simpson Home,Okay.
10200,67,25,171000,Captain,Simpson Home,"Set sail for ""The Fryin' Dutchman."""
10201,67,26,174000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aye, aye Captain! Marge, we're going to that restaurant."
10202,67,27,178000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"But I think I'm allergic to seafood. The last time I ate shrimp, my throat closed up and I went into convulsions."
10203,67,28,185000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mmmm, shrimp."
10205,67,30,187000,Woman,WINFIELD HOUSE,"Now, I don't know much about haggling or bargaining, so why don't we just agree to pay whatever the Winfields want?"
10206,67,31,193000,Price,WINFIELD HOUSE,That could work.
10207,67,32,195000,Man,WINFIELD HOUSE,What was that?
10208,67,33,197000,Price,WINFIELD HOUSE,Sigh.
10210,67,35,199000,Homer Simpson,WINFIELD AND SIMPSON HOUSES,"There you are! Thought you could get away, huh?"
10211,67,36,204000,Woman,WINFIELD AND SIMPSON HOUSES,Goodbye.
10215,67,40,215000,Lisa Simpson,WINFIELD BASEMENT,I don't think we should be down here.
10216,67,41,217000,Bart Simpson,WINFIELD BASEMENT,"Nervous, Lis? I don't blame you. This is where the Winfields hid their mutated son."
10217,67,42,222000,Lisa Simpson,WINFIELD BASEMENT,Bart! The Winfields didn't have a son.
10218,67,43,225000,Bart Simpson,WINFIELD BASEMENT,See that sock over there? It was his only friend.
10219,67,44,228000,Bart Simpson,WINFIELD BASEMENT,"Hello, Lisa. Here in the dark you won't need those eyes. Let me have them."
10220,67,45,234000,Lisa Simpson,WINFIELD BASEMENT,"Bart, that's not funny."
10221,67,46,235000,Bart Simpson,WINFIELD BASEMENT,There are some who say the monster... ... is still... here!
10222,67,47,244000,Lisa Simpson,WINFIELD BASEMENT,Aaah!
10223,67,48,244000,Laura Powers,WINFIELD BASEMENT,Friend... friend...
10225,67,50,251000,Laura Powers,WINFIELD BASEMENT,"Hey kid, wake up."
10226,67,51,253000,Bart Simpson,WINFIELD BASEMENT,Who are you?
10227,67,52,253000,Laura Powers,WINFIELD BASEMENT,I'm Laura - your new neighbor. You all right?
148671,67,53,258000,Bart's Thoughts,WINFIELD BASEMENT,She's beautiful. Say somethin' clever.
10228,67,54,260000,Bart Simpson,WINFIELD BASEMENT,I fell on my bottom.
10230,67,56,270000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,WINFIELD HOUSE,Not again.
10231,67,57,272000,Laura Powers,WINFIELD HOUSE,"My mother's inside, Mrs. Simpson. Please go right on in."
10232,67,58,276000,Marge Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,"Oh, you speak so politely to adults."
10233,67,59,278000,Laura Powers,WINFIELD HOUSE,"My upbringing was painfully strict, ma'am."
10234,67,60,280000,Marge Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,That's sweet.
10235,67,61,282000,Marge Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,"... and finally, Moe's Tavern has contributed a coupon as their way of saying ""Welcome to Springfield."""
10236,67,62,282000,Mrs. Powers,WINFIELD HOUSE,"Thank you, this is all so nice. I actually had some doubts about moving to Springfield. Especially after that Time cover story, ""America's Worst City."""
10237,67,63,294000,Marge Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,You could see our house in that photo.
10238,67,64,294000,Mrs. Powers,WINFIELD HOUSE,Oh.
10239,67,65,301000,Marge Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,And this is for the man of the house... which I guess... is you.
10240,67,66,310000,Mrs. Powers,WINFIELD HOUSE,"I guess I should explain. Laura's father and I divorced two years ago. Oh, they're so sweet when you marry them, but soon it's just career, career, career."
10241,67,67,321000,Homer Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don't look that way.
10243,67,69,326000,Bart Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,I bet you don't know this one. How'd you like a Hertz Donut?
10244,67,70,329000,Bart Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,Oh.
10245,67,71,330000,Laura Powers,WINFIELD HOUSE,"Hurts, don't it?"
10247,67,72,332000,Bart Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,"Uh, right. Do you know what a Wet Willie is?"
10248,67,73,334000,Laura Powers,WINFIELD HOUSE,Is it this?
10249,67,74,337000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,WINFIELD HOUSE,"Hey baby, how about putting your finger in my ear?"
10250,67,75,340000,Laura Powers,WINFIELD HOUSE,"Well, I don't know, your boyfriend looks like the jealous type."
10251,67,76,342000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,WINFIELD HOUSE,"Hey, what the --"
10252,67,77,343000,DOLPH,WINFIELD HOUSE,That chick's messin' with our minds.
10253,67,78,346000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,WINFIELD HOUSE,Let's get outta here.
10254,67,79,347000,Laura Powers,WINFIELD HOUSE,"Now, where were we? Oh yeah, I was gonna tell your fortune."
10255,67,80,352000,Bart Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,Huh?
10256,67,81,353000,Laura Powers,WINFIELD HOUSE,"Oh, man, you're gonna be rich!"
10257,67,82,355000,Bart Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,Whoa!
10258,67,83,356000,Laura Powers,WINFIELD HOUSE,"There's your mansion. There's the tennis court... and there's the swimming pool! See you later, Bart!"
10259,67,84,364000,Bart Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,I'll never wash this hand again.
10260,67,85,369000,Lisa Simpson,WINFIELD HOUSE,"Dad, make Bart wash his hand."
10262,67,87,371000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Lis, I no longer control the hand. The hand controls me."
10263,67,88,377000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Daad!
10264,67,89,378000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Shut up, you little monsters! Hello, I was wondering if you'd like to baby-sit my little angels."
10266,67,91,383000,Woman #1,Suburban House,"Sorry, this isn't Abbie, this is her sister. I look after her now."
10267,67,92,388000,Woman #2,Suburban House,"No, Bart, put it down. Put it down, Bart. Bart, put it down..."
10269,67,94,395000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No ""All You Can Eat Seafood."" I wore my extra-loose pants for nothing. Nothing!"
10270,67,95,402000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe Laura could watch us.
10271,67,96,404000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I get it. Bart, the baby-sitter's here. Let me tuck you in."
10272,67,97,411000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Silence!
10274,67,99,417000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe it's time I wash my hand.
10276,67,101,420000,Mrs. Powers,POWERS HOUSE,I'll send Laura over to baby-sit as soon as she gets home.
10277,67,102,423000,Homer Simpson,POWERS HOUSE,"Great. Oh, uh... and there was something else. Something I was supposed to tiptoe around..."
10278,67,103,430000,Mrs. Powers,POWERS HOUSE,My divorce.
10279,67,104,431000,Homer Simpson,POWERS HOUSE,"That's it! Whew, I'm glad one of us remembered. That could have been embarrassing."
10281,67,105,436000,Mrs. Powers,POWERS HOUSE,"Well I know what you're thinking and the answer is yes, I want to be fixed up with one of your friends as soon as you can arrange it. After all, Homer, I do have the normal appetites."
10282,67,106,447000,Homer Simpson,POWERS HOUSE,"Heh heh, I know what you mean. Just let me make sure we're not talking about food."
10283,67,107,451000,Mrs. Powers,POWERS HOUSE,I'm not.
10284,67,108,451000,Homer Simpson,POWERS HOUSE,"Right. Me neither. We're talkin' about sex, right?"
10285,67,109,456000,Mrs. Powers,POWERS HOUSE,Right.
10286,67,110,457000,Homer Simpson,POWERS HOUSE,I hear you loud and clear.
10288,67,112,460000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, are you taking a bath?"
10289,67,113,462000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes I am. And it would be nice to have a little privacy around here for a change.
10290,67,114,466000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"This wouldn't have anything to do with Laura coming over, would it?"
10291,67,115,470000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, sometimes a guy just likes his skin to look its yellowest."
10292,67,116,473000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why, Laura. What a pleasant surprise."
10293,67,117,478000,Laura Powers,Simpson Home,Cute. What do you guys want for dinner?
10294,67,118,481000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't care. Ask Hef over there.
10295,67,119,483000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Lady's choice.
10298,67,122,491000,Guy #1,Restaurant,Sometimes I think you want to fail.
10299,67,123,493000,Guy #2,Restaurant,Shut up. Just shut up.
10301,67,125,499000,Laura Powers,Simpson Home,We used to eat this when my dad was stationed in Vandahar. Take your Kafta B-Sanieh and dip it in the Labneh.
10302,67,126,506000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Now that is good Labneh.
10304,67,128,514000,Waiter,The Frying Dutchman,"I'm sorry, ma'am, but everything on the menu has fish in it."
10305,67,129,517000,Marge Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,"Hm, what about the bread? Does that have much fish in it?"
10306,67,130,519000,Waiter,The Frying Dutchman,Yes.
10307,67,131,520000,Marge Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,"Well, I have some Tic Tacs in my purse..."
10308,67,132,523000,Waiter,The Frying Dutchman,Excellent choice... and for the gentleman?
10309,67,133,526000,Homer Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,All you can eat. All you can eat.
10310,67,134,527000,Waiter,The Frying Dutchman,"All right. When you're ready, take this plate over..."
10311,67,135,529000,Chef,The Frying Dutchman,"Please don't take the steam tray, sir."
10313,67,137,533000,Laura Powers,Simpson Home,"C'mon Bart, if I can teach Maggie to waltz, I can teach you."
10314,67,138,539000,Laura Powers,Simpson Home,Just follow me. Put your hand on my hip.
10315,67,139,542000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,O-kay.
10316,67,140,557000,Laura Powers,Simpson Home,Wedgie!
10317,67,141,557000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoa.
10320,67,144,570000,Waiter #2,The Frying Dutchman,That man ate all our shrimp and two plastic lobsters!
10321,67,145,574000,Captain,The Frying Dutchman,'Tis no man. 'Tis a remorseless eating machine. Arrrr...
10322,67,146,579000,Captain,The Frying Dutchman,"Six bells, time for closin'."
10323,67,147,581000,Homer Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,Can't talk... eating.
10324,67,148,582000,Captain,The Frying Dutchman,"Fairly warned be thee, says I."
10325,67,149,582000,Homer Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,"Hey, hey, hey!"
10326,67,150,594000,Homer Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,"But the sign said ""All you can eat."""
10329,67,153,599000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna fight this thing.
10330,67,154,601000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, please don't. For me?"
10331,67,155,604000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry Marge, this is my quest. I'm like that guy -- that Spanish guy -- you know, he fought the windmills..."
10332,67,156,611000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don Quixote?
10333,67,157,612000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, that's not it. What's his name? The Man of La Mancha."
10334,67,158,615000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don Quixote.
10335,67,159,615000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
10336,67,160,617000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I really think that was the character's name... Don Quixote!
10337,67,161,619000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. I'll look it up.
10338,67,162,623000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, who was it?"
10339,67,163,624000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Never mind.
10340,67,164,633000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Mmhmmm.
10342,67,166,633000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh no! Here comes the ""Conservative Judge!"""
10343,67,167,638000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Plead insanity! Plead insanity!
10344,67,168,640000,Laura Powers,Kwik-E-Mart,It's not working!
10345,67,169,641000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,All right. Hit the change of venue button. Now!
10346,67,170,644000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Oh no. You're in Texas!
10347,67,171,651000,Laura Powers,Kwik-E-Mart,"If I'd hit the ""remorse"" button one more time, I would have made it. Ah, Bart, I gotta go. See ya around."
10348,67,172,657000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"I am thinking you like this girl, yes?"
10349,67,173,660000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,How did you know?
10350,67,174,661000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,My ceiling mirrors and video cameras sometimes see more than who is about to shoot me.
10246,67,177,667000,Homer Simpson,The Law Office of Lionel Hutz,"...All you can eat, ha!"
10352,67,178,667000,Lionel Hutz,The Law Office of Lionel Hutz,"Mr. Simpson, this is the most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film ""The Neverending Story."""
10353,67,179,676000,Homer Simpson,The Law Office of Lionel Hutz,So you think I have a case?
10354,67,180,677000,Lionel Hutz,The Law Office of Lionel Hutz,"Homer, I don't use the word ""hero"" very often. But you are the greatest hero in American history."
10355,67,181,688000,Homer Simpson,The Law Office of Lionel Hutz,Woo hoo!
10357,67,183,688000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,I'm here to see my Grampa.
10358,67,184,688000,Old Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Here I am, sonny."
10359,67,185,690000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,You're not my Grampa.
10360,67,186,692000,Old Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Ah, c'mon, give me a chance. Hey, can your grandfather do this?"
10361,67,187,701000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Bart! Ah, you remembered my birthday."
10362,67,188,706000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Huh? Oh. I sure did!... Here's a bus schedule.
10363,67,189,711000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Wow! Fits right in my pocket!
10364,67,190,714000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Grampa, I need some advice. Did you ever have a crush on an older woman?"
10365,67,191,718000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"I had a crush on the oldest woman. One hundred and twenty years old, she was. Here's a picture of her delivering Eubie Blake."
10366,67,192,727000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,What happened?
10367,67,193,728000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"She fell in with that Guinness Book of Records crowd. Suddenly, she didn't have any time for me. I wore a 15 pound beard of bees for that woman, but it just wasn't enough."
10369,67,195,742000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I have some questions about women."
10370,67,196,745000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uhh... can't you see I'm reading the uh...
10371,67,197,745000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"..._______ calendar? Hmm... Ooh, Mostly Mozart is in town."
10372,67,198,751000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, Bart's at a very curious age. As his father, I think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know."
10373,67,199,761000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But Marge, I think he should learn about it the same way I did."
10374,67,200,764000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you sure...?
148067,67,201,768000,Young Homer,Simpson Home,Zookeeper! Zookeeper! Those two monkeys are killing each other!
148068,67,202,774000,Young Homer,Simpson Home,Oh.
10375,67,203,775000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe you're right. Now, if you'll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father."
10377,67,204,783000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... Oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! They smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You want to drink another woman!"
10378,67,205,811000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So I says, ""Yeah, if you want that money, come and find it 'cause I don't know where it is you baloney..."" You make me wanna retch..."
10379,67,206,819000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,How can I get her to notice me?
10380,67,207,833000,Laura Powers,Simpson Home,"Meet me at the treehouse, Bart. And come alone."
10382,67,209,847000,Laura Powers,Bart's Treehouse,Thanks for coming.
10383,67,210,848000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I please to aim.
10384,67,211,850000,Laura Powers,Bart's Treehouse,"I'm so happy, I just had to tell someone. I have a boyfriend."
10385,67,212,858000,Laura Powers,Bart's Treehouse,You won't be needing this.
10387,67,214,874000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,A boyfriend...
10388,67,215,876000,Laura Powers,Bart's Treehouse,"I really think you'd like him, Bart. His name's Jimbo."
10389,67,216,879000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Jimbo Jones?
10391,67,218,888000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, you've been flushing for twenty minutes. Is there a problem?"
10392,67,219,891000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh no, Principal Skinner."
10393,67,220,895000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Very well, I'll continue to wait."
10394,67,221,905000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,How can you like that guy?
10395,67,222,907000,Laura Powers,Springfield Elementary School,I don't know. Maybe 'cause he's an outlaw. You know that dead body they found behind the mayor's house?
10396,67,223,913000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Jimbo killed him?
10397,67,224,914000,Laura Powers,Springfield Elementary School,"No, but he poked him with a stick."
10398,67,225,917000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey Laura, Dr. Tongue has arrived."
10399,67,226,922000,Laura Powers,Springfield Elementary School,"That's him, Bart."
10400,67,227,924000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,Who's the dork?
10401,67,228,925000,Laura Powers,Springfield Elementary School,"Leave him alone, he's just a kid."
10402,67,229,929000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'll show them who's just a kid.
10403,67,230,931000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, it's your bedtime. I laid out your jammy-jams."
10376,67,233,940000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do?"
10406,67,234,945000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I married her!
10408,67,235,949000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, please I just had eggs."
10409,67,236,952000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good luck in your trumped-up law suit, Dad."
10410,67,237,955000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, that means a lot to me."
