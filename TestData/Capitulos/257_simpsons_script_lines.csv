64064,257,142,678000,Homer Simpson,Research Institute,But I've had thousands of head x-rays. How come no one ever noticed it before?
64065,257,143,682000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Research Institute,"Oh, I can answer that. You see, whenever I pick up an x-ray, I always hold it like this."
64066,257,144,688000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Research Institute,My thumb must've covered up the crayon every time. I'll show myself out.
64067,257,145,695000,Female Researcher,Research Institute,Do you have any idea how this might have happened?

64073,257,151,726000,Homer Simpson,Research Institute,"Hey, I came here to be drugged, electrocuted and probed, not insulted."
64074,257,152,730000,Female Researcher,Research Institute,We could remove the crayon for you. It could vastly increase your brain power... or it could possibly kill you.
64075,257,153,736000,Homer Simpson,Research Institute,"Hmmm. Increase my killing power, eh? Let's do it."
64077,257,155,745000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer, where have you been?"
