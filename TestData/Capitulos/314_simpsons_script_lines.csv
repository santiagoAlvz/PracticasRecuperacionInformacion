80678,314,98,415000,Swedish Scientist,Simpson Home,"Sir, I'm honored to inform you that you've won the Nobel Prize."
80679,314,99,419000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The Nobel Prize! Finally. So, uh it's for what, my whole deal?"
80680,314,100,426000,Swedish Scientist,Simpson Home,"This is Professor John Frink, isn't it?"
80681,314,101,428000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If I say no, do I still win?"
80682,314,102,430000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll tell Professor Frink he's won. Tack för att ni förärat vår stad.
80683,314,103,436000,Swedish Scientist,Simpson Home,Yumping Yiminy!
80685,314,105,436000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Great glayvin in a glass! The Nobel Prize. They must have awarded it to me for my invention of a hammer with a screwdriver on the other end. It's mildly convenient.
80686,314,106,447000,Lisa Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Just for that?
80687,314,107,448000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"It was a slow year, yes."
80688,314,108,451000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,I only wish my dear father were here to see me win.
80689,314,109,454000,Lisa Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Is there a problem with your father?
80690,314,110,455000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Well, our relationship was never great. Mother used to say we got along like positrons and anti-neutrinos. Oh yes! I'm a geek."
80691,314,111,466000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"I was always a disappointment to him. You see, he was one of those he-man scientists who worked on the atom bomb by day and slept with Marilyn Monroe by night and sold secrets to the Russians at lunch."
80692,314,112,479000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"The last time I saw him alive, he was going to study sharks."
80693,314,113,483000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"I don't want to go on this oceanographic expedition, Father. I get seasick taking a shower. Clean but nauseous."
80694,314,114,491000,Frink Senior,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Clean but nauseous with the rolling and the heaving and the you make me sick! You've disgraced the name of John Nerdlebaum Frink.
80695,314,115,500000,Young Professor Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"But father, I..."
80696,314,116,500000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,We never spoke again.
80697,314,117,508000,Lisa Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Well where is he now? Maybe I can help you two patch up your differences.
80698,314,118,512000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Uh, you'll need to patch up more than that."
80699,314,119,518000,Lisa Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Did a shark do that?
80700,314,120,520000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Yes, he was testing out a new blood-based suntan lotion."
80701,314,121,525000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"You know, now that I have my hammer-screwdriver I could reanimate him."
80702,314,122,525000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Without the needless switching of tools. Well, that's always tedious and annoying."
80704,314,124,546000,Frink Senior,Professor Frink's Lab,I'm alive! With the breathing and the tingling and the what's this radiator where my pupik should be?
80705,314,125,552000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,"Poppa, you're back! Now, we had to replace several vital organs with machinery, but that doesn't make you any less of a man. Except you have no penis. In the uh, traditional sense."
80706,314,126,565000,Frink Senior,Professor Frink's Lab,"So, what am I, some kind of a tin can man from Planet Tomorrow?"
80707,314,127,569000,Lisa Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,"Sir, your son has brought you into the twenty-first century. It's a lot like the twentieth, except everybody's afraid and the stock market is much lower."
80708,314,128,578000,Frink Senior,Professor Frink's Lab,"Polly don't like that cracker. I'm getting me a real spleen, and then I'm gonna vent it on you, boychik."
80709,314,129,584000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,"Ay, shoving"
80710,314,130,587000,Lisa Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,It almost sounded like he plans to tear organs out of living people!
80711,314,131,592000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,"Well, that's my dad -- you can't stop him."
80713,314,133,598000,Frink Senior,Springfield Town Square,"Hey, Seven Hundred Club. You look like a healthy specimen."
80714,314,134,602000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Town Square,"Well, I did finish first in the Walk For The Cure... of homosexuality."
80715,314,135,607000,Frink Senior,Springfield Town Square,"Say ah, baby."
80716,314,136,608000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Town Square,Ahhhh...
80718,314,138,611000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Town Square,"I'm dying! And there's Heaven. But who's that? Confucius? And Milton Berle? Boy, have I been barkin' up the wrong tree."
80720,314,140,626000,Frink Senior,Springfield Elementary School,Nice posture.
80721,314,141,627000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, thank you. Mother always said a curvy spine is the devil's roller coaster."
80722,314,142,632000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, you can't have that--"
80723,314,143,636000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lost your spine, huh? You just keep finding new ways to disappoint me."
80724,314,145,655000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,There you are.
80725,314,146,657000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,Have you stopped to think about who you're hurting with this rampage?
80726,314,147,660000,Frink Senior,Springfield Street,The people I've killed?
80727,314,148,661000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,"No -- your son! On the biggest day of his life, when he accepts the Nobel Prize, you're not gonna be there."
80728,314,149,667000,Frink Senior,Springfield Street,"Oh, dear God. I've let my organ lust come between me and my son."
80729,314,150,674000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,But it's not too late. You can still fly to Stockholm.
80730,314,151,677000,Frink Senior,Springfield Street,"Well, it'd better be first class. Comic Book Guy's ass won't fit in coach."
80731,314,152,682000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield Street,"You may keep my posterior... just please return the ""Jabba the Butt"" tattoo."
80735,314,156,695000,Announcer,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,He explored the behavior of individual molecules in a chemical reaction. She's the sexy star of Alias. Please welcome Nobel laureate Dr. Dudley Herschbach and Emmy Nominee Jennifer Garner.
80736,314,157,710000,Jennifer Garner,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,"You know, Dr. Herschbach, our jobs are actually not that different."
80737,314,158,714000,Dudley Herschbach,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,I disagree. Winner of the Nobel Prize in physics: Professor John Frink.
80738,314,159,721000,Professor Jonathan Frink,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,"Thank you. This is a tremendous honor, however I can't help being somewhat disheartened that my father has become a marauding ghoul..."
80739,314,160,731000,Frink Senior,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,"Not anymore, son."
80741,314,162,734000,Frink Senior,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,I'm here to accept the Nobel Prize -- for stupid. Can you forgive me?
80742,314,163,741000,Professor Jonathan Frink,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,"Good glayvin, Dad. You've made receiving the Nobel Prize the happiest day of my life."
80743,314,164,746000,Professor Jonathan Frink,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,"Oh, the hug is good."
80744,314,165,748000,Frink Senior,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,"This is what the Nobel prize is all about. The science and the love and that physics we call quantum. Ain't that right, people?"
80745,314,166,758000,Frink Senior,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,"What a great crowd. You all have such big hearts and such... big brains. With large juicy dripping with knowledge heads... that's it, I'm going smorgasbord on these Poindexters."
80747,314,168,776000,Bart Simpson,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,And I thought Halle Berry went nuts during her acceptance speech.
80748,314,169,779000,Homer Simpson,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,I wish I was Death again. That was cool.
80749,314,170,783000,Frink Senior,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,Every brain unlocks more secrets of the universe. Muffins are surprisingly high in calories! The pyramids were actually built by Sears!
80750,314,171,793000,Lisa Simpson,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,He's right! It all checks out!
80751,314,172,803000,Marge Simpson,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,This is more violent than the Hip Hop Awards. You've got to stop your father!
80752,314,173,808000,Professor Jonathan Frink,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,"Yes, but how?"
80753,314,174,809000,Professor Jonathan Frink,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,"He's sixty-three years old... pressure points here... and here... room temperature is twenty-two degrees Celsius... yes, this should just about do it."
80754,314,175,821000,Professor Jonathan Frink,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,"Oh father... you're dying again. But I can bring you back to life, sir."
80755,314,176,826000,Frink Senior,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,"Son, it doesn't take five brains in your head to know that's a bad idea."
80756,314,177,831000,Frink Senior,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,"You saw I'd become a monster and you stopped me like a man. I'm proud of you. And now it's time for me to go to Hell. Ow, oo, oo ow, oy... oy oo ow, dead."
80757,314,178,846000,Jennifer Garner,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,This is the most exciting Nobel Prize ceremony ever.
80758,314,179,849000,Dudley Herschbach,NOBEL PRIZE AUDITORIUM,I disagree.
80760,314,181,853000,Lisa Simpson,RECEPTION HALL,It must be tough to win the Nobel Prize and lose your father on the same day.
80761,314,182,859000,Professor Jonathan Frink,RECEPTION HALL,"Oh, I didn't really lose my father. Thanks to my latest invention, the soul catcher. Let's bring it out and look at it."
80762,314,183,866000,Frink Senior,RECEPTION HALL,"I may be a soul, but I'm hungry. Can you throw in a little matzoh? Maybe a nice piece of fish."
80763,314,184,872000,Professor Jonathan Frink,RECEPTION HALL,"Why of course, father. Allow me to satisfy your Hebraic desires."
80764,314,185,876000,Frink Senior,RECEPTION HALL,That's a good shmendeleh.
80765,314,186,878000,Professor Jonathan Frink,RECEPTION HALL,"Oh, I've waited so long to hear you say that. What does it mean? Is it dirty?"
80767,314,188,888000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh baby! Did I find something to throw out today! If you like space in the attic, are you gonna be happy!"
80768,314,189,897000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Cool! Comics from the seventies!
