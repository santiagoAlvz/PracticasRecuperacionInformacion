143853,554,3,57000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it wasn't easy, but we managed to watch every testicle fail video on the internet."
143854,554,4,62000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Now to leave a great comment. ""LOL... that's... got-ta... hurt."""
143855,554,5,68000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I guess there's nothing left to do but go outside and play. Wait, a sponsored link!"
143856,554,6,94000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Well, they did everything they could to stop us, but we hacked through anyway."
143857,554,7,99000,Narrator,Simpson Home,They thought the party was over.
143858,554,8,102000,CEELO GREEN-TYPE,Simpson Home,After party!
143860,554,10,116000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Brief nudityyy!
143861,554,11,125000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers.
143862,554,12,129000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know what that stuff blocks.
143864,554,14,130000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Mammogram appointment.
143866,554,16,134000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I told you to clean your room and instead you're watching chest videos! Look at all those bowls of half-eaten cereal!
143867,554,17,142000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The cereal on the bottom gets soggy.
143868,554,18,144000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I know how cereal works. Now clean your room.
143869,554,19,147000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why should I? It's just gonna get dirty again.
143870,554,20,150000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm in charge. You do what I say.
143871,554,21,152000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll get to it when I get to it.
143872,554,22,155000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That better not mean what it means when I say it.
143875,554,25,167000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe you two are more similar than you'd like to admit.
143876,554,26,169000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We're not similar. I love being told what to do by someone who's wise in the ways of the world! Love it!
143877,554,27,176000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here's what I would do... in the middle of the night, clean Bart's room for him, then in the morning thank him for cleaning his room."
143880,554,28,183000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You poor woman. Dealing with Bart has turned your mind to ketchup water. You rest. I'll be the boy's father now.
143882,554,30,198000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, I'm not feelin' it."
143883,554,31,202000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why do I need to eat broccoli?
143884,554,32,211000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, I'll drink another glass of milk."
143885,554,33,215000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Milk. That's for babies and old guys who can't sleep at night because of what they did in the war. Broccoli.
143886,554,34,223000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh it!
143887,554,35,228000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli. And I'm going to sit right here until you do.
143888,554,36,235000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Pfft. You'll never out-sit me.
143889,554,37,246000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The sit is on.
143890,554,38,253000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Eat your broccoli.
143891,554,39,254000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
143892,554,40,255000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Eat your broccoli.
143893,554,41,261000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
143896,554,44,263000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,They've been at it all night.
143897,554,45,265000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know, but they're not gonna waste a whole Saturday inside."
143898,554,46,275000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Today's our draft! I've got to pick a good fantasy team! When I lost last year they made me do something so humiliating...
143899,554,47,284000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Jebus loves Tebow.
143900,554,48,287000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"And so... the fat man caves. If you need me, I'll be up in my room eating cereal. Half a bowl of cereal."
143901,554,49,297000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I want you, my wife, to draft my fantasy football team."
143903,554,51,303000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I-- I don't really know that much about--
143906,554,54,331000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,I've never seen moves like that!
143907,554,55,333000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Simpson Home,And never will again!
143909,554,57,345000,Martin Prince,Evergreen Terrace,"Today, I wear the vest. Haw. Haw."
143911,554,59,352000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Now I am never eating that broccoli.
143913,554,61,378000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This has got to stop! If you don't go to work you're going to get fired!
143915,554,62,382000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I can get another job! Who wouldn't want to hire a man who won't back down? I could be a prison warden or a southern anything.
143916,554,63,389000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I've got an idea... but I'll need that broccoli.
143917,554,64,394000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"These two fruit smoothies look and taste exactly the same. One of them, however, has the broccoli blended in."
143918,554,65,401000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it -- maybe he had the broccoli, maybe he didn't. No one knows, so neither of you has given in, and this horrible impasse can come to an end."
143919,554,66,411000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, works for me."
143920,554,67,413000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm in.
143921,554,68,414000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, thank God."
143922,554,69,422000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh no, the broccoli!"
143923,554,70,424000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You did that on purpose! You lick this table clean!
143924,554,71,429000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Come on. Lick it!
143925,554,72,429000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, lick it!"
143927,554,74,429000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You can still lick it!
143928,554,75,436000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm afraid Homer and Bart's problems are beyond our power to solve.
143929,554,76,441000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,There's only one thing left to try.
143936,554,83,476000,Bart Simpson,OPEN SEAS,Where are we?
143937,554,84,477000,Homer Simpson,OPEN SEAS,I don't know. Eat your broccoli.
143938,554,85,479000,Bart Simpson,OPEN SEAS,No.
143941,554,88,488000,Homer Simpson,SHIP'S DECK,We're on an old-time boat!
143942,554,89,490000,Bart Simpson,SHIP'S DECK,We've been kidnapped!
143943,554,90,492000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,SHIP'S DECK,"Not kidnapped, shanghaied!"
143945,554,92,517000,Homer Simpson,SHIP'S DECK,Relation Ship. It works two ways. Pretty good. Pret-ty good.
143946,554,93,525000,Bart Simpson,SHIP'S DECK,"Hey lame ass. Thanks to you, we're stuck on a stupid therapy boat."
143947,554,94,529000,Homer Simpson,SHIP'S DECK,I'm the lame ass? The only lame ass on this boat is you and all the other lame asses.
143949,554,96,538000,Ned Flanders,SHIP'S DECK,Should we do something?
143847,554,97,540000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,SHIP'S DECK,We are doing something -- we're empathizing.
143951,554,99,546000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, I'm getting a message from your father's fantasy football league. I must still be logged in as him."
143952,554,100,559000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Lenny used the uck-word!
143953,554,101,561000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, it's trash talk. You know how guys say mean things to their friends, the way women say nice things to their enemies."
143954,554,102,569000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Ohh.
143955,554,103,569000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Yikes!
143956,554,104,579000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well I don't like this trash talk. And I'm gonna do something about it. Even if I have to bring in the big guns.
143958,554,106,587000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Dear Lord, please help Homer's friends understand that make-believe computer football is no excuse for using the internet to be mean."
143959,554,107,611000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,It's everywhere.
143960,554,108,614000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"And now, a moment of silence for the victims of the Shelbyville sinkhole..."
143961,554,109,623000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,The Wi-Fi! The Wi-Fi! I've got to take out the Wi-Fi!
143962,554,110,632000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,She's under a lot of stress. Her husband's at sea.
143964,554,112,647000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,"WHO WANTS TO SING ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS? / WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST AND SING ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS? / I'LL GO FIRST AND SING ABOUT MY FEELINGS / I'M SO HAPPY TO BE SINGING... Now, Homer!"
143965,554,113,662000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,"So, Cletus... Gitmo. What brings you fellas to The Relation Ship?"
143966,554,114,673000,GITMO,Ship,Why won't you let me fail?!
143967,554,115,676000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,"What about you, Bart... Homer? Homer?"
143968,554,116,701000,Bart Simpson,Ship,What does that mean?
143969,554,117,703000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,"Mainly climbing. Except for Wednesday night, when we project a movie on the sails. But really, a lot of climbing."
143971,554,119,744000,Bart Simpson,THE RELATION SHIP,"Sheep shank, bowline, clove hitch..."
143972,554,120,748000,Bart Simpson,THE RELATION SHIP,"Dad, look! I did a round turn with two half hitches."
143973,554,121,754000,Homer Simpson,THE RELATION SHIP,"Wait a minute... windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands. You're enjoying this, aren't you?"
143974,554,122,760000,Bart Simpson,THE RELATION SHIP,So what if I am?
143975,554,123,760000,Homer Simpson,THE RELATION SHIP,You're my son and you will hate what I hate. Angled parking. Lemons. Kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money. And this boat!
143976,554,124,770000,Bart Simpson,THE RELATION SHIP,I'm old enough to choose my own things to hate. And the things I like! And I like being a sailor.
143977,554,125,776000,Homer Simpson,THE RELATION SHIP,Betrayed by my worst enemy. I never would have seen it coming.
143978,554,126,780000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,THE RELATION SHIP,"Why, Bart! That's a perfect halyard cleat!"
143979,554,127,784000,Bart Simpson,THE RELATION SHIP,"Just like you taught me, Captain. Over, under, over, under, over, under, under, under, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, under, over, half hitch."
143980,554,128,791000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,THE RELATION SHIP,"Well, the standard form is under, over, under, over, under, under, under, under, under, over, over, under, under, under, around, over, over, under..."
143982,554,130,798000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,"Fathers, sons... together we've made a lot of progress on this voyage."
143983,554,131,803000,Ned Flanders,Ship,"I learned that left is called ""port""!"
143984,554,132,803000,Homer Simpson,Ship,I finally got over my sea sickness.
143985,554,133,809000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,"That's right, Mr. Midshipman."
143987,554,135,838000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,"I'm sorry we had to discipline you. On the positive side, you won't miss out on the father/son hornpipe dance."
143988,554,136,849000,Homer Simpson,Ship,I hate the Golden Age of Sail.
143991,554,139,861000,Cletus Spuckler,Ship,Officer on deck!
143992,554,140,870000,Cletus Spuckler,Ship,I'm in charge. You do what I say.
143993,554,141,872000,Homer Simpson,Ship,"Fine. I'll swab whatever you say. Look, I'm swabbing the deck. I'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of. Oh! I'm swabbing the top of the ocean."
143994,554,142,884000,Homer Simpson,Ship,"Ooo! Swab, swab, swab--"
143995,554,143,886000,Homer Simpson,Ship,What the?
143997,554,145,889000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Fantasy football has turned every man in this town into a trash-talking monster!
143998,554,146,894000,Bumblebee Man,Springfield Town Square,Mas cowbell!
143999,554,147,906000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield Town Square,There's only one thing that will shut these guys up. You gotta beat one of them at fantasy football.
144000,554,148,915000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Then that's what I'm gonna do.
144003,554,151,947000,Wife,Simpson Living Room,That doesn't match my phone!
144004,554,152,950000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Lakwando's mind won't be on the game. Aaaand benched.
144005,554,153,955000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,And now to make my big move.
144006,554,154,961000,NFL NARRATOR,Simpson Living Room,There would be no funeral.
144009,554,157,966000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,An eighty-five yard field goal? You gotta be kidding me! Refresh! Refresh!
144011,554,159,982000,NFL NARRATOR,Moe's Tavern,"...despite her breathtaking ignorance and a powerful dislike of the sport, a rookie housewife had been defeated by a savvy veteran..."
144014,554,162,1002000,NFL NARRATOR,Ship,Ahoy Midshipman. I hope your voyage on The Relation Ship is proving interpersonally fruitful.
144015,554,163,1009000,NFL NARRATOR,Ship,I don't know. It's really hard when someone doesn't respect your authority.
144016,554,164,1013000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,Epiphany ho. And I'm sure your father has been doing some growing and learning of his own.
144018,554,166,1029000,Bart Simpson,CREW'S QUARTERS,Yi-yo-yu!
144020,554,168,1049000,Homer Simpson,Ship,"I love this boat, with all its pullies and flappies and... everything has a name."
144021,554,169,1058000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,"You know what, Homer? I always wanted to eat a parrot. What's the big deal? It's just like a green chicken."
144022,554,170,1064000,Homer Simpson,Ship,Yeah...
144023,554,171,1068000,NFL NARRATOR,Ship,"But fortune did not favor The Relation Ship, as the same winds that lofted Marge's fantasy field goals to victory now sent gales of doom toward this vessel of questionable therapeutic value."
144024,554,172,1082000,Rod Flanders,Ship,Why is the Captain just juggling?
144025,554,173,1089000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,"Okay, okay. I can do this. I can do this. Someone count me in!"
144026,554,174,1095000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,I said count me in!
144027,554,175,1097000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Ship,"Don't worry, I'll radio the coast guard for help."
144028,554,176,1100000,Ned Flanders,Ship,The therapy bears! Look out for the therapy bears!
144029,554,177,1110000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,I'm a-comin' bears!
144030,554,178,1133000,Bart Simpson,Ship,Now I'm the ship's highest ranking officer. It's up to me to get us to shore.
144033,554,181,1141000,Bart Simpson,Ship,Dad! We can make it to harbor if we can just sail around that lighthouse!
144034,554,182,1145000,Homer Simpson,Ship,Are you crazy? We'll never make it! Drop the anchor and wait out the storm!
144035,554,183,1150000,Bart Simpson,Ship,"No, we need to sail!"
144036,554,184,1152000,Homer Simpson,Ship,I'm dropping the anchor!
144037,554,185,1153000,Bart Simpson,Ship,Can't you just do what I say?!
144038,554,186,1155000,Homer Simpson,Ship,You've never done what I say! Ever!
143950,554,188,1168000,Bart Simpson,Ship,Now can we respect each other?
143673,554,189,1172000,Homer Simpson,Ship,"Yes, son. We can."
144040,554,190,1175000,Homer Simpson,Ship,"Awaiting your orders, Mr. Midshipman!"
144041,554,191,1179000,Bart Simpson,Ship,Put up the storm jib and haul in the main sheet!
144042,554,192,1181000,Homer Simpson,Ship,"Aye-aye, sir."
144043,554,193,1184000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Ship,Another success story for The Relation Ship.
144046,554,196,1205000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Harbor,"So, did your sailing adventure help you work out your issues?"
144047,554,197,1209000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Harbor,Does this answer your question?
144048,554,198,1217000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Springfield Harbor,"Yar. Quite a hornpipe thar be. But, eh, surely you would never have gone on a sea adventure without your old friend, The Sea Captain."
144049,554,199,1229000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Springfield Harbor,Yar. That's gonna hurt for a long time. Yar.
144050,554,200,1254000,CAPTAIN BOWDITCH,Springfield Harbor,MY NAME IS JOSEPH BOWDITCH FROM A SEAPORT KNOWN AS MYSTIC / I SAIL AT DAWN BOUND FOR CAPE HORN AND COUNSELING HOLISTIC / WE'LL WORK YOUR CONFLICTS OUT THROUGH SAILING'S THERAPEUTIC POWERS / THE FRESH WATER IS LIMITED SO PLEASE COMBINE YOUR SHOWERS
