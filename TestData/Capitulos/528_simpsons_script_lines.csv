137261,528,5,145000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Well, I am gonna write a note back to Mr. Muntz."
137262,528,6,150000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Sorry about that. So, Mrs. Simpson, the reason you're here..."
137263,528,7,153000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,Let me guess... you need a field trip mom?
137264,528,8,157000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,A library volunteer? Someone to Purell the CPR dummy?
137265,528,9,161000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Resusci-Kate is just fine, thank you."
137268,528,12,165000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,We're here to talk about Bart.
137269,528,13,167000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,What did he do now?

137271,528,15,173000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,What did he do in the future?
137272,528,16,176000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"I'm not sure what he's planning, although there is a lot of internet chatter. I want to change his character: less Dennis the Menace, more Casper the Ghost, if he were still alive."
137273,528,17,185000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,What if Bart took music lessons? Music lessons could channel his destructive impulses into artistic expression. I myself have been taking flamenco lessons.
137274,528,18,200000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Got it, music lessons!"
137276,528,20,214000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Mother!!!

137288,528,32,260000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,TV's gotten so lousy.
137289,528,33,263000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Did you ever wonder if hippopotamuses think that rhinos are unicorns?
137290,528,34,267000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,TV's not so bad.
137291,528,35,270000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Sweetie... did you ever think of doing something a little more creative with your time?
137292,528,36,275000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,If you're worried about your Mother's Day present it's in the works.
137295,528,39,282000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,I was thinking something more artistic. Something musical. You could take advantage of a fantastic musician living right here!
137296,528,40,297000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,That's the kind of riff you can aim for after years of practice. We start off with the fun stuff: music theory.
137297,528,41,306000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Don't worry, music theory's just a fancy word for music math."
137299,528,43,312000,Sideshow Mel,Sideshow Mel's Dressing Room,"My dear boy, you undoubtedly think of the slide whistle as merely a whistle that slides. Let me disabuse you of that misperception."

137310,528,56,362000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Is it that obvious?
137311,528,57,363000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh yes. The only thing that screams ""I am hiding hairlessness"" more is a goatee."
137312,528,58,369000,"Nedward Flanders, Sr.",Kwik-E-Mart,I'm as smooth as jazz.
137313,528,59,376000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,My wife has never seen my head naked. Maybe I should wear a cowboy hat.
137314,528,60,381000,The Rich Texan,Kwik-E-Mart,"A cowboy hat means ""I'm ashamed of my small penis."""
137315,528,61,381000,The Rich Texan,Kwik-E-Mart,Don't even ask me what this means!

137327,528,74,447000,Marge Simpson,RUSSIAN LIVING ROOM,"So, how much are lessons?"
137328,528,75,449000,Slava,RUSSIAN LIVING ROOM,"I give you something you want, you give me something I want. I'm sorry, did my voice go all evil? It is common with Russian accent."
137329,528,76,459000,Marge Simpson,RUSSIAN LIVING ROOM,You'd better be asking for something P.C.: pie or cake.
137330,528,77,463000,Slava,RUSSIAN LIVING ROOM,"Here is my offer: my daughter give lessons, you teach me to drive car."
137331,528,78,467000,Marge Simpson,RUSSIAN LIVING ROOM,There might be some nagging involved.
137332,528,79,469000,Slava,RUSSIAN LIVING ROOM,Deal! Now we toast with vodka!

137344,528,89,515000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Dear Lord. Here. You need this more than I do.
137345,528,90,525000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Just what exactly is this good for?
137347,528,92,531000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,It's nice when something you plan in your head for so long comes to fruition.
137348,528,93,538000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"Where you goin', Bart?"

137387,528,134,678000,Slava,Marge's Car,"I'm sorry, Officer. I believe my license is... ...somewhere in these pairs of easy-fit blue jeans. Eh? Eh?"
137388,528,135,687000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,That's not the way American police do things!
137389,528,136,690000,Chief Wiggum,Marge's Car,Finally. Someone who knows what a traffic stop is really all about.
137390,528,137,695000,Lou,Marge's Car,"Uh, Chief, don't you think those jeans are a little tight?"
137391,528,138,698000,Chief Wiggum,Marge's Car,"We're all not high-waisted like you, Lou, okay?"
137392,528,139,702000,Chief Wiggum,Marge's Car,I'm gonna... lie down in the back seat here.

137407,528,154,785000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Thank you. I owe it all to Zhenya.
137409,528,155,788000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Can you teach my boys? But no tickling the ivories. You treat them with respect.
137410,528,156,793000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Elementary School,Can you teach my monkey? Then I can deal with the Musician's Union instead of the Humane Society. Much easier to muscle.
137411,528,157,801000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Zhenya, I couldn't have done it without you. And you."
137412,528,158,807000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Bart!
137413,528,159,809000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, I've never been so proud of you. Never, never, never!"
137414,528,160,815000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,And now I'll always be at home in a saloon!
137415,528,161,818000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Something smells fishy.
137416,528,162,820000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Springfield Elementary School,"Yarrr, that would be me. But I agree. There's something funny here."

137426,528,172,843000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, you already landed a hot wife. That's the only reason men evolved hair."
137427,528,173,847000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What are you talking about?
137428,528,174,848000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You lured Marge in with your hair. You trapped her with marriage. You skinned and field-gutted her by having kids. Now she's mounted on your wall for good, with fake glass eyes and a rubber tongue."
137429,528,175,858000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"The way you put it, it sounds so perfect, but it's not."
137430,528,176,862000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You sound seriously depressed. Why don't we talk about it over at Moe's?
137431,528,177,866000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It's not even noon.
137432,528,178,867000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, I've got a watch, egghead!"
137433,528,179,870000,Vigorous Older Man,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I couldn't help overhearing your predicament. Mainly because my hearing is so great.
137434,528,180,875000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Who are you?
137435,528,181,876000,Vigorous Older Man,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,The answer to your prayers.
137437,528,182,878000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Are you my guardian angel? If so, can you turn a pumpkin into a chariot? Even a used Camry would be okay."
137438,528,183,885000,Vigorous Older Man,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, just a regular hairless Joe like you. Been bald since I was twenty-three. With the money I've saved I bought a yacht."
137439,528,184,894000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You're cool with it? I haven't even told my wife.
137440,528,185,897000,Vigorous Older Man,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You wait for the right moment, you show her that glorious dome, and then you rest it sweetly on her bosom and let the kisses flow like rain."
137441,528,186,907000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Wow, is that what your wife did?"
137442,528,187,909000,Vigorous Older Man,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No wife. I just slept with thousands of bald women.
137444,528,189,919000,Helen Lovejoy,Try-N-Save,"Caught your recital, Bart. Lisa, isn't it great to have a musical genius in the family?"
137445,528,190,925000,Marge Simpson,Try-N-Save,"Helen Lovejoy, you always have to stir the pot."
137446,528,191,929000,Helen Lovejoy,Try-N-Save,Unlike you when you make your lumpy clam chowder.
137447,528,192,931000,Lisa Simpson,Try-N-Save,"I guess Bart must be a musical genius, because frauds are always found out. Always."
137448,528,193,947000,Helen Lovejoy,Try-N-Save,My work is done! Now to reward myself with a case of wine.
137450,528,195,955000,Bart Simpson,RUSSIAN HOUSE,"Hi Zhenya, I'm here for my lesson."

137453,528,198,961000,Zhenya,RUSSIAN HOUSE,"Because of your performance, I win many new students."
137454,528,199,967000,Nelson Muntz,RUSSIAN HOUSE,C'mon. I gotta learn my mom's stripper music by midnight!
137455,528,200,970000,Bart Simpson,RUSSIAN HOUSE,"If I got you all these students, shouldn't you be grateful?"
137456,528,201,973000,Zhenya,RUSSIAN HOUSE,Of course I'm grateful. Here is cushion for porch chair.
137457,528,202,980000,Zhenya,RUSSIAN HOUSE,"Go to ""bata boom."""
137459,528,204,980000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Mopped myself into a corner...
137462,528,207,993000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, you'd still be proud of me if I couldn't play piano, right?"
137463,528,208,997000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of course. But very, very, very angry at all the time I wasted."
137465,528,210,1005000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Gulp?! Was that a gulp? Are you getting a sore throat? Let me give you some castor oil.
137436,528,212,1015000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You'll need your voice to say ""thanks, Mom"" after your next recital!"
136333,528,213,1019000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,My wha?

137467,528,215,1025000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, I'm almost eleven, it's not really fair."
137468,528,216,1028000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, when you were on that stage, it felt like you were pouring those notes right into my heart."
