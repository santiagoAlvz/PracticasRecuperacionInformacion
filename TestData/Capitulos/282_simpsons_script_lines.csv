71546,282,28,122000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,What's got into you punks?
71547,282,29,124000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,The home told us you were dead.
71548,282,30,126000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Me? I ain't dead. It was Stimson down the hall. So much for Mister ""I can button my own shirt."""

71564,282,46,189000,Zack,Springfield Retirement Castle,Who wants to go get some sweet corn in my minivan?
71565,282,47,193000,Zack,Springfield Retirement Castle,It's got a wheelchair lift.
71567,282,49,198000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,"If you can drive, they're all over ya."

71584,282,66,251000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you're no angel behind the wheel. What about your D.U.I.?"
71585,282,67,255000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That was a D.W.I.
71586,282,68,258000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Give Grampa a chance. Statistics show that old people drive at least as well as sleep-deprived apes.
71587,282,69,263000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Please, son. Driving is my last chance to feel alive."
71588,282,70,268000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you brought me into this world, so no."

71606,282,88,321000,Chief Wiggum,CLASSROOM,"You know, it's kind of ironic. These old people are being kept alive by the organs of the young people they ran over."
71607,282,89,327000,Lou,CLASSROOM,"Makes you think, eh Chief?"
71608,282,90,328000,Chief Wiggum,CLASSROOM,Not really.

71615,282,97,344000,Patty Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,I'll give you your license if you never do that again.
71616,282,98,348000,Grampa Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,Everything's the last time I do everything.
71617,282,99,351000,Grampa Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,Can't you just use this recent photo?
71618,282,100,355000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Eh, all right."

71623,282,105,377000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"What's the scoop, milkshakes?"
71624,282,106,380000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I got me a date with Zelda, so I need the car."
71625,282,107,383000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, no. I'm not giving you my car. You'll probably drive it."
71626,282,108,388000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't trust your old man? You ungrateful milkshake.
71627,282,109,392000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't we double date? Then the restaurant will have to give us that booth.
71628,282,110,396000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, a booth. If I'm tired, I can just lie down!"
71631,282,113,405000,Grampa Simpson,Car,Cut it out. I can work the brakes myself.
71632,282,114,410000,Homer Simpson,Car,No you can't.
71633,282,115,411000,Homer Simpson,Car,"You're slow to react, Dad."
71634,282,116,415000,Grampa Simpson,Car,Baloney.

71642,282,124,433000,Homer Simpson,DRIVE-IN THEATER,"Hey, watch the movie."
71643,282,125,437000,Grampa Simpson,DRIVE-IN THEATER,"Movies were better in our day. For a nickel you got two movies, a cartoon, a bag of popcorn, and a whuppin'. Kept your mind on your business."
71645,282,127,448000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Hop in, beautiful."
71649,282,130,461000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Now, there's a few things I wanna say to you, Zelda."
71650,282,131,465000,Zelda,Simpson Car,Save your breath. Seriously.
71651,282,132,467000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Well, I gotta do something before the Viagra kicks in. I know, I'll suck my teeth. Whoa, here we go."
71653,282,134,488000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Give me those keys. Do you have any idea what you put us through? I called the police, the hospital, my bookie, the kennel... Okay, this isn't about who I called."
71654,282,135,498000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"See you later, I'm going to the library."
71655,282,136,500000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa gets to do what she wants and you don't yell at her.
71656,282,137,504000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I've earned their trust."
71657,282,138,507000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, everybody trusts Lisa. Precious little Lisa, apple of her Daddy's eye."
71658,282,139,513000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa doesn't borrow my car and stay out all night with some... hoochie.
71659,282,140,518000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,She's no hoochie. Her name is Zelda and she understands me.
71660,282,141,522000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Grampa, I gotta tell ya, she's a stone-cold hoochie."
71661,282,142,526000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Straight up, Marge. That hoochie only likes you because you can drive."
71662,282,143,529000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Shut up! You don't know her! Zelda loves me! I HATE THIS HOUSE!
71663,282,144,543000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Turn that down! You call that music? I-- I just don't know what to do.
71664,282,145,549000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He used to be such an angel. Maybe you should give him another chance.
71665,282,146,553000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, he's gotta learn, Marge. The way my dad made me learn."
71666,282,147,557000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He is your dad.
71667,282,148,560000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Cosmic.
71669,282,150,564000,Jasper Beardly,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey, Abe, what are you doing here?"
71670,282,151,566000,Old Jewish Man,Kwik-E-Mart,We heard you lost your driving privileges.
71671,282,152,568000,Grampa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well for your information, I can still drive to the store. But I have to be back in five minutes with these things for the baby."
71672,282,153,577000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, gentlemen! The new scratch-and-win tickets are out today."
71673,282,154,581000,Grampa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"I'll take one, Achoo."
71674,282,155,583000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Not ""Choo,"" ""Pu."""
71675,282,156,583000,Old Jewish Man,Kwik-E-Mart,I got trouble with both.
71676,282,157,588000,Grampa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Finally, the shakes are workin' for me!"
71677,282,158,592000,DISTINGUISHED VOICE,Kwik-E-Mart,"Pardon me, sir..."
71678,282,159,594000,HISPANIC GENTLEMAN,Kwik-E-Mart,"Your scrapings have landed on my jacket from Planet Hollywood, Orlando."
71679,282,160,597000,Grampa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,So what if it did?
71680,282,161,599000,Sidekick,Kwik-E-Mart,"So, it is very thoughtless."
71681,282,162,601000,Sidekick,Kwik-E-Mart,I should cut you like I cut sodium out of my diet.
71682,282,163,604000,Grampa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,You don't scare me with your dignity and your subtle cologne.
71683,282,164,609000,HISPANIC GENTLEMAN,Kwik-E-Mart,"Then perhaps you should be taught a lesson by us, Los Souvenir Jacquitos."
71684,282,165,616000,Jasper Beardly,Kwik-E-Mart,Bring it on.
71685,282,166,619000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Please gentlemen, violence is not the answer."
71686,282,167,621000,HISPANIC GENTLEMAN,Kwik-E-Mart,Then what is?
71687,282,168,623000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Some sort of death race? That's what I would do.
71688,282,169,625000,Sidekick,Kwik-E-Mart,"Very well, viejo. You shall have your death race."
71689,282,170,632000,Grampa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Death race?
71690,282,171,633000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,And another thing: no death races!
71691,282,172,636000,Grampa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Aw, I better not."
71692,282,173,638000,HISPANIC GENTLEMAN,Kwik-E-Mart,"Cheek-a, cheek-a, cheek-a..."
71693,282,174,640000,Old Jewish Man,Kwik-E-Mart,"Cheek-a, cheek-a, cheek-a..."
71694,282,175,641000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Cheek-a, cheek-a, cheek-a..."
71695,282,176,642000,Grampa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Fine. I'll meet you at the abandoned aqueduct!
71696,282,177,646000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,For the death race!
71697,282,178,648000,Grampa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Yes, the death race."
71699,282,180,650000,Snake Jailbird,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,"All right, seniors and señors. Whichever car makes it through that tunnel first is the winner."
71700,282,181,658000,Grampa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,But it's only big enough for one car.
71701,282,182,660000,HISPANIC GENTLEMAN,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,"What are you scared of, old man?"
71702,282,183,662000,Grampa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,"Everything. Dogs, Dutchmen, the gathering darkness..."
71703,282,184,667000,Snake Jailbird,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,"All right, when I yank down my girlfriend's tube top, the race will begin."
71704,282,185,673000,Snake Jailbird,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,What? I'm just trying to bring you into my world. Just go.
71705,282,186,686000,Sidekick,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,Aieee! Zapata del Diablo!

71707,282,188,698000,Sidekick,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,"Old friend, your jacket, she burns!"
71708,282,189,701000,HISPANIC GENTLEMAN,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,Then I burn with her. For I would rather die than have people not know what stores I have been to.
71709,282,190,710000,Grampa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,Woo hoo! We're the baddest punks in our age bracket!
71711,282,192,731000,Jasper Beardly,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,My beard! I broke my beard!
71712,282,193,735000,Grampa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD RIVER,Oh my God! We can't let Homer know!
