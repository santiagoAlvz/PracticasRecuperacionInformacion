53652,224,2,107000,Appraiser,Simpson Home,"This gentleman's beer tap dates back to the turn of the century, and remarkably, seems to have never been washed."
53653,224,3,113000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Yeah, yeah, I been meanin' to wash that, but, uh, you know, it's been such a century..."
53654,224,4,117000,Appraiser,Simpson Home,"At auction, I'd expect this to bring twenty to thirty thousand dollars..."
53655,224,5,121000,Appraiser,Simpson Home,"Except that on the handle somebody's carved ""HOMER ROCKS."""
53657,224,7,121000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,And I do! Woo!

53660,224,10,134000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I don't know how you can all just lay around the house on a nice day like this. When was the last time we went for a good old-fashioned family walk?
53661,224,11,142000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, we stopped those when the kids said I was too fat to carry."
53662,224,12,146000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, come on, let's go for a walk! This family's getting so lazy."
53663,224,13,151000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"I'm not lazy, I'm just um, uhh... Lisa, finish my sentence for me."
53664,224,14,158000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Why don't you finish your own darn...
53665,224,15,162000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Fine. If we're not going for a walk, we'll just talk about our day. I wrote another poem about a duck."
53667,224,17,169000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Can't we go home yet? My feet hurt. All this fresh air is making my hair move. And I don't know how much longer I can complain.
53668,224,18,180000,Barney Gumble,Evergreen Terrace,Get a horse!
53669,224,19,182000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Could we, Marge? Could we get a horse?"
53670,224,20,184000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"We're walking, Homer."
53671,224,21,185000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,There are some dogs. We could all ride dogs.
53672,224,22,188000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Forget it. Nobody's riding any...
53673,224,23,189000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Hi-yo Silver, away!"
53675,224,25,195000,Marge Simpson,Street,"Oh, look! There's the store where I buy my yarn. But you don't want to buy your buttons there."
53676,224,26,202000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Pew, well, I dodged a bullet."
53677,224,27,203000,Marge Simpson,Street,Now there's the place you want to buy your buttons.
53679,224,28,207000,Marge Simpson,Street,And that's where the bookmobile lady used to live!
53680,224,29,210000,Bart Simpson,Street,"If you love me, you'll kill me."
53681,224,30,212000,Lisa Simpson,Street,"Hey, Mom, look!"

53683,224,32,220000,Lisa Simpson,Street,Why can't we see it now?
53684,224,33,221000,Marge Simpson,Street,"Well, it's not really on our walking route..."
53687,224,36,230000,Marge Simpson,Store,Where'd you get that champagne?
53688,224,37,232000,Homer Simpson,Store,Clown.
53689,224,38,235000,Homer Simpson,Store,"Thanks, Noodles."
53690,224,39,236000,Marge Simpson,Store,All this commotion just for a store?
53691,224,40,239000,Homer Simpson,Store,"Hey, it's not just a store. It's a ""mega"" store. ""Mega"" means ""good."" And ""store"" means ""thing."""
53693,224,42,242000,Homer Simpson,Megastore,"Wow, what a high-tech wonderland. Oop, got an itch."
53694,224,43,261000,Everyone In Store,Megastore,Ew!

53697,224,46,269000,Nelson Muntz,Megastore,I'm doing all my thieving here!
53698,224,47,271000,Marge Simpson,Megastore,This is so much nicer than the Kwik-E-Mart.
53699,224,48,275000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Megastore,Oh.
53700,224,49,277000,Marge Simpson,Megastore,"Oh, I'm sorry, but... oh, it really is."
53701,224,50,280000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Megastore,"Yes, I know, but... still."
53702,224,51,285000,Bart Simpson,Megastore,"Hey, Dad, gimme fifty bucks. I gotta buy some things. Uh, better make it a hundred."
53704,224,53,289000,Lisa Simpson,Megastore,"Yeah, me too."
53706,224,55,290000,Marge Simpson,Megastore,Homer! Don't you think you're spoiling...
53708,224,57,297000,Otto Mann,Megastore,"New music? Man, all these bands are just rippin' off Judas Priest!"
53709,224,58,305000,Lisa Simpson,Megastore,"Ooh, I hear this really sucks. Hm, ""Director's Commentary""."
53710,224,59,307000,Kevin Costner,Megastore,"I'm sorry. I am really sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. But, uh, ""Field of Dreams"" was good, wasn't it? Made us all believe again..."
53711,224,60,318000,Lisa Simpson,Megastore,"Ohh, poor Mr. Costner. He tries so hard."
53712,224,61,322000,Kevin Costner,Megastore,"Aw, thanks. You're sweet to say that."
53713,224,62,324000,Lisa Simpson,Megastore,Uh... Where are you?

53719,224,69,348000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Car,"Step lively, Smithers. That orphanage won't demolish itself!"
53720,224,70,353000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Car,"Sir, ah, although I do enjoy your loud, excessive honking, it doesn't seem to be moving the crowd."
53721,224,71,358000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Car,Deploy the cow catcher.
53723,224,73,368000,Comic Book Guy,Burns's Car,Once again my underwear has become tangled on a cow catcher. Ooo.
53724,224,74,372000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Car,"Oh, tarnation! I've got to see what the excitement's about. Make way! Doctor coming through."
53726,224,76,379000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Car,Excuse me.
53728,224,78,380000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Car,So sorry.

53731,224,81,382000,Ned Flanders,Burns's Car,"Well, hi-diddly..."
53732,224,82,384000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Car,That's a good lad.
53734,224,84,388000,C. Montgomery Burns,Megastore,Books and cocoa in the same store? What's next? A talking banana?
53735,224,85,390000,C. Montgomery Burns,Megastore,Hm?
53736,224,86,394000,Waylon Smithers,Megastore,"Uh, I don't see one, sir."
53737,224,87,396000,C. Montgomery Burns,Megastore,"No, of course not. The very notion of a talking banana is absurd! Still."
53738,224,88,408000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Megastore,"Attention, good shoppers of Springfield. Someone very special has just entered the store. The world's most popular billionaire..."
53739,224,89,417000,C. Montgomery Burns,Megastore,"Ohhh, please. All this fuss for little ol' me?"
53740,224,90,421000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Megastore,"Please welcome the owner of Fortune Megastores, Arthur Fortune!"
53741,224,91,426000,C. Montgomery Burns,Megastore,Whaaa?!!

53743,224,93,433000,Crowd,Megastore,"Hello, Arthur!"
53744,224,94,436000,Arthur Fortune,Megastore,"You know, I've done a lot of exciting things in my life."
53745,224,95,439000,Arthur Fortune,Megastore,I went down Mt. Everest on a boogie board...
53747,224,97,443000,Arthur Fortune,Megastore,Climbed Niagara Falls...
53750,224,99,446000,Arthur Fortune,Megastore,"And, just last month, I knocked out Muhammad Ali."
53751,224,100,453000,Marge Simpson,Megastore,"Oh, how awful."
53752,224,101,454000,Arthur Fortune,Megastore,But this is the biggest thrill ever -- the opening of my one hundred and twelfth store.
53753,224,102,461000,Arthur Fortune,Megastore,Now I'm afraid I've got some bad news from my accountant today. It seems I have too much money. Who wants a dollar?
53754,224,103,469000,Crowd,Megastore,I do! I do! / Right here!
53755,224,104,471000,Homer Simpson,Megastore,I DO!
53756,224,105,472000,Arthur Fortune,Megastore,"Ha! All right. What's your name, young man?"
53757,224,106,475000,Homer Simpson,Megastore,I don't know. Just give me the dollar.
53758,224,107,477000,Arthur Fortune,Megastore,"Well, I hope this starts you on your way to a great fortune. Now, who wants the second dollar?"
53759,224,108,482000,Homer Simpson,Megastore,I do!
53760,224,109,483000,Arthur Fortune,Megastore,Uh... well... all right. Here.
53761,224,110,484000,Arthur Fortune,Megastore,Now...
53762,224,111,484000,Homer Simpson,Megastore,I do.
53763,224,112,485000,Arthur Fortune,Megastore,"Oh, the heck with it. Dollars for everyone!"
53764,224,113,490000,Crowd,Megastore,For-tune! For-tune! For-tune! For-tune! For-tune! For-tune!
53765,224,114,497000,C. Montgomery Burns,Megastore,That man's totally insane!
53766,224,115,499000,Ned Flanders,Megastore,"Well, this goes right into the old poor box."
53767,224,116,502000,C. Montgomery Burns,Megastore,"Not so fast, old chum."
53769,224,118,507000,Conga Line,Megastore,We love Arthur Fortune / He gave us a dollar / We love Arthur Fortune / He gave us a dollar...
53770,224,119,512000,C. Montgomery Burns,Megastore,That flamboyant fop! He's got them eating out of his hand.
53771,224,120,515000,Waylon Smithers,Megastore,"Well, you have to admit, he is charismatic, sir."
53772,224,121,517000,C. Montgomery Burns,Megastore,"Oh, bosh. Anyone can lead a conga line. Hop to it, Smithers. Con-ga, con-ga, con-ga!"
53773,224,122,523000,C. Montgomery Burns,Megastore,We love Monty Burns more. / Con-ga like you mean it. / Please don't make me shock you...
53774,224,123,530000,Kent Brockman,Megastore,Springfield is still swooning from the whirlwind visit of playful plutocrat Arthur Fortune.
53776,224,125,536000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,The man has no idea how to behave like a billionaire. Where's the dignity? Where's the contempt for the common man?
53777,224,126,544000,Kent Brockman,Burns Manor,"This new breed of fun-loving billionaire is a welcome change from the classic joyless miser, brooding in his cavernous mansion..."
53778,224,127,552000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Bah!
53779,224,128,556000,Kent Brockman,Burns Manor,"...grasping a glass of brandy with his thin, claw-like fingers...and a superior smirk on his greedy, soulless face."
53780,224,129,565000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"I thought I had everything. Money, good looks, strong sharp teeth... But what's it all worth when nobody likes you?"
53781,224,130,576000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"I like you, sir."
53782,224,131,577000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Are you still here?
53784,224,133,582000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Easy... easyyy...
53785,224,134,589000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Woo hoo! Look at me, I can juggle!"
53786,224,135,591000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Mm... Simpson!
53788,224,137,594000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I need your help. I want to be loved.
53789,224,138,597000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I see. Well, I'll need some beer."
53790,224,139,602000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I want you to look at me the way I saw you look at Arthur Fortune.
53791,224,140,606000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, Arthur Fortune!"
53792,224,141,610000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yes! That's the look I'm looking for. What would make you and your slovenly kind look at me that way?
53793,224,142,616000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, you don't have to call me slovenly."
53794,224,143,618000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes, exactly. That's the kind of pointer I need."
53795,224,144,621000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Tell me more, fatty."
53797,224,146,625000,C. Montgomery Burns,Roof Of Building In Downtown Springfield,"Ah-ha! This is a great idea, Simpson. Free silver dollars! Compliments of C. Montgomery Burns!"
53799,224,148,637000,PEDESTRIANS,Base Of Building,Stop it!
53800,224,149,637000,Lenny Leonard,Base Of Building,Ow! Ow! Take it out! Take it out!
53801,224,150,641000,Lenny Leonard,Base Of Building,Oh! Ooh! Put it back! Put it back!
53802,224,151,644000,Lenny Leonard,Base Of Building,That was a close one. Wanna go bowling?
53803,224,152,647000,Carl Carlson,Base Of Building,Maybe you should see a doctor about that coin in your brain.
53804,224,153,650000,Lenny Leonard,Base Of Building,Maybe you should mind your own business.
53805,224,154,652000,Lenny Leonard,Base Of Building,"Afternoon, Miss."
53808,224,157,656000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I can't believe it. I'm still not among the hundred most popular billionaires. I'm behind Adam Sandler, for God's sake!"
53810,224,158,664000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, how 'bout donating money to charity? Lots of crazy old coots do that."
53811,224,159,669000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"A charitable donation, eh? Well, there's a first time for everything."
53812,224,160,676000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Take this check for two hundred thousand dollars to the Springfield Hospital.
53813,224,161,681000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Can do.
53814,224,162,689000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Now there's nothing to do now but sit back and wait for the kudos to roll in.
53817,224,165,706000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield General Hospital,Where are my kudos?
53818,224,166,709000,Receptionist,Springfield General Hospital,"Mm... No, we don't have any record of you giving the hospital any money, Mr. Burns. Oh, but we did get a very generous donation from a Mr. Homer Simpson."
53819,224,167,718000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield General Hospital,What?!
53820,224,168,725000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield General Hospital,It's not fair! It's not fair!
53821,224,169,729000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield General Hospital,"Morphine, please."
53823,224,171,731000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait a minute... because I brought the check, they named a wing after me? Oh, you must be mad."
53824,224,172,741000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Well, I will be when the morphine wears off, but until then, Teedily deedily dee dee. Teedily dee dee dee. Woo hoo hoo. Hee hee hee."
53825,224,173,749000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Gee, I feel bad. If people knew the real Monty Burns, and not the silver-dollar-throwing morphine addict you've become, they might like you."
53826,224,174,757000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, if you want to change your image, you've got to get your face out there..."
53827,224,175,760000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh! ... on the radio.
53828,224,176,763000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"That's it, the radio! I'll go on the most popular program of the day. I assume that's still Don MacNeil and his Breakfast Club."
53829,224,177,771000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, get with the times, man. It's Jerry Rude and the Bathroom Bunch."
53830,224,178,775000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I don't think Mr. Burns would like that show."
53831,224,179,778000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,What's the matter? Think I'm not hip? I don't have enough vo-dee-oh-doh?
53833,224,181,787000,Jerry Rude,Radio Station,"Thank you, Knick-Knack and Paddy-Whack, the Siamese midgets. We'll be sure to catch your new series on Fox."
53835,224,182,792000,Homer Simpson,Radio Station,"Good luck, Mr. Burns. And if you get in trouble, I wrote some jokes about how white people are different from black people."
53837,224,184,799000,Jerry Rude,Radio Station,"How you doing, Mr. Burns? Jerry Rude. Welcome to the show."
53838,224,185,803000,C. Montgomery Burns,Radio Station,I'm pleased to...
53839,224,186,804000,Jerry Rude,Radio Station,"All right, let's get this geezer out quick so we can bring in the lesbian gladiators."
53840,224,187,808000,Homer Simpson,Radio Station,"You see white people have names like ""Lenny,"" whereas, black people have names like ""Carl."""
53842,224,189,816000,C. Montgomery Burns,Radio Station,"Now, Mr. Rude, I just want you to know I'm a good sport. If you want to make fun of my legendary love of cashews, you have at it."
53843,224,190,825000,Jerry Rude,Radio Station,Uh-huh. All right. How many times a day do you go to the can?
53844,224,191,828000,C. Montgomery Burns,Radio Station,"Oh, about forty, I suppose. When are we going on the air?"
53845,224,192,831000,Jerry Rude,Radio Station,"We're on the air now, Skeletor."
53846,224,193,832000,C. Montgomery Burns,Radio Station,What!?
53847,224,194,834000,Jerry Rude,Radio Station,Question Two: How long is your wiener? Seriously.
53848,224,195,836000,C. Montgomery Burns,Radio Station,Great heavens! What kind of radiola show is this?
53849,224,196,839000,Jerry Rude,Radio Station,How 'bout this? When was your first gay experience?
53850,224,197,842000,C. Montgomery Burns,Radio Station,"Oh, well, when I was six, my father took me on a picnic. That was a gay old time. Oh-ho, I ate my share of wieners that day."
53851,224,198,851000,Jerry Rude,Radio Station,"Oh, that sounds lovely. Queer. Queer. Umm... ever murder anybody?"
53852,224,199,856000,C. Montgomery Burns,Radio Station,"Murder?! Well, mistakes have been made..."
53853,224,200,860000,Jerry Rude,Radio Station,"Monty, I've heard you're a pretty flatulent guy. Any comment on that?"
53854,224,201,863000,C. Montgomery Burns,Radio Station,"Now, now, see here..."
53855,224,202,865000,C. Montgomery Burns,Radio Station,Stop that! Attention wireless listeners! Most of the sounds you are now hearing are not being made by me.
53856,224,203,870000,C. Montgomery Burns,Radio Station,"Oh, stop! Stop! Won't someone please stop the farting?"
53857,224,204,876000,Jerry Rude,Radio Station,"Don't worry, folks. He's not dead. I still hear some faint sounds of life."
53859,224,206,883000,C. Montgomery Burns,Homer's Car,"That didn't go well, did it?"
53860,224,207,885000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Good thing those lesbians knew CPR.
53862,224,208,887000,C. Montgomery Burns,Homer's Car,"Oh... What's the use? I'll never be a popular, beloved billionaire like Arthur Fortune."
53863,224,209,892000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Ooo, Arthur Fortune. You know what that fabulous man just did? He gave the Springfield zoo two male Pandas, and got them to mate successfully."
53864,224,210,906000,C. Montgomery Burns,Homer's Car,And a stunt like that impresses people?
53865,224,211,908000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Oh, yeah! And I'm not easily impressed. Wow! A blue car!"
53866,224,212,914000,C. Montgomery Burns,Homer's Car,"Well, if a couple of Chinese bamboo gobblers can win people's hearts, I'm gonna bring them something that man has searched for since the dawn of time."
53867,224,213,923000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,A sober Irishman?
53868,224,214,924000,C. Montgomery Burns,Homer's Car,Even rarer.
53870,224,216,932000,Homer Simpson,Scotland,"Whew, that was one long helicopter ride."
53872,224,218,944000,Homer Simpson,Loch Ness,"Do you really think you can capture the Loch Ness Monster? I mean, he's eluded Leonard Nimoy and Peter Graves."
53873,224,219,951000,C. Montgomery Burns,Loch Ness,Peter Graves couldn't find ugly at a Radcliffe mixer!
53874,224,220,955000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Loch Ness,"Hey, hey. Let's see now... we have the Monster-ometer, Flipper-Finder, Hoaxiscope... which is important for the looking and the finding."
53875,224,221,962000,Groundskeeper Willie,Loch Ness,Ach. The whole town's turned out. I've never seen them so excited.
53876,224,222,969000,Homer Simpson,Loch Ness,"Hey, Willie. That old couple looks just like you."
53877,224,223,972000,Groundskeeper Willie,Loch Ness,"Aye, 'tis my ma and pa. They own a tavern hereabouts. They still have the same pool table on which I was conceived, born, and educated."
53878,224,224,983000,Mother,Loch Ness,"So you're back, son."
53879,224,225,984000,Groundskeeper Willie,Loch Ness,Aye.
53880,224,226,985000,Father,Loch Ness,I suppose you'll be leaving soon?
53881,224,227,988000,Groundskeeper Willie,Loch Ness,Aye.
53882,224,228,993000,Homer Simpson,Loch Ness,Good. Good. One more.
53883,224,229,997000,C. Montgomery Burns,Loch Ness,"Where's my monster, Tubby? What do you people think I'm paying you for?"
53884,224,230,1001000,Homer Simpson,Loch Ness,"Uh, to work in your power plant?"
53885,224,231,1003000,Groundskeeper Willie,Loch Ness,You're not paying me anything.
53886,224,232,1004000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Loch Ness,"You kidnapped me. I remember it distinctly, with the grabbing and the duct taping and the tennis ball in the mouth... it hurt me."
53887,224,233,1010000,C. Montgomery Burns,Loch Ness,"The beast looks something like this, only without the saucy t-shirt."
53888,224,234,1016000,Homer Simpson,Loch Ness,Check.
53889,224,235,1027000,Groundskeeper Willie,Loch Ness,He's been down in that icy water for hours! How can the lad survive such brutal punishment?
53891,224,237,1043000,Homer Simpson,Pub,Tilt? You monster!
53893,224,239,1049000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Loch Ness,"Oh my, great good God. Gentlemen, your attention please. I am detecting a gigantic amphibious lifeform! It's 80 meters long and it's headed this way! Oh, good glayvin! It's on my shoe! It's, ah... a small frog. Just get off of there. Just get off! Get off! Get off!"
53894,224,240,1066000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Loch Ness,"Stupid machine. Oh, wait a minute. This isn't the monster-ometer -- it's the frog exaggerator."
53895,224,241,1072000,C. Montgomery Burns,Loch Ness,We're the laughingstock of the town.
53896,224,242,1076000,Homer Simpson,Loch Ness,"Don't worry, Mr. Burns. We're gonna find that monster, no matter how long it takes. Besides, I'm getting kind of used to wearing a kilt!"
53897,224,243,1083000,Homer Simpson,Loch Ness,Can you believe I'm a size four? Woo!
53898,224,244,1088000,C. Montgomery Burns,Loch Ness,"Oh, it's pointless hunting for an animal that has 24 miles of water to hide in. Drain the lake."
53899,224,245,1094000,Groundskeeper Willie,Loch Ness,Whut?!
53900,224,246,1096000,C. Montgomery Burns,Loch Ness,You heard me. Deploy the de-lochinator.
53904,224,250,1100000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Loch Ness,Pumping is hard. Glayvin.
53905,224,251,1118000,Local,Loch Ness,We've lost our homes and everything we hold dear.
53906,224,252,1120000,3rd Local,Loch Ness,Aye.
53907,224,253,1124000,C. Montgomery Burns,Loch Ness,I see it! I see the monster!
53908,224,254,1128000,Groundskeeper Willie,Loch Ness,Nay. 'Tis merely Loch Ness High School's discarded Homecoming float.
53909,224,255,1135000,Homer Simpson,Loch Ness,No way! Aberdeen rules!
53912,224,258,1148000,Homer Simpson,Loch Ness,God! It's him!
53913,224,259,1149000,C. Montgomery Burns,Loch Ness,"C'mon, boys, overpower it!"
53915,224,261,1152000,C. Montgomery Burns,Loch Ness,Fine. I'll do it myself.
53916,224,262,1159000,Groundskeeper Willie,Loch Ness,"That was amazing, Mr. Burns."
53917,224,263,1162000,C. Montgomery Burns,Loch Ness,"I was a little worried when he swallowed me, but... well, you know the rest. And now for my triumphant return to Springfield."
53920,224,265,1177000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Harbor,"Monster fever has gripped Springfield by the throat and it's all thanks to one man. Montgomery Burns has captured not only a legendary monster, but also our hearts. And by the way, girls, he's single."
53921,224,266,1189000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield Harbor,"Single? Well, he passes the Selma test."
53922,224,267,1195000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Harbor,"Thank you, thank you everyone. And now, presenting the ninth wonder of the world, the eighth being Gomer Pyle's heavenly singing voice... I give you! -- the Loch Ness Monster!"
53923,224,268,1211000,Crowd,Springfield Harbor,"Oh, my God!"
53924,224,269,1211000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Harbor,"Thank you, you're too kind. Yes, that's it, let it all out. Clutch me to your common bosom."
53925,224,270,1218000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Harbor,"Hey, look. He's getting up!"
53926,224,271,1225000,Crowd,Springfield Harbor,"/ Oh, my God!"
53927,224,272,1225000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Harbor,"No, no! Stop it! Stop it! You'll enrage the beast!"
53929,224,274,1229000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Harbor,No more pictures! You're driving him mad!
53931,224,276,1238000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Harbor,"Ahhh!! Stop it! You're blinding me! No, I can't see!"
53932,224,277,1246000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Harbor,Run!
53933,224,278,1248000,Man,Springfield Harbor,Mr. Burns will kill us all!
53934,224,279,1252000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Harbor,Wait! Don't go!
53935,224,280,1254000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Harbor,LOVE MEEEE!
53937,224,282,1259000,Homer Simpson,Harbor,"Well, if you wanted people to love you, you sure blew it with that insane rampage."
53938,224,283,1264000,Homer Simpson,Harbor,"But you know what? To be loved you have to be nice to people. Every day! But, to be hated, you don't have to do squat."
53939,224,284,1273000,C. Montgomery Burns,Harbor,"You know, perhaps you're right. I got so swept up with the notion of being liked, I completely forgot who I am. I'm a selfish old crank and that fits me like a Speedo."
53941,224,286,1288000,Homer Simpson,Harbor,"So what do we do with our friend here? Uh, throw him in the dumpster?"
53942,224,287,1292000,C. Montgomery Burns,Harbor,"No, no, no, I really want to give the lovable scamp a good home."
53945,224,290,1304000,C. Montgomery Burns,Las Vegas Casino,"Tough luck, Simpson."
53946,224,291,1305000,Homer Simpson,Las Vegas Casino,"Come on, Nessie. One more pull."
53948,224,293,1309000,Homer Simpson,Las Vegas Casino,"Okay, okay... You want a shrimp cocktail?"
53749,224,295,1313000,Homer Simpson,Las Vegas Casino,"Yeah, they're not great."
53834,224,296,1366000,Lisa Simpson,Las Vegas Casino,"Oh, I think this really sucks."
