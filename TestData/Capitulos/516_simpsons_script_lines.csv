134042,516,35,157000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I can't pick up something this heavy without my lifting belt."

134045,516,38,167000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh no! I won't be able to help you pack up Grampa!
134046,516,39,170000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. Just stay here and hold down the fort.

134054,516,47,217000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Just call me DeForest Kelley. I gotta write that down and send it to Conan.
134055,516,48,221000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Move this here. Tap. Mill! Mill! Barn! Silo! Tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern! Brothel. Parsonage! Theater In The Round! And... hay pile...

134060,516,53,267000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe one of your tavern wenches can do the laundry.
134061,516,54,271000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're back!

134067,516,60,283000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The back yard?! But what if he got out through your half-completed tunnel to Flanders's fridge?
134069,516,62,290000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,I don't see him anywhere. You jackass! You lost our dog!

134078,516,71,327000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What the hell?
134079,516,72,329000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, right."
134080,516,73,332000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"The animal shelter hasn't had any greyhounds turned in. Just a dachshund, a chow, and a pregnant raccoon."
134081,516,74,338000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A lot of good backups. How pregnant is the raccoon?
134082,516,75,341000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We don't want a raccoon.
134083,516,76,342000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good, Marge. Get their price down."
134084,516,77,345000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I just noticed something: you're not upset enough about this."
134085,516,78,349000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Lisa's right. You're the only one who hasn't cried about the dog."
134086,516,79,354000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Not a crier.
134087,516,80,355000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What?! You cry all the time! You cried when they canceled that show you hated.
134088,516,81,360000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Goofing on it made me feel wise!
134091,516,84,367000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,He's alive!
134092,516,85,370000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And he didn't pee on the floor!
133943,516,86,372000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"For me, that's a perfect day!"
133975,516,87,377000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mere, little buddy."
134094,516,88,377000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, why'd you shut our dog in a cabinet?"
134095,516,89,380000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll answer that: your father's an idjit!
134096,516,90,383000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I believe the word is idiote.
134097,516,91,385000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How did Santa's Little Helper get in there?
134098,516,92,388000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I know what must have happened:
134099,516,93,392000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna get a snack. But first... should I introduce the black plague? What could be the harm?
134100,516,94,400000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, now I've gotta buy a corpse wagon. That's how they getcha."
134101,516,95,405000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's amazing how many things they can make taste like cheese.
134102,516,96,411000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh yeah, baby, I'm drinking you down to your knees."
134103,516,97,416000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,GONNA DRINK AMMONIA / 'CAUSE IT TASTES LIKE CHEESE / WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN...
134104,516,98,423000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"A minstrel has composed a roundelay mocking me?! Torture, torture, torture!"
134105,516,99,428000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it's time we showed this dog some love!"
134107,516,101,435000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Homer, how come you're not hugging the dog?"
134108,516,102,437000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,He knows I love him. And he loves me.
134110,516,104,441000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's short for ""Rrright you are!"""
134111,516,105,441000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think you even like Santa's Little Helper!
134112,516,106,447000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You never take him for walks or sleep with him in your arms. And I suspect you've been chewing on his treats.
134113,516,107,453000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How are they his treats if I paid for them?
134115,516,109,456000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Okay, okay. I'll be nicer to the dude. I've just never really been a dog person."
134116,516,110,461000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Really? What about Bongo?
134117,516,111,463000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Bongo?! I told you never to ever talk about Bongo!
134118,516,112,471000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Ever!
134119,516,113,473000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,What just happened? Who's Bongo?
134120,516,114,475000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Bongo was Homer's dog when he was a boy.
134121,516,115,478000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,He's still my dog!
134122,516,116,479000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,We got him years ago...
134123,516,117,482000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"I don't know what you just said, but it's wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong!"
134125,516,118,485000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I was workin' long hours...
134127,516,120,485000,Grampa Simpson,Large Industrial Factory,...at the Springfield Smokestack Factory.
134129,516,122,493000,Grampa Simpson,YOUNGER GRAMPA AND MONA'S HOUSE,I was so tired when I got home. Then little Homer would start crying and crying. But Bongo knew just what to do.
148197,516,125,507000,Young Grampa,YOUNGER GRAMPA AND MONA'S HOUSE,"Now, my dear, we can watch ""Mannix"" as a couple."
134133,516,127,511000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Unfortunately, like all true stories, this one has a crappy ending."
134134,516,128,517000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,You have a story with an ending?!
134135,516,129,519000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Uh-huh. All my stories have endings now. They're putting something in my Jell-O down at the home. Anyway, Homer and that dog went together like Christmas and suicidal thoughts."
134144,516,131,530000,Young Grampa,Springfield - Homer's Boyhood,Awww.
148198,516,132,574000,Young Grampa,Springfield - Homer's Boyhood,I had no clue.
134137,516,133,578000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield - Homer's Boyhood,Then came the fateful day when Mr. Burns was lobbying for the go-ahead on his nuclear plant...
134139,516,135,578000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"...and he was giving away stuffed ""Isotoads"" to all the children."
134145,516,136,591000,Young Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Have a toy, don't thwart my ambition... Look, they even talk!"
134140,516,137,596000,Toad,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Cancer clusters are random occurrences.
148147,516,138,599000,Young Homer,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Creepy. You can have mine, Bongo."
134146,516,139,602000,Young Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Those toys are people bribes, you good-hearted little brat!"
134147,516,140,606000,Young Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,He bit me!
148199,516,141,608000,Young Grampa,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Get him out of here, son! Now!"
148200,516,142,612000,Young Grampa,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Mr. Burns, I'm awfully sorry..."
148254,516,143,615000,Young Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, I'll be all right. Once I hold your dying pet in my arms and feel his wagging tail go stiff!"
134141,516,144,621000,"Waylon Smithers, Sr.",Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, sir, you are aware you're at a P.R. event for children."
134148,516,145,626000,Young Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Bring in the clown!
134149,516,146,628000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey-hey! So, Lady Godiva gets a haircut, right, and... Kids?! No problem. I'll just cut to my clean material. Farmer's daughter, no... A man from Nantucket, no... Bring out the monkey!"
134150,516,147,649000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Next time I'm getting a smaller monkey.
134151,516,148,655000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,All right!
134153,516,150,661000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"So Mr. Burns wanted to kill Homer's dog. Homer had no idea -- he was so innocent and chubby. 'Course now, he's just stupid and fat."
134154,516,151,669000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Focus!
134155,516,152,669000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Huh? Oh, right. Little Homer didn't know it..."
134157,516,154,671000,Grampa Simpson,STREETS OF SPRINGFIELD - DAY,...but Burns had unleashed the local dog catcher to bring Bongo in.
148148,516,155,679000,Young Homer,STREETS OF SPRINGFIELD - DAY,LITTLE HOMER HAD A DOG / AND BONGO WAS HIS NAME-O / B-O-ON-ON-GO / B-O-ON-ON-GO...
134173,516,156,686000,Young Grampa,STREETS OF SPRINGFIELD - DAY,Get in -- quick!
134158,516,157,688000,Grampa Simpson,STREETS OF SPRINGFIELD - DAY,This was before the day of safety seats and coming to a complete stop to let your child get in.
134159,516,158,697000,Young Herman,STREETS OF SPRINGFIELD - DAY,"When God closes a door, he opens a gun shop."
134160,516,159,702000,Lisa Simpson,STREETS OF SPRINGFIELD - DAY,Wait. How could you know what Herman said? You were driving away.
134161,516,160,707000,Grampa Simpson,STREETS OF SPRINGFIELD - DAY,He wrote a memoir.
134162,516,161,714000,Grampa Simpson,STREETS OF SPRINGFIELD - DAY,Anyway...
134174,516,164,717000,Young Grampa,Grampa's Car,"Son, I've got an idea."
148149,516,165,719000,Young Homer,Grampa's Car,A hole next to the seat to hold my cup?
134175,516,166,721000,Young Grampa,Grampa's Car,"That's a stupid idea. Holding cups are what thighs are for. Now, hang on tight!"
134167,516,169,731000,Chief Wiggum,Animal Control Van,"Mmm. Smell them sausages, Lou!"
134168,516,170,734000,12-Year-Old Lou,Animal Control Van,Are you sure the Big Brother Program couldn't find me anybody else?
134169,516,171,738000,Chief Wiggum,Animal Control Van,"Yeah, well you were my last pick too. Okay?"
134170,516,172,745000,Chief Wiggum,Animal Control Van,I'm a wash-out as a dog catcher. What do I do now?
134171,516,173,749000,12-Year-Old Lou,Animal Control Van,"Well, my dream is to be Police Chief."
134172,516,174,751000,Chief Wiggum,Animal Control Van,"Oh no, you can't 'cause, um, that's my dream! I'm gonna be Chief of Police!"
134142,516,175,754000,12-Year-Old Lou,Animal Control Van,"Well then I'll be a spokesman for my people, like Ralph Abernathy."
134143,516,176,757000,Chief Wiggum,Animal Control Van,"Ralph, I like that name."
134176,516,177,762000,Bart Simpson,Animal Control Van,"Man, this story is filling in a lot of gaps."
134177,516,178,765000,Lisa Simpson,Animal Control Van,But I wanna know about Dad and his broken heart.
134178,516,179,769000,Grampa Simpson,Animal Control Van,"Your father's lost a lot in his life, his hair, his mother, more games of Monopoly than any man ought... he'd go to jail and stay there 'cause he loves the easy life. But I think losing that dog was the toughest blow of all."
148150,516,181,785000,Young Homer,YOUNGER GRAMPA'S CAR,"Where are we going, Daddy?"
134192,516,182,787000,Young Grampa,YOUNGER GRAMPA'S CAR,"Remember our old neighbor Miss Viola? Well, she moved to the country, where there was no limit to how many pets one single lady could own."
148151,516,183,794000,Young Homer,YOUNGER GRAMPA'S CAR,Miss Viola? Isn't she cuckoo?
134193,516,184,797000,Young Grampa,YOUNGER GRAMPA'S CAR,"Now son, a lot of people are cuckoo till you need something from them."
134181,516,186,802000,Grampa Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING (30 YEARS AGO),"I knew that Bongo would have a good home there, and Burns would never find him."
148201,516,187,808000,Young Grampa,COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING (30 YEARS AGO),"Gosh, Miss Viola, I want you and your husband to know how much I appreciate this."
134182,516,188,815000,Miss Viola,COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING (30 YEARS AGO),"Well, let's get this dog in."
148202,516,189,817000,Young Grampa,COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING (30 YEARS AGO),Son... why don't you give him your sweatshirt so he'll remember you.
148152,516,190,825000,Young Homer,COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING (30 YEARS AGO),Okay. How long till we come back and get him?
134183,516,191,829000,Grampa Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING (30 YEARS AGO),I had to tell my boy we were giving away his dog for good. I wasn't sure if a six-year-old could even understand the concept.
148153,516,192,839000,Young Homer,COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING (30 YEARS AGO),What?! No! No! No! Bongo!!
134184,516,193,845000,Grampa Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING (30 YEARS AGO),"Turns out, he caught on pretty quick."
134186,516,195,852000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Your father was devastated.
134187,516,196,855000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Women and their crying...
134188,516,197,857000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Finish the damn story. I've got a hockey game tonight.
134190,516,199,863000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Homer's House,When I finally got back to the house...
134194,516,200,866000,Young Burns,Grampa and Homer's House,Simpson! Release your hound!
148203,516,201,869000,Young Grampa,Grampa and Homer's House,He's already gone! Where you'll never get him!
134195,516,202,872000,Young Burns,Grampa and Homer's House,"I'm a powerful man, Simpson! I can walk into McDonalds, order soup and they'll make it!"
134210,516,203,878000,Young Grampa,Grampa and Homer's House,Go on! Get! I got a bug zapper and I ain't afraid to use it!
134213,516,204,882000,Young Burns,Grampa and Homer's House,Is that sugar water I smell?
134214,516,205,886000,Young Burns,Grampa and Homer's House,"Well, I'm afraid I already told my dogs they could tear yours apart. Don't make me look into those pitiless black eyes and say, ""Daddy didn't bring you a friend-friend to rip-rip!"""
148154,516,206,890000,Young Homer,Grampa and Homer's House,Where's Bongo? Is he still at the crazy lady's...
134211,516,207,899000,Young Grampa,Grampa and Homer's House,"Back to sleep, son!"
148204,516,208,905000,Young Grampa,Grampa and Homer's House,Listen... I can think of something you'd enjoy more than killing a dog.
134215,516,209,911000,Young Burns,Grampa and Homer's House,Dropping a horse on a church?
134212,516,210,912000,Young Grampa,Grampa and Homer's House,No! Breaking a man's spirit. Mine.
134216,516,211,917000,Young Burns,Grampa and Homer's House,Well I guess I could always drop a horse on a church afterward... fine.
134197,516,213,922000,Grampa Simpson,Burns Manor Dog Kennel,I had to take care of his hounds for a year.
134198,516,214,926000,Grampa Simpson,Burns Manor Dog Kennel,"I tried to wear a bite-proof suit, but those Satanic Snoopys always found their way in."
148255,516,216,938000,Young Burns,Burns Manor,I'm not done with you. I insist you never wear shoes or a proper necktie again. Just house slippers and the most humiliating tie there is: bolo.
134201,516,219,952000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Homer's House,But the hardest part was that my son was so angry with me.
148206,516,220,956000,Young Grampa,Grampa and Homer's House,How was school today?
148155,516,221,958000,Young Homer,Grampa and Homer's House,"Ketchup, please."
148207,516,222,960000,Young Grampa,Grampa and Homer's House,Probably wondering how I got rabies... Well...
148156,516,223,962000,Young Homer,Grampa and Homer's House,I'm-not-hungry-anymore.
134202,516,224,964000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Homer's House,"Our relationship never recovered, and no amount of ignoring the problem could ever fix it."
134204,516,226,971000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Grampa, why is the saddest story you ever told the only one that's ever made sense?"
134205,516,227,977000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It doesn't make sense to me!
134206,516,228,979000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I happen to remember it just a little differently.
134207,516,229,983000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, tell us your version."
134208,516,230,985000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now granted, I was just a kid, but I say..."
134217,516,231,988000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Grampa always hated Bongo and loved money so he sold Bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped Santa so I'd never get the toy I actually wanted--
134218,516,232,1002000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And then... and then wha... and then what happened... what... gee, my story doesn't make much sense except the Santa part."
134219,516,233,1013000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but at least it was short."
134220,516,234,1015000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait. Wait. There's one part of the story even Grampa didn't know about: a few months later, I went to rescue Bongo..."
134222,516,236,1031000,Miss Viola,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,"Hendrix! C'mere, boy!"
134223,516,237,1036000,Homer Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,"But, there was one thing I wasn't prepared for..."
134224,516,238,1039000,Homer Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,Bongo was happy. Without me. He had become her dog.
134225,516,239,1046000,Marge Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,Oh Homie. I'm so sorry.
134226,516,240,1050000,Homer Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,"Well, that's just the way dogs are. The most disloyal unfaithful creatures God ever made."
134227,516,241,1055000,Grampa Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,"Homer, maybe you should take a look at this."
134228,516,242,1058000,Grampa Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,A Christmas card I got from Miss Viola years later.
134229,516,243,1065000,Homer Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,He still has my sweatshirt.
134230,516,244,1067000,Grampa Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,"Bongo didn't forget you. Unlike those gerbils of yours we gave away years ago. Oh, they were fickle as hell."
134231,516,245,1071000,Grampa Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,Bongo didn't forget you. Unlike those gerbils of yours we gave away. They were fickle as Hell.
134232,516,246,1073000,Homer Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,"Oh my God, Dad... I owe you an apology. You saved Bongo. I never understood that till now."
134233,516,247,1084000,Grampa Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,All these years I thought you loved that dog more than me.
134234,516,248,1088000,Homer Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,"Why would you think that, just because I put you in a home where they feed you dog food?"
134235,516,249,1097000,Grampa Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,"Aw, give me a hug, son."
134236,516,250,1100000,Homer Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,"Okay, but I'm a little out of practice."
134237,516,251,1102000,Grampa Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,Hold your arms like you're carrying a wedding cake!
134238,516,252,1106000,Homer Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,What flavor?
134239,516,253,1107000,Grampa Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,It doesn't matter!
134240,516,254,1108000,Homer Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,"If it doesn't matter, then I call Snickers."
134191,516,255,1110000,Grampa Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,That's not a flavor!
134209,516,256,1112000,Homer Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,Everything's a flavor in the kitchens of today!
134242,516,257,1115000,Marge Simpson,COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR MISS VIOLA'S FARM,Just hug already!
134244,516,259,1120000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie?
134245,516,260,1125000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, boy. Time to go to bed."

134247,516,262,1129000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, Homer. It's your moment. But he's mine tomorrow."

134255,516,270,1165000,C. Montgomery Burns,Castle,Fiscal cliff.
134256,516,271,1174000,C. Montgomery Burns,Castle,"Think of the economy as a car and the rich man as the driver. If you don't give the driver all the money, he'll drive you over a cliff. It's just common sense. Furthermore, rich people feel things more deeply than the common man."
134258,516,273,1191000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Republican Party Headquarters,"And we've got to change our approach to immigration. I have a progressive proposal to let into this country, two hundred grimy Irishmen a year. I've got lots of potatoes that need peeling and stables to be mucked out."
134259,516,274,1203000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Republican Party Headquarters,"Sir, the Insta-polls are in. You're just digging yourself deeper."
134260,516,275,1206000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Republican Party Headquarters,Well then let me just say this: Marco Rubio es un pañuelo rosa!
134261,516,276,1208000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Republican Party Headquarters,I'm afraid you just made things even worse.
