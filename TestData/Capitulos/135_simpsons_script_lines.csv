28994,135,9,68000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yeah. Every muscle in my body's gettin' a workout. Especially my big fat mouth.
28995,135,10,73000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah! Especially your big fat... Oh, wait."

29019,135,34,189000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you gain 61 pounds, they'll let you work at home?"
29020,135,35,192000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yuh-huh, that's the deal. No more exercise program! No more traffic! No more blood drives or charity walks!"
29021,135,36,198000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I know we don't do a lot together, but helping you gain 61 pounds is something I want to be a part of."
29022,135,37,205000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad--
29024,135,39,206000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I must protest. You're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate.
29025,135,40,210000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. But try to see it my way. All my life I've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body."
29026,135,41,219000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Have you told mom about this?
29027,135,42,220000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No. It would only worry her. If you want to add to her worries, go ahead. I guess I'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us."
29028,135,43,227000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Da-ad!
29029,135,44,228000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, sweetheart?"
29030,135,45,229000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Obesity is really unhealthy. Any doctor will tell you that.
29031,135,46,232000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh yeah? Well, we'll just see about that, Little Miss Smart Guy."
29033,135,48,237000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"My God, that's monstrous... I've never heard of anything so neglige-- I'll have no part of it."

29039,135,54,251000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Dr. Nick Rivera's Office,"Now there are many options available for dangerously underweight individuals like yourself. I recommend a slow, steady gorging process, combined with assal horizontology."

29041,135,56,266000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Dr. Nick Rivera's Office,"You'll want to focus on the neglected food groups, such as the whipped group, the congealed group, and the choc-o-tastic."
29042,135,57,274000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Nick Rivera's Office,"What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor?"
29043,135,58,277000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Dr. Nick Rivera's Office,"Be creative. Instead of making sandwiches with bread, use Pop-Tarts. Instead of chewing gum, chew bacon."
29044,135,59,284000,Bart Simpson,Dr. Nick Rivera's Office,You could brush your teeth with milkshakes!
29045,135,60,286000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Dr. Nick Rivera's Office,"Hey, did you go to Hollywood Upstairs Medical College, too?"
29047,135,62,291000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Dr. Nick Rivera's Outer Office,"And remember, if you're not sure about something, rub it against a piece of paper."
29048,135,63,297000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Dr. Nick Rivera's Outer Office,"If the paper turns clear, it's your window to weight gain."
29049,135,64,301000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Dr. Nick Rivera's Outer Office,"Bye-bye, everybody!"
29051,135,66,305000,Homer Simpson,Supermarket,"Oh, it's a dream come true, boy! I can, nay, I must, eat everything I've always wanted. Now c'mon! Every second I'm out of bed, I'm burning precious calories. Now get grabbin'!"

29053,135,68,347000,Muscular Guy,Supermarket,"Lucky for you, this stuff doesn't work."
29054,135,69,355000,Homer Simpson,Supermarket,I don't know... fish sandwich? Are you sure?
29055,135,70,365000,Homer Simpson,Supermarket,"Oh, two-twenty-five?! That means I lost weight!"
29056,135,71,370000,Bart Simpson,Supermarket,"Homer, you're... um... on the towel rack."
29057,135,72,376000,Homer Simpson,Supermarket,Woo hoo! Four more pounds and my dream comes true: Working at home...
29058,135,73,388000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,Here's your lemonade and here's your beer.
29059,135,74,390000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,"Oh, you're such a vigorous young go-getter. When's your next coffee break?"

29061,135,76,409000,Homer Simpson,Supermarket,"Hey, Flanders, bad day at the rat races?"
29062,135,77,412000,Ned Flanders,Supermarket,Yeah. A crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat.
29063,135,78,420000,Bart Simpson,Supermarket,"Hey, Lis, come look at this."
29064,135,79,422000,Lisa Simpson,Supermarket,Neat!
29066,135,81,430000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, honey."
29067,135,82,431000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hi. Ah, er, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. Did you put on a little weight this week?"
29068,135,83,438000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- Honey, I'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability."
29069,135,84,447000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Have you lost your mind?! Have you thought about your health?... Or your appearance?
29070,135,85,452000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I didn't know you were so shallow."
29071,135,86,457000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh please, I would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but--"
29072,135,87,460000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Beautiful. G'night.
29073,135,88,464000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or I gotta face another day at work.
29074,135,89,468000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bad news, Dad, we're out of food. We're even out of the basic elements of food. You ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce."
29075,135,90,474000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I need a miracle.
29076,135,91,483000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, honey, that looks just like a real donut..."
29077,135,92,487000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad? It says ""Non-Toxic."""
29078,135,93,487000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that's a plus."

29085,135,99,528000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"... Yes, Simpson."
29086,135,100,533000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Thank you for your pity.
29087,135,101,535000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, were you ever planning to step in and put a stop to this?"
29088,135,102,539000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Normally your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out as soon as he finds something good on TV. But this season...
29092,135,106,559000,Homer Simpson,VAST WAISTBAND,I'm looking for something loose and billowy. Something comfortable for my first day of work.
29093,135,107,562000,Salesman,VAST WAISTBAND,"Work, huh? Let me guess: Computer programmer? Computer magazine columnist? Something with computers."
29094,135,108,568000,Homer Simpson,VAST WAISTBAND,"Well, I use a computer!"
29095,135,109,570000,Salesman,VAST WAISTBAND,"What's the connection? Must be the non-stop sitting and snacking. Well, sir, many of our clients find pants confining. So we offer a range of alternatives for the ample gentleman: ponchos, muu-muus, capes, jumpsuits, uni-sheets, muslin body rolls, academic and judicial robes..."
29096,135,110,586000,Homer Simpson,VAST WAISTBAND,I don't want to look like a weirdo. I'll just go with a muu-muu.
29099,135,113,598000,Arnie Pye,Simpson Home,"Arnie Pie in the Sky with the morning commute! Traffic this morning is as bad as it gets! Due to a fire at the Army Testing Lab, a bunch of escaped infected monkeys are roaming the Expressway! Despite the sweltering heat, don't unroll your windows, 'cause those monkeys seem confused and irritable!"
29100,135,114,615000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I pity those poor suckers on the freeway. Gas-brake-honk. Gas-brake-honk. Honk-honk-punch. Gas-gas-gas.
29101,135,115,627000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Eight fifty-eight. First time I've ever been early for work. Except for all those daylight savings days. Lousy farmers.

29103,135,117,641000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I see essc, ctarl, and pig-up. There doesn't seem to be any ""any"" key. All this computer hacking is making me thirsty. I think I'll order a Tab."
29082,135,118,654000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oops, no time for that now -- the computer's starting."
29104,135,119,657000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Check core temperature? Yes-slash-No."" Yes."
29105,135,120,663000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Core temperature normal."" Not too shabby. ""Vent radioactive gas?"" N-O."

29109,135,124,689000,Farmer,REMOTE IDYLLIC CORN FIELD,"Aw no, the corn! Paul Newman's gonna have my legs broke."
29111,135,126,694000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart and Lisa have to go to school while I get to stay home. Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah.
29112,135,127,700000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I like school.
29113,135,128,701000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, why don't you live in it then?"
29114,135,129,702000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I would if I could.
29115,135,130,704000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not me, sister. When I grow up I wanna be a lardo on workman's comp, just like Dad."
29116,135,131,713000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I wash myself with a rag on a stick.
29119,135,134,724000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Eww! Mo-om!
29120,135,135,726000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,This whole thing is really creepy. Are you sure you won't talk to dad?
29121,135,136,730000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'd like to, honey, but I'm not sure how. Your father can be surprisingly sensitive. Remember when I giggled at his Sherlock Holmes hat? He sulked for a week and then closed his detective agency."
29122,135,137,741000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings. The longer he lives like this, the harder it'll be to go back."
29123,135,138,746000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're right. Maybe if I use my least nagging tone of voice. Homer? Homer! Homer! That's it. That's the one. All right, send him on in."
29124,135,139,760000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad?
29125,135,140,761000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, honey?"
29126,135,141,762000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Umm... Mom just baked a cake.
29127,135,142,768000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, we need to have a serious talk."
29128,135,143,770000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You dragged me all the way from work for that?
29129,135,144,772000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan, shall we?"
29130,135,145,778000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I...
29131,135,146,778000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Con: You're endangering your health.

29135,135,150,788000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Con: You're running the air conditioner non-stop. It's freezing in here.
29136,135,151,792000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Pro: Uhh... uhh... I love you?
29137,135,152,796000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Con: I am finding myself less attracted to you physically.
29138,135,153,804000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of, right here."
29139,135,154,804000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And nobody's gonna take it away from me! You never had faith in me before. But let me tell you, the slim, lazy Homer you knew is dead. Now I'm a big fat dynamo. And where's that cake?"
29140,135,155,822000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,There's no cake.
29142,135,157,826000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Vent radioactive gas?..."" Y-E-S."
