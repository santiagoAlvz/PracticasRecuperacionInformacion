33594,153,37,226000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Homer, I'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. I was all set to go off on vacation, when I get called up for jury duty. Oh, it's a corker of a case -- seems a man drove up onto a traffic island and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums."
33595,153,38,240000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Now they're trying it as a maritime offense. So anyhoo, how'd you like to use my beach house? Free of charge."
33596,153,39,248000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I only get two weeks of vacation a year -- and you want me to spend it in your lousy beach house?
33597,153,40,254000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, if it'll seal the deal, I'll take a look at your septic tank. See if I can get her hummin' again."

33606,153,49,299000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Girls, Lisa. Boys kiss girls."
33607,153,50,303000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, why don't I have any friends?"

33609,153,52,314000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"We are best friends, Mom. But I'm a kid. I need friends my own age, too."
33610,153,53,318000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, you'll make plenty of friends. All you have to do is be yourself."
33611,153,54,325000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Be myself? I've been myself for eight years and it hasn't worked. Look at all these dorky clothes... A bathing cap... nose plugs...
33612,153,55,334000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"A microscope at the beach -- ugh, what was I thinking?"
33613,153,56,343000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I'm gonna tighten Milhouse's straps. He's fidgeting again."
33615,153,58,349000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, let's go!"
33616,153,59,352000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey. Hmm, somebody's travelin' light."

33625,153,68,386000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"It's called Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport. It's known as ""America's scrod-basket."""
33626,153,69,392000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,I thought Springfield was America's scrod-basket.
33627,153,70,395000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"No, Springfield is ""America's crud-bucket."" At least according to Newsweek."
33628,153,72,411000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,"""Wel-diddly-elcome Simpsons."" Oh, geez. He actually wrote ""diddly."""
33629,153,73,414000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,That was thoughtful.

33638,153,82,448000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,It must be exciting to make a different set of beds.
33639,153,83,451000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"I know you're joking -- but it is! Say, why don't you put on your swimsuit and head for the beach?"
33640,153,84,457000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Well, it's kind of funny... with all the craziness and confusion and mishegoss of packing... Ha... I forgot to pack."
33641,153,85,464000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Lisa, that's not at all like you."
33642,153,86,466000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Exactly.
33644,153,88,468000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"I forgot my swimsuit, too. But I improvised."
33645,153,89,474000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Hello.
33648,153,92,480000,Lisa Simpson,Teejay's Zaymart,"Uh, Mom, I'm kinda trying to go for a different look this year."

33650,153,94,487000,Marge Simpson,Teejay's Zaymart,"Ohhhh, how about this adorable sun-suit. It has a starfish on the fanny and it comes with its own pail!"
33651,153,95,495000,Lisa Simpson,Teejay's Zaymart,"Mom, come here. Bring money."
33652,153,96,503000,Marge Simpson,Teejay's Zaymart,So where do you want to show off your new hip togs? The Sherbet Shoppe? The Candle District? Big Sue's Tap Water Taffy?
33653,153,97,510000,Lisa Simpson,Teejay's Zaymart,"Um, if it's okay with you, Mom, I'd rather go find some kids."
33654,153,98,515000,Marge Simpson,Teejay's Zaymart,Oh... okay.
33655,153,99,519000,Marge Simpson,Teejay's Zaymart,You'll be my friend. I'm never gonna let you get away.

33662,153,106,546000,Lisa Simpson,Downtown Pwagmattasquarmsettport,I wonder where all the kids are.
33663,153,107,550000,Lisa Simpson,Downtown Pwagmattasquarmsettport,"Hey, a library! No, I can't. That's the old nerdy Lisa."
33664,153,108,556000,Pippi Longstocking,Downtown Pwagmattasquarmsettport,"Lisa, read about my adventures in the South Seas -- and make me live again."
33665,153,109,562000,Eustace Tilley,Downtown Pwagmattasquarmsettport,We've got periodicals on microfiche!
33666,153,110,567000,Alice,Downtown Pwagmattasquarmsettport,"Won't you join our tea party? It will be ever so -- Don't do it, Lisa, it's a trick!"
33667,153,111,573000,Alice,Downtown Pwagmattasquarmsettport,Run! Run!
33669,153,113,579000,Lisa Simpson,BEACH BOARDWALK,I don't see any kids at all. It's like they ditched me in advance.

33677,153,121,613000,Lisa Simpson,UNDER THE BOARDWALK,"Okay, okay, okay... not your fault, it's a bird thing. You don't control the birds -- you will someday, but not now."

33679,153,123,622000,Kid,UNDER THE BOARDWALK,'Sup.

33685,153,130,638000,Rick,UNDER THE BOARDWALK,"Try to, but cops always confiscate our boards."
33686,153,131,641000,Erin,UNDER THE BOARDWALK,"Yeah, and you just know they're using them like five minutes later down at the station."
33687,153,132,646000,Lisa Simpson,UNDER THE BOARDWALK,I think I know a place you can skate that's virtually deserted.
33689,153,134,652000,Lisa Simpson,UNDER THE BOARDWALK,"Like, you know, whatever."
33692,153,137,662000,Erin,Public Library,"Hey, this place rocks. What'd you say your name was?"

33696,153,140,671000,Lisa Simpson,Public Library,Me? Unlikely. My goony brother's always going to libraries. I usually hang out in front.
33697,153,141,678000,Erin,Public Library,"Oh, you like hangin' out, too?"
33698,153,142,680000,Lisa Simpson,Public Library,"Well, it beats doing stuff."

33712,153,156,741000,Erin,FAR SIDE OF PARKING LOT,"Like, who does he think he is with that slingshot in his back pocket? Dennis the Menace?"
33715,153,159,749000,Milhouse Van Houten,Parking Lot,How'd it go? Are we down with them?
33716,153,160,751000,Bart Simpson,Parking Lot,No. They must have seen you.
33718,153,162,757000,Bart Simpson,Beach House,"Oh, why do we have to play this lousy old game?"
33719,153,163,759000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,"Because it was the only one in the house. Come on, Homer, open the door for your Mystery Date!"
33720,153,164,766000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,"Ooh, Captain of the Football Team! He's a dreamboat! Don't wait up, Marge."
33721,153,165,773000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,"Okay, Bart, your turn, your turn."
33722,153,166,780000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,"You got ""The Dud!"""
33723,153,167,783000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,"Hey, he looks just like you, Poindexter!"
33724,153,168,787000,Bart Simpson,Beach House,How come Lisa doesn't have to play? Why does she get to hang out with her friends?
33725,153,169,792000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,"You've got friends. You got ""The Dud"" right here. Stand up for yourself, Poindexter!"

33727,153,172,808000,Rick,BEACH IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE,"Hey, that clam's got legs."
33728,153,173,809000,Lisa Simpson,BEACH IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE,"That's a hermit crab. When she outgrows her old shell, she finds a new one that's a better fit."
33729,153,174,814000,Lisa Simpson,BEACH IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE,"Don't be afraid, little friend. You'll be the most popular crab on the beach."
33730,153,175,819000,Lisa Simpson,BEACH IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE,"Aww, a gift from my favorite crustacean."
33731,153,176,823000,Dean,BEACH IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE,"Um, did you learn that word from a teacher or something?"
33732,153,177,827000,Lisa Simpson,BEACH IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE,"No. No, I heard it on ""Baywatch."""
33734,153,179,837000,Homer Simpson,BEACH IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE,"Hmm. I bet this place sells illegal fireworks. Just go in and act casual, like you buy 'em all the time."
33736,153,181,848000,Homer Simpson,Convenience Store,"Um... let me have one of those porno magazines... a large box of condoms... a bottle of Old Harper... a couple of those panty shields... and some illegal fireworks... and one of those disposable enemas. No, make it two."
33737,153,182,864000,Apu II,Convenience Store,"My apologies, sir, but the sale of fireworks is prohibited in this state and is punishable by--"
33738,153,183,869000,Apu II,Convenience Store,Follow me.
33739,153,184,876000,Apu II,Convenience Store,"Any red-blooded, flag-fearing American would love the M-320. Celebrate the independence of your nation by blowing up a small part of it."
33740,153,185,886000,Homer Simpson,Convenience Store,All right.
33742,153,187,888000,Rick,Beach House,'Pretty cool of your mom to let us hang out here.
33743,153,188,890000,Erin,Beach House,Totally. Not like my mom. She'd be butting in with rice crispie squares and Tang.
33744,153,189,895000,Rick,Beach House,My dad's all stoked 'cause today's the Fourth of July. He woke me up at dawn to take a loyalty oath.
33745,153,190,901000,Dean,Beach House,"My mom's French, so we only celebrate Bastille Day."
33746,153,191,907000,Lisa Simpson,Beach House,"Well, we could do something fun. Um, how 'bout a beach party?"
33747,153,192,910000,Erin,Beach House,"Great idea, Lis."
33748,153,193,912000,Rick,Beach House,"Yeah, I know where there's a beach!"
33749,153,194,914000,Dean,Beach House,I know where we can get some baguettes!
33750,153,195,917000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,"Gee, I don't know what you've got planned for tonight, Homer, but count me out. Didn't you buy any meat?"
33752,153,196,924000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,"This baby's sure to kill something. Okay, now everybody -- stand back while I celebrate freedom. Bart, give me your matches."
33753,153,197,933000,Bart Simpson,Beach House,Fresh out.
33754,153,198,934000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,No lighter?... Nothin'?

33760,153,204,970000,Bart Simpson,Beach House,"Oh, this is the worst Fourth of July ever. I hate America! Come on, Milhouse, let's go down there."
33761,153,205,976000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,I don't think you should. Let Lisa be alone with her new friends.
33762,153,206,980000,Bart Simpson,Beach House,"They're my friends, rightfully. She only got them by copying me!"
33763,153,207,984000,Lisa Simpson,Beach House,"Don't have a cow, man!"
33765,153,209,986000,Bart Simpson,Beach House,See?! That's my expression!
33766,153,210,988000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,"Oh, you haven't said that in four years. Let Lisa have it."
33767,153,211,992000,Bart Simpson,Beach House,It's the principle. She's gotta learn!
