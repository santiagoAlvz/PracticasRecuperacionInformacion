136617,525,198,903000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"For reasons I forgot in the car, this sushi represents our marriage. But what I know for sure, is that I want to share it with you."
136618,525,199,914000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He's taken a step. He's really close. All he has to do is not eat a piece before I do.

136637,525,219,994000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, you know, it's funny you should mention that. I've been readin' that ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and it turns out that what chicks want now is a guy to give 'em what-for in the bedroom there."
136638,525,220,1004000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Woo hoo! I'll woo her with woo-hoo!

136661,525,242,1097000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This is not putting me in the mood!
136662,525,243,1099000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Anger's a mood!
136663,525,244,1101000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why would you think I'd like this?
136664,525,245,1103000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know. It's just that you always say we should try new things. But I thought snuggle clamps just might rekindle...
136665,525,246,1114000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Quick! Call the Procter and Gamble help line!

136670,525,252,1139000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,Huh. That was just a placebo.
136671,525,253,1141000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,What does that mean?
136672,525,254,1142000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,Powerful drug.
136673,525,255,1145000,Marge Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Homer, I'm glad that you tried, even though now I can't find the washing machine."
136674,525,256,1151000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,It's behind the Dingle Swing.

136677,525,259,1156000,Marge Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Not because of what you bought, but because I realized that no matter what, you will never stop trying. And there's nothing a woman loves more than that."
136678,525,260,1166000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Thanks, honey. So you're not cool with any of the toys?"
