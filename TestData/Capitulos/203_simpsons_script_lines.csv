47346,203,77,313000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It was just the shock of seeing all that food on the floor. Plus I'd just fallen on my back, which hurt more than I let on."
47348,203,79,321000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"When we got married, is this how you thought we'd be spending our Saturdays? Driving out to the boondocks to trade in a refrigerator motor?"

47354,203,85,358000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"I'll get us out of this, honey. It's just gonna take a whole lot of floorin'."
47355,203,86,372000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Hmmm...
47356,203,87,373000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Homer!
47358,203,89,375000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"... And that's why today, bananas are called ""yellow fatty beans."" Questions?"

47364,203,95,398000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"What are you, simple? That's my old mine detector from the war."
47366,203,96,402000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,It was my job to clear the roads of enemy explosives.
47367,203,97,416000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,And that's how I earned the Iron Cross.
47368,203,98,420000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Can we borrow this, Grampa?"
47369,203,99,421000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Sure, she still works."
47370,203,100,423000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,That's my brass knee... Steel hip... That one's news to me.
47372,203,102,430000,Homer Simpson,Country Road,"When you think about it, mud is nothing but wet dirt."
47373,203,103,433000,Marge Simpson,Country Road,Hope that farmhouse has a phone.
47375,203,105,439000,Marge Simpson,Country Road,"Quick, the barn!"
47377,203,107,454000,Marge Simpson,Barn,Safe at last.
47378,203,108,456000,Homer Simpson,Barn,Shhh. We're trespassing. And some of these farmers have pitchforks.
47379,203,109,460000,Farmer,Barn,"Hey, Theresa! Steve! Now, who let you out?"
47380,203,110,468000,Farmer,Barn,"Ahh, looks like we got us some intruders."

47383,203,113,477000,Farmer,Barn,"If somebody's in here, you're in for some serious ass-forkin'."
47384,203,114,488000,Farmer,Barn,"Huh. Well, maybe they're in the media room."
47385,203,115,495000,Homer Simpson,Barn,That was close!
47386,203,116,497000,Marge Simpson,Barn,Very close...

47390,203,120,520000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"At your service, milady."
47391,203,121,522000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Cara mia...
47393,203,123,527000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, public display."
47394,203,124,530000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, what's with the love thang?"
47395,203,125,531000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, let's just say the country air did us good."

47404,203,133,566000,Pirate Captain,Simpson Home,"Arr, we'll dig up the treasure in seven yar. I've drawn a map on this cracker, which Polly will hold for safe keepin'."
47405,203,134,578000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So you see, there's treasure everywhere."
47407,203,136,586000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, here's the deal. Crowns and doubloons are mine. Snuff boxes and cameos are yours. Now as for wands and scepters..."
47408,203,137,593000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's a bottle cap.
47409,203,138,594000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Jewel-encrusted?

47416,203,145,610000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Nah, it'd just be awkward... what with the sex and all."
47417,203,146,613000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, I always figured Marge'd be a dynamo in the sack. You know?"
47418,203,147,617000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh boy, she's got legs from here to ya-ya."

47423,203,152,628000,Homer Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,"Now they did say bed and breakfast, right?"
47424,203,153,632000,Marge Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,"Oh, isn't it romantic? Doilies and cozies as far as the eye can see."
47425,203,154,638000,Homer Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,"If there's anything more exquisite than Queen Anne's lace, I haven't found it."
47426,203,155,644000,Marge Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,Big enough for two...
47428,203,157,648000,Homer Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,Are you ready to rock? 'Cause heeere we go!

47431,203,160,661000,Marge Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,"Hm, something's not right. Does this bed feel lumpy to you?"
47432,203,161,667000,Homer Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,"Well, yeah, kinda..."
47433,203,162,669000,Homer Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,Did that butter churn just move? 'Cause if it did...
47434,203,163,674000,Marge Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,"What's wrong with us, Homer? Have we lost the spark already?"
47403,203,164,679000,Homer Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,"No, no, honey. Maybe this will help."
47435,203,165,683000,Marge Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,"Heyyy, look at that."

47441,203,171,700000,Marge Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,"Y'know, the fear of getting caught is kind of a turn-on."
47442,203,172,705000,Homer Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,"There's the dirty girl I married. Come on, I have a disgusting idea."
47443,203,173,715000,Wealthy Dowager,BED AND BREAKFAST,"Oh, it's a donkey."
47444,203,174,719000,Marge Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,Shh! They'll hear us.
47445,203,175,721000,Homer Simpson,BED AND BREAKFAST,They didn't hear us in the sewing room.
47448,203,178,728000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, excellent haul!"
47449,203,179,730000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But it's all trash.

47466,203,196,792000,Homer Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,Not yet. Wait... wait... wait... now!
47468,203,198,803000,Marge Simpson,WINDMILL,"Oh, this is so naughty. Coming back to our old love nest..."
47469,203,199,808000,Homer Simpson,WINDMILL,It hasn't changed since that magical evening when I knocked you up.

47488,203,217,896000,Lisa Simpson,Airfield,I'm just a little girl.
47489,203,218,898000,Old Jewish Man,Airfield,"Ah, my studio produced ""Casablanca,"" all right. We tried to tack that happy ending on the picture 'cause back then, well, studio execs we were, we were just dopes in suits. Not like today."
