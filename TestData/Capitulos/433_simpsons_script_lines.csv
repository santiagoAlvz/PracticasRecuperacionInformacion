112294,433,13,120000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna see it first!
112295,433,14,120000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I'm gonna see it first!"
112296,433,15,122000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hit the road, ya big load!"
112297,433,16,124000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,My space toy!

112299,433,18,132000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"But Mom, you'll miss the eclipse."
112300,433,19,134000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,There'll be another one in North Yemen in 2027.
112301,433,20,137000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"We have totality, people!"
112303,433,22,141000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We'll be talking about this together for years!
112304,433,23,146000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,For years... for years...
112305,433,24,148000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I finally feel like part of a family!
112306,433,25,151000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't miss out! Just one little peek.
112307,433,26,151000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's beautiful!
112311,433,30,161000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Now Marge, your eyes must stay completely covered for two full weeks."
112314,433,31,167000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Don't worry, honey, I'll be your ""seeing-eye Homer."" We're in some kind of doctor room, bunch of stuff on the walls... it's kind of hard to describe... Um, I'm gonna take my break now."
112315,433,32,176000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Now Simpsons, I must warn you -- any stress could increase the blood pressure in Marge's eyeballs, leading to what we call ""Tex Avery Syndrome."""
112316,433,33,196000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Wolves are taking all our women.
112318,433,35,198000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You guys have treated me like a princess. Every day's been like the first ten minutes of Mother's Day!
112319,433,36,207000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You just rest those rods and coddle those cones -- everything's taken care of.
112320,433,37,211000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad! Come in the kitchen! Quick!
112321,433,38,215000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Is there any other way to enter a kitchen?
112323,433,40,221000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Aw, rats in the kitchen. Just like that delightful movie I taped in the theater."
112324,433,41,223000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Ooh, he's controlling me with my hair, using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots Vichy."
112325,433,42,243000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Hmmm, this is good."
112326,433,43,246000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Good, but not great. I'll go get some rat poison."
112330,433,47,255000,Clerk,Poison Store,"Here you go. This'll kill those dirty rats. And the clean ones, too."
112332,433,49,260000,Clerk,Poison Store,"Oh, that's not candy, sweetheart. What is it with kids and candy-colored poison, huh?"
112334,433,51,263000,Homer Simpson,Poison Store,"No, you stupid dog -- that's Maggie's bunny!"
112335,433,52,272000,Homer Simpson,Poison Store,Not in front of the poison man!
112337,433,54,272000,Homer Simpson,Shelbyville,"Whoever's biting me, stop it!"
112341,433,58,282000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Bridge,Why did I bring the baby and the dog to the poison store?
112343,433,60,288000,Homer Simpson,Bridge,How am I gonna get us all across this river?
112344,433,61,293000,Homer Simpson,Bridge,A boat!
112345,433,62,299000,Homer Simpson,Bridge,"Oh, we're too heavy."
112346,433,63,302000,Homer Simpson,Bridge,"Let's see: I need to get the baby, the dog, and the poison across the river, but I can only take one thing at a time. I can't leave the baby alone with the poison, and I can't leave the dog alone with the baby."
112347,433,64,311000,Homer Simpson,Bridge,Can't someone help me with this puzzle?
112348,433,65,317000,Homer Simpson,Bridge,Professor Frink! Help me figure this out!
112349,433,66,321000,Homer Simpson,Bridge,Yo! Over here!
112350,433,67,326000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Bridge,Wha--
112351,433,68,326000,Homer Simpson,Bridge,"Great time to nap, Einstein!"
112353,433,70,339000,Homer Simpson,River Bank,"Okay, Maggie, dog, poison, you're all involved, so listen up. First I row Maggie over, leaving the dog and the poison. Then I row back alone, take the poison over and bring Maggie back. Then I take the dog over, come back, get Maggie, row across, and before I know it, I'm back at home!"
112354,433,71,359000,Homer Simpson,River Bank,Were you listening at all?
112356,433,73,365000,Cletus Spuckler,River,"Sir, I'd be obliged to you if you'd help me puzzle out my fox, duck and corn situation."
112358,433,75,369000,Cletus Spuckler,River,"Well, the puzzle done puzzled itself out."
112360,433,77,380000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Now, I need to leave you where you'll be safe...under the watchful eyes of God. And I'll be watching you too, in case God's busy making tornadoes or not existing."
112361,433,78,389000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,I see you! I see you!
112362,433,79,392000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,I see--
112363,433,80,394000,Mother Superior,Springfield,Look at that -- one of God's discarded miracles.
112364,433,81,399000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Catholics!
112366,433,83,403000,Homer Simpson,CONVENT,Give me my baby back!
112367,433,84,405000,Mother Superior,CONVENT,"Sir, our mission is quite clear."
112368,433,85,407000,Mother Superior,CONVENT,Any child left here will be cared for by the Sisters of St. Teresa. Why would you leave such a beautiful baby on our doorstep?
112369,433,86,415000,Homer Simpson,CONVENT,'Cause she was fighting my dog and stealing my poison. Now give her back so I can take her home to my rat-infested house!
112370,433,87,422000,Mother Superior,CONVENT,"No. The poor dear is right where she belongs. God help you, sir!"
112371,433,88,425000,Homer Simpson,CONVENT,"Come on, lady, have a heart. I screwed up! I'm sure your husband does stupid things sometimes!"
112372,433,89,430000,Mother Superior,CONVENT,I'm married to Jesus!
112280,433,90,430000,Homer Simpson,CONVENT,"Yeah, right! And I'm married to Wonder Woman!"
112373,433,93,433000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Kids, I have to tell your Mom I lost Maggie."
112374,433,94,440000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,But Dr. Hibbert said not to stress her out.
112375,433,95,440000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Wait, I have an idea! One of us can go undercover as a nun and infiltrate the convent."
112376,433,96,448000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh no, oh no, ohhh no. There is no way Homer Simpson's gonna put on a dress and act like a nun."
112378,433,98,457000,Homer Simpson,CONVENT STEPS,Told you there was no way I would do it.
112379,433,99,459000,Homer Simpson,CONVENT STEPS,Are you sure you don't want me to do it? 'Cause I can do it. I got the outfit right here.
112380,433,100,462000,Homer Simpson,CONVENT STEPS,Huh?
112381,433,101,464000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT STEPS,"Dad, leave -- so I can get into character."
112382,433,102,475000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT STEPS,Hello. I'm a poor little sinner who's lost her way. May I join your order?
112383,433,103,478000,Mother Superior,CONVENT STEPS,How do you feel about kneeling?
112384,433,104,481000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT STEPS,Can't get enough.
112385,433,105,481000,Mother Superior,CONVENT STEPS,You're in.
112387,433,107,483000,Mother Superior,CONVENT,"Finally, you must wear your habit modestly at all times -- not like Sister Marilyn."
112388,433,108,493000,Nun,CONVENT,IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT / THAT'S A SIN...
112389,433,109,497000,Nun,CONVENT,IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT / THAT'S A SIN...
112390,433,110,500000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,Where's Maggie?
112391,433,111,502000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,"Mother Superior, are those all the babies in our orphanage?"
112392,433,112,505000,Mother Superior,CONVENT,"Lookin' for more unwanted babies, are ya? Well, next week's nine months after the prom. They'll be stacked up to the ceiling."
112393,433,113,511000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,"No, I was just thinking you might have some in the back you haven't put out yet."
112394,433,114,514000,Mother Superior,CONVENT,"Oh, a Doubting Thomas, are ya?"
112395,433,115,514000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,"Well, more of a curious George."
112396,433,116,519000,Mother Superior,CONVENT,"Well, little monkey, it's time for you to spend some time with the man in the yellow hat."
112397,433,117,523000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,Why would Mother Superior lie to me about not having Maggie? What is going on?
112398,433,118,532000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,A jewel! Why would nuns want a jewel?
112399,433,119,535000,Mysterious Nun,CONVENT,"Find the jewel, find what you desire."
112400,433,120,539000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,The jewel will lead me to my baby sister? Why are you telling me this?
112402,433,121,543000,Mysterious Nun,CONVENT,"Because I'm sick of that Mother Superior. Whenever we play football, she has to be quarterback."
112403,433,122,556000,Mysterious Nun,CONVENT,"Now, you must solve a series of clues."
112404,433,123,559000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,You mean an increasingly difficult series of challenges to my intellect? That's so cool.
112405,433,124,564000,Mysterious Nun,CONVENT,"Plus, you find your sister."
112406,433,125,564000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,Oh sure.
112407,433,126,566000,Mysterious Nun,CONVENT,Your first clue.
112408,433,127,569000,Mysterious Nun,CONVENT,"And before you decide to become a nun, consider this: I am only twenty-three!"
112409,433,128,573000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,Hm...
112410,433,129,579000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,"""Quaerite Deum in corde et anima."" That's Latin... ""Deum"" is God... and of course ""Quaerite"" means ""seek""... ""Seek God with heart and soul."""
112411,433,130,587000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,"""Heart and Soul""..."
112412,433,131,599000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU / HEART AND SOUL...
112414,433,133,642000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I haven't held Maggie all day. Can you hand her to me?"
112415,433,134,646000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Um... No problem, sweetie."
112416,433,135,651000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, mommy's little baby is getting big and chubby! Who's a chubby baby?"
112417,433,136,655000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But that doesn't mean that you can't have a little dinner.
112418,433,137,661000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hm. You're not usually this greedy.
112419,433,138,667000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Cool it -- she's getting suspicious.
112420,433,139,670000,HOMER'S HAND,Simpson Home,You cool it -- I'm hungry!
112422,433,141,679000,Lisa Simpson,Chapel,A cryptic message! Maybe this will lead me to the gem!
112423,433,142,683000,Lisa Simpson,Chapel,"Hmm, what if I read every other word? ""One more time, you're hopeless. Try again, numb skull."" That's not very nice -- I will try again, but not because the wall told me to. ""Turn around. Seek Springfield's biggest man-made ring."""
112424,433,143,696000,Lisa Simpson,Chapel,Big ring... big ring...
112425,433,144,713000,Lisa Simpson,Chapel,So many rings! But which one is the key to finding the gem?
112426,433,145,726000,Lisa Simpson,Chapel,Well? Did you get it?
112427,433,146,728000,Milhouse Van Houten,Chapel,"No. I'm not a smart nerd, I'm just a weak nerd."
112428,433,147,732000,Lisa Simpson,Chapel,The biggest ring in Springfield...comes from the bell in the Springfield Bell Tower!
112401,433,151,747000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Goodnight, Bart."
112432,433,152,749000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll be right in, Lisa!"
112434,433,154,762000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Good night, Lisa. Good ni-ight!"
112435,433,155,767000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Oooo, jazz!"
112436,433,156,772000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Keep going and I'll scat.
112437,433,157,787000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Skee-biddy-bob-boo! Dot-doobiddy-dum-doo!
112440,433,160,787000,Lisa Simpson,Clock Tower,Ha! Principal Skinner? Comic Book Guy? What are you doing here?
112441,433,161,791000,Comic Book Guy,Clock Tower,Following you. We seek the gem of Saint Teresa.
112442,433,162,794000,Lisa Simpson,Clock Tower,"Oh. Well, I seek it so I can find my sister. How do you know about the gem?"
112443,433,163,799000,Comic Book Guy,Clock Tower,"We are an ancient order of mystery buffs, who hide in shadow, and call ourselves... ""The Brethren of the Quest."""
112444,433,164,807000,Seymour Skinner,Clock Tower,Because we do our sleuthing in Mother's Nissan Quest Minivan.
112445,433,165,809000,Lisa Simpson,Clock Tower,Tell me all you know about the gem.
112446,433,166,809000,Seymour Skinner,Clock Tower,Never!
112447,433,167,812000,Lisa Simpson,Clock Tower,Does your mother know you're using her minivan?
112448,433,168,814000,Seymour Skinner,Clock Tower,"You see, legend has it that on her deathbed, Saint Teresa of Avila had a vision of a jewel that would usher in an era of peace and harmony..."
112450,433,170,822000,Seymour Skinner,CONVENT,She dispatched a team of nuns to the New World to seek this fabulous gem...
112452,433,172,839000,Seymour Skinner,SAILING SHIP,They landed at what is now Philadelphia...and used the timbers of their ship to construct a convent.
112454,433,174,851000,Seymour Skinner,FIELD NEAR BEACH,"The order flourished, never forgetting its sacred mission. But word about the gem got out...and a group of high-ranking Freemasons, led by Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and King George the Third, staged a phony war of ""independence"" to cover their search for the gem."
112455,433,175,879000,Seymour Skinner,FIELD NEAR BEACH,"Fleeing the violence, the nuns of Saint Teresa's left the colonies and settled here in Springfield."
112457,433,177,885000,Comic Book Guy,BELL TOWER,"Legend, and Wikipedia, have it that the gem will be revealed during the first full moon after a solar eclipse."
112458,433,178,892000,Lisa Simpson,BELL TOWER,That's tonight!
112459,433,179,892000,Comic Book Guy,BELL TOWER,Adoy. One question remains: why did you come here?
112460,433,180,898000,Lisa Simpson,BELL TOWER,Because I cleverly deduced the answer to Springfield's biggest ring. Voila!
112461,433,181,903000,Comic Book Guy,BELL TOWER,"Well, it gives me no pleasure to say... your deduction was faulty."
112462,433,182,912000,Comic Book Guy,BELL TOWER,This is a fake papier-mâché bell. The real bell was melted down in World War Two to make civil war chess sets. Four of which I own.
112463,433,183,922000,Lisa Simpson,BELL TOWER,"Oh my God. I know what the biggest ""ring"" in ""Springfield"" is. It's been right in front of us the whole time."
112464,433,184,928000,Comic Book Guy,BELL TOWER,"Ah, yes, I see it!"
112465,433,185,930000,Seymour Skinner,BELL TOWER,"I see it too. Let's, uh, head that way. We'll walk, or drive, to... the obvious solution."
112467,433,187,942000,Seymour Skinner,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"Oh, the word ""ring!"""
112468,433,188,942000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"Well, well. If it isn't the Tardy Boys and Nancy Clueless."
112469,433,189,956000,Lisa Simpson,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,Mr. Burns! What are you doing here?
112470,433,190,958000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"Oh, I've known about the gem for years. You see, my dear girl, I joined the Freemasons before it was trendy. That's my eyeball on the dollar bill."
112471,433,191,964000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,That's also my pyramid.
112472,433,192,968000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"Hence I trailed you on your quest, accompanied by my faithful albino."
112473,433,193,972000,Waylon Smithers,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"I keep telling you, I'm not an albino. I just use a lot of sun-block."
112474,433,194,977000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,Then why do I give you all the albino holidays off? Hm? Hm?
112475,433,195,980000,Lisa Simpson,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"Look -- there's writing on the ""R!"""
112476,433,196,980000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"Oh, everything is ""writing"" to you young people!"
112477,433,197,985000,Lisa Simpson,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,From this angle they're words!
112478,433,198,987000,Lisa Simpson,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"""Great""..."
112479,433,199,987000,Lisa Simpson,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"""Crimes""... ""Kill"" ""Holy""... ""Sage""..."
112480,433,200,990000,Seymour Skinner,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"""Great crimes kill holy sage?"" The puzzle is solved! We must warn the holy sage at once!"
112481,433,201,997000,Lisa Simpson,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"No, that's not it! A secret message this awkwardly-worded is always an anagram."
112482,433,202,1004000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,Fine. Then you unscramble those letters to spell out the location of the gem... while you two dig your own graves.
112483,433,203,1009000,Comic Book Guy,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"Superman, I have believed in you for years. If you can hear me now, please come help me dig this giant grave."
112485,433,205,1031000,Lisa Simpson,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"So, the anagram spells: ""Regally, the rock gem is..."""
112486,433,206,1037000,Lisa Simpson,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,...Lisa?
112487,433,207,1039000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,So the gem is inside you?
112488,433,208,1042000,Waylon Smithers,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"Sir, stop! She is the gem!"
112489,433,209,1045000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"Of course. St. Teresa wouldn't be interested in a mere bauble. Her greatest treasure would be a pure young girl. You are pure, aren't you?"
112490,433,210,1051000,Lisa Simpson,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,Does kissing Milhouse count?
112491,433,211,1054000,Comic Book Guy,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,No.
112492,433,212,1054000,Lisa Simpson,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,It all adds up. I am the gem that will bring world peace! How brilliant of God to remove my skepticism by making me his chosen one!
112493,433,213,1064000,Comic Book Guy,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"According to legend, the gem must be brought to the convent by sunrise."
112494,433,214,1069000,Seymour Skinner,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,We could make it if we took Mr. Burns's helicopter.
112495,433,215,1072000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,"Hmm... I don't really want you people inside, but you could dangle from the skids."
112496,433,216,1074000,Seymour Skinner,Hillside Near Springfield Sign,Deal.
112498,433,218,1077000,Waylon Smithers,CONVENT,"Feels good to help someone, doesn't it, sir?"
112499,433,219,1080000,C. Montgomery Burns,CONVENT,No. It feels weird.
112500,433,220,1090000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,Look who's here!
112501,433,221,1090000,Lisa Simpson,CONVENT,"Oh, fine, fine, finish your song. I can be patient -- after all, I am the gem child."
