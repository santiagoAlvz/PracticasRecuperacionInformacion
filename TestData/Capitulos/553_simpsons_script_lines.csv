143649,553,36,318000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,I thought this night would be fun for me and my friends. I don't even know these people.
143650,553,37,324000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,And I guess I don't have any friends. My only comfort is the roast is over and will only be shown four times a day for the rest of all time.
143651,553,38,334000,JEFF ROSS,Simpson Home,Krusty...is your nose red because it's embarrassed to be seen with you?

143658,553,45,368000,Bart Simpson,Swapper Jack's,"Krusty, why don't you talk to your Dad? He'll cheer you up. He's a Rabbi. He must've learned something from that giant star scroll he's always reading."
143659,553,46,375000,Krusty the Clown,Swapper Jack's,"Kid, does talking to your Dad make you feel better?"
143660,553,47,378000,Bart Simpson,Swapper Jack's,Well no... but he's not a rabbi. More of a Flabbi.
143661,553,48,380000,Homer Simpson,Swapper Jack's,Why you little! I'll show you who's a Flabbi!
143662,553,49,387000,Bart Simpson,Swapper Jack's,"All right, you're not a Flabbi! Okay! I got it!"
143663,553,50,388000,Homer Simpson,Swapper Jack's,All muscle. In Minnesota I'd be a supermodel!

143669,553,56,410000,Krusty the Clown,Temple Beth Springfield,"Wait, wait, wait! Please, Dad. Do you even think I'm funny?"
143670,553,57,414000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Temple Beth Springfield,"I'm not gonna lie to you, for funny, I prefer Rabbi Rudenstein."
143671,553,58,417000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Temple Beth Springfield,He puts the ha in Hanukah and the levity in Leviticus!
143674,553,59,420000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Temple Beth Springfield,"As for you, son, if you want to know my honest opinion of you, you've always been... eh."
143675,553,60,426000,Krusty the Clown,Temple Beth Springfield,Go on.
143676,553,61,428000,Krusty the Clown,Temple Beth Springfield,I've always been Eh... ntertaining? Dad?
143677,553,62,436000,Krusty the Clown,Temple Beth Springfield,Show me nose fog!

143682,553,67,470000,Krusty the Clown,Temple,Wha?
143683,553,68,474000,RABBIS,Temple,Eh. Eh. Eh.
143684,553,69,481000,Krusty the Clown,Temple,"Look, I'm an entertainer. So maybe the best way to say how I feel about my Dad is through a song, that someone else wrote, that I hired people to sing. This is for you, Dad!"
143685,553,70,492000,Choir,Temple,HE FOUGHT / AND FOUGHT / AND FOUGHT FOR JEWISH RIGHTS / WISDOM SOUGHT / STUDENTS TAUGHT / RABBI KRUSTOFSKY'S GONE!

143693,553,78,532000,Homer Simpson,Temple,"Yeah, yeah, great. I guess my getting-up days are over."
143695,553,80,542000,Lisa Simpson,Krusty's House,"Dad, you're eating too much! I'm worried about your health! I don't wanna lose you!"
143696,553,81,550000,Lisa Simpson,Krusty's House,Oh no.
143697,553,82,552000,Marge Simpson,Krusty's House,"Krusty, I brought some homemade chicken soup. We used the Play-Doh maker for the matzo."
143698,553,83,558000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's House,"Thanks, but I don't really like soup."
143699,553,84,561000,Marge Simpson,Krusty's House,But you wear that little spoon around your neck.
143700,553,85,564000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's House,"Huh... you really notice stuff, don't you?"
143701,553,86,566000,Marge Simpson,Krusty's House,Yes. And I can tell how hard it was to lose your father. But at least you were there to share his final thoughts.
143702,553,87,573000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's House,Eh.
143672,553,88,574000,Marge Simpson,Krusty's House,"No, no, it's a big thing."
143704,553,89,576000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's House,"No, that's what he called me. Eh."
143705,553,90,577000,Marge Simpson,Krusty's House,Well... it could be worse.
143706,553,91,580000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's House,Oh yeah? How?
143707,553,92,582000,Marge Simpson,Krusty's House,I don't know. Uh... how about... That's a lot worse!
143708,553,93,586000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's House,Can you stop comforting me now?
143709,553,94,588000,Sideshow Bob,Krusty's House,"Krusty, condolences on your loss."
143710,553,95,592000,Sideshow Mel,Krusty's House,So this is the Bob whose comedic genius I can never live up to.
143711,553,96,600000,Sideshow Mel,Krusty's House,"Believe me, all of us have thought about killing him."
143714,553,99,610000,Therapist,Therapist's Office,"Clowns have it tough, Krusty. I understand. I was Professor Pickles with Ringling Brothers for several years."
143715,553,100,616000,Therapist,Therapist's Office,The elephant and I had our differences.
143716,553,101,617000,Therapist,Therapist's Office,"So, what brings you here, and don't say ""clown car."""
143717,553,102,621000,Krusty the Clown,Therapist's Office,"I'm a sad, tragic clown like what's his name, Liberace."
143718,553,103,626000,Therapist,Therapist's Office,"Tell me about your father, huh?"
143719,553,104,632000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Therapist's Office,Herschel! Did you read your Exodus?
143720,553,105,634000,TEENAGED KRUSTY,Therapist's Office,"Oh, uh, oh, sure."
143721,553,106,636000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Therapist's Office,"Really? Then tell me, what did the Burning Bush say?"
143722,553,107,639000,TEENAGED KRUSTY,Therapist's Office,"It said ""Ow! Put me out! How many talking bushes do you think there are?!"""
143723,553,108,641000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Therapist's Office,"My son, you are a big needy nothing that only laughs can fill!"
143724,553,109,649000,Krusty the Clown,Therapist's Office,I don't need laughs!
143725,553,110,651000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Therapist's Office,Ha!
143726,553,111,652000,Krusty the Clown,Therapist's Office,Thank you. Thank you.
143727,553,112,654000,Krusty the Clown,Therapist's Office,"A big, needy nothing."
143728,553,113,654000,Therapist,Therapist's Office,"Wow. Wow. Krusty, would you like a therapy dog?"
143729,553,114,661000,Krusty the Clown,Therapist's Office,Yeah... with extra relish. Hey-hey! I still got it. Huh?
143730,553,115,665000,Therapist,Therapist's Office,"Yes, if by ""it"" you mean reflexive denial of your inner sadness."
143731,553,116,669000,Krusty the Clown,Therapist's Office,Hey-hey.
143733,553,118,670000,Sideshow Mel,Krustylu Studios,"Shut up, children!"
143734,553,119,673000,Sideshow Mel,Krustylu Studios,"Boys and girls, you know that we've been dark for a couple of days because of a tragic loss in the Krustylu family. Now put your hands together for the man who's falling apart before our eyes, Krusty the Clown!"
143735,553,121,694000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,No monologue. Roll the cartoon.
143736,553,122,703000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Oh, my God. Who made this monstrosity?"
143737,553,123,708000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,I did everything!
143738,553,124,710000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,Kids... I'm experiencing a crisis of conscience.
143739,553,125,715000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"No, no, no, no! I don't deserve the pre-recorded applause of children long gone."
143740,553,126,720000,Kid,Krustylu Studios,I like Ike!
143741,553,127,723000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Therefore, I'm quitting the show. And I know Mel will be quitting it with me."
143742,553,128,727000,Sideshow Mel,Krustylu Studios,"Yes, yes, buy the house. It will be-- What?!"
143744,553,130,731000,Kent Brockman,Channel 6 News Studio,Today is the day the pity laughter died. Krusty the Clown has retired.
143745,553,131,736000,Kent Brockman,Channel 6 News Studio,"For a brief overview of a half century of ha-has, here is Channel Six T.V. critic Clive Meriwether."
143746,553,132,741000,CLIVE MERIWETHER,Channel 6 News Studio,Krusty the Clown will perhaps best be remembered for taking up two spots in the Channel Six parking lot.
143747,553,133,747000,CLIVE MERIWETHER,Channel 6 News Studio,"On a personal level, he used to call me Little Lord Tingaling. I shan't miss that. This man's only lasting legacies are a law in his name limiting the working hours of chimpanzees to fourteen hours a day, and the invention of the payment of alimony by dropping hot pennies from a helicopter. I give his life a D-plus. Good day to you."
143748,553,134,768000,Kent Brockman,Channel 6 News Studio,"What will Krusty do now? I suppose only time will tell. Which is true for all news stories, I guess. Until anyone realizes, I'm Kent Brockman adding no useful information. And here's another sentence. You can tell I'm winding it up because my voice is going up and down like this."
143750,553,136,786000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's House,"Well, at least now I'll have plenty of time to solve this Rubik's Cube."
143755,553,141,804000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom? Dad?
143756,553,142,806000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, Lisa?"
143758,553,144,808000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've been listening, and Dad stops breathing for as long as five minutes. Mind if I sleep with you guys and keep an eye on him?"
143759,553,145,816000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetie, you shouldn't have to worry about such things."
143760,553,147,822000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The doctor gave us this machine to help him breathe in his sleep. Go to bed. I'll take care of him.
143762,553,149,828000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"/ No good, no good. What do I do? What do I do?"
143763,553,150,833000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"/ Oh! Breathe, Homie, breathe!"
143764,553,151,851000,Krusty the Clown,Lisa's Bedroom,"Well, at least Teeny's doin' okay. He's in ""The Odd Couple"" with David Hyde Pierce."
143766,553,153,856000,DAVID HYDE PIERCE,BROADWAY STAGE,"Now really, Oscar, would it kill you to use a coaster?"
143768,553,155,862000,DAVID HYDE PIERCE,BROADWAY STAGE,"If you're going to go up there, at least dust!"
143769,553,156,867000,NEIL SIMON,BROADWAY STAGE,"Finally, done the way I first imagined it!"
143771,553,158,870000,Bart Simpson,Krusty's House,"I'm gonna prove you did groundbreaking work. Krusty, I want you to binge-watch all the shows you've ever done."
143772,553,159,876000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's House,"Well, I've never said no to a binge."
148282,553,160,880000,Young Krusty,Krusty's House,Deuteronomy? Isn't that the study of deuters?
143773,553,161,884000,MIDDLE-AGED KRUSTY,Krusty's House,Hippocampus? Isn't that another name for the University of Mississippi?
143774,553,162,889000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's House,"Okay. I've been on fifty years, you're bound to repeat yourself a little."
143775,553,163,892000,Krustys,Krusty's House,"...unless I wanted to get sat on by Mama Cass / ...unless I wanted to get sat on by Dom DeLuise / by the cast of ""What's Happening"" / William ""The Refrigerator"" Perry everyone! / Newman from ""Seinfeld"" / the whale from ""Whale Rider"" / Adele! What? She's a guest star?!"
143777,553,165,916000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,So that's why all my cameramen have P.T.S.D.!
143778,553,166,920000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,Where's my whiskey funnel!
143779,553,167,922000,GERMAN HOUSEKEEPER,Krusty's Mansion,"Young man, you should go. When the master is like this, it is no place for children."
143780,553,168,928000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,"Pour, Helga!"
143781,553,169,930000,GERMAN HOUSEKEEPER,Krusty's Mansion,It begins.
143782,553,170,942000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,Where am I?
143783,553,171,945000,RODNEY DANGERFIELD,Krusty's Mansion,Why you're in Jewish Heaven!
143784,553,172,946000,RODNEY DANGERFIELD,Krusty's Mansion,"Oh, this place is great! Why, my necktie straightens itself!"
143785,553,173,950000,RODNEY DANGERFIELD,Krusty's Mansion,Even Portnoy has no complaints! And I tell ya... I get so much respect.
143786,553,174,956000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,Wow. So I made it to Heaven.
143788,553,175,971000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,This place is amazing!
143789,553,176,973000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Krusty's Mansion,Schmuck! There is no Jewish Heaven!
143790,553,177,975000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Krusty's Mansion,"Our faith teaches that once you're dead -- that's it! Kaput! It's dark, it's cold, it's like that apartment we lived in before I started doing weddings. But you, my son, remain..."
143791,553,178,988000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,Eh?!
143792,553,179,988000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Krusty's Mansion,Go back to earth! Do something with your life! Help people!
143793,553,180,995000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Krusty's Mansion,Help people! Help people!
143794,553,181,999000,Paramedic,Krusty's Mansion,Nothing. Not getting' a pulse.
143795,553,182,1001000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,I gotta change my life!
143796,553,183,1003000,Paramedic,Krusty's Mansion,Still no pulse. I guess I'm just really bad at this.
143798,553,185,1021000,Miss Hoover,Miss Hoover's Classroom,I'm afraid Lisa's getting obsessed with keeping her father out of danger. She's gotten our Resusci-Annie doll to breathe on its own.
143799,553,186,1028000,RESUSCI-ANNIE,Miss Hoover's Classroom,Why?!
143801,553,188,1030000,Krusty the Clown,Downtown Springfield,In this new shelter we provide a home for animals put out of work by Cirque du Soleil.
143802,553,189,1038000,Reporter,Downtown Springfield,"Um, Krusty! Have you fulfilled the promise you made to your father in the dream you never told anyone about?"
143803,553,190,1045000,Krusty the Clown,Downtown Springfield,No. Somehow a brief act of uncharacteristic generosity solved nothing.
143804,553,191,1050000,Bart Simpson,Downtown Springfield,"Hey, Krusty."
143805,553,192,1050000,Krusty the Clown,Downtown Springfield,What? Have you been going to temple?
143806,553,193,1053000,Bart Simpson,Downtown Springfield,Yeah. And I've learned that all religions are equally boring. But there's a reason I went. Come and see.
143807,553,194,1060000,Krusty the Clown,Downtown Springfield,"Kid, there's no way you can cheer me up. Not when whiskey, good deeds and hookers failed."
143808,553,195,1065000,Bart Simpson,Downtown Springfield,Who's a hooker?
