5789,51,97,514000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars.
5790,51,98,518000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers."
5791,51,99,521000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I am not!
5792,51,100,522000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes you are. You've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on TV. I know, I'll build him a dog house."
5793,51,101,531000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I don't know..."
5794,51,102,532000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't worry. I just drew up a little blueprint. Now let me walk you through it.
5795,51,103,537000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is the door. He goes through that. This is the roof. And this happy character here is the sun. He shines down on the house, see."
5797,51,105,547000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"How was detention today, dear?"

5808,51,114,583000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The hell with this!
5810,51,116,585000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. Well sir, I gave him three quarters by mistake. Took me the whole afternoon to track him down."

5821,51,127,619000,Ned Flanders,Lovejoy Home,"Sorry to bother you, Reverend Lovejoy, but I'm kind of in a tizzy. Our son Todd just told us he didn't want to eat his ""damn vegetables."""
5822,51,128,627000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Lovejoy Home,"Well, you know kids and vegetables. What was it, asparagus?"
5823,51,129,630000,Ned Flanders,Lovejoy Home,"No Reverend, the point is, he said a bad word."
5824,51,130,633000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Lovejoy Home,"Oh, oh right, yeah. Kids usually pick these things up from someplace. Find out who's doing it and... uh, direct them to the Bible."
5825,51,131,641000,Ned Flanders,Lovejoy Home,Where in the Bible?
5826,51,132,642000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Lovejoy Home,Uh... page nine-hundred.
5827,51,133,642000,Ned Flanders,Lovejoy Home,But Reverend...

5832,51,138,652000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Suppose I was writing a second letter to a girl and I already used up my A material. What should I say?
5802,51,139,658000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mmm! Could it be there's a special someone you're not telling me about?
5803,51,140,661000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, please."
5833,51,141,661000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Is it Terri?

5018,51,144,663000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
5774,51,145,664000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Is it that girl with the lazy eye patch?

5835,51,148,669000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No! It's not for me. It's homework.
5836,51,149,672000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure it is. Hey Bart, let's do some homework."
5838,51,151,680000,Southern Private,Flanders Home,"Golly, Sergeant Carter, I can't fix your jeep. But maybe this will make it up to you. Galveston, oh Galveston..."
5839,51,152,690000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Is this all he watches?
5840,51,153,692000,Maude Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh, he used to watch ""Davy and Goliath,"" but he thought the idea of a talking dog was blasphemous."
5842,51,155,699000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Mom, did you save the love letters Dad sent you?"
5843,51,156,701000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Of course I saved them.
5844,51,157,703000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Although actually there's only one. And it's more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited."
5845,51,158,710000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Maybe it's the beer talking, Marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. They got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? Get outta here."""
5846,51,159,715000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, a side of dad I've never seen."

5871,51,184,786000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Homer?
5872,51,185,787000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What is it, Flanders?"
5873,51,186,788000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,I'm afraid I have a bone to pick with you.
5874,51,187,791000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, if this is about your camcorder -- I lost it, okay?"
5875,51,188,794000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"No, I-I came to talk to you about your potty-mouth."
5876,51,189,799000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What the hell are you talking about?
5877,51,190,801000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Look Homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. So, I don't want to be hard on you... but I just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys."
5878,51,191,811000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh come on now, Flanders, I don't complain about your your... moustache."
5879,51,192,819000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,What's wrong with my moustache?
5880,51,193,821000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Makes you look like you've got something to hide.
5881,51,194,824000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,What?
5882,51,195,825000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,People are talking... lots of people.
5883,51,196,828000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. I'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?"
5884,51,197,834000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Aye-aye! Admiral Butthead.
5885,51,198,837000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"We now return to ""Two for Tunsia"" on Colorization Theater."

5889,51,202,855000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Wow, ""a million poets working for a million years""... You're so lucky. When are you gonna meet him?"

5892,51,205,864000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"If he's got everything where it should be, I'm reelin' him in."
5894,51,206,872000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Strap on your skates Gordie, you're going in."
5896,51,208,876000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Marge, do you want to hear something funny? Flanders thinks I swear too much. Marge, you're not laughing."
5897,51,209,885000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you know, maybe he's right."
5898,51,210,886000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well what a surprise. Marge sticks up for Flanders! Can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, Ned Flanders?"
5899,51,211,894000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, Homer, you brought up Ned Flanders. I never said a word --"
5900,51,212,896000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, we're past that. Marge, maybe I do curse a little, but that's the way God made me. And I'm too old to stop now."
5901,51,213,903000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, you're not. When my father got out of the Navy, he used to curse a blue streak. It almost cost him his job as a baby photographer. So, my mom put a Swear Jar in the kitchen. Every time he said a bad word, he put in a quarter. What do you think?"
