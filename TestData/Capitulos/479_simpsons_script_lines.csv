124184,479,87,459000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Trying to get out of here before Grampa wakes up.

124205,479,108,543000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,But it's not real happiness. It's just because of an untested drug!
124206,479,109,548000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,So what? There are no guarantees in life! We don't know if this... knife is safe!
124207,479,110,556000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Turns out it's not. The point is, when I'm cranky, nobody likes me, sweet pea. Let me live as a happy man for my remaining thirty years."

124216,479,119,607000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, do somethin' about your dad. He's casting a pall over this grim dungeon full of losers."

124218,479,121,616000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, why don't you just make some more of the serum yourself?"

124225,479,128,641000,Walther Hotenhoffer,Moe's Tavern,Lisa is irrelevant.
124226,479,129,643000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,You better elaborate!
124227,479,130,644000,Walther Hotenhoffer,Moe's Tavern,"All I need is one drop of extract, and I can synthesize the drug at my plant. But where do I find that drop?..."

124230,479,133,670000,Walther Hotenhoffer,Moe's Tavern,World War Two? I wasn't born yet.
124231,479,134,673000,Grampa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Funny how many Germans say that these days.
124233,479,136,695000,Walther Hotenhoffer,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"From that one droplet, I have synthesized fifty different compounds. Please identify the one that is ausgezeichnet."

124240,479,143,727000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"Oh, don't get me started on that one. They're just plain better than the greats of my day. God bless them, and their refusal to learn English."
124241,479,144,744000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,Huh? This one didn't make me feel anything.

124260,479,163,807000,Walther Hotenhoffer,Simpson Home,"Grampapa, no one but you should take this drug until it has been through rigorous trials. Be careful -- if the wrong hands got hold of it, a fortune could be made by selling this drug on the black market."
124261,479,164,820000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, wrong hands, eh? That's your cue, boys."
124263,479,166,828000,Otto Mann,Simpson Home,You sell drugs -- Why can't you dress like that?

124296,479,198,988000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,At some point I think we should see a doctor.

124303,479,205,1007000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It better be tonsillitis.
124304,479,206,1010000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, actually... I may have accidentally traded a few of those pills, for money..."

124311,479,213,1050000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"So, I guess we're all in the same boat, huh?"
124312,479,214,1053000,Walther Hotenhoffer,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"Nein, nein. My boat is me and hundreds of lawyers. Your boat has you and a lot of people with their eyes falling out."
124313,479,215,1062000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"Walther, when a man puts something on a Frisbee, he should stand by it."
124314,479,216,1066000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,See?
124315,479,217,1068000,Walther Hotenhoffer,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"You are right -- as always, the Frisbee is the mirror to the soul."
124316,479,218,1074000,Secretary,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"Mr. Hotenhoffer, there's a mob outside."
124317,479,219,1076000,Walther Hotenhoffer,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,An angry mob?
124318,479,220,1078000,Secretary,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"No, a cheerful mob."
124319,479,221,1080000,Walther Hotenhoffer,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,I'd like to have just one day when I don't put a gun to my head.
124320,479,222,1089000,Old-timey Farmer,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"Now, I ain't much for speeches..."
124321,479,223,1094000,Old-timey Farmer,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"But we sure do appreciate what you done for us, and we were just hopin' we could get more of that drug. Lots more!"
124323,479,225,1106000,Walther Hotenhoffer,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,Those poor googly-eyed fools. I cannot exploit them like this. I will have to be content exploiting their fear of losing hair and penis. I will destroy the drug.
124324,479,226,1119000,Crowd,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,/ What? Well I never!
124325,479,227,1121000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"Walther, let's not be so hasty. Who would begrudge them a few years of shambling, dope-fogged, into the grave? Besides, our generation's got everything under control! Now, if you'll excuse me, I was supposed to be drunk an hour ago. To Moe's!"
124326,479,228,1140000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,Flat tire? No problem!
124328,479,230,1147000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"Homer, use your head. Just buy a new car!"
124329,479,231,1149000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"Great idea, but I don't have any money."
124330,479,232,1151000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,You could take out a loan with your house as collateral.
124331,479,233,1154000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,And I wouldn't have to pay it back for three more years! What are the odds of that much time happening?
124332,479,234,1159000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"Pretty close to zero, I'd say."
124333,479,235,1161000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,Problem solved. Generation awesome does it again!
124335,479,237,1168000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"All right, you googly-eyed geezers, turn up your hearing aids -- I've got something to say."
124338,479,238,1175000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"Together, we survived the Depression, won a few wars, and put a man on the moon. In fact, the only mistake our generation made was creating that generation."
124339,479,239,1186000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"If we want to set these bumblers straight it's going to take all the crankiness we can muster. So put down those pills, pop in your eyeballs, and ""upside-down"" them smiles!"
124341,479,241,1214000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"Their ""can-do"" will bail out our ""won't-try"" every time!"
124342,479,242,1220000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,So I guess the lesson here is...
124343,479,243,1223000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"If you go on a field trip, don't break off from the group."
124344,479,244,1226000,Walther Hotenhoffer,Springfield Pharmaceuticals,"And if you are a fat little boy in a chocolate factory, never try to drink from the river. The tube! My God! Every night I see the tube!"
