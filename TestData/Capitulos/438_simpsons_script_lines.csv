113574,438,29,206000,Moe Szyslak,CLOSET,"Yeah, you know, my invitation didn't say nothin' about no towels. So I guess we should all just go ""Scandinavian,"" huh? Huh?"

113589,438,44,245000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,I'm afraid his tongue will be in that cast for a few weeks -- it may put something of a cramp in your lovemaking.

113642,438,98,443000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Sure is hot back here.
113643,438,99,446000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, there we go."
113644,438,100,448000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't worry, I won't embarrass you."
113646,438,102,458000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,I used to date your daughter.
113647,438,103,460000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Buddy, I'm here to eat, not make interesting conversation."
113648,438,104,463000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Dad, do you have to hang out at my school? It's bad enough I have to be here three days a week!"
113649,438,105,468000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Well, I know when I'm not wanted. Am I wanted?"
113650,438,106,472000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,No.
113652,438,108,472000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Hi, Homer Simpson. Mind if I sit near your son? Mine sucks."
113653,438,109,479000,Soccer Mom,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Well, we certainly are proud of Noah. He's a straight-A student. Noah, state capitals, alphabetical order, on my clap!"
113654,438,110,486000,Noah,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,Albany! Annapolis Atlanta! Augusta! Austin! Baton Rouge! Bismarck! Boise! Boston! Capital City! Carson City!
113655,438,111,495000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Wow, he's terrified of you."
113656,438,112,499000,Soccer Mom,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,That's why I'm here -- to make sure he gets good grades.
113657,438,113,502000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- you come to school to help him get good grades? Isn't that why we pay public school teachers those enormous salaries?"
113658,438,114,510000,Soccer Mom,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Well, call me over-involved, but some day your son will be my son's chauffeur."
113659,438,115,515000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,Well I hope your son enjoys being driven around by the President of the United States.
113660,438,116,522000,Soccer Mom,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,Really? Let's see what the future President's doing right now.
113662,438,118,531000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Yeah, you don't see many presidents doing that. Maybe L.B.J. -- you know, at the end."
113663,438,119,538000,Soccer Mom,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"It's not your son's fault, it's yours. You have to hover over your kid's shoulder to force him to succeed. It's called ""helicopter parenting."""
113664,438,120,544000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"I don't have to ""helicopter"" Bart -- I've got a backup plan called ""Lisa."""
113665,438,121,548000,Soccer Mom,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Oh right, your second grader. Sure she's smart, but how can she be successful if she's not popular?"
113666,438,122,557000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Um, do you mind if I join you?"
113667,438,123,560000,Popular Girl #1,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Well, that depends. What are you eating?"

113671,438,127,569000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,Is this seat taken?
113672,438,128,571000,Popular Girl #2,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"No, go ahead, take it. Take it way over there."
113674,438,130,580000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Oh my God, my son's a loser and my daughter's a loner. Way to go, Marge!"

113677,438,133,592000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I..."
113678,438,134,594000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No time. I'll just deduce where you were from a list of possibilities in my head.
113679,438,135,600000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That makes sense. Movin' on.
113680,438,136,602000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"...if we don't get more involved in their lives, Bart and Lisa are gonna be failures. Failures who work for... Noah!"
113681,438,137,609000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Noah. I like that name. No-ahhh. Noah. Noah!
113682,438,138,617000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Aren't you the one that usually worries about stuff?
113683,438,139,619000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Am I?
113684,438,140,620000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If Marge doesn't worry about the kids... then that leaves... me! Help me, mayonnaise!"
113686,438,142,636000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Look at all these helicopter parents. I hope Bart's doing okay on his own.
113687,438,143,646000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
113688,438,144,649000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,There's no future in that!
113689,438,145,651000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't forget, children -- Monday is the balsa-wood model-building competition. The American Balsa Council will award this year's winner a thousand-dollar savings bond for their college education."
113690,438,146,661000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,A thousand dollars?! That's what my house is worth!
113691,438,147,666000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart Simpson, what will you be making?"
113692,438,148,668000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'unno.
113694,438,150,670000,Homer Simpson,Hallway,"Time to take control of my son's life. Let's see, what can he build..."
113695,438,151,678000,Homer Simpson,Hallway,Too obvious.
113696,438,152,683000,Homer Simpson,Hallway,Gotta be something from Earth.
113697,438,153,686000,Homer Simpson,Hallway,You're no help.
113698,438,154,689000,Homer Simpson,Hallway,Perfect!

113701,438,157,698000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CLASSROOM,Washington Monument.
113702,438,158,701000,Ralph Wiggum,CLASSROOM,I like Bart's idea.
113703,438,159,703000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CLASSROOM,You're not in this class.
113704,438,160,704000,Ralph Wiggum,CLASSROOM,Willie swept me in here.
113705,438,161,706000,Groundskeeper Willie,CLASSROOM,My mistake.
113706,438,162,710000,Homer Simpson,CLASSROOM,I did it! I helped my son! Helicopter Homer away!

113711,438,165,719000,Homer Simpson,Sidewalk,"Lisa, I found this book in the ""What's Wrong With My Daughter"" section of the bookstore."
113712,438,166,723000,Homer Simpson,Sidewalk,It tells you how you can get popular.
113713,438,167,725000,Lisa Simpson,Sidewalk,"Dad, if I join a clique, I'll be the kind of person I hate."
113714,438,168,728000,Homer Simpson,Sidewalk,"Sweetie, our country was founded by a clique: the Continental Congress. Dolphins swim in cliques. Those are my two examples."
113715,438,169,736000,Lisa Simpson,Sidewalk,"Hmm, well, they are good ones."
113716,438,170,738000,Homer Simpson,Sidewalk,"And to show you how this book works, I will demonstrate on some rats..."
113718,438,172,747000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Let's try what chapter seven calls ""Un-sults"" -- insults disguised as compliments. Hey, Lenny -- it takes a lot of courage to wear suspenders when you're not in the circus."
113719,438,173,760000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Well that's very nice of you-- Hey! You sayin' my clothes are clown-like? Oh God, I feel so insecure! Please be my friend..."
113720,438,174,768000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"See, it works. And un-sults are just the beginning. There's also envy-tations, hate-hugs, spamming with faint praise and... Hey everyone, wanna go get frozen yogurt?"
113721,438,175,778000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I do! / Yeah! / You know it! / Oh boy!
113722,438,176,780000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Ooo, I'm sorry, Moe. I didn't mean everyone everyone. Hope you don't mind."
113723,438,177,785000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"No, oh sure, no, uh no... that's all right."
113724,438,178,792000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"If I didn't sell booze, they probably wouldn't even come here."
113725,438,179,799000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"And that, my dear girl, is called the Toledo Take-back."
113726,438,180,803000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Dad, I don't want to hurt people's feelings."
113727,438,181,805000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I see. Well, maybe you're not ready for this book. It is more of a big girl thing."
113728,438,182,812000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I'm a big girl! I'm a big girl!
113730,438,184,818000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,One of you said something bad about the other.
113731,438,185,821000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,He did?!
113735,438,189,828000,Clerk,Arts And Crafts Store,"Son, you buy an awful lot of airplane glue, but you never buy any models."
113736,438,190,832000,Otto Mann,Arts And Crafts Store,"Oh, uh, right, models... one Messerschmitt M.E.-262, '67 S.S. G.T.O., an Alfred E. Neuman with interchangeable arms..."
113738,438,194,848000,Bart Simpson,Store,"We'd like some balsa wood, please."
113739,438,195,851000,Homer Simpson,Store,Enough to build a Washington Monument.
113740,438,196,853000,Clerk,Store,What scale are you using?
113741,438,197,855000,Homer Simpson,Store,What cologne are you wearing? None of your business! Now we'd like our Washington Monument to be one five-hundredth the size of the real one.
113742,438,198,863000,Seymour Skinner,Store,Washington Monument? Aren't you gonna even try?
113743,438,199,865000,Homer Simpson,Store,What do you mean? And who are you?
113744,438,200,867000,Seymour Skinner,Store,"I'm your son's principal, and the Washington Monument is the most uninspired model choice there is. It's like saying ""I don't care. My kid's a loser."""
113745,438,201,872000,Homer Simpson,Store,"But, you..."
113746,438,202,877000,Homer Simpson,Store,What's the hardest model there is?
113747,438,203,879000,Clerk,Store,"Hmm, that would be Westminster Abbey."
113748,438,204,882000,Homer Simpson,Store,"Attention parents, children and childless weirdoes. My son and I are going to build Westminster Abbey!"
113749,438,205,890000,Helicopter Parents,Store,You've got to be crazy! / Prepare to be frustrated!
113750,438,206,894000,Kirk Van Houten,Store,You won't get past the north transept!
113751,438,207,896000,Homer Simpson,Store,"Hey, how hard can it be? All we have to do is follow the directions."
113753,438,209,911000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, the boy and I will be making Westminster Abbey."
113754,438,210,914000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Blabby's gonna build an Abbey. Groovy.
113755,438,211,918000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But first, as part of ""Operation Popularity,"" Lisa and I are hosting a decorate-your-own-cell-phone party in the back yard."
113756,438,212,925000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Brittany and Kaitlin are here! Where's my spray-on tan?
113757,438,213,931000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ant poison? Why do I always read the labels after?
113758,438,214,937000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ladies, we've got it all. Rhinestones, stickers, tassels... everything to make those hundred dollar phones look like five dollar toys."

113771,438,227,982000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All the other parents are doing it for their kids. Now stand back and I'll take it from here. A little further back.
113772,438,228,991000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Do you want me to watch and learn?
113773,438,229,992000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Naw, that kinda creeps me out."

113809,438,264,1154000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'm sorry. I got carried away. From now on the only thing I'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun. But at least I made Lisa popular.

113821,438,276,1213000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That mattress the dog sleeps on in the cellar?
