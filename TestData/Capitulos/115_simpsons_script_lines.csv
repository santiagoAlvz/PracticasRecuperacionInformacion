23533,115,1,16000,Plumber,Simpson Home,"Uh, looks like you got a leak."
23534,115,2,40000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Could you start fixing it pretty soon? The basement is getting awfully flooded. And I think the cat's down there.
23535,115,3,47000,Plumber,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I probably won't be able to get the parts I need for two--three weeks. And that's if I order 'em today. Which I won't."
23536,115,4,55000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh dear.
23537,115,5,59000,Plumber,Simpson Home,"Hm, emergency call. Gotta go."
23538,115,6,61000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What should we do until you get back?
23539,115,7,63000,Plumber,Simpson Home,Put a pan down there.
23540,115,8,70000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, it didn't work."
23543,115,11,75000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Lousy traffic jams. The traffic report'll get me outta this one.
23544,115,12,80000,Arnie Pye,Simpson Car,This is Arnie Pie.
23546,115,14,83000,Arnie Pye,COPTER,Looks like we got a little accident that's backing traffic up as far as this reporter can see.
23548,115,16,97000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hi, Dad."
23551,115,19,106000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, how come you guys got such great parking places?"
23552,115,20,110000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It's a secret.
23553,115,21,111000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Shh-- shut up.
23555,115,23,121000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Workstation,"All right, Econo-Save, you just made the list."
23557,115,25,129000,Homer Simpson,Lenny and Carl Workstation,"Hey, will you guys help me fix my..."
23558,115,26,133000,Homer Simpson,Lenny and Carl Workstation,"Hey, how come you guys got better chairs than me?"
23559,115,27,137000,Lenny Leonard,Lenny and Carl Workstation,It's a secret.
23560,115,28,139000,Carl Carlson,Lenny and Carl Workstation,Shut up.
23562,115,30,146000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, you guys wanna go bowling tonight?"
23563,115,31,148000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Nah. We're busy.
23564,115,32,149000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, we got uh, things to do."
23565,115,33,151000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Like what?
23566,115,34,153000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It's a secret.
23567,115,35,156000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Shut up.
23570,115,37,157000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays. And they don't tell me where they go. It's like a conspiracy."
23571,115,38,165000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"A conspiracy, eh? You think they might be involved in the Kennedy assassination in some way?"
23572,115,39,169000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I do... now. Anyway, I'm gonna follow them tonight and see where they go."
23573,115,40,174000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer. Don't start stalking people again. It's so illegal. Remember when you were stalking Charles Kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden?"
23574,115,41,182000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, something did."
23575,115,42,184000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
23576,115,43,186000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, okay. Have it your own way, Marge. I'll be back in a minute. I'm going outside. To stalk... ... Lenny and Carl."
23578,115,45,217000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's House,All I have to do is follow the yellow drip road.
23580,115,47,226000,Lenny Leonard,Street,There's our secret meeting place.
23581,115,48,228000,Carl Carlson,Street,Yes. Let's go inside.
23582,115,49,228000,Lenny Leonard,Street,Sounds good!
23585,115,52,235000,Homer Simpson,TEMPLE ROOF,"Hee hee hee! I can see everything. And they're none the wiser, hee hee hee."
23588,115,55,259000,Moe Szyslak,Temple,An intruder!
23589,115,56,260000,Seymour Skinner,Temple,He will pay the ultimate price.
23590,115,57,263000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Temple,"Yes, the ultimate price."
23591,115,58,265000,Moe Szyslak,Temple,Ged oudda heah!
23593,115,60,270000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I saw weird stuff in that place last night. Weird strange sick twisted eerie godless evil stuff. And I want in.
23594,115,61,278000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,We don't know what you're talkin' about Homer.
23595,115,62,281000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,And you can't join the Stonecutters because it's too exclusive.
23596,115,63,284000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh well. That was a real nice secret organization we had once.
23597,115,64,288000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Stonecutters, eh? How do I join?"
23598,115,65,290000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,There are only two ways to gain membership. Be the son of a Stonecutter...
23599,115,66,293000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Next.
23600,115,67,294000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Or save the life of a Stonecutter.
23569,115,68,298000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I saved your life. That egg sandwich could have killed you by cholesterol.
23601,115,69,303000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Forget it, Homer. While it has been established that eggs contain cholesterol, it has not yet been proven conclusively that they actually raise the level of serum cholesterol in the human bloodstream."
23602,115,70,312000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"So, one of those egg-counsel creeps got to you too, huh?"
23603,115,71,314000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You got it all wrong, Homer. It's not like that."
23604,115,72,320000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You'd better run, egg!"
23606,115,74,322000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why don't people like me, Marge?"
23607,115,75,324000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Everyone likes you. You're a wonderful person.
23608,115,76,327000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Then why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks?
23609,115,77,330000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sure it's nothing personal, Homer."
23610,115,78,332000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It is. It's been happening to me all my life.
23612,115,80,338000,Boy,YARD,"Hey, Billy, hey, Joey, come on in. There's plenty of room. Sorry, not you, Homer."
23613,115,81,344000,7-Year-Old Homer,YARD,Why not?
23614,115,82,348000,7-YEAR-OLD-HOMER,YARD,But you let in Homer Glumplet.
23616,115,84,350000,Boy,YARD,"It says ""No Homers."" We're allowed to have one."
23618,115,86,356000,Homer Simpson,YARD,I felt so left out.
23619,115,87,359000,Marge Simpson,YARD,Kids can be so cruel.
23620,115,88,361000,Bart Simpson,YARD,"We can? Thanks, Mom."
23621,115,89,363000,Lisa Simpson,YARD,"Ow! Cut it out, Bart."
23624,115,92,367000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'd give anything to get into the Stonecutters.
23625,115,93,369000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"What do they do there, Dad?"
23626,115,94,370000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm a member.
23627,115,95,372000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What do they do? What don't they do! Oh they do so many things... they never stop... oh the things they do there! My stars.
23628,115,96,380000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You don't know what they do there, do you?"
23629,115,97,381000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not as such, no."
23630,115,98,382000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm a Stonecutter.
23631,115,99,384000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore Grampa?"
23632,115,100,388000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Do I ever! It's five years later and I still think I'm a chicken. I'm a chicken, Marge."
23633,115,101,392000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know, I know."
23635,115,102,393000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe we should be listening to him now.
23636,115,103,395000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm a member.
23637,115,104,397000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh?
23638,115,105,397000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,What?
23639,115,106,398000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What?
23640,115,107,399000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh?
23641,115,108,399000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're a member of the Stonecutters, Grampa?"
23642,115,109,402000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh sure. Let's see...
23643,115,110,404000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm an Elk, a Mason, a Communist... I'm the president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance for some reason... Ah, here it is. The Stonecutters."
23644,115,111,414000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This is it. My ticket in. They have to let me join if I'm the son of a member.
23645,115,112,420000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll take this Communist one too.
23647,115,114,422000,Homer Simpson,Temple,"Comin' through! Can't throw me out! My father's a member! I'm in, I'm in!"
23648,115,115,427000,Lenny Leonard,Temple,"Okay, okay, Homer. You're in. Just don't point that thing at me!"
23649,115,116,430000,Homer Simpson,Temple,"Aw, thanks, Lenny. When am I gonna be initiated?"
23650,115,117,435000,Carl Carlson,Temple,As soon as Number One gets here.
23651,115,118,437000,Homer Simpson,Temple,"Number one? Ha ha. What kind of stupid wiener name is that? ""Hello, my name is Number One."" And so forth."
23652,115,119,447000,Lenny Leonard,Temple,"We call each other by number, not by name. Carl is number 14, I'm number 12. Burnsie is number 29."
23653,115,120,452000,Homer Simpson,Temple,You outrank Mr. Burns here?
23654,115,121,454000,Lenny Leonard,Temple,Sure. Watch. Hey 29! Get over here!
23655,115,122,460000,C. Montgomery Burns,Temple,"Thank you, sir, may I have another?"
23656,115,123,465000,C. Montgomery Burns,Temple,"Patience, Monty. Climb the ladder."
23657,115,124,471000,Homer Simpson,Temple,Is he the leader?
23658,115,125,472000,Moe Szyslak,Temple,Of this chapter. There are chapters all over the world. And it has been foretold that someday a Chosen One will...
23659,115,126,479000,Homer Simpson,Temple,"Okay, okay, I didn't ask for your life story."
23660,115,127,484000,Carl Carlson,Temple,Let the initiation begin.
23661,115,128,487000,Number One,Temple,"All Stonecutters must take the leap of faith. If you survive this five-story plunge, your character will be proven."
23663,115,130,497000,Moe Szyslak,Temple,Happy landings.
23664,115,131,510000,Homer Simpson,Temple,I think I have to do it again. My blindfold came off.
23665,115,132,515000,Number One,Temple,"This ritual is called ""Crossing the Desert."""
23666,115,133,521000,Number One,Temple,"And this we call ""The Unblinking Eye."""
23667,115,134,527000,Homer Simpson,Temple,"Hey, have you ever noticed that the ""Crossing the Desert"" is a lot like ""The Unblinking Eye"" and it's exactly like ""The Wreck of the Hesperus""?"
23668,115,135,533000,Number One,Temple,And now the final ordeal: the paddling of the swollen ass... with paddles.
23669,115,136,544000,Homer Simpson,Temple,And by the Sacred Parchment I swear that if I reveal the secrets of the Stonecutters may my stomach become bloated and my head be plucked of all but three hairs.
23670,115,137,555000,Moe Szyslak,Temple,Um... I think he should have to take a different oath.
23671,115,138,557000,Number One,Temple,Everyone takes the same oath.
23672,115,139,559000,Number One,Temple,"Welcome to the club, Number 908. You have joined the sacred order of the Stonecutters, who since ancient times have split the rocks of ignorance that obscure the light of knowledge and truth. Now let's all get drunk and play Ping-Pong!"
23673,115,140,575000,Moe Szyslak,Temple,...cause he's already kind of heavy you know and...
23675,115,142,581000,Plumber,Simpson Home,"Well to be honest, I never got around to ordering that part for ya, so uh, it's still gonna be a couple of weeks."
23676,115,143,588000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh really?
23677,115,144,589000,Plumber,Simpson Home,Yes.
23678,115,145,590000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Really?
23679,115,146,592000,Plumber,Simpson Home,"Yes, yes."
23680,115,147,593000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But what if I were to shake your hand in this wise?
23681,115,148,597000,Plumber,Simpson Home,"Well, I didn't realize you were a member."
23683,115,150,611000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,"Heh heh heh! So long, suckers!"
23686,115,153,625000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Same old space, huh, Dad?"
23687,115,154,627000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yep, but they gave me these Rollerblades so I can glide to the front door."
23688,115,155,634000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Heh heh heh heh. Sweet.
23689,115,156,641000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Jealous?
23690,115,157,642000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Well... no. We've got the same chair.
23691,115,158,645000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You're jealous.
23692,115,159,647000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Your membership pack.
23693,115,160,649000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What's this?
23694,115,161,650000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You put that sticker on your car so you won't get any tickets. And this other one keeps paramedics from stealing your wallet while they're working on you.
23696,115,162,656000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, and don't bother calling nine one one anymore. Here's the real number."
23699,115,165,662000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I still don't believe all the founding fathers were Stonecutters.
23700,115,166,667000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's because you trust your stupid school books. Here's what really happened at the signing of the Declaration of Independence...
23701,115,167,676000,Last Signer,Simpson Home,... and a nation is born. Now let us party like 'twere seventeen ninety-nine!
23702,115,168,686000,Others,Simpson Home,"Quaff, quaff, quaff, quaff ...!"
23703,115,169,692000,Innkeeper,Simpson Home,"Please, sir. You're destroying my establishment."
23704,115,170,696000,Thomas Jefferson,Simpson Home,"We just created the greatest democracy on earth, you low-life commoner."
23705,115,171,701000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You wanna see how Davy Crockett really died at the Alamo? You must be 18.
23707,115,173,705000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, a man who called himself ""You Know Who"" just invited you to a secret ""wink wink"" at the ""you know what."" You certainly are popular now that you're a Stonecutter."
23708,115,174,716000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, yeah. Beer busts, beer blasts, keggers, stein hoists, AA meetings, beer night. It's wonderful, Marge. I've never felt so accepted in all my life. These people looked deep within my soul, and assigned me a number based on the order in which I joined."
23710,115,176,739000,Stonecutters,Temple,WHO CONTROLS THE BRITISH CROWN? /WHO KEEPS THE METRIC SYSTEM DOWN? / WE DO! WE DO!
23711,115,177,748000,Carl Carlson,Temple,WHO LEAVES ATLANTIS OFF THE MAPS?
23712,115,178,750000,Lenny Leonard,Temple,WHO KEEPS THE MARTIANS UNDER WRAPS? /
23713,115,179,752000,Stonecutters,Temple,WE DO! WE DO!
23714,115,180,756000,Stonecutters,Temple,WHO HOLDS BACK THE ELECTRIC CAR? /
23715,115,181,760000,Stonecutters,Temple,WHO MAKES STEVE GUTTENBERG A STAR? / WE DO! / WE DO!
23716,115,182,769000,Seymour Skinner,Temple,WHO ROBS CAVE FISH OF THEIR SIGHT? /
23717,115,183,771000,Homer Simpson,Temple,WHO RIGS EVERY OSCAR NIGHT? /
23718,115,184,773000,Stonecutters,Temple,WE DO! / WE DO!
23719,115,185,781000,Number One,Temple,"Thank you. Tonight we are here to commemorate our glorious society's 1500th Anniversary. And in honor of this momentous occasion, we're having ribs."
23720,115,186,794000,Homer Simpson,Temple,"Uh-oh. I need a bib. If I slop any on my shirt, I could lose the respect of my beloved brethren."
23722,115,187,801000,Number One,Temple,So let us rejoice and enjoy our meal in the shadow of the hallowed sacred parchment.
23724,115,189,811000,Lenny Leonard,Temple,Homer!
23725,115,190,812000,Homer Simpson,Temple,"Huh? Oh. Yeah. Thanks, Lenny."
23726,115,191,816000,Stonecutters,Temple,/ This is just appalling and outrageous.
23727,115,192,818000,Homer Simpson,Temple,What? Did I miss something?
23729,115,194,823000,Stonecutters,Temple,"Oh God! / Oh Homer, no! / This is outrageous! / You can't do that! / No!"
23730,115,195,827000,Carl Carlson,Temple,You really are stupid.
23731,115,196,834000,Number One,Temple,And the official Stonecutter underwear too.
23733,115,198,844000,Homer Simpson,Temple,Please don't kick me out! This society is everything to me! Please give me another chance! I've learned my lesson.
23734,115,199,850000,Homer Simpson,Temple,I've learned my lesson!
23735,115,200,853000,Stonecutters,Temple,/ That's it!
23736,115,201,856000,Homer Simpson,Temple,Oh. Sorry.
23737,115,202,858000,Number One,Temple,"Homer Simpson: for your continuing and baffling desecration of our beloved sacred parchment, you are hereby banished from the Stonecutters forever. And as a final humiliation, you must walk home naked, dragging behind you the stone of shame."
23738,115,203,887000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Temple,The mark!
23739,115,204,888000,Homer Simpson,Temple,Oh that. It's just a birth mark and I'll thank you not to stare.
23740,115,205,893000,Moe Szyslak,Temple,He's the chosen one!
23741,115,206,897000,Number One,Temple,"You are the Chosen One, whom the sacred parchment prophesied would lead us to glory. Now to the top of Mount Springfield for the coronation! Remove the stone of shame!"
23742,115,207,911000,Homer Simpson,Temple,Woo-hoo!
23743,115,208,913000,Number One,Temple,Attach the stone of triumph.
23745,115,210,931000,Homer Simpson,Temple,Wow. Mental note. Don't overdo this.
23746,115,211,941000,Homer Simpson,Temple,Peek-a-boo!
23748,115,213,948000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I always wondered if there was a god. And now I know. There is. And it's me.
23749,115,214,954000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're not a god, Homer."
23750,115,215,955000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Remember, Dad. All glory is fleeting."
23751,115,216,957000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,So?
23752,115,217,957000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Beware the Ides of March.
23753,115,218,960000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
23754,115,219,960000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I know you think you're happy now, but it's not gonna last forever."
23695,115,220,964000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Everything lasts forever.
23755,115,221,965000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't you see? Getting what you want all the time will ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless.
23756,115,222,970000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Remove the girl.
23757,115,223,971000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you're not with the Stonecutters now. There are no lackeys around to carry out your every..."

23765,115,231,1007000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"No, no, Homer. You have a... royal... sampler."
23766,115,232,1011000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh I win again, don't I? Woo hoo."
23767,115,233,1013000,Stonecutters,Simpson Home,"""Good one, Chosen One."" Etc."

23773,115,239,1037000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Run!
23775,115,241,1043000,Seymour Skinner,Lisa's Classroom,The Grand Exalted Leader requests a moment of your time. Class dismissed.
23776,115,242,1051000,School Kids,Lisa's Classroom,Yay!
23777,115,243,1053000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,"Lisa, you were right. My happiness is fading."
23778,115,244,1057000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,You're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings.
23779,115,245,1062000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,"What do you mean, isolated? ...ated...ated..ated..ated."
23780,115,246,1066000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,Well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people.
23781,115,247,1071000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,"Hm... I could help others. I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the Civil War ."
23782,115,248,1080000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,"Dad, that doesn't help people."
23783,115,249,1082000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,Couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.
23785,115,251,1092000,Homer Simpson,Temple,"Brothers, brothers."
23788,115,253,1095000,Homer Simpson,Temple,"Brothers, I've learned a wonderful lesson. Helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people. So instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us Stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate."
23789,115,254,1116000,Moe Szyslak,Temple,He's gone mad with power. Like that Albert Schweitzer guy.
23790,115,255,1130000,Moe Szyslak,Temple,"Oh, for the love of God! Somebody get the jaws of life!"
23792,115,257,1138000,Kid #3,Temple,Higher! Higher!
23793,115,258,1141000,C. Montgomery Burns,Temple,"Oh I'll give you higher, my filthy little urchin."
23794,115,259,1148000,C. Montgomery Burns,Temple,"You've won this round, but..."
23795,115,260,1150000,Woman,Temple,"Oh, thank you Mr. Simpson. It looks so much better. A beautiful sky-blue."
23797,115,262,1167000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You were right, Lisa. I've never felt so spiritually fulfilled. And with my brothers, the Stonecutters, behind me, this is the beginning of a better world for all of us."
23799,115,264,1179000,Moe Szyslak,Temple,We gotta kill him.
23800,115,265,1181000,Number One,Temple,"Take it easy, Moe. Let's hear from the Stonecutter World Council before we act too rashly."
23801,115,266,1186000,Redenbacher,Temple,Kill him!
23802,115,267,1187000,NICHOLSON,Temple,Kill him!
23803,115,268,1188000,Mr. T,Temple,Kill the fool!
23804,115,269,1189000,BUSH,Temple,"I'm afraid I have to disagree with Orville, Jack, and Mister. Can't we just do something to his voice box?"
23805,115,270,1195000,Number One,Temple,"We might as well face the truth. As long as we're Stonecutters, he will control our lives."
23806,115,271,1201000,Moe Szyslak,Temple,"Maybe... but maybe, we don't want to be Stonecutters no more."
23808,115,273,1215000,Number One,BASKIN ROBBINS,Silence! I now call to order the first meeting of the Ancient Mystic Society of NoHomers.
23809,115,274,1226000,Homer Simpson,BASKIN ROBBINS,"Hey, fellas. Can I join?"
23810,115,275,1229000,Number One,BASKIN ROBBINS,"Sorry, no Homers."
23814,115,279,1233000,Homer Simpson,Stonecutters Lodge,"Loyal stonecutters, let us begin our reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg."
23816,115,281,1241000,Marge Simpson,Stonecutters Lodge,"Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these Colobus monkeys. Somebody's gonna get parasites."
23817,115,282,1248000,Homer Simpson,Stonecutters Lodge,"Oh Marge, kids, I miss my club."
23787,115,283,1251000,Marge Simpson,Stonecutters Lodge,"Aw, Homie. You know, you are a member of a very exclusive club."
23721,115,284,1258000,Homer Simpson,Stonecutters Lodge,The Black Panthers?
23818,115,285,1260000,Marge Simpson,Stonecutters Lodge,"No. The family Simpson, which has just five members. And only two of those members have special rings."
23819,115,286,1269000,Lisa Simpson,Stonecutters Lodge,Yeah!
23820,115,287,1272000,Marge Simpson,Stonecutters Lodge,I meant our wedding rings.
23821,115,288,1276000,Homer Simpson,Stonecutters Lodge,"You know, Marge you're right. The Simpson family is the best possible club I could belong to."
23823,115,290,1288000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,This club'd better be worth it.
23824,115,291,1292000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"All right, all right. It's Lisa's turn."
