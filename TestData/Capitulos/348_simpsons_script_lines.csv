90009,348,1,33000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,Is there anything more fun than a nice Sunday drive?
90010,348,2,36000,Bart Simpson,Marge's Car,"Oh yeah, it's great. Why don't we top it off by reading to old people?"
90011,348,3,40000,Lisa Simpson,Marge's Car,"Well, I think -- in these days of petro-terrorists and ozone depletion -- a Sunday drive reeks of bio-hubris."
90012,348,4,47000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,"Hey, hey, it's Krusty the clown! What do you say, Krusty?"
90013,348,5,51000,Krusty the Clown,Marge's Car,What? Can't I get a cup of coffee without doing a monkey dance for you freaks?
90014,348,6,56000,Krusty the Clown,Marge's Car,The fishing hat means leave me alone!
90015,348,7,59000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,Always nice to see him.
90016,348,8,61000,Bart Simpson,Marge's Car,How did Dad get out of this snooze cruise?
90017,348,9,64000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,He's cleaning out the garage. I can picture it now...
90018,348,10,69000,Muscular Homer,Marge's Car,I cleaned out the garage and lost fifty pounds!
90022,348,13,79000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Hmmm. Seems a shame to chuck out these cross-country skis. I'll keep one.
90023,348,14,88000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Let's see now... ""Kill spiders?"" We don't have spiders."
90025,348,16,100000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Stupid spider... afraid of dying.
90026,348,17,106000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Aha! Huh?
90028,348,19,119000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Spider poison is people poison?!
90029,348,20,122000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Baaart!
90030,348,21,124000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Hm, where's the pain? There it is!"
90032,348,23,135000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,A spider!
90034,348,25,156000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Garage,Homie!
90035,348,26,159000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Garage,Time to open the envelope I gave you.
90037,348,28,168000,Lisa Simpson,GARAGE,Out of the way! I learned CPR while waiting for other kids to finish their math tests.
90038,348,29,178000,Lisa Simpson,GARAGE,Compress his chest!
90039,348,30,179000,Bart Simpson,GARAGE,I'm on it.
90041,348,32,192000,Marge Simpson,GARAGE,"Oh, thank God! He's alive!"
90044,348,35,205000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Honey... your near-fatal boo boo today really scared me. What would the kids and I do if something happened to you?
90045,348,36,216000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry. If I croak, you'll marry Lenny. Or Moe -- the winner will be determined by a card game I invented. I got all the rules written down... up here."
90046,348,37,226000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You keep almost dying. Just look at our vacation photos.
90047,348,38,241000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, if you die, I'm gonna have three kids to take care of. I want you to buy some life insurance. Please?"
90048,348,39,249000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure, if it'll give you peace of mind. But I'm not gonna die for many, many years."
90049,348,40,257000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know, I just wan--"
90053,348,44,274000,Insurance Agent,MERRY WIDOW LIFE INSURANCE,"Mr. Simpson, before we can insure you, we need to ask you some questions. Have you ever had a heart attack?"
90054,348,45,280000,Homer Simpson,MERRY WIDOW LIFE INSURANCE,Haven't we all?
90055,348,46,281000,Insurance Agent,MERRY WIDOW LIFE INSURANCE,Strokes?
90056,348,47,282000,Homer Simpson,MERRY WIDOW LIFE INSURANCE,"None. No wait, three. Since the last one, I don't remember so good."
90057,348,48,288000,Insurance Agent,MERRY WIDOW LIFE INSURANCE,Are you a smoker?
90058,348,49,290000,Homer Simpson,MERRY WIDOW LIFE INSURANCE,Yes I am.
90059,348,50,291000,Marge Simpson,MERRY WIDOW LIFE INSURANCE,You don't smoke!
90060,348,51,292000,Homer Simpson,MERRY WIDOW LIFE INSURANCE,Sssh! I want her to think I'm cool!
90061,348,52,296000,Homer Simpson,MERRY WIDOW LIFE INSURANCE,"If I sign it, it still counts!"
90062,348,53,300000,Homer Simpson,MERRY WIDOW LIFE INSURANCE,My hemophilia!
90063,348,54,304000,Homer Simpson,MERRY WIDOW LIFE INSURANCE,Uninsurable?!
90065,348,56,312000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm not gonna worry just because Homer doesn't have insurance. A lot of people don't!
90066,348,57,317000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"Wifetime TV presents, ""From Homemaker to Homeless..."""
90068,348,59,317000,Brenda,Simpson Home,"Oh Roger, I just love our present lifestyle..."
90069,348,60,326000,Roger,Simpson Home,"Don't thank me, thank our many debts and obligations."
90070,348,61,333000,Brenda,Simpson Home,"Honey, stop kidding around. Honey?!"
90072,348,63,340000,Banker,Bank,"Brenda, I'm afraid your husband had no insurance."
90073,348,64,343000,Brenda,Bank,Well how will I feed my family?
90074,348,65,345000,Banker,Bank,You should have thought of that before you had children with a dead man.
90076,348,67,350000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, this is only based on a story. A true story!"
90078,348,69,357000,Fashionable Lady,Street,Brenda! Where's your wealth?
90079,348,70,360000,Brenda,Street,"Gone. Along with my sanity. But I'm still pretty, right? Right?"
90080,348,71,371000,Announcer,Street,The real Brenda later went to Harvard medical school... as a cadaver.
90081,348,72,371000,Marge Simpson,Street,We need to start saving!
90082,348,73,374000,Marge Simpson,Street,Go easy on that -- it's gotta last 'til you're five.
90085,348,76,385000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Budget-O's""?"
90086,348,77,387000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's right. It's much less expensive than the leading clown-based cereal. You just have to assemble it yourself.
90087,348,78,398000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We saved fifty cents on that purchase!
90088,348,79,403000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, why are you so worried about money?"
90089,348,80,404000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, we're just saving for... a very rainy day."
90091,348,81,409000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean when the big tuna goes belly-up?
90092,348,82,411000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh?
90093,348,83,412000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I just think we should be building a nest egg."
90094,348,84,415000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Way ahead of you, Marge -- I just ordered a series of tapes on saving money. They should get here soon. I paid a bundle for over-night delivery."
90095,348,85,422000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I have a book from the library with the same information!
90096,348,86,425000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay. I'll just hire a haulage firm to cart them away... at my expense!
90097,348,87,431000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Directory assistance?
90098,348,88,432000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No more directory assistance! It's not free!
90099,348,89,434000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'll get a lawyer on that. No, a whole team of lawyers. Who will dine on mustard flown in from the Orient."
90100,348,90,440000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No more oriental mustard!
90102,348,92,445000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,It's so embarrassing Mom is making us wear clothes from Goodwill.
90103,348,93,451000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw-haw! People died in those shirts.
90105,348,95,466000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, hey, hey. No outside suds!"
90106,348,96,469000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I'm sorry, Moe. Marge won't let me spend any money -- even counterfeit money!"
90108,348,98,476000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's my money... I'm the one who earns it... drinking beer out of a thermos like an animal...
90109,348,99,483000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Can you help me unload this soup from the car? There was a sale, so I bought four hundred cans."
90110,348,100,488000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, your penny-pinching rampage has gone too far."
90111,348,101,491000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Honey, I know it's not easy, but we've got to put money away."
90112,348,102,496000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You can't enjoy money when you're dead, so why not have fun now?"
90113,348,103,500000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't you think you've had enough ""fun?"""
90114,348,104,503000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Last year, you spent five thousand dollars on donuts, two thousand on scalp massages, five hundred on body glitter--"
90115,348,105,511000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I earn that money -- while you lounge around here, doing laundry and putting up drywall, I'm at work busting my hump."
90116,348,106,517000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh please. From what I hear, you waltz in there at 10:30, take a nap on the toilet, then sit around ""Google""-ing your own name until lunch."
89968,348,107,526000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who told you that?
90117,348,108,527000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You shouted it while we were making love! Now look here, Mister. I pay the bills, I do the budget, and I'm in charge of the money."
90118,348,109,543000,George Washington,Simpson Home,Are you going to let her push you around?
90119,348,110,545000,Andrew Jackson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, show that skirt who's boss, see?"
90120,348,111,548000,Benjamin Franklin,Simpson Home,"Give us our independence, Homer!"
90121,348,112,550000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, President Franklin."
90122,348,113,551000,Benjamin Franklin,Simpson Home,"I, uh, was never president. I invented some kind of stove."
90123,348,114,556000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I invented a Popsicle made of Mountain Dew."
90124,348,115,559000,Benjamin Franklin,Simpson Home,Sweet.
90125,348,116,560000,Andrew Jackson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, yeah, that's swell."
90127,348,118,570000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My scrimpings!
90129,348,120,580000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You banged?
90130,348,121,581000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Did you spend our savings on a motor home?
90131,348,122,584000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I spent our savings on the down payment for a motor home. I need a castle where I can be king!"
90132,348,123,591000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well I hope you enjoy it, your majesty -- 'cause I'm not speaking to you!"
90133,348,124,605000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Dammit!
90135,348,126,609000,Homer Simpson,Motor Home,"Kids, your mother and I have decided to take a little break from each other. While we deal with our issues, I plan to go on ""Motorhome Makeover"" and trick this thing out like a palace, not like that dump you live in. All I need is for someone to start a show called ""Motorhome Makeover."""
90136,348,127,625000,Bart Simpson,Motor Home,"I see. You were mad enough to leave our house, but not mad enough to leave our property? That's my half-assed Dad!"
90137,348,128,632000,Homer Simpson,Motor Home,"Hey, I couldn't leave you kids. You're like my own family. Now check this place out!"
90138,348,129,639000,Lisa Simpson,Motor Home,"Neat! When I sleep at Dad's, I call this bed."
90139,348,130,642000,Bart Simpson,Motor Home,You can have it -- this one's way better.
90140,348,131,644000,Lisa Simpson,Motor Home,That's a bread compartment.
90141,348,132,645000,Bart Simpson,Motor Home,You're a bread compartment!
90142,348,133,646000,Marge Simpson,Motor Home,"Kids, come back in the house!"
90143,348,134,648000,Bart Simpson,Motor Home,"Oh, do we have to?"
90144,348,135,650000,Marge Simpson,Motor Home,I melted string cheese over some corn chips!
90145,348,136,652000,Lisa Simpson,Motor Home,Oh boy!
90148,348,138,653000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,I've got Gameboys and caramel apples!
90149,348,139,655000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,I'll let you sass me!
90150,348,140,657000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,I'll let you punch me!
90151,348,141,658000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,You can wear swimsuits instead of underwear!
90152,348,142,661000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,We'll have Christmas tomorrow!
90153,348,143,663000,Lisa Simpson,Backyard,Yay!
90155,348,145,664000,Homer Simpson,Gas Station,Woo hoo! Free gas!
90156,348,146,681000,New England Rv-er,Gas Station,"Well, it's a pleasure to meet another sultan of the slow lane. That's my rig over there."
90157,348,147,685000,New England Rv-er,Gas Station,She's a Roam-a-way SilverCoach. Thirty-four feet of walnut-burled freedom.
90158,348,148,692000,Homer Simpson,Gas Station,"Boy, I wouldn't mind driving that to the Holland, Michigan Tulip Festival."
90159,348,149,696000,New England Rv-er,Gas Station,"I'm lookin' for a place to dock the beast. I don't mean you, Martha."
90160,348,150,700000,Martha,Gas Station,I've never loved you either. We use jokes to mask our pain at the death of our son. Really.
90161,348,151,709000,Homer Simpson,Gas Station,"Hmmm. A place to dock, eh? I got room -- I have a back yard that makes my front yard look like an idiot."
90162,348,152,716000,New England Rv-er,Gas Station,Can I bring the rest of the convoy?
90163,348,153,720000,Homer Simpson,Gas Station,Are you crazy? Let twelve complete strangers live on my lawn?
90164,348,154,724000,New England Rv-er,Gas Station,"Well, we'll give you regional beers."
90165,348,155,726000,Homer Simpson,Gas Station,It's a deal! Woo hoo!
90166,348,156,728000,New England Rv-er,Gas Station,And there you have it.
90168,348,158,730000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Welcome, welcome. If my wife asks, you're here for a Boz Skaggs concert."
90169,348,159,735000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer!
90170,348,160,737000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What are all these recreational vehicles doing here?
90171,348,161,740000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,These are my new friends. They like me for me... and my plumbing and gas hookups.
90172,348,162,747000,New England Rv-er,Simpson Home,"Young lady, I like what you're driving -- is that one of them two-level Wander-Kings?"
90173,348,163,752000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This is a house!
90174,348,164,759000,Southern Rv-er,Simpson Home,"Hey boys, let's play her the RV National Anthem!"
90176,348,166,768000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,"Daddy, all the fumes are making me dizzy."
90177,348,167,770000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Well now Roddy, the Lord wouldn't let us die this way."
90178,348,168,773000,Jesus,Flanders Home,"That's right, Ned. Now you three take a little nap while I make some hot chocolate."
90021,348,169,778000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,Yay!
90179,348,171,782000,Southern Rv-er,Simpson Home,"I'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE, MAN / I'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE / OF TRAVEL, I'VE DONE MY SHARE, MAN / I'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE / I'VE BEEN TO SPRINGFIELD, SHELBYVILLE, OGDENVILLE, CAP CITY, / OGDENBERG, SHELBYTOWN, SPRING CITY, CAPFIELD, / WEST SPRINGFIELD, PARIS, ROME, AND SHELBYVILLE ADJACENT..."
90181,348,173,798000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's a lot of places.
90182,348,174,801000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I know another place you can go -- to sleep!
90183,348,175,804000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Marge. We've got the power now. And you can't turn us off!"
90184,348,176,811000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Can't turn off the power, eh?"
90186,348,178,817000,Square Dance Caller,Backyard,SASHAY THIS AND FANCY THAT / WATCH THE DOG DANCE WITH THE CAT...
90188,348,180,826000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,"Lights out, weirdoes!"
90189,348,181,834000,Southern Rv-er,Backyard,"I was making a Monte Cristo sandwich when my crisper cut out. It's not golden brown, it's not brown, it's not nothin'. Damn."
90192,348,184,854000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't belong on the lawn. You belong in your bed with your wife!
90193,348,185,858000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's no marriage bed -- it's a loveless slab of bossiness!
90194,348,186,862000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you're not perfect either!"
90195,348,187,865000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Name one way I'm not!
90196,348,188,867000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You hide food in my hair... you think brushing your teeth is foreplay...
90197,348,189,871000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll have you know I could have married Sideshow Mel!
90198,348,190,875000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boy, they're really going at it. Do you think they're gonna get divorced?"
90199,348,191,878000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I don't see Dad doing all that paperwork."
90200,348,192,881000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I seem to recall you asked me to get this fat!
90201,348,193,884000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh boy. Let's get out of here before Dad does a bad impression of Mom.
90202,348,194,889000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm Marge Simpson. Don't eat off the floor.
90204,348,196,892000,Marge Simpson,YARD,And I'm so sick of that story about finding an onion ring in your French fries. It was twenty years ago!
90205,348,197,902000,Homer Simpson,YARD,That was my Woodstock!
90209,348,199,905000,Bart Simpson,Motor Home,You know what started all this trouble? This motor home. How could a vehicle this cool destroy a marriage that crappy?
90210,348,200,912000,Lisa Simpson,Motor Home,"Hey, I know this is a crazy idea, but hear me out. What if we..."
90211,348,201,915000,Bart Simpson,Motor Home,Take this back to the dealer?
90212,348,202,918000,Lisa Simpson,Motor Home,"Wow, I was gonna say ""call Reverend Lovejoy,"" but I guess this could work."
90214,348,204,921000,Homer Simpson,House,"Oh yeah, Marge? What about my womanly needs?"
90217,348,207,933000,Bart Simpson,RV,"Slowly, slowly -- the RV dealer is across town under that gorilla blimp."
90218,348,208,940000,Lisa Simpson,RV,How do you know that's their blimp?
90219,348,209,941000,Bart Simpson,RV,Duh! It's Kamper Kong.
90221,348,211,946000,Salesman,RV DEALERSHIP,"Bob, word on the street is there's two kids trying to return an RV."
90222,348,212,950000,Cowboy Bob,RV DEALERSHIP,Return an RV?! Return an RV?!
90223,348,213,954000,Cowboy Bob,RV DEALERSHIP,Tie me to the Kong and cut its tethers.
90225,348,215,957000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't take anything seriously. Not even your bankruptcy hearing!
90226,348,216,962000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, that judge thought I rocked. Case closed! Although my case is still open."
90228,348,218,966000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"If you need me, I'll be in my trailer!"
90229,348,219,972000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"My RV is gone! It was more than a motor home. It was a car I could go to the bathroom in. Hey, a note."
90231,348,221,983000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Dear Mom and Dad: We don't want you guys to split up, so we're driving the RV back to the dealer."" We've got to stop them."
90232,348,222,993000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, this is a parent's worst nightmare! They've stolen a car and they're home alone."
90234,348,224,1001000,Lisa Simpson,RV,"Let's see, the RV dealership is across the freeway on the corner of... hey, this is a Flintstones Fun Map."
