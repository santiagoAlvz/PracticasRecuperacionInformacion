119594,462,3,90000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Union Station,Why couldn't you have died instead of the car?

119603,462,11,128000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Anyway, here's my little tale. As the town's bartender, I know everyone's problems. And everyone's got problems -- especially the married ones."
119605,462,13,139000,Moe Szyslak,Lovejoy Home,Be they bible-thumper...
119606,462,14,141000,Helen Lovejoy,Lovejoy Home,Timothy! I finished saying my prayers...

119612,462,20,157000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,1980s Volkswagen Mini-van,Where did we get this dreck?
119613,462,21,159000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,1980s Volkswagen Mini-van,Typical. Here's the kind of lullaby my sweet mother sang to me:
119615,462,23,169000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,1980s Volkswagen Mini-van,"Why do you always change it to ""Sanskrit 93.7: The Dot?"""
119616,462,24,173000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,1980s Volkswagen Mini-van,"I like Rajiv, Rubaba and the Big Brahmin in the morning! No caste is safe from their merry japes!"
119617,462,25,179000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,1980s Volkswagen Mini-van,Having a Ma-hot-ma or Man-not-ma contest is not a jape! It is sexist sacrilege! I hate that channel!
119618,462,26,186000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,1980s Volkswagen Mini-van,But you have so much in common with them: nonstop chatter during drive time!
119619,462,27,190000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,1980s Volkswagen Mini-van,Take it back.
119620,462,28,191000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,1980s Volkswagen Mini-van,I take it back.
119622,462,30,193000,Moe Szyslak,Evergreen Terrace,"And now you're probably wondering, what's this all building to?"
119624,462,32,197000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,It's a timeless tale of the... hello! Are you seein' what I'm seein' here? Ooh! This omniscient point of view has got some surprising bonuses! Yeah.
119625,462,33,208000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"No, no, no, no. What the hell was I talking about?"
119626,462,34,212000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Oh yeah! It was just before Mothers' Day...
119627,462,35,214000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,I destroyed my body to give birth to you!
119631,462,36,221000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Kids, this Mother's Day, why don't you give your mom what she really wants: a break from you! Have your dads take all you annoying kids on a Krusty Krustival Kruiseline Day-Kruise to historic Weasel Island, one of America's ten roundest islands!"
119632,462,37,238000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Explore a dark, dark weasel cave!"
119633,462,38,242000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Tour the historic Civil War prison, and picnic where the bodies were once stacked like cordwood."
119634,462,39,247000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Plus some kind of amusement park!
119635,462,40,249000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"Warning, you may not be amused."
119636,462,41,251000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You guys should go on that cruise. You'll have a great time, and you kids can spend the day getting to know your father..."
119637,462,42,257000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I like beer, hot dogs, and long blackouts on the beach."
119638,462,43,261000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And I can spend my Mother's Day taking care of something I've been putting off for a long time.
119639,462,44,266000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Cleaning the gutters?
119640,462,45,268000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's something you've been putting off.
119641,462,46,270000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Cartoons! Everybody be quiet!
119642,462,47,314000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, Marge, what were we talking about?"
119643,462,48,317000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why do I waste my breath?
119644,462,49,319000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, honey. I wasn't listening. And I won't be listening now."
119645,462,50,325000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Homer, what do you think Mom meant by ""taking care of something?"""
119646,462,51,329000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son, I'm a bit of an expert on the female gender, and I can tell you: women don't mean anything by anything."
119647,462,52,336000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad! That's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife.
119648,462,53,340000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I hear what you're saying, Lisa -- nothing."
119650,462,55,346000,Homer Simpson,Ocean Ferry Docks,"Into the playpen, sweetie. And if you get hungry, there's lobster!"
119654,462,59,359000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Boat,"Special delivery letter for Misters Simpson, Lovejoy and Nahasapeemapetilon!"
119656,462,61,377000,Homer Simpson,Boat,It's from Moe!
119657,462,62,379000,Moe Szyslak,Boat,"""Dear friends, I have some news that is doubly sad -- first off, I am leaving town forever. And my going away present? One of your wives is running off with me."""
119628,462,63,386000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Boat,One of our wives is leaving us for Moe?!
119629,462,64,391000,Homer Simpson,Boat,Moe's leaving town?!
119658,462,65,393000,Moe Szyslak,Boat,Perhaps I should've told you in person. But there's no easy way to say goodbye forever. So I'll say it the hardest way I can: in Mandarin Chinese. Zai jian yong yuan!
119660,462,67,400000,Moe Szyslak,Boat,"And now, as our teakettle starts to toot, I'm gonna take a little break. Boy, this voiceover thing is killin' me. Whatever that Don Pardo gets paid, it ain't enough."
119661,462,68,412000,Don Pardo,Boat,I make more than you can possibly imagine. And I'm making it right now.
119662,462,69,417000,Moe Szyslak,Boat,Where are you?
119664,462,71,422000,Homer Simpson,FERRY DECK,Moe is running off with one of our wives?!
119665,462,72,426000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,FERRY DECK,"Well, the stationery's legit. It's got the Moe watermark."
119666,462,73,429000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,FERRY DECK,"So I guess the question is, which of our wives got Moe-jacked?"
119667,462,74,434000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FERRY DECK,"Well, I will end the suspense with a simple cellular phone call to Manjula."
119668,462,75,441000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FERRY DECK,No signal?!
119669,462,76,441000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,FERRY DECK,No battery?!
119670,462,77,442000,Homer Simpson,FERRY DECK,I got Marge!
119671,462,78,442000,Marge Simpson,FERRY DECK,Homer?
119672,462,79,444000,Homer Simpson,FERRY DECK,Marge! Are you running off with Moe?!
119673,462,80,446000,Marge Simpson,FERRY DECK,Homer? I'm-- you!
119674,462,81,448000,Homer Simpson,FERRY DECK,You're losing me? Or you're leaving me?!
119675,462,82,450000,Marge Simpson,FERRY DECK,We're breaking up!
119676,462,83,452000,Homer Simpson,FERRY DECK,Aw dammit!
119677,462,84,456000,Marge Simpson,FERRY DECK,Homer?
119678,462,85,457000,Homer Simpson,FERRY DECK,Can't talk! Must text!
119679,462,86,459000,Homer Simpson,FERRY DECK,"Marge, have u left me 4..."
119681,462,88,466000,Sailor,FERRY DECK,We needed that pole to hook the dock.
119682,462,89,472000,Sailor,FERRY DECK,Most of our cargo is explosives.
119685,462,92,483000,Bart Simpson,Civil War Prison,You rebel scum make me sick! This is sweet justice for how you greybacks treated our boys at Andersonville!
119686,462,93,491000,Bart Simpson,Civil War Prison,Hyaa! Hyaa!
119687,462,94,491000,Lisa Simpson,Civil War Prison,"When there's cruelty involved, Bart sure knows his history."
119688,462,95,494000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Civil War Prison,"Well, if Moe were leaving with one of our wives, it wouldn't be my Helen. We just started a new jigsaw puzzle last week. We're still on the edges!"
119690,462,96,503000,Homer Simpson,Civil War Prison,"Well, Marge and I don't have any problems. We never even fight anymore."
119691,462,97,508000,Homer Simpson,Civil War Prison,What?
119692,462,98,510000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Civil War Prison,"When a woman is peaceful and content, that means all hell is about to break loose!"
119693,462,99,515000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Civil War Prison,"Think back, Homer. When did you first realize Marge was checked out like a Harry Potter book at the public library? Think back. Think back. Think back..."
119695,462,101,527000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,CRIB,Not that far back.
119697,462,103,531000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer my Mother's party's starting any minute. Get busy.
119698,462,104,537000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Moe, my in-laws are coming. I need something strong enough that I forget I hate them, but not so strong that I tell them I love them."
119699,462,105,545000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Sorry Homer, I ain't servin' no liquor. Just ""O'Glums"" non-alcohol beer."
119700,462,106,550000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, this is crazy!"
119701,462,107,552000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This is my mother's eightieth birthday party and you're not ruining it. You'll have a good time. I invited a friend for you.
119702,462,108,559000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Knock-a-doodle-you!
119703,462,109,559000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Flanders?!
119704,462,110,563000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Neighbor, Marge invited me over to be the little angel on your shoulder, so you wouldn't listen to the four hundred devils on the other."
119708,462,114,577000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,"Hey, Chunky with the Pants of Meatballs."
119709,462,115,580000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,Take our picture.
119710,462,116,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,All right.
119711,462,117,583000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,I wasn't smiling!
119712,462,118,584000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,What the--
119713,462,119,585000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,I had something in my teeth.
119714,462,120,586000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Why you--
119715,462,121,587000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,My eyes were shut.
119716,462,122,588000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Lousy--
119717,462,123,589000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,My sweater's on backwards!
119719,462,125,589000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,He can't do anything right.
119720,462,126,593000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,Except setting off car alarms with his big fat footsteps.
119721,462,127,596000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,You take that back!
119724,462,129,604000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Go ugly up someone else's house, you penis-curling she-devils!"
119725,462,130,608000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,You got it. / We're not staying where we're not wanted.
119726,462,131,611000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Every time I plan something that means something to me you somehow mess it up.
119727,462,132,623000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"I need some cash, man."
119728,462,133,628000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"""You will lose all your money."" We'll see about that!"
119730,462,135,641000,Bart Simpson,Weasel Island,"One, please."
119731,462,136,642000,Carny,Weasel Island,You had that scar before you got on.
119732,462,137,645000,Bart Simpson,Weasel Island,What scar?
119733,462,138,645000,Carny,Weasel Island,"Oh, you'll find out."
119734,462,139,648000,Carny,Weasel Island,"...oh, man do I make the soup. My goodness do I make the soup."
119735,462,140,655000,Homer Simpson,Weasel Island,I'm doomed.
119736,462,141,656000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Weasel Island,"Now, we don't know for sure it's your wife."
119737,462,142,659000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Weasel Island,It could be yours!
119738,462,143,660000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Weasel Island,"Oh, no sir. My marriage is solid. Manjula would never cheat on me like I cheated on-- Hoo-boy."
119739,462,144,666000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Weasel Island,"That's right. Now, was there ever a time when your wife might have found comfort in Moe's hairy arms? Think back, Apu. Think back, Apu."
119742,462,147,684000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,May we use your restroom to change our kids out of their cricket uniforms?
119743,462,148,687000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,We got caught in the rain because someone wouldn't use international short form rules.
119744,462,149,692000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Calm down there, 'Pu and She-Pu. You can use the restroom."
119745,462,150,695000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,My one day off and it's miserable.
119746,462,151,699000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,This is my day everyday!
119747,462,152,701000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,You see this? I'm playing the world's smallest sitar for you.
119749,462,154,709000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,One-two-three-four-five-six... We are missing a tuplet!
119750,462,155,713000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,We must have left it at that godforsaken pub!
119751,462,156,716000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,How could you forget your own child?
119752,462,157,718000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,How could you forget your own child?!
119754,462,158,720000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,"Oh, I can't believe I married you. What my grandfather saw in your grandfather, I will never know."
119755,462,159,722000,Moe Szyslak,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,"Uh, hey 'Pu. I just want you to know that I got one of your kids here. This ain't a kidnapping thing, but if you're in the mood to give me a million dollars, that's cool. This should not be interpreted by federal agents as a threat. Once again, no threat, but will take the dough."
119756,462,160,742000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,"Well, one of us has to go back to Moe's... maybe have a beer or two... shoot a game of pool, and if I win I have to play the challenger, such are the customs of billiards..."
119757,462,161,753000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,"What a great father, I say sarcastically!"
119758,462,162,757000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,If only that mark on your forehead was an off-button!
119759,462,163,761000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,"Hours later, she returned -- smelling of beer and pickled eggs. I know no more."
119760,462,164,766000,Homer Simpson,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,Uh... I do.
119761,462,165,768000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,You do?! Tell me!
119762,462,166,769000,Homer Simpson,Street In Front Of Apu And Manjula's Apartment,"I was there when your wife got to Moe's, being my usual effervescent self..."
119764,462,168,779000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, thank you for saving my precious...Gheet!"
119765,462,169,784000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Sounds like you had a rough day.
119766,462,170,788000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,It's true.
119767,462,171,789000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,My eyes have more bags than the Darjeeling Limited.
119768,462,172,793000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, that's probably a good one. Here, I got somethin' that might cheer ya up."
119769,462,173,797000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"I got this for women that came to the bar, and Low-Blow Boxing for the guys."
119770,462,174,802000,Boxer,Moe's Tavern,My nards! My nards! My nards!
119771,462,175,805000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"So uh, would you like to cut one? I mean a rug. Oh God, I always say the wrong thing."
119772,462,176,816000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,You said you'd be home by seven to help with my mother's birthday!
119774,462,178,822000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,Then what happened?
119775,462,179,822000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I don't know.
119776,462,180,825000,Carny,Moe's Tavern,"Teacup? How'd that get in there? Question me, you little rutabaga brain, I'll take your eyeball and make soup out of it."
119778,462,181,833000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,"Well, how can you be so sure your wife is not the putty in the bartender's hands?"
119779,462,182,836000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, Padre. How innocuous are your flashbacks?"
119780,462,183,840000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Moe's Tavern,Well... I... uh...
119781,462,184,844000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,The ferry will be back in ten minutes. It'll take us home... to find out the truth.
119782,462,185,851000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,The truth...
119783,462,186,851000,Ralph Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,The roof...
119785,462,188,857000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I'm still mad at you from last night.
119786,462,189,859000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Today's the first, which means it was last month, which means you're being ridiculous."
119787,462,190,865000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,I'm glad we never argue like that.
119788,462,191,868000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Yes, to argue, you have to actually talk to each other."
119789,462,192,871000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Way to bitch up the conversation, Helen."
119791,462,194,875000,Parson,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, Tim...as your spiritual advisor, I'm afraid you two have a b-b-b-big problem."
119792,462,195,882000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Me and Helen? We're as happy as Adam and Eve before Eve munched us all to Hell.
119793,462,196,889000,Parson,First Church of Springfield,"I'm gonna let you in on a little trick they taught us in Divinity School. Now take a look at Helen over there. She seems happy as a clam, am I right?"

119822,462,231,1031000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My mother explained that what happened at the party wasn't your fault.
119823,462,232,1035000,Jacqueline Bouvier,Simpson Home,It's that Patty and Selma. There's something evil about them. Did you know they smoked when I was pregnant?
119824,462,233,1041000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Marge, you not leaving with Moe is the best thing that never happened to me."
119826,462,235,1048000,Otto Mann,Bus,"Okay Reverend, your place is next."

119838,462,246,1094000,Helen Lovejoy,Lovejoy's Bedroom,Is that a train in your pocket or are you happy to see me?

119843,462,251,1114000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu and Manjula's Apartment Building,I feel the pain of a thousand Squishee headaches.
119845,462,253,1122000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apartment,My worst fears confirmed.
119846,462,254,1125000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apartment,"Apu, this man has come here to convince me to do something I never thought I would do... stay with you."
119847,462,255,1130000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apartment,You mean you are not leaving me for him?
119848,462,256,1133000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apartment,"Don't be ridiculous. What am I, blind and noseless?"
119849,462,257,1137000,Moe Szyslak,Apartment,"Hey, hey, I'm right here."
119850,462,258,1138000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apartment,"Believe me, I know. Apu, our marriage will never be easy. But nothing worth doing is ever easy."
119851,462,259,1145000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apartment,It is true. The tastiest ice cream is the hardest to scoop.
119852,462,260,1149000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apartment,But if you wrap something warm around it...
119854,462,262,1153000,Moe Szyslak,Apartment,"Very nice. Well all's well that ends well, huh?"
119855,462,263,1155000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apartment,"Yes, except for... Why did you write that horrible letter?"
119856,462,264,1159000,Moe Szyslak,Apartment,When I saw how much trouble your marriages were in...
119857,462,265,1163000,Moe Szyslak,Apartment,I knew I had to act fast.
119858,462,266,1166000,Moe Szyslak,Apartment,"I got Marge's mother to go to Marge, convinced Helen to ride the rails of romance with the padre, then I bought some roadside corn, ate it raw, got a kernel in my teeth, flossed with the corn silk, and then I came over to fix things with Manjula."
119859,462,267,1179000,Moe Szyslak,Apartment,And I wrote that letter so you three chumps would realize that you have not been treatin' your wives the way they deserve. Think of it as a wakeup call from a man who ain't got nothin' but a blowup doll. And even she left me. Should not have used helium.
119860,462,268,1193000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,"Moe, I don't know whether to punch you or kiss you... so I'm gonna do both."
119861,462,269,1200000,Moe Szyslak,Apartment,"So all you mugs out there, be sure you don't take for granted the woman you love. Oh, and it's Mother's Day, so call your ma."
119863,462,270,1209000,Moe Szyslak,Apartment,"Take her down to the diner at the department store there. Get her a roast beef on rye. Oh, and make sure she gets a fruit cup on the side -- she's worth it."
