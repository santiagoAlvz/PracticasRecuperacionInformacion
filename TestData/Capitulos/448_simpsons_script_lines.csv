115811,448,77,423000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,Why did I do Poetry Club instead of Girl Scouts? Why did I do Poetry Club instead of Girl Scouts?
115812,448,78,429000,Mysterious Voices,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"Dark is she, but brilliant! Black are her wings, black on black!"
115813,448,79,436000,Hooded Figures,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"She is Lilith, who leadeth forth the hordes of the Abyss!"

115821,448,87,470000,Esmeralda,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,We're Wiccans.
115822,448,88,470000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,You mean... witches?
115823,448,89,470000,Gwendolyn,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"Technically, but we're not into broomsticks, or pointy hats..."
115824,448,90,470000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"Well I'm glad you're not ""witches."" Wouldn't want you to ""cast a spell"" on me."

115826,448,92,471000,Cassandra,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,And they work.
115827,448,93,471000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"Sure they do. If magic was real, I'd use it to get out of my pipe cleaner art project that's due tomorrow."
115828,448,94,471000,Cassandra,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,You should keep an open mind.
115829,448,95,471000,Gwendolyn,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,Things said in the circle have a surprising way of coming true.
115830,448,96,471000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,Lisa! Lisa!

115833,448,99,471000,Cassandra,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,What are you talking about?
115834,448,100,471000,Gwendolyn,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,Text your Mom to pick us up.
115835,448,101,471000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"Oh sweetie, I found you! Now, who's gonna find us? Help!"
115836,448,102,471000,Homer Snowman,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,Uh-oh.
115838,448,104,471000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I have one minute to avoid my first late assignment ever. The pipe cleaner fur is coming off on my hands!
115839,448,105,471000,Substitute Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,"Class, Miss Hoover will not be in today, so you'll get A's on your pipe-cleaner sculptures."
115841,448,107,471000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What happened to Miss Hoover?
115842,448,108,471000,Substitute Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,Came down with a spell of stomach flu.
115843,448,109,471000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Spell? Those girls couldn't have made her sick... or could they?
115844,448,110,471000,Substitute Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,Maybe we'll pass the time with another craft project. I'll let one of you pick. Uh... Lisa? Which craft?
115846,448,112,471000,Substitute Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,Which craft?
115848,448,114,471000,Substitute Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,Which craaaaaaft?!!
115851,448,117,471000,Cletus Spuckler,SPRINGFIELD HILL COUNTRY,"This here country's home to over three hundred family-owned stills. None of them big corporate moonshiners, like Crazy-Think White Lightnin', or Dwayne Saggery's Demento Juice. So let's go taste some independent hooch!"
115854,448,120,471000,Carl Carlson,Cletus's Shack,"Hey, thanks for bringin' us down here, Homer."
115855,448,121,471000,Lenny Leonard,Cletus's Shack,Yeah. There's somethin' wonderful about being drunk outdoors.
115856,448,122,471000,Carl Carlson,Cletus's Shack,I wonder if Moe misses us.
115857,448,123,471000,Moe Szyslak,Cletus's Shack,"No, I don't miss ya."
115858,448,124,471000,Moe Szyslak,Cletus's Shack,Now get back to my bar for happy hour or I'll paint the snow pink with your brains!
115859,448,125,471000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,"Drop your firesticks, man-possum!"
115860,448,126,471000,Moe Szyslak,Cletus's Shack,"Oh, uh, so, uh, I guess this means you hillbillies are gonna have your way with me. Huh?"
115861,448,127,471000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,"Oh fer God's sake! Y'know, one hillbilly has his way with one fat guy in ""Deliverance,"" and suddenly people think that's all hillbillies do!"
115862,448,128,471000,Bearded Hillbilly,Cletus's Shack,"I s'pose you think all space is ""Star Wars!"""
115863,448,129,471000,Moe Szyslak,Cletus's Shack,"No, I thought that we had a connection here, and we're out in the woods and everything, and... hey, forget it. I ain't gonna beg for it."
115864,448,130,471000,Moe Szyslak,Cletus's Shack,You'll never know what you missed out on!
115866,448,132,471000,Lisa Simpson,SNOWY WOODS,Did you girls make Miss Hoover sick?
115867,448,133,471000,Cassandra,SNOWY WOODS,"Oh no, we would never ask the Goddess to harm a teacher."
115868,448,134,476000,Gwendolyn,SNOWY WOODS,"But if the Goddess chose to help you by giving Miss Hoover the Hershey Squirts, such is her divine wisdom."
115869,448,135,476000,Lisa Simpson,SNOWY WOODS,"Listen, not that I've lost my skepticism, but I am interested in learning more about Wiccans. Are you a minority group as defined by Ivy League admissions?"
115870,448,136,476000,Gwendolyn,SNOWY WOODS,Cornell and Dartmouth.
115871,448,137,480000,Lisa Simpson,SNOWY WOODS,What else ya got?

115874,448,140,480000,Esmeralda,SNOWY WOODS,Want to join us?
115875,448,141,480000,Lisa Simpson,SNOWY WOODS,"Well, it is an honor to be asked. But I never make a final decision in the middle of a forest at night."
115876,448,142,480000,Frankie the Squealer,SNOWY WOODS,"Hey, hey, that's smart thinkin'."
115877,448,143,480000,Louie,SNOWY WOODS,Shut up and dig your own grave.
115878,448,144,480000,Frankie the Squealer,SNOWY WOODS,What if I don't dig it? What are you gonna do then?
115879,448,145,480000,Johnny Tightlips,SNOWY WOODS,Guess I'll have to dig it for ya.
115880,448,146,480000,Frankie the Squealer,SNOWY WOODS,With your bad back? Fuhgetaboutit!
115882,448,148,480000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Is that a pentagram? Lis! You've finally come over to the dark side.
115883,448,149,480000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Um, it's the wiccan home page."
115884,448,150,480000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,I'm thinking of joining.
115885,448,151,480000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"No, no, no. You're too young to be a witch. Savor the steps leading up to it: college anorexic, string of bad marriages, career disappointments, failed pottery shop. And then when you're old and alone, you can hit the witch thing hard."
115886,448,152,480000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Hey, every witch needs a familiar..."
115887,448,153,480000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"I'm gonna put a spell on you! Yes I am, my tuna-breath familiar."
115888,448,154,480000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! I curse you, Hell's Kitten!"
115889,448,155,480000,Ned Flanders,Lisa's Bedroom,Just as I feared: her Buddhism has led directly to witchcraft.
115891,448,156,480000,Ned Flanders,Lisa's Bedroom,And she's teleconferencing the Devil using that computer from Hell!
115892,448,157,480000,Rod Flanders,Lisa's Bedroom,"I think it says ""Dell."""
115893,448,158,480000,Ned Flanders,Lisa's Bedroom,We'll let the authorities sort that out.
115895,448,160,480000,Homer Simpson,Forest,"Mmm, not bad."
115896,448,161,480000,Bearded Hillbilly,Forest,What's that twirly ruckus?
115897,448,162,480000,Cletus Spuckler,Forest,The gummiment!
115899,448,164,483000,Cassandra,FOREST CLEARING,"Initiate, how does one enter the circle?"

115902,448,167,483000,Chief Wiggum,FOREST CLEARING,Do not sanctify that witch!
115903,448,168,483000,Chief Wiggum,FOREST CLEARING,"I kinda feel sorry for 'em, crammed in that back seat. Toss 'em a Judy Blume novel, Lou."
115904,448,169,483000,Lou,FOREST CLEARING,"Uh... all we've got is ""Wifey,"" Chief."
115905,448,170,483000,Chief Wiggum,FOREST CLEARING,Nothin' with kids in it? Damn budget cut.
115907,448,172,483000,Kent Brockman,Springfield County Court House,"Double bubble boil and trouble?! Today, Springfield will see its first witch trials in twelve years. Oh, I think I see the witches now. This reporter has never encountered such disfigured crones."
115908,448,173,492000,Patty Bouvier,Springfield County Court House,We're not the witches!
115909,448,174,494000,Kent Brockman,Springfield County Court House,"Oh, well then you must be victims of the witches' hideous curse."
115910,448,175,497000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield County Court House,You didn't think I was so hideous that night we made out in the back booth at the Seafood Hut.
115911,448,176,502000,Kent Brockman,Springfield County Court House,"We all did crazy things on nine-eleven. Ah, here COME the witches. Do you have a statement for us ""mortals?"""
115912,448,177,509000,Gwendolyn,Springfield County Court House,"Goddess Lilith, who knows our hearts are pure..."
115913,448,178,512000,Esmeralda,Springfield County Court House,"Oh queen of magic, show our persecutors that they are blind!"
115914,448,179,517000,Gwendolyn,Springfield County Court House,They are blind!
115916,448,181,521000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,I'm blind! I'm blind!
115917,448,182,523000,Martin Prince,Springfield,"What goes around, comes around."
115918,448,183,530000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield,"Dear God, I've gone blind. Nurse, you'll have to be my eyes."
115919,448,184,534000,Nurse,Springfield,I'm blind too!
115920,448,185,536000,Hans Moleman,Springfield,Then I guess it's up to me.
115923,448,187,544000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,SPRINGFIELD COURTROOM,"Gwendolyn Nightshadow, did you use your supernatural powers to blind half this town?!"
115924,448,188,552000,Gwendolyn,SPRINGFIELD COURTROOM,We're just kids! My real name isn't even Gwendolyn Nightshadow! It's Stacey -- Stacey Deathsatan.
115926,448,190,562000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Springfield County Court House,"So... the defendants recruited you, a young innocent, into their evil coven."
115927,448,191,568000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield County Court House,They're not evil! They believe in friendship and respecting the earth... and they made me feel like I belonged.
115928,448,192,574000,Bart Simpson,Springfield County Court House,"Your honor, I'd like to enter something into the record."
115929,448,193,577000,Judge Snyder,Springfield County Court House,"Strangely, I'll allow it."
115930,448,194,578000,Bart Simpson,Springfield County Court House,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am a big dummy with a stupid job. I write down what other people say just like a big dummy would. Could the court reporter read that back?"
115931,448,195,587000,Court Reporter,Springfield County Court House,...I am a big dummy with a stupid job. Hey!
115933,448,197,589000,Judge Snyder,Springfield County Court House,"In all my years of being a judge, I've never seen such a flimsy case."
115934,448,198,597000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield County Court House,Are you sure? 'Cause we've brought you a lot of flimsy cases. Like that goat we accused of income tax evasion. I still think he was guilty.
115937,448,201,607000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Well, I'm not wasting another minute on this. Case dismissed!"
115938,448,202,612000,Moe Szyslak,Courtroom,There's no justice here.
115939,448,203,614000,Krusty the Clown,Courtroom,They made me blind! And now I can really hear how I bomb!

115943,448,207,630000,Chief Wiggum,Courtroom,I got you now.
115945,448,209,636000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield County Court House,BURN THE WITCH! BURN THE WITCH! BURN THE WITCH!
115946,448,210,641000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield County Court House,"Not so fast! As citizens, we are still bound by the rule of law..."
115947,448,211,645000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield County Court House,Boooo!
115948,448,212,647000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield County Court House,Seventeenth century law!
115952,448,215,650000,Groundskeeper Willie,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"I have reconstructed the ultimate instrument of colonial justice: the dunking stool. If the alleged witches survive the dunking, they clearly were witches. If they drown, then they were clearly innocent."
115953,448,216,664000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"And after this, it will be featured in the fifth-grade play ""The Crucible""!"
115954,448,217,668000,Gary Chalmers,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"Good seats still available, by which I mean seats in the back where you can fall asleep."
115956,448,219,680000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,Don't dip those Wiccans!
115958,448,221,683000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,They didn't blind anyone -- I have proof!
115959,448,222,687000,Crowd,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,/ Proof?
115960,448,223,687000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,When my father was attending the moonshine competition last Saturday...
115961,448,224,690000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,You said you were at a parenting class!
115962,448,225,693000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"Marge, please. You're embarrassing me in front of the mob."
115963,448,226,696000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"You heard sirens, which you thought were the police coming to arrest you. To ditch their stills...the moonshiners pushed them down a hill. The moonshine landed in a river, temporarily blinding anyone or anything that drank it."
115964,448,227,717000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,That river led to the reservoir -- which made anyone who drank the town's tap water also go temporarily blind.
115965,448,228,725000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,Moonshine in the water? I'll be the judge of that.
115966,448,229,733000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,Hmm... Hillbilly moonshine -- the little witch is right!
115968,448,231,746000,Moe Szyslak,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"Wait, wait, wait, don't un-form! You're a great mob -- we'll think of something else to get upset about! How 'bout all that construction on Route One? Huh? Huh?"
115970,448,233,753000,Moe Szyslak,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"Oh, you ain't no mob. You're just a buncha spineless weasels!"
115971,448,234,761000,Moe Szyslak,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"Hey, hey, hey, it's just a figure of speech."
115972,448,235,763000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,Kill the weasel hater!
115973,448,236,766000,Moe Szyslak,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,Now this is what I'm talkin' about!
115974,448,237,768000,Gwendolyn,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"Sister Lisa, thank you for saving us."
115975,448,238,771000,Cassandra,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,You were awesome.
115976,448,239,773000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"No, thank you. I've been rational but nerdy my whole life. But these past few weeks, you girls made me feel cool. Cool! Me! Lisa Simpson!"
115978,448,240,785000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,"Well, I think you're very interesting girls, but from now on, the only witch in Lisa's life is which boy will marry her. Right, Homer? Homer?"
115979,448,241,796000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,Start the ride!
115980,448,242,802000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WOODS,Again!
