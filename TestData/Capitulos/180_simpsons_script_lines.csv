40753,180,1,39000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, yeah."
40754,180,2,46000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I have it going on.
40755,180,3,54000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, let the good times roll."
40757,180,5,65000,Gary Chalmers,FACULTY LOUNGE,Good Lord! The rod up that man's butt must have a rod up its butt!
40758,180,6,70000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,FACULTY LOUNGE,"Oh, Superintendent Chalmers. Can I offer you a cup of coffee-flavored Beverine?"
40760,180,7,73000,Gary Chalmers,FACULTY LOUNGE,"Yeah, I take it grey, with creamium. But first, before Skinner shows up, I have a secret announcement. In honor of Seymour's twentieth year as principal, we've decided to hold a surprise tribute Friday night."
40761,180,8,86000,Groundskeeper Willie,FACULTY LOUNGE,"It's my twentieth year, too."
40762,180,9,88000,Gary Chalmers,FACULTY LOUNGE,"Ech. The teachers' lounge is for teachers, Willie."
40764,180,11,93000,Miss Hoover,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"And for the tribute, I need a volunteer to present an oral report on Principal Skinner's life."
40765,180,12,99000,Ralph Wiggum,Miss Hoover's Classroom,Miss Hoover? Which one is oral?
40766,180,13,102000,Miss Hoover,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"Out of your mouth, Ralph. Volunteers?"
40767,180,14,105000,Miss Hoover,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"Thank you, Lisa."
40768,180,15,108000,Ralph Wiggum,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"Um, no, Miss Hoover, I'm Ralph!"
40769,180,16,110000,Miss Hoover,Miss Hoover's Classroom,"I only need one volunteer, Ralph."
40770,180,17,112000,Ralph Wiggum,Miss Hoover's Classroom,Miss Hoover? Which one is one?
40771,180,18,115000,Lisa Simpson,Miss Hoover's Classroom,Ralph and I could do the report together.
40772,180,19,117000,Miss Hoover,Miss Hoover's Classroom,It's your funeral.
40773,180,20,118000,Ralph Wiggum,Miss Hoover's Classroom,Miss Hoover?
40775,180,22,122000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart? Why are you doing that?
40776,180,23,125000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Our class is making refreshments for Skinner's party. These are in honor of his Army days.
40777,180,24,129000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh huh, that explains the flags. What about the dog food?"
40778,180,25,132000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"My theory is, Skinner likes dog food."
40779,180,26,136000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Let's bake him a cake.
40780,180,27,137000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, a fresh batch of America Balls! Mmm..."
40782,180,29,145000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,"Seymour, tell me what time it is. Now!"
40783,180,30,151000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"Seven o'clock Friday night, Mother. Time for our weekly silhouette."
40784,180,31,155000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,No! Cutting out your ugly nose gives me a hand cramp!
40785,180,32,159000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"Oh, but you love silhouette night! And then we go through your bird book and make up silly captions and -- Mother, why are you all dressed up?"
40786,180,33,167000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,I'm sick of this house and I'm sick of you. Tonight we're going for a drive!
40787,180,34,171000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"Mmm, what's so special about tonight?"
40788,180,35,174000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,Nothing! Now put on your special suit and get in the car.
40759,180,36,176000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,Yes Mother.
40790,180,38,180000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Why are we stopping at my school, Mother? What does it say on that sign?"
40791,180,39,184000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I don't like your tone.
40792,180,40,186000,Crowd,Springfield Elementary School,"Surprise! / Happy 20th anniversary, Principal! / etc."
40793,180,41,191000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Happy anniversary, Son."
40794,180,42,193000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh Mother, you are still the master of deception."
40795,180,43,198000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I surely am.
40796,180,44,200000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"...So in 1966, a brave young man named Seymour Skinner enlisted and shipped out to Vietnam, where he rose to become Platoon Sergeant. Ralph?"
40797,180,45,210000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Principal Skinner is an old man who lives at the school. Lisa?
40798,180,46,214000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Sgt. Skinner was a hero. He risked capture many times behind enemy lines.
40799,180,47,219000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Teacher made me go to Principal Skinner's office when I was dirty.
40800,180,48,223000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"And he survived to make it back to Springfield, where he became the fine educator we salute tonight."
40801,180,49,229000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"When I grow up, I want to be a principal or a caterpillar. I love you, Principal Skinner."
40802,180,50,238000,Student Choir,Springfield Elementary School,"THEY CALL HIM ""SKINNER"" / ""SKINNER"" / FASTER THAN LIGHTNING / NO ONE YOU SEE / IS STRICTER THAN HE..."
40803,180,51,254000,Stranger,Springfield Elementary School,"""Tribute to Seymour Skinner!"" Pull over, driver."
40804,180,52,257000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, I know the school normally serves cake only on Thursdays. And I'm also well aware that today is Friday. Nevertheless, I have a surprise for you."
40805,180,53,269000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I hope you all brought forks and plates!
40806,180,54,282000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Oh! What the -- an enjoyment buzzer?!
40807,180,55,286000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, thank you. What a wonderful night to share with the people and the town that I love. I have never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner."
40808,180,56,298000,Stranger,Springfield Elementary School,You're not Seymour Skinner!
40809,180,57,301000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Skinner!
40810,180,58,303000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Skinner?
40811,180,59,303000,Stranger,Springfield Elementary School,I'm Skinner!
40812,180,60,305000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Seymour!
40813,180,61,307000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Mother!
40814,180,62,308000,Stranger,Springfield Elementary School,She's my mother!
40816,180,64,312000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Will someone remove that crazy man, please?"
40817,180,65,314000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"No...No he's, he's not crazy. It's true: I'm, I'm an impostor. That man is the real Seymour Skinner."
148581,180,67,335000,Homer's Brain,Springfield Elementary School,Keep looking shocked and move slowly towards the cake.
40819,180,68,345000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Now let's clear this up. Who exactly are you?
40820,180,69,348000,Stranger,Springfield Elementary School,"Sergeant Seymour Skinner, U.S. Army."
40821,180,70,352000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,It's true. I was in his platoon... But they said you were killed on that scouting mission!
40822,180,71,357000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"No, just captured. It's kind of a funny story really. After five years in a secret POW camp, I was sold to China for slave labor, and since '77 I've been making sneakers at gunpoint in a sweatshop in Wuhan."
40823,180,72,371000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That's not a funny story.
40824,180,73,373000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well I guess you had to be there. Anyhow, the U.N. shut the factory down last week, and the Embassy shipped me home, and here I am."
40825,180,74,381000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"So what's your story, Seymour? If that is your real name."
40826,180,75,385000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, obviously it isn't. My real name is Armin Tamzarian."
40828,180,77,395000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm an orphan from Capitol City, and those who recall my fight to outlaw teenage rudeness may be shocked to learn that I myself was once a ""street punk."""
40829,180,78,410000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh yeah, the way I was headed, it was just a matter of time before I wound up in front of a judge."
40830,180,79,418000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"They gave me a choice: jail, the Army, or apologizing to the judge and the old lady. No, 'course if I'd known there was a war going on, I probably would've apologized."
40831,180,80,441000,Young Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, who wants a piece 'a me?"
40832,180,81,444000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"You trying to get yourself killed, Tamzarian? You've got your whole life ahead of ya! Don't you have any dreams?"
40833,180,82,451000,Young Armin,Springfield Elementary School,My dreams all involve combing my hair.
40834,180,83,453000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh gosh, son, everybody's got dreams.... I come from a town called Springfield, and my dream is to go back and become principal of the elementary school."
40835,180,84,463000,Young Armin,Springfield Elementary School,Some people might call that a pretty corny dream. Sergeant.
40837,180,85,467000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well there's nothing ""corny"" about fresh-faced youngsters skippin' to school, scrapin' knees and spellin' bees and pies cooling softly on a windowsill. Well sir, if that's corny, then corn me up."
40838,180,86,482000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,Sgt. Skinner took me under his wing and showed me that life was worth living.
40839,180,87,487000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,I came to think of him as the big brother I never had. He made me believe I might have a future after all.
40840,180,88,502000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"And when they told us he was missing, presumed dead, my future died, once again. My life lost all meaning."
40841,180,89,513000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Come on! Get to the part where you steal his identity!
40842,180,90,516000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"Ech, I'm trying to explain how emotionally fragile I was."
40843,180,91,519000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, it's one of those stories."
40844,180,92,522000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"Hmm, Sgt. Skinner meant the world to me, and I... I felt it was my duty to deliver the grim news to his mother."
40845,180,93,538000,Young Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"Hello, I'm uh... I'm --"
40846,180,94,541000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Seymour?! Is that you?
40847,180,95,544000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"I don't know why I did what I did. I guess I couldn't bear to tell her about her son. What I did was wrong, but I'd do it again."
40848,180,96,553000,Young Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, Mother, it's me."
40849,180,97,556000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,You look different somehow... but you must be Seymour. Yes. You are Seymour.
40850,180,98,564000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"As strange as it sounds, deep down I think she knew I wasn't her son. But the lie made us both happier than the truth ever could have."
40851,180,99,573000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,You can have some lima beans as soon as you've cleaned your room. Go!
40852,180,100,579000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Upstairs, third door on the left. Don't walk on the rugs!"
40853,180,101,584000,Young Armin,Springfield Elementary School,Yes... Mother.
40854,180,102,587000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't judge her too harshly, Sergeant. She was a lonely old woman. If you must blame someone, blame me."
40855,180,103,594000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, that's pretty much what I was planning to do there, Armin."
40856,180,104,597000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, that's about it. And so for the past 26 years, I've dedicated myself to living out your dream."
40857,180,105,604000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I didn't dream anything about an aqua suit or a lavender shirt. But you did take care of Mom...
40858,180,106,610000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,A dagger! A dagger through my heart!
40859,180,107,613000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, here, Mother, let me help you --"
40860,180,108,615000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Get your hands off me!
40861,180,109,616000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Please, Mom --"
40862,180,110,617000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"You too, stranger!"
40863,180,111,618000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I'm your son!
40864,180,112,619000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I have no son!
40865,180,113,622000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Look, lady, you obviously have at least one son."
40866,180,114,625000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"No, I have one stranger and one fraud!"
40867,180,115,629000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Take it easy, Mom--"
40868,180,116,631000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I said back off!
40869,180,117,633000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"You better do as she says -- she's quick with a hat pin. Ah, well, I suppose I'll have to find a hotel."
40870,180,118,640000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,I won't hear of it. Tonight you can sleep on the floor of your office.
40871,180,119,647000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, Armin."
40873,180,121,651000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Mrs. Krabappel sent me. I forged my dad's signature on my report card.
40874,180,122,654000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, now, Bart, you know that's wrong."
40875,180,123,656000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I don't see how me signing Homer's name is any different from you using Sgt. Skinner's name."
40876,180,124,661000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,I guess my punishing you would be somewhat hypocritical. Why don't you just write a thirty word essay on what you've done.
40877,180,125,667000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, hey, hey! Easy there, you big impostor."
40879,180,127,674000,Armin,Kwik-E-Mart,"So, uh, um, should I sign my original name?"
40880,180,128,677000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Just put an X, then call yourself whatever the hell you want."
40881,180,129,681000,Armin,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well now, there's no need for profanity. My name may have changed, but I'm still the same man I was last week."
40882,180,130,686000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Not to us you're not. I mean, how would you feel if you suddenly found out Ned Flanders was an impostor?"
40883,180,131,692000,Armin,Kwik-E-Mart,Who's Ned Flanders?
40884,180,132,693000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,My next-door neighbor? Religious guy?
40885,180,133,695000,Armin,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, you mean Reverend Lovejoy."
40886,180,134,697000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"No I don't! What I mean is, to me you're just a stranger pretending to be something he's not."
40887,180,135,705000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"I'm sorry, but that's just how I feel."
40888,180,136,708000,Armin,Kwik-E-Mart,"No, don't apologize. It's time I stopped pretending."
40890,180,138,713000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"I've called this assembly to announce my retirement, effective as of the end of this sentence."
40891,180,139,722000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,This sentence I'm speaking. Right now. Period.
40893,180,141,733000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"I wrongfully usurped Sgt. Skinner's position, and I suggest you consider him to replace me. Thank you."
40894,180,142,740000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, now I don't know... Skinner, do you know anything about being a principal?"
40895,180,143,745000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, it's been my lifelong ambition. And if a man pretending to be me could do it, well then logically the real me must be far more qualified."
40896,180,144,753000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Good enough. Armin Tamzarian's reign of terror is over. Now let us welcome our new Principal Skinner: Principal Seymour Skinner. Ah, him."
40898,180,146,777000,Armin,Skinner Home,"Before I go, I've got some personal items for you: you belong to the Radio Shack Battery Club... Oh, ten Canadian dollars; that's a souvenir from your trip to upstate New York..."
40899,180,147,788000,Sgt. Skinner,Skinner Home,"Why you've led quite a life, Tamzarian."
40900,180,148,792000,Armin,Skinner Home,It's your life. I just kept it warm for you.
40901,180,149,796000,Armin,Skinner Home,"Oh, I nearly forgot -- your pocket watch. Mother's picture is still inside. Take good care of her."
40902,180,150,802000,Sgt. Skinner,Skinner Home,I'll wind her every day.
40903,180,151,808000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,"I poached some fish for your trip, Mr. Tamzarian. They're full of tiny bones, so I want you to be careful."
40904,180,152,815000,Armin,Skinner Home,"I will, Moth -- Uh, Mrs. Skinner. Well, I better be going."
40906,180,154,831000,Armin,Edna's Apartment,"Good evening, Edna. I know we were planning to see a film tonight, but instead I'm leaving town forever."
40907,180,155,837000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Edna's Apartment,"No, please! I don't care what you've done. You're still a decent, honorable man."
40908,180,156,842000,Armin,Edna's Apartment,"Mmm, that's the kind of talk that makes me want to marry you."
40909,180,157,847000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Edna's Apartment,Oh!
40910,180,158,848000,Armin,Edna's Apartment,"But instead, I'm leaving town forever. Good-bye."
40913,180,161,865000,Armin,Storage Facility,"Well, it's time to pick up where I left off. As a no-good street punk."
40836,180,163,878000,Bart Simpson,Highway,Principal Skinner?
40915,180,164,880000,Armin,Highway,"Up yours, children!"
40916,180,165,885000,Kent Brockman,Highway,Now to recap our top story in its entirety: The adaptable citizens of Springfield have opened their hearts to Principal Seymour Skinner. Who...
40917,180,166,890000,Kent Brockman,Highway,Not that one. Idiots.
40918,180,167,901000,Sgt. Skinner,Highway,"Thank you. Thank you. I must say, in many ways, Springfield really beats the old slave-labor camp."
40921,180,170,912000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I admit Sgt. Skinner seems okay... but Mr. Tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets and earned our respect and admiration.
40922,180,171,920000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,He lied about his name.
40923,180,172,921000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"His name doesn't matter. ""A rose by any other name would smell as sweet."""
40924,180,173,923000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not if you called 'em ""stench blossoms""."
40925,180,174,923000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Or ""crapweeds""."
40926,180,175,929000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for Valentine's Day. I'd rather have candy.
40927,180,176,933000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not if they were called ""scumdrops""."
40929,180,178,933000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Your new principal would like to say a few words. Remember, you have to respect him -- he's a war hero."
40930,180,179,941000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw-haw!
40931,180,180,943000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Thank you, Chalmers. You know, where I come from, there's no better way to get acquainted than by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance together. Why don't you lead us, son?"
40932,180,181,956000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey America, you're so fine. You're so fine, you blow my mind. America."
40934,180,183,962000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, that's very concise, but it's an insult to everything I suffered for. Now take a seat, junior, and listen to someone who gave their youth in service of their country. Mrs. Krabappel? The pledge, please."
40935,180,184,977000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"You haven't dealt with women for a long time, have you, Sergeant?"
40936,180,185,981000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Are you asking me out?
40938,180,187,985000,Armin,CAPITOL CITY,"Ah, 433rd Street, my old neighborhood..."
40943,180,189,994000,Armin,NIGHT CLUB,"""Oh yes, oh yes, Capitol City's nakedest ladies. They're not even wearing a smile. Nod suggestively. Yes, six, count 'em, six gorgeous ladies just dying for your leers and catcalls. Yowza, yowza."""
40945,180,191,1010000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,"Seymour, it's 7:30! Where were you?"
40946,180,192,1017000,Sgt. Skinner,Skinner Home,"A bar, Mom."
40947,180,193,1018000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,"I don't know what that is, but on Fridays you come straight home after school. Tonight is silhouette night. Sit there."
40948,180,194,1026000,Sgt. Skinner,Skinner Home,I really just came home to change into a turtleneck.
40949,180,195,1028000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,Seymour! Sit!
40950,180,196,1030000,Sgt. Skinner,Skinner Home,"In the morning. Oh, Mom -- I'm borrowing your car."
40952,180,198,1042000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,"Good morning, Agnes. How's your new son working out?"
40953,180,199,1048000,Agnes Skinner,Supermarket,"That child is the most disobedient, smart-alecky middle-aged man in creation."
40954,180,200,1053000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Supermarket,"Hello, ladies. Is this the line for people who want to bad-mouth Sgt. Skinner?"
40955,180,201,1057000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,And have ten items or less.
40956,180,202,1059000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Supermarket,Twelve... eleven... ten. The man's a weenie.
40957,180,203,1061000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,"Oh, now be fair, Edna. I liked Armin Tamzarian too, but he was at least as big a weenie as Sgt. Skinner."
40958,180,204,1067000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Supermarket,But he was our weenie!
40959,180,205,1069000,Agnes Skinner,Supermarket,Now there was a weenie you could be proud to call your son.
40960,180,206,1074000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,Did you ever tell him that?
40962,180,208,1078000,Homer Simpson,Highway,"Okay, once more. Where are we going?"
40963,180,209,1082000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Highway,To Capitol City.
40964,180,210,1083000,Homer Simpson,Highway,And why are you and the old lady in the car?
40965,180,211,1086000,Agnes Skinner,Highway,We're gonna talk Armin Tamzarian into coming back.
40966,180,212,1088000,Homer Simpson,Highway,And why is Marge here?
40967,180,213,1090000,Marge Simpson,Highway,I came up with the idea.
40968,180,214,1092000,Homer Simpson,Highway,And why am I here?
40969,180,215,1093000,Marge Simpson,Highway,Because the streets of Capitol City are no place for three unescorted ladies.
40970,180,216,1097000,Homer Simpson,Highway,And why are the kids here?
40971,180,217,1099000,Marge Simpson,Highway,Because we couldn't find Grampa to sit for them.
40972,180,218,1101000,Homer Simpson,Highway,And why is Grampa here?
40973,180,219,1102000,Grampa Simpson,Highway,'Cause Jasper didn't wanna come by himself.
40940,180,220,1106000,Homer Simpson,Highway,Fair enough.
40941,180,221,1108000,Grampa Simpson,Highway,"Hel-lo, beautiful!"
40942,180,222,1110000,Agnes Skinner,Highway,In your dreams.
40974,180,223,1112000,Grampa Simpson,Highway,We'll see about that!
40975,180,224,1114000,Grampa Simpson,Highway,"Hello, beautiful."
40978,180,227,1124000,Armin,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,"My mind is made up. I'm not coming back, and that's final."
40979,180,228,1131000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,"Oh, Seymour --"
40980,180,229,1132000,Armin,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,"And I'm not Seymour! My name is Armin! This is Armin's apartment! Armin's liquor! Armin's copy of ""Swank""! Armin's frozen peas!"
40981,180,230,1140000,Homer Simpson,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,"Can I see your copy of ""Swank"", Armin?"
40982,180,231,1142000,Armin,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,"Yes you can. This is Armin's life, and maybe it's not perfect, but at least I'm back where I belong. I was born a nogoodnik and I'll die a nogoodnik."
40983,180,232,1149000,Agnes Skinner,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,Seymour!
40984,180,233,1149000,Agnes Skinner,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,I didn't bring you up to use language like that!
40985,180,234,1153000,Armin,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,"Well, you didn't bring me up at all."
40986,180,235,1154000,Agnes Skinner,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,The hell I didn't! I've been taking care of you for 26 years. I'm the only mother you've ever known!
40987,180,236,1160000,Armin,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,But you have your real son--
40988,180,237,1161000,Agnes Skinner,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,"You're my real son! You've been my son longer than he has, and he doesn't need me, and I don't need him! Now you march yourself downstairs and get in that car!"
40989,180,238,1170000,Armin,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,"Yes, Mother."
40990,180,239,1171000,Agnes Skinner,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,And the rest of you too!
40991,180,240,1173000,All,Armin's Bare Seedy Apartment,"Yes, Mrs. Skinner."
40993,180,242,1183000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, everybody, look! Armin Tamzarian's back and he's gonna take over the school again!"
40995,180,244,1191000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Elementary School,Now hold on. Armin Tamzarian is an unsavory character who played us all for chumps.
40996,180,245,1196000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"All right, all right. So, he's a fraud. I don't care! His mom doesn't care! Do any of you care?"
40997,180,246,1205000,Crowd,Springfield Elementary School,No / Not really / Not very much / etc.
40998,180,247,1207000,Sgt. Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,You all seem to be forgetting that I am Seymour Skinner. This is where I belong. You can't ask me to disappear just because you like some other guy better! I gave half my life for you people. Aren't I entitled to a little dignity?
40999,180,248,1221000,Armin,Springfield Elementary School,"You're ah... you're right, Sergeant."
41001,180,249,1225000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I don't see any way out of this."
41002,180,250,1228000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, if you'll allow me, I think I have a solution that'll satisfy the town and let Sgt. Skinner keep his dignity."
41004,180,252,1236000,Sgt. Skinner,RAILROAD STATION,But I'm a hero!
41005,180,253,1239000,Homer Simpson,RAILROAD STATION,And we salute you for it. Now don't come back.
41006,180,254,1243000,Agnes Skinner,RAILROAD STATION,"I'm sorry, Seymour. It's nice you're alive, but you're just not what I'm looking for in a son. I'm glad you understand."
41007,180,255,1256000,Armin,RAILROAD STATION,"Well this is a lovely gesture, but we still have to face the fact that I'm not really Seymour Skinner."
41008,180,256,1263000,Homer Simpson,RAILROAD STATION,Oh no we don't! Judge Snyder?
41009,180,257,1266000,Judge Snyder,RAILROAD STATION,"By authority of the City of Springfield, I hereby confer upon you the name of Seymour Skinner, as well as his past, present, future, and mother."
41010,180,258,1274000,Armin,RAILROAD STATION,Okay.
41011,180,259,1275000,Judge Snyder,RAILROAD STATION,"And I further decree that everything will be just like it was before all this happened, and no one will ever mention it again... under penalty of torture!"
41013,180,261,1289000,Agnes Skinner,RAILROAD STATION,"Here, son. This is yours again...."
41014,180,262,1293000,Seymour Skinner,RAILROAD STATION,"I've never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner. But these last few days as that hot-headed rogue Armin Tamzarian have taught me a thing or two. You know, maybe I've been a little too ""uptight"" in the past. Well, from now on you're gonna to see a new Seymour Skinner--"
41015,180,263,1311000,Agnes Skinner,RAILROAD STATION,Oh no we won't.
41016,180,264,1313000,Seymour Skinner,RAILROAD STATION,"Yes, Mother."
