100103,386,10,52000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Recording that fake fight was a great idea.
100104,386,11,56000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Now the kids won't bother us during our morning snuggle.
100105,386,12,60000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dear Lord, thank you for the physical intimacy we are about to enjoy."

100116,386,23,104000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey dinks, gimme your lunch money."
100117,386,24,108000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,But what will I eat at mid-day?

100120,386,27,118000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Come to my party or die! Come to my party or die!
100121,386,28,122000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,I hate Nelson's parties -- he makes you look at his baseball cards and tell him they're good. They're not good!
100122,386,29,130000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,I don't like him.
100123,386,30,132000,Database,Springfield Elementary School,And I'll bet Nelson won't even have gift bags!
100124,386,31,134000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,Unthinkable! / Is that legal?
100125,386,32,136000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Wait. What if... NOBODY goes? He can't kill all of us.
100126,386,33,141000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"He's right. Individually, we are weak like a single twig... But as a bundle, we form a mighty faggot."
100128,386,35,151000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well said! If we all stand together, Nelson's helpless. Hell no, we won't show! Hell no, we won't show!"

100135,386,42,171000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yup, he'll be all alone on his birthday! Oh, I wish I could see it. Boo hoo! I'm Nelson. No one likes me."
100137,386,43,178000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bartholomew J. Simpson, how can you be so mean?"
100138,386,44,181000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you gonna do about it?
100139,386,45,184000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey!

100143,386,49,201000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Kind of?
100144,386,50,203000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah c'mon Bart, the party will be fun. Nelson's not bad -- all he needs is a little kindness."
100145,386,51,212000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, you're never gonna get a husband by being sarcastic."
100146,386,52,216000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, no husband."

100151,386,57,235000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,Why?
100152,386,58,236000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Son, we all have to do things we don't want to. Like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be Mr. Funny all the time -- You think I wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest? Like some ancient pagan! Just dancing around playing the pan flute! And here we are!"
100153,386,59,258000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Okay, just walk in, say happy birthday, and get out."
100156,386,62,266000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S BACKYARD,"This party doesn't suck. Pizza, that's a nice touch."
100157,386,63,272000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S BACKYARD,"Uh-oh, do I hear a dial tone? 'Cause this party is off the hook! What up, B?"
100158,386,64,281000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S BACKYARD,"Um, happy birthday, Nelson."
100159,386,65,284000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S BACKYARD,Uh... I know it seems a little quiet... must be a lot a traffic today. Is highway eighty-eight backed up?
100160,386,66,291000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S BACKYARD,Oh yeah. It's a parking lot out there.
100161,386,67,293000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S BACKYARD,Of course! That explains everything. Stupid highway eighty-eight!
100162,386,68,305000,Spider-Man,NELSON'S BACKYARD,"Hey, kids! My Spidey sense is tingling! Tingling because it's a certain someone's birthday!"
100163,386,69,310000,Spider-Man,NELSON'S BACKYARD,Yeah.

100166,386,72,321000,Spider-Man,NELSON'S BACKYARD,"Uh, listen, I only got ten minutes of material. Um, maybe I should come back a little later?"
100167,386,73,326000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S BACKYARD,Don't go! My party peeps are en route! I swear!
100168,386,74,332000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S BACKYARD,Nelson... nobody's coming.
100169,386,75,334000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S BACKYARD,But... how could nobody come? I ordered them to.
100170,386,76,338000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S BACKYARD,"Well, that's the thing. Sometimes, you can be kind of a jerk."
100171,386,77,343000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S BACKYARD,True... but I thought I had some friends.
100172,386,78,348000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S BACKYARD,Maybe you can have fun with just me.
100173,386,79,352000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S BACKYARD,"Okay, why not?"
100174,386,80,354000,Dr. Octopus,NELSON'S BACKYARD,"Stop having fun, kids! I'm Dr. Octopus, from Marvel Comics' ""Spider-Man."" I'm inventing a ray that turns birthday presents into homework!"
100175,386,81,365000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S BACKYARD,"C'mon, Bart! Let's knock him down!"
100179,386,85,378000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S BACKYARD,Wait... I have an idea.
100180,386,86,387000,Mrs. Muntz,NELSON'S BACKYARD,Look at our kids! Playin' like champs!
100181,386,87,390000,Homer Simpson,NELSON'S BACKYARD,Yeah. How'd you afford this kick-ass party?
100182,386,88,392000,Mrs. Muntz,NELSON'S BACKYARD,Carnival ride hit me on the head.
100185,386,91,396000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, how was Nelson's party?"
100186,386,92,398000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not bad. We had pizza, cake, and then sang songs with Nelson's Gramma. But, it was a one-time thing, and now I'll never see him again."
100188,386,94,408000,Nelson Muntz,School Bus,Hey... it's my birthday bud!
100189,386,95,414000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Yeah, yeah, it was uh, super fun. Good times. Hey, Ralph! Have I got a half a sandwich for you."
100190,386,96,421000,Nelson Muntz,School Bus,"Bart, where you goin'? I saved you a seat, best friend."
100191,386,97,427000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,Haw haw!
100193,386,99,432000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, best friend, I got you a present. An entire case of pool cue chalk! Huh? Huh? We can make the tip of anything blue!"
100194,386,100,442000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Um, Nelson, I was just thinking about us being ""best friends."""
100195,386,101,447000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Whoa! Me too! We are so connected!
100196,386,102,451000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Look, um, I don't have time for new friends. I got a lot on my plate. I've got a big report due on the Nile river: topic sentence, bibliography, page numbers... it's nuts."
100197,386,103,462000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"Dude, you made me get water on my cheek!"
100198,386,104,471000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Bart is my best friend now. Which means no one picks on him ever again.
100199,386,105,478000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, okay! I forgot how cool Bart was."
100200,386,106,482000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, he's awesome! / Good guy, good guy!"
100201,386,107,484000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Isn't he? I've known him for years, but I ran into him at a party and we really clicked."
100202,386,108,489000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"That's right, we're best friends now. So why don't you go pick on someone smaller and weaker?"
100203,386,109,495000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,Good idea!
100204,386,110,496000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,Let's go over to the Sunshine pre-school and wail on toddlers.
100205,386,111,499000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, we'll jump 'em while they're napping."
100207,386,113,503000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie...
100208,386,114,508000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"When you're done putting Lisa to bed we can, uh, finish what we started the other day."
100209,386,115,514000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo! Marital sex!
100210,386,116,516000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, tucked in tight, glass of water, nightlight on, no barn owls, don't do drugs, love you, good night."
100211,386,117,523000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, can't you read me a story for a little bit?"
100212,386,118,526000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But your mother smells like coconut!
100213,386,119,530000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay sweetie, which book should I read?"
100214,386,120,533000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Angelica Button and the Dragon King's Trundle Bed"". It's the ninth book in the ""Angelica Button"" series."
100215,386,121,539000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh yeah, this is that fantasy book that even grownups like. Broken, lonely grownups."
100216,386,122,545000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Chapter One: The RubyStone in the Door-Portal"". Are you asleep yet?"
100217,386,123,550000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
100220,386,126,552000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Angelica trembled as she looked up at the stern but wise whiskers of Headmaster Greystash...
100221,386,127,552000,Greystash,Lisa's Bedroom,"Angelica Button, you are a mere Earthkin. What business have you with the Merlinical Council?"
100223,386,128,567000,ANGELICA,Lisa's Bedroom,I bring warning! The Minister of Niceness -- Lord Evilton -- is not what he appears!
100224,386,129,573000,Snake Wizard,Lisa's Bedroom,Preposteroussss!
100225,386,130,575000,2-headed Woman,Lisa's Bedroom,Foolish Earthkin!
100226,386,131,577000,Unicorn,Lisa's Bedroom,Send her to the sorrow mines of Mount Purgatorium!
100227,386,132,581000,ANGELICA,Lisa's Bedroom,Nooo!
100229,386,134,584000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Lisa, wake up! They're taking Angelica to Mount Purgatorium."
100230,386,135,588000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Oh Dad, I'm tired. We'll read more tomorrow."
100231,386,136,592000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Tomorrow? But she's in trouble now! I'll just read ahead without you.
100232,386,137,596000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,No! We have to read it together.
100233,386,138,599000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Oh, of course. Whatever you say, sweetie. Nighty-night."
100237,386,142,614000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School Roof,I like to come up here and make fun of the sunset.
100238,386,143,619000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School Roof,"Hey, gas ball -- you suck!"
100239,386,144,621000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Roof,"Nelson, do you ever wish you weren't a bully?"
100240,386,145,624000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School Roof,"Hmm, sometimes. But it's not up to me -- it's who I am. I mean, a shark can't stop swimming or it'll blow up."
100241,386,146,633000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Roof,Man... I never knew you were so deep.
100242,386,147,636000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School Roof,"Here, this is for you."

100244,386,149,641000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School Roof,The sleeves were torn off by wild dogs.
100245,386,150,645000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Roof,"From then on, my life changed."
100247,386,152,650000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"All of a sudden, I was a somebody in a school full of nobodies. I could go anywhere, do anything. For us, to live any other way was nuts."
100248,386,153,691000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"So, Scotty, how do you like school?"
100249,386,154,694000,Dummy,Springfield Elementary School,Closed!
100251,386,156,698000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Life was perfect.
100253,386,158,701000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, I'm home! Time for me to read to you!"
100254,386,159,704000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa's sleeping over at Janey's. Apparently, her mom makes good mac and cheese."

100256,386,162,715000,T.R. Francis,Lisa's Bedroom,You must read ahead. Fiction is your passion!
100257,386,163,718000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Lady, you're nice, but I'm married."
100258,386,164,721000,T.R. Francis,Lisa's Bedroom,"Just read the book, you shaved ape."
100259,386,165,724000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Ow! I can't read ahead -- I promised Lisa I wouldn't!
100260,386,166,729000,T.R. Francis,Lisa's Bedroom,Just take a peek at the title of the next chapter and see if you can resist.
100261,386,167,733000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"""An Unexpected Occurrence?!"" What could it be?!"
100262,386,168,738000,T.R. Francis,Lisa's Bedroom,"We hooked him, Galahad."
100263,386,169,740000,Galahad,Lisa's Bedroom,"Yes, quite."
100265,386,171,742000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Angelica was trapped in the Suffoclock of Sandy Doom...
100266,386,172,742000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,...As Headmaster Greystash fought a battle to the finish with dark wizard Maluicious Krubb.
100267,386,173,742000,Maluicious Krubb,Simpson Home,"Time to choose, Greystash. If you save Angelica... you die!"
100268,386,174,773000,Greystash,Simpson Home,Goodbye... Angelica...
100269,386,175,777000,Angelica Button,Simpson Home,Greystash.
100270,386,176,780000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,He killed Greystash!
100271,386,177,783000,Telephone Worker,Simpson Home,"Thanks for the spoiler there, big mouth."
100273,386,179,786000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey, Bart."
100274,386,180,786000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Milhouse.
100275,386,181,788000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,"Bart, why are you hanging around with Nelson so much? He's a bully."
100276,386,182,793000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey, don't use the ""b"" word around me. It's offensive."
100277,386,183,796000,Jimbo Jones,Kwik-E-Mart,"Yo, bully!"
100278,386,184,798000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Kwik-E-Mart,"What up, my bully."
100279,386,185,799000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,How come they can say it?
100280,386,186,801000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"They just can, okay."
100281,386,187,804000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,It's weird to see you as somebody's sidekick.
100282,386,188,807000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Whoa, Bart Simpson is nobody's sidekick."
100283,386,189,809000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,Then why are you wearing that vest?
100284,386,190,812000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,'Cause my chest is cold and my arms aren't.
100285,386,191,815000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,I see. Then I suppose you can just fly kites with whoever you want -- right here in front of everyone.
100286,386,192,822000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Come on, Bart. Throw the dork a bone."
100287,386,193,824000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"All right, I will."
100289,386,195,835000,Nelson Muntz,Park,Blue and red -- the colors of friendship.
100290,386,198,848000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,You're late. I was waitin' to smash this frog with you and it peed in my hand.
100291,386,199,854000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Sorry, I was uh... stealing loose grapes at the grocery store."
100292,386,200,859000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Really? You call this ""stealing loose grapes?"""
100293,386,201,868000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,We were just having fun. Don't get upset.
100294,386,202,870000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Oh, right. Stupid Nelson always gets upset. He'll probably do something stupid -- like smash his own camera!"
100295,386,203,879000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Aw, look what you made me do!"
100296,386,204,881000,Mrs. Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Nelson, get in here! The cat's eyes are runny and I need you to dab 'em!"
100297,386,205,887000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Coming, Ma! See you later, lying traitor."
100298,386,206,894000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Something in your eye, Mr. Mooch? Well, there's something in my eye too."
100299,386,207,903000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Ma, what happened to the curtains?"
100300,386,208,905000,Mrs. Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,I made 'em into a dress for kar-oke singing.
100303,386,211,911000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Bart, do you want some ice cream? I just hit a major marshmallow vein - Ooo, I think it goes all the way to the bottom!"
100304,386,212,918000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No thanks.
100305,386,213,918000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What's wrong?
100306,386,214,921000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Me and Nelson were best friends, and now I think he's gonna kill me!"
100307,386,215,924000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bully problems, eh? You know, they say all bullies are cowards. It's not true, they're brave 'cause they're strong."
100310,386,218,938000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, we need to talk."
100312,386,220,941000,Nelson Muntz,LOCKER,"I feel so bad about freaking out on you. It'll never happen again, I swear."
100313,386,221,947000,Bart Simpson,LOCKER,"Um, okay."
100314,386,222,949000,Nelson Muntz,LOCKER,Best friends... forever?
100315,386,223,953000,Bart Simpson,LOCKER,No! I can't do it! You're a nut bar! A whack-job! A kooka-dooka!
100316,386,224,958000,Bart Simpson,LOCKER,"Please, just leave me alone!"
100317,386,225,959000,Seymour Skinner,LOCKER,Best not to get involved.
100318,386,226,961000,Gary Chalmers,LOCKER,Agreed.
100319,386,227,966000,Nelson Muntz,LOCKER,Looks like you've made your choice. Make sure your affairs are in order.
100320,386,228,971000,Bart Simpson,LOCKER,I've set up a trust. It bypasses the inheritance tax.
100322,386,229,973000,Nelson Muntz,LOCKER,Only till two thousand eight! Look into it!
100324,386,231,978000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Greystash. Greystash! Oh, hello, Lisa."
100325,386,232,986000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon Dad, read the last chapter! Everyone says there's a big surprise -- I bet Angelica discovers that she's a wizard!"
100326,386,233,993000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... how would you feel if something bad happened to Greystash?
100327,386,234,998000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It would be the day my childhood ended.
100329,386,236,1001000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, read, read!"
100330,386,237,1004000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Angelica was trapped in the Suffoclock of Sandy Doom...
100331,386,238,1004000,Maluicious Krubb,Simpson Home,"Time to choose, Greystash. If you save Angelica... you die!"
100332,386,239,1014000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why are you stopping? We're almost at the happy ending!
148625,386,240,1018000,Homer's Thoughts,Simpson Home,No book is gonna make my daughter sad. Time to do what I do best: lie to a child.
100333,386,241,1024000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Greystash looked Krubb right in the eye and said...
100334,386,242,1024000,Greystash,Simpson Home,Mustache power: activate!
100335,386,243,1046000,Maluicious Krubb,Simpson Home,"Oh man, I can't believe you beat me but you did."
100336,386,244,1050000,Angelica Button,Simpson Home,I somehow escaped from the hourglass!
100337,386,245,1055000,Greystash,Simpson Home,"And now, to go on living!"
100339,386,247,1064000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The end.
100340,386,248,1067000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Is that really how it ends? What happened to the Merlinical Council?
100341,386,249,1071000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, they went to Star Wars Land and fought star wars."
100342,386,250,1075000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you can read to me anytime."
100343,386,251,1078000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now Lisa won't know about death till it strikes someone close to her.
100344,386,252,1092000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad's ending is better.
100346,386,254,1095000,Seymour Skinner,ROCKY COAST,"Okay, field-trippers, welcome to the Springfield Tide Pools -- nature's most fecund eco-system!"
100347,386,255,1101000,Seymour Skinner,ROCKY COAST,"Who will spot the playful abalone? The mighty winkle? I think it might be you, Sherri!"
100349,386,257,1108000,Seymour Skinner,ROCKY COAST,"Now remember, these pools can be dangerous, so everyone pick a buddy."
100350,386,258,1112000,Nelson Muntz,ROCKY COAST,Bart's my buddy!
100351,386,259,1114000,Seymour Skinner,ROCKY COAST,"Good boy, Nelson. Squeeze him extra tight for safety!"
100353,386,261,1120000,Bart Simpson,Tide Pools,"We sure are far from the rest of 'em. Funny how that happened, huh?"
100354,386,262,1126000,Nelson Muntz,Tide Pools,Come with me.
100356,386,264,1126000,Bart Simpson,GROTTO,"Nelson, please don't kill me! Remember when we made fun of Cinco de Mayo? I called it ""Stinko de Mayo"". We laughed so hard..."
100357,386,265,1135000,Nelson Muntz,GROTTO,Bart...
100358,386,266,1138000,Nelson Muntz,GROTTO,You are a bad friend.
100359,386,267,1141000,Bart Simpson,GROTTO,Say again?
100360,386,268,1143000,Nelson Muntz,GROTTO,You never liked me for me. You liked that I protected you and gave you a vest and stole milk boxes for you. I hate milk! It comes from cow wangs!
100361,386,269,1152000,Bart Simpson,GROTTO,There you go again -- you act all nice and then you go crazy.
100362,386,270,1156000,Nelson Muntz,GROTTO,"Well, maybe I get jealous. But it's just because... I never had a best friend before."
100363,386,271,1165000,Bart Simpson,GROTTO,"Um, Nelson? Was the water always up to our necks? Nelson?!"
100364,386,272,1172000,Bart Simpson,GROTTO,Help! Help!
100365,386,273,1173000,Nelson Muntz,GROTTO,Put this on!
100366,386,274,1175000,Bart Simpson,GROTTO,Where'd you get it?
100367,386,275,1176000,Nelson Muntz,GROTTO,Dude gave it to me.
100371,386,279,1202000,Bart Simpson,ROCKY BEACH,Aaagh! Man lips!
100372,386,280,1204000,Kids,ROCKY BEACH,Skinner loves Bart! Skinner loves Bart!
100373,386,281,1209000,Seymour Skinner,ROCKY BEACH,Shut up! I'm just giving him CPR -- the kiss of life! And if anyone loves Bart it's Nelson.
100374,386,282,1214000,Bart Simpson,ROCKY BEACH,Where is Nelson?
100375,386,283,1215000,Seymour Skinner,ROCKY BEACH,I'm sorry. Nelson never woke up.
100376,386,284,1218000,Bart Simpson,ROCKY BEACH,What?
100377,386,285,1218000,Seymour Skinner,ROCKY BEACH,Never woke up because he never passed out. He's right over there.
100378,386,286,1225000,Bart Simpson,ROCKY BEACH,"Hey, thanks for saving me, man."
100379,386,287,1227000,Nelson Muntz,ROCKY BEACH,Of course I saved you -- you're my field trip buddy. And nothing else.
100380,386,288,1231000,Bart Simpson,ROCKY BEACH,You mean...
100381,386,289,1232000,Nelson Muntz,ROCKY BEACH,Exactly. You're barf to me now.
100383,386,291,1246000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nelson, I'll never forget that week we were best friends."
100384,386,292,1259000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"Haw haw, I touched your heart!"
100386,386,294,1275000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Greystash! Greystash!
100387,386,295,1280000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Gee, you're really upset about this Greystash thing."
100388,386,296,1283000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Don't say his name! In your mouth it sounds like dirt!
100389,386,297,1287000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, it's just a book."
100390,386,298,1288000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,No man should outlive his fictional wizard! No man!
