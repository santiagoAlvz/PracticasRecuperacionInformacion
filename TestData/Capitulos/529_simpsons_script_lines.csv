137568,529,47,181000,Blaise Pascal,HALL OF PROBABILITY,"My friend Silly Squirrel is about to buy a lottery ticket. Silly Squirrel, do you know the probability of winning the lottery?"
137570,529,49,190000,Blaise Pascal,HALL OF PROBABILITY,"Why, you are more likely to be run over by a car..."
137571,529,50,194000,Blaise Pascal,HALL OF PROBABILITY,Or be hit by lightning...
137572,529,51,198000,Blaise Pascal,HALL OF PROBABILITY,Or murdered by an acquaintance...
137574,529,53,201000,Blaise Pascal,Graveyard,"If you understood probability, you would never play the lottery."
137576,529,55,210000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Guys, this science exhibit that told me how stupid it is to play the lottery."
137577,529,56,214000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,So you didn't buy our weekly ticket?
137578,529,57,217000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Are you nuts? You can't win if you don't play.
137579,529,58,220000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, it's time. Turn it on! Turn it on!"
137580,529,59,222000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Four lucky numbers for four best friends.
137581,529,60,225000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, I always go with three -- the number of brothers and sisters I, uh, ""Hunger Games'd"", in the womb."
137582,529,61,231000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Nineteen for me! And for the best year of my life: nineteen ninety-six.
137583,529,62,234000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,My number's twenty-two. No reason. Just twenty-two.
137584,529,63,238000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"And I'm sixty-nine, because people always laugh when you say sixty-nine. No one knows why."
137585,529,64,246000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,"And the winning numbers are... three, nineteen, twenty-two and sixty-nine."
137586,529,65,253000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Oh my gosh... we won. We won the Springfield lottery!
137587,529,66,256000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,That's two hundred grand! That's fifty thousand bucks each!
137588,529,67,262000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Guys, guys, we gotta celebrate! Throw a ragin' party! I'll cash the ticket, Homer, Homer, you get the food--"
137589,529,68,267000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I'll get mini-dumpsters of wings from Garbage Wings!
137590,529,69,271000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"And Lenny, you get the drinks!"
137591,529,70,272000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,But we're already at a bar.
137592,529,71,274000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, no, ah, that's just gasoline and hot dog water."
137593,529,72,277000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Who cares? We got the money! I'm so happy! I'm so happy!
137594,529,73,283000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,To the best feeling in the world -- money.
137595,529,74,289000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Guys, I got big plans for these winnings. I'm going to build... a swimming pool."
136513,529,75,295000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,In-ground?
137596,529,76,297000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"So freaking far in the ground, baby."
137597,529,77,299000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"What about you, Carl? What are you gonna do with your share of the money?"
137598,529,78,305000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Oh... I guess Carl ain't back yet from cashin' in the ticket.
137599,529,79,309000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,I'm sure he just got held up in traffic.
137600,529,80,311000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, that's probably what happened."
137601,529,81,313000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,I wonder what's keeping Carl?
137602,529,82,315000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I hope our friend wasn't in an accident.
137603,529,83,317000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I'm glad we're the kind of people who are worried about Carl's safety instead of thinking that he ripped us off.
137604,529,84,323000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I wasn't thinking that! Carl's our good friend.
137605,529,85,325000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Our good friend!
137606,529,86,328000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, good old Carl."
137607,529,87,331000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Good old Carl's phone went straight to voicemail. Again.
137609,529,89,338000,Homer Simpson,WINDING ROAD,"The power of friendship is so amazing, I don't feel at all suspicious of Carl."
137610,529,90,344000,Moe Szyslak,WINDING ROAD,Drive faster because of the power of friendship.
137612,529,92,350000,Lenny Leonard,Carl's Apartment,Carl's gone.
137613,529,93,352000,Homer Simpson,Carl's Apartment,Our money's gone.
137614,529,94,354000,Moe Szyslak,Carl's Apartment,We've been betrayed -- by good ol' Carl!
137615,529,95,356000,Homer Simpson,Carl's Apartment,"Guys, I think we might need a new song. FOUR BEST FRIENDS WHO NE-VER QUAR-REL"
137616,529,96,364000,Moe Szyslak,Carl's Apartment,"HOMER SIMPSON, LENNY, MOE, AND... AND..."
137618,529,98,370000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Airport,And no one...
137620,529,100,377000,Moe Szyslak,Carl's Apartment,"All our lottery money, gone! If I ever see that Carl again, I'm gonna freeze him, chop him up into ice cubes, and scoop him into the urinal trough at the gathering of the Juggalos."
137621,529,101,386000,Lenny Leonard,Carl's Apartment,"Guys, give Carl a chance! I'm sure he's gonna come back!"
137622,529,102,389000,Homer Simpson,Carl's Apartment,I don't think so -- his travel neck pillow's gone from its pedestal...
137623,529,103,393000,Moe Szyslak,Carl's Apartment,"Fellas, he ain't comin' back."
137624,529,104,393000,Lenny Leonard,Carl's Apartment,You don't know that! I'm gonna keep looking till we figure out what really happened.
137626,529,105,399000,Lenny Leonard,Carl's Apartment,"I bet he flew to Quebec to bring us back authentic French Canadian sugar pie. Oh, I can taste it already. ""Mmm, thanks for the sugar pie, Carl."""
137627,529,106,410000,Homer Simpson,Carl's Apartment,"Hey, what's this? ""I've gone home. Goodbye forever, Carl Carlson."""
137628,529,107,414000,Lenny Leonard,Carl's Apartment,"Where'd you go, Carl?"
137630,529,109,422000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"I had plans for that money too -- I was gonna be one of those guys who's really into hot sauce! Hot sauce suspenders, hot sauce pajamas, bolo tie with a little chili pepper on it..."
137631,529,110,433000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I still can't believe it was Carl who took your winnings. I thought it would have been you, or you, or you."
137632,529,111,440000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know, me too. It's the ultimate screw-over."
137633,529,112,444000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe he had a good reason to give you the ultimate screw-over.
137634,529,113,447000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"He said he went home, and his passport is gone. What country is he from?"
137636,529,115,454000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't know where Carl is from?
137637,529,116,457000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, you know how dudes are. We don't go digging into the past. We talk about guy stuff."
137638,529,117,467000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"You know, guy stuff."
137639,529,118,469000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe if you'd talked less about guy stuff you'd know more about your so-called friend.
137640,529,119,474000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Well it don't matter no more, Midge. Carl is gone, and we're already auditioning replacements."
137642,529,121,482000,Lou,Moe's Tavern,This could not be more offensive. Man!
137643,529,122,485000,Lou,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, of course."
137644,529,123,491000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, hey, get that outta here! I don't ever want to see that moolah-stealing jackpot-thief again!"
137645,529,124,495000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Wait a minute! Something's reflected in the lenses of Carl's sunglasses!
137646,529,125,501000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I just need to get closer.
137647,529,126,506000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,He's looking at a geyser! And there's a sign in front of it!
137648,529,127,511000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,It's too small to read.
137649,529,128,516000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,It's backwards.
137650,529,129,518000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Try this.
137651,529,130,519000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Strokkur Geysir.
137625,529,132,524000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The geyser's one of the most famous natural wonders in... Iceland. I guess that's where Carl's from.
137653,529,133,531000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Ice-land? Is that even a real place?
137655,529,134,533000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought it was Superman's Superman-cave.
137656,529,135,535000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Iceland keeps the most detailed family records of any country in the world.
137657,529,136,540000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,There... Carl was adopted... by a couple who lives outside Reykjavik.
137658,529,137,547000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Well if that's Carl's home, then that's where our money is! And that's where we're going! We gotta pack!"
137662,529,141,560000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fifty bucks per bag? I guess I'm only bringing one guitar on this revenge trip.
137663,529,142,568000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're going so far away. I'll miss you.
137664,529,143,571000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Baby... I'm going for us. That money is gonna dig us a swimming pool that'll take our broken family and make it whole.
137665,529,144,578000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We're not broken!
137666,529,145,580000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,We're broken.
137667,529,146,580000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We're pretty broken.
137668,529,147,582000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How am I going to sleep if someone isn't pushing me all the way to the very edge of the bed?
137669,529,148,587000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've already taken care of that.
137670,529,149,593000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that's perfect."
137673,529,152,601000,Lenny Leonard,Plane,I can't wait to see the smile on Carl's face when we surprise him. I call first hug!
137674,529,153,606000,Moe Szyslak,Plane,"Hey Lenny, when are you gonna wise up? Carl never wants to see us again! I'm done talkin' to you!"
137675,529,154,614000,Homer Simpson,Plane,"This is funny, it says here Iceland is green, and Greenland is icy. The Vikings switched the names to trick everybody."
137676,529,155,625000,Lenny Leonard,Plane,/ That's pretty good! / Great gag!
137678,529,157,628000,Moe Szyslak,STREETS OF REYKJAVIK,"Hey Vikings, it's still pretty damn cold!"
137679,529,158,631000,Lenny Leonard,STREETS OF REYKJAVIK,I only packed shorts!
137681,529,160,640000,Moe Szyslak,REYKJAVIK CLOTHING STORE,"Excuse me, uh, we're looking for our, friend... he's, uh, about so tall, uh, wears a jacket, he's, um, got no visible tattoos..."
137682,529,161,650000,Homer Simpson,REYKJAVIK CLOTHING STORE,"Just say he's black, Moe."
137683,529,162,652000,Moe Szyslak,REYKJAVIK CLOTHING STORE,You say he's black!
137684,529,163,653000,Lenny Leonard,REYKJAVIK CLOTHING STORE,His name is Carl Carlson.
137686,529,164,655000,Male Icelander,REYKJAVIK CLOTHING STORE,Carl Carlson! His family has been hated for a thousand years.
137687,529,165,659000,Homer Simpson,REYKJAVIK CLOTHING STORE,How do you know about Carl's family?
137688,529,166,661000,Male Icelander,REYKJAVIK CLOTHING STORE,"Our country is very small, very judgmental, and very nosy. Ingimar Ögmundsson, how progresses your gonorrhea?"
137689,529,167,669000,Ingimar,REYKJAVIK CLOTHING STORE,"It heals, but slowly."
137690,529,168,672000,Moe Szyslak,REYKJAVIK CLOTHING STORE,Why does everybody hate Carl's family?
137692,529,170,674000,Male Icelander,ICELANDIC MUSEUM OF NATIONAL HISTORY,Here's why.
137694,529,172,677000,Male Icelander,Museum,"This saga tells of how Carl Carlson's family were the watchmen of the coast, always keeping an eye out for invading hordes. Iceland's safety depended on their vigilance."
137695,529,173,687000,Male Icelander,Museum,"But the Carlsons failed in their duty. The enemy invaded, laying waste to our lava fields, burning our sweaters, and feasting upon our tiny horses."
137696,529,174,697000,Moe Szyslak,Museum,Apparently screwing over your friends is in Carl's blood -- his adopted blood.
137699,529,177,708000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"All right, this is it, Carl's family home. Twenty-two..."
137700,529,178,713000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"Ooh, phew, oh, that's a lot of letters."
137701,529,179,716000,Lenny Leonard,Farmhouse,Twenty-two Hjorleifsstræti. So that's why twenty-two was Carl's lottery number.
137702,529,180,721000,Moe Szyslak,Farmhouse,"Yeah, and that's why his sweatpants say ""Hjorleifsstræti"" across the butt."
137703,529,181,726000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,The gates are locked.
137704,529,182,728000,Moe Szyslak,Farmhouse,Well then we'll just have to wait for him to come out.
137706,529,184,732000,Moe Szyslak,Icelandic Car,"Oh man, stakeouts are so boring. I wish I had something to look at."
137707,529,185,736000,Moe Szyslak,Icelandic Car,I guess I'll just read the car rental contract again.
137708,529,186,740000,Moe Szyslak,Icelandic Car,"Damage waiver, check. Return with full tank of gas, check."
137709,529,187,744000,Moe Szyslak,Icelandic Car,All drivers must be over the age of twenty-five... and check.
137711,529,189,750000,Carl Carlson,Farmhouse,"Love ya, Mom. See ya, Dad."
137714,529,192,760000,Lenny Leonard,Homer's Car,"It's Carl! Wake up, wake up!"
137716,529,194,781000,Homer Simpson,REYKJAVIK,"Aw, dammit, we lost him!"
137685,529,195,784000,Moe Szyslak,REYKJAVIK,There he is! And he's got our money!
137717,529,196,804000,Homer Simpson,REYKJAVIK,It's no use. We're perfectly matched.
137718,529,197,811000,Homer Simpson,REYKJAVIK,We did it!
137720,529,199,815000,Homer Simpson,Icelandic Restaurant,"Give us some answers, or you'll get a mouthful of rotten shark fermented in its own urine."
137721,529,200,820000,Carl Carlson,Icelandic Restaurant,"No, no, anything but the inedible, repulsive food of my native land!"
137722,529,201,824000,Lenny Leonard,Icelandic Restaurant,"Yeah Carl, tell them the good reason you had for borrowing the money."
137723,529,202,828000,Carl Carlson,Icelandic Restaurant,"Look, I admit it. I gave you the ultimate screw over. But I did it to clear my family's name. Everyone blames the barbarian invasion on my ancestors. But that saga had a missing page."
137724,529,203,841000,Lenny Leonard,Icelandic Restaurant,Oh yeah... a page was torn out.
137725,529,204,843000,Carl Carlson,Icelandic Restaurant,"My family's always believed that we fought bravely against the invaders, and the missing page will prove it! I took the lottery money to buy that page and restore my family's honor."
137726,529,205,853000,Lenny Leonard,Icelandic Restaurant,Why didn't you just tell us? We're your friends.
137727,529,206,856000,Carl Carlson,Icelandic Restaurant,I didn't tell you because... we're not friends!
137729,529,208,860000,Carl Carlson,Icelandic Restaurant,"Friends share their feelings, their hopes, their dreams! Friends know their friends are from Iceland! We are just guys who sit next to each other at a bar and talk about guy stuff."
137730,529,209,872000,Lenny Leonard,Icelandic Restaurant,So all those years of hanging out... meant nothing?
137731,529,210,875000,Carl Carlson,Icelandic Restaurant,Not to me.
