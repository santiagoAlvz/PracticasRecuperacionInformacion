146007,562,87,362000,Kodos,Spaceship,All will be revealed in time... unsuspecting humans.
146008,562,88,366000,Lisa Simpson,Spaceship,Why does the last thing you say sound so ominous?
146009,562,89,369000,Kang,Spaceship,It's just the way we speak... easily-reassured fool.

146040,562,121,450000,Homer Simpson,SIMPSONS' SHIP,Look at all these knobs and buttons. They are clearly a superior race. But maybe that means they'll be nice to us.
146041,562,122,458000,Lisa Simpson,SIMPSONS' SHIP,You mean like Europeans were to the Native Americans? Or the Belgians were to the Congo?
146042,562,123,463000,Homer Simpson,SIMPSONS' SHIP,That's right. Pick the only two times in history where things got messy.

146073,562,154,589000,Kang,RIGEL 7,"Farewell dear friends, on your sacred journey to the chopper-upper."
146074,562,155,593000,Marge Simpson,RIGEL 7,Aww.
146075,562,156,594000,Lisa Simpson,RIGEL 7,Why are you sharing all of this with us?
146076,562,157,596000,Kodos,RIGEL 7,Because we want you to fully appreciate the planet... that you will never leave.
146078,562,159,603000,Homer Simpson,RIGEL 7,"Wait, are you telling me we're prisoners in this cage?!"
146079,562,160,614000,BAGPIPER,RIGEL 7,"Okay, take five."

146102,562,183,718000,INTELLECTUAL ALIEN,SIMPSONS' CAGE,"And now the part that is difficult to tell you. At the end of a life well-lived, there is one final ritual: we must eat one of you."
146104,562,185,728000,INTELLECTUAL ALIEN,SIMPSONS' CAGE,But we'll let you have the fun of picking which one.
146105,562,186,734000,Marge Simpson,SIMPSONS' CAGE,There's only one fair solution: we have to put it to a vote.
146106,562,187,738000,Bart Simpson,SIMPSONS' CAGE,"Before we vote, I'd just like to point out in Sophie's Choice she saved the boy."
146108,562,189,747000,Homer Simpson,SIMPSONS' CAGE,This isn't a happy thing!

146162,562,242,949000,Homer Simpson,RIGEL 7,Where are you taking me?
146163,562,243,950000,Alien Woman,RIGEL 7,You are about to behold the secret rebel base.
146164,562,244,961000,Homer Simpson,RIGEL 7,Why are they dancing? Shouldn't they be making weapons?
146165,562,245,964000,ALIEN MAN,RIGEL 7,This is excellent training... for the party we will throw when our rebellion succeeds.
146166,562,246,971000,Alien,RIGEL 7,Turn the music back on!
146167,562,247,974000,Alien Woman,RIGEL 7,"In a minute! First, noble human Homer Simpson will explain his primitive yet beautiful culture."
146170,562,250,984000,Homer Simpson,Cave,"...but perhaps Earth's greatest achievement is moon rocks. Oh, and the golden age of radio."
146172,562,252,992000,Alien Woman,Cave,Truly a species with much to offer.
146173,562,253,995000,Alien,Cave,Seriously? Are we listening to the same guy?
146174,562,254,997000,Alien Woman,Cave,"Silence! Homer, we will get you back to Earth."
146175,562,255,1001000,Homer Simpson,Cave,What about my family?
146176,562,256,1002000,ALIEN MAN,Cave,Why do you care? It's just your sex mate and spermlings.
146177,562,257,1005000,Homer Simpson,Cave,"Sex mate? Clearly you've never been married. But it's great, I'm telling you."
146179,562,259,1012000,Alien Woman,FLYING SAUCER,"Unfortunately, we only had the means to build the spaceship for one. We spent most of our money on the party."
146180,562,260,1018000,Homer Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,"Well, it is a great party."
146181,562,261,1020000,Alien Woman,FLYING SAUCER,The pod is equipped to fulfill your deepest desires. Just concentrate.
146182,562,262,1032000,Homer Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,"Suddenly, this trip has gotten interesting."
146183,562,263,1038000,Homer Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,What the?!
146184,562,264,1040000,Homer Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,Oh who am I kidding? I couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family. I'm going back to save them.
146185,562,265,1046000,Alien Woman,FLYING SAUCER,"Aww. If I could just live inside that head, so full of noble thoughts."
146186,562,266,1057000,Kang,FLYING SAUCER,"The golden rule states if the chosen one escapes, his family is eaten as forfeit."
146187,562,267,1063000,HOMER),FLYING SAUCER,What do your rules say now?
146188,562,268,1065000,Kang,FLYING SAUCER,That all will be eaten!
146190,562,270,1069000,Lisa Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,This system is really rigged against us.
146193,562,273,1075000,Homer Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,You forgot to glaze me!
146194,562,274,1076000,Kodos,FLYING SAUCER,No I didn't! You licked it off!
146195,562,275,1079000,Homer Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,I think somebody's afraid to admit he's out of glaze.
146197,562,277,1089000,Homer Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,"Glaze, please."
146199,562,279,1094000,Kang,FLYING SAUCER,Make way for the queen!
146200,562,280,1100000,Queen Elizabeth II,FLYING SAUCER,I shall take the first bite. It is quite an honor.
146201,562,281,1104000,Homer Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,What's that?
146202,562,282,1105000,Kang,FLYING SAUCER,Part of your magnificent behind. We sliced it off when you were sleeping.
146203,562,283,1109000,Homer Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,It does look delicious.
146204,562,284,1119000,Kodos,FLYING SAUCER,"What is it, my queen?"
146205,562,285,1121000,Queen Elizabeth II,FLYING SAUCER,This ass is most disagreeable.
146206,562,286,1128000,INTELLECTUAL ALIEN,FLYING SAUCER,The creatures are composed of completely indigestible toxins!
146207,562,287,1135000,INTELLECTUAL ALIEN,FLYING SAUCER,These humans have been poisoned by their unhealthy fast-food diet.
146208,562,288,1140000,Lisa Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,"Um, are you sure you don't want to try me again?"
146209,562,289,1143000,Kang,FLYING SAUCER,You?! Your lunches of hummus and rice cakes combine in your stomach to form formaldehyde and animal fat.
146210,562,290,1149000,Lisa Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,Really? But I thought...
146211,562,291,1151000,Kodos,FLYING SAUCER,You'd be better off chewing tobacco like the boy.
146212,562,292,1154000,Marge Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,What?!
146213,562,293,1155000,Bart Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,Dad said I could try it.
146214,562,294,1156000,Marge Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,Homer!
146215,562,295,1157000,Homer Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,Don't you people realize your queen is dying?
146216,562,296,1161000,INTELLECTUAL ALIEN,FLYING SAUCER,"I'm afraid the lardo speaks the truth, Your Majesty."
146217,562,297,1165000,Queen Elizabeth II,FLYING SAUCER,It's all right. I have seen many glories and have only one regret: that my breasts aren't bigger.
146218,562,298,1171000,Bart Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,I don't see any breasts.
146219,562,299,1173000,Queen Elizabeth II,FLYING SAUCER,And those will be the last words I ever hear.
146220,562,300,1179000,Kodos,FLYING SAUCER,"Useless humans! We will send you back to your planet, and your memories will fade. So it will be as if none of this ever happened."
146222,562,302,1192000,Homer Simpson,Spaceship,"Captain's log, Star date: six-five-eight-four-eight point two. After successfully conquering the Rigelians..."
146223,562,303,1199000,Lisa Simpson,Spaceship,Right. Conquering.
146224,562,304,1199000,Bart Simpson,Spaceship,At least Maggie can fly us home.
146225,562,305,1203000,Marge Simpson,Spaceship,Thank God it's just like her busy box.
146228,562,306,1208000,Lisa Simpson,Spaceship,"Well, I guess we've learned that of all the countless planets in the universe, we have evolved into the most inedible species. Like three bean salad at a barbecue, we will remain untouched."
146229,562,307,1221000,Marge Simpson,Spaceship,We're receiving a transmission from an unknown source!
146230,562,308,1227000,Grampa Simpson,Spaceship,"Hey, I finally tracked you down! My oatmeal's gone cold!"
146231,562,309,1232000,Grampa Simpson,Spaceship,The cat ate my heart medicine!
146232,562,310,1234000,Homer Simpson,Spaceship,"Set a course, Mr. Maggie. Anywhere but home."
