155909,25,1,41000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Do you two have to sit so close to the TV? Back up, or it'll hurt your eyes."
155910,25,2,60000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, it will not."
155911,25,3,61000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yes it will.
155912,25,4,65000,Bald One,Simpson Home,"Our next movie is ""McBane."" Another shoot 'em up, push 'em through the plate-glass window, splatter-fest from the Hollywood cookie-cutter. Here's a typically brainless scene."
155892,25,6,74000,Police Captain,Police Captain's Office,"Senator Mendoza is one of the most respected citizens in this state, McBane. And yet you ran his limo off a cliff, broke the necks of three of his bodyguards and drove a bus through his front door."
147981,25,7,83000,McBain,Police Captain's Office,"But, Captain, I have proof that he's head of an international drug cartel."
155914,25,8,87000,Police Captain,Police Captain's Office,"I don't want to hear it, McBane. You're outta here!"
147982,25,10,94000,McBain,Police Captain's Office,That makes two of us.
155916,25,11,98000,Homer Simpson,Police Captain's Office,That makes two of us.
155918,25,13,98000,Fat One,Police Captain's Office,"You know, I can't believe we're talking about the same movie!"
155919,25,14,105000,Bald One,Police Captain's Office,"Oh, no..."
155920,25,15,105000,Fat One,Police Captain's Office,"I thought ""McBane"" was a non-stop, roller-coaster of chills, thrills, spills and kills."
155922,25,17,111000,Fat One,Police Captain's Office,And that chase at the end my friend...
155923,25,18,114000,Bald One,Police Captain's Office,Are you nuts? That movie stinks like a creepy one bedroom apartment.
155924,25,19,117000,Fat One,Police Captain's Office,Your mother didn't think it was so creepy.
155925,25,20,118000,Bald One,Police Captain's Office,My mother. Real mature. I'm sick of your...
155926,25,21,121000,Homer Simpson,Police Captain's Office,I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.
155927,25,22,124000,Bart Simpson,Police Captain's Office,"Hey, what gives?"
155928,25,23,127000,Lisa Simpson,Police Captain's Office,"Dad, do something!"
155929,25,24,128000,Homer Simpson,Police Captain's Office,"All right, all right. Time for Dr. TV to perform a little surgery."
155930,25,25,134000,Bart Simpson,Police Captain's Office,"Looks like you lost the patient, Doc."
155931,25,26,137000,Homer Simpson,Police Captain's Office,"Shut up, boy. Cheap Chinese TVs... Why did I every buy... Is that better?"
155932,25,27,142000,Lisa Simpson,Police Captain's Office,No!
155933,25,28,143000,Homer Simpson,Police Captain's Office,How's this?
155935,25,30,147000,Homer Simpson,Police Captain's Office,"Okay, just everybody remain calm."
155937,25,32,155000,Bart Simpson,Police Captain's Office,"Hey, everybody! If you look real close, you can kinda make 'em out."
155938,25,33,158000,Homer Simpson,Police Captain's Office,"Hey, yeah, yeah. I think I can."
155939,25,34,160000,Marge Simpson,Police Captain's Office,I think this is sick. They're staring at a dot!
155940,25,35,163000,Homer Simpson,Police Captain's Office,She's right! She's right!
155941,25,36,166000,Homer Simpson,Police Captain's Office,"Oh, how I miss TV! Dear, God. Just give me one channel!"
155942,25,37,170000,Marge Simpson,Police Captain's Office,"Homer. It's not the end of the world. You know, before we got married we hardly ever watched television."
155943,25,38,176000,Bart Simpson,Police Captain's Office,You lie!
155944,25,39,176000,Homer Simpson,Police Captain's Office,Bart!
155945,25,40,177000,Marge Simpson,Police Captain's Office,"No, it's true, Bart. We used to shoot pool... and go dancing..."
155946,25,41,181000,Lisa Simpson,Police Captain's Office,How romantic.
155947,25,42,183000,Marge Simpson,Police Captain's Office,"And a lot of times we'd stay at home and talk, just like this."
155949,25,43,186000,Bart Simpson,Police Captain's Office,I'm livin' it but I ain't lovin' it.
155950,25,44,188000,Lisa Simpson,Police Captain's Office,It's so hard to picture you two then. Hand in hand at the crossroads of life. There are so many questions.
155951,25,45,195000,Marge Simpson,Police Captain's Office,Pick one.
155952,25,46,195000,Lisa Simpson,Police Captain's Office,Okay. Uh... how did Dad propose to you?
155953,25,47,199000,Marge Simpson,Police Captain's Office,Uh... well....
155955,25,49,203000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Well, Miss Bouvier. I think we found the reason why you've been throwing up in the morning. Congratulations."
155959,25,53,213000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, I'd rather tell you a different story. How your father and I first met and fell in love."
155960,25,54,221000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"We were seniors in high school, but we had never even met."
155963,25,57,231000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Ugh, gross. Ecch."
155964,25,58,233000,Homer Simpson,Car,SOME PEOPLE CALL ME A SPACE COWBOY / YEAH / SOME CALL ME THE GANGSTER OF LOVE / SOME PEOPLE CALL ME MAURICE. Woo woo / 'CAUSE I SPEAK OF THE PUPPETS OH OF LOVE.
155966,25,60,256000,Barney Gumble,Springfield High School,"Hey, Homer. You're late for English."
155967,25,61,259000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"English! Who needs that? I'm never going to England. Come on, let's go smoke."
155968,25,62,264000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,I'm for equal rights. But do we really need a whole amendment?
155969,25,63,268000,Kim,Springfield High School,"Come on, Marge. Don't you think you deserve to earn just as much as a man who does the same job?"
155970,25,64,273000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,Not if I have to do heavy lifting or math.
155971,25,65,276000,Kim,Springfield High School,Oh Marge. You really ought to read this.
155972,25,66,280000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,"Oh, the shop kids are smoking again."
155974,25,68,288000,Barney Gumble,Boy's Bathroom,"Oh, no! We're late for wood shop."
155975,25,69,290000,Homer Simpson,Boy's Bathroom,But we're early for lunch. Let's go grab a burger.
155976,25,70,294000,Barney Gumble,Boy's Bathroom,"Boy, you never stop eatin' and you don't gain a pound."
155977,25,71,296000,Homer Simpson,Boy's Bathroom,"Eh, it's my metabmobolism. I guess I'm just one of the lucky ones."
155978,25,72,300000,Principal Dondelinger,Boy's Bathroom,"Well, well, well. If it isn't Homer Simpson and Barney Gumbel. Springfield's answer to Cheech and Chong."
155979,25,73,305000,Principal Dondelinger,Boy's Bathroom,"Allow me, gentlemen. You just bought yourselves three days of detention. You know where and when."
155980,25,74,310000,Barney Gumble,Boy's Bathroom,Three o'clock. Old building. Room 106.
155982,25,76,313000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,"... And in another article, I found out that to hire professionals to do all the jobs of a housewife, who incidentally is not married to a house, would cost forty-eight thousand dollars a year!"
155983,25,77,328000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,The first step to liberation is to free ourselves from these... male imposed shackles.
155984,25,78,337000,Kim,Springfield High School,I didn't think it would burn so fast.
155985,25,79,339000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,"Hm, I guess it's the tissue paper inside."
155986,25,80,342000,Principal Dondelinger,Springfield High School,"Miss Bouvier, I am surprised!"
155987,25,81,344000,Principal Dondelinger,Springfield High School,You just bought yourself one day of detention. You know where and when.
155988,25,82,348000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,"Well, no I don't. Actually, I never really..."
155989,25,83,350000,Principal Dondelinger,Springfield High School,Three o'clock. Old building. Room 106.
155991,25,85,356000,Barney Gumble,DETENTION HALL,"Hey, Estelle, will you go to the prom with me?"
155992,25,86,360000,Estelle,DETENTION HALL,I wouldn't go to the prom with you if you were Elliot Gould.
155993,25,87,364000,Barney Gumble,DETENTION HALL,"Oooh, shot down again."
155994,25,88,365000,Homer Simpson,DETENTION HALL,"Hey, don't worry Barney. It's a big school. There's gotta be a girl nobody else wants to take to the prom."
155995,25,89,371000,Marge Simpson,DETENTION HALL,"Excuse me, is this Room 106?"
155996,25,90,373000,Barney Gumble,DETENTION HALL,"Hey, who's that?"
155997,25,91,375000,Homer Simpson,DETENTION HALL,I... I don't know!
155998,25,92,377000,Barney Gumble,DETENTION HALL,"Hey, would you like to go to the..."
155999,25,93,397000,Homer Simpson,DETENTION HALL,She's mine!
156001,25,95,408000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"So, what are you in for?"
156002,25,96,409000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,I'm a political prisoner. Last time I ever take a stand.
156003,25,97,412000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"Well, I'm here for being me. Every day I show up, act like me, and they slap me in here."
156004,25,98,417000,Teacher,Springfield High School,Simpson! Be quiet!
156005,25,99,421000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,I haven't seen you in school before.
156006,25,100,422000,Teacher,Springfield High School,"Okay, Simpson."
156007,25,101,423000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,What?
156008,25,102,424000,Teacher,Springfield High School,You just bought yourself another day of detention!
156010,25,103,426000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,Maybe we should get together some time.
156011,25,104,426000,Teacher,Springfield High School,Two days!
156012,25,105,429000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,"I'm sorry, I don't even know your name."

156018,25,111,432000,Teacher,Springfield High School,Five days!
156019,25,112,432000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,It was worth it.
156020,25,113,433000,Teacher,Springfield High School,"Six days! Okay, Simpson. To the back of the room!"
156022,25,115,438000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, it was love at first sight."
156023,25,116,440000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"It was a jailhouse romance, man."
156024,25,117,441000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'd reached step one: She knew I existed. The only problem was, she didn't care."
156026,25,119,446000,Grampa Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"What's the matter, boy?"
156027,25,120,448000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Nothing.
156028,25,121,450000,Grampa Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"You haven't said boo all night, and usually I have to wrestle the bucket out of your greasy mitts."
156029,25,122,453000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Dad, I'm in love."
156030,25,123,455000,Grampa Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Uh-oh. Why don't you grab yourself a beer, boy."
156031,25,124,458000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"But, Dad, I don't drink..."
156032,25,125,459000,Grampa Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Cut the crap. ""I just collect the cans, Daddy."" Now grab yourself a beer and get me one, too."
156033,25,126,467000,Grampa Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Now, this girlfriend of yours. Is she a real looker?"
156034,25,127,471000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Uh-huh.
156035,25,128,471000,Grampa Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,A lot on the ball?
156036,25,129,472000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Oh, yeah."
156037,25,130,473000,Grampa Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Ohhh, son, don't overreach. Go for the dented car, the dead-end job, the less attractive girl. Ohh, I blame myself. I should have had this talk a long time ago."
156038,25,131,487000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Thanks, Pop."
156041,25,134,495000,Homer Simpson,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"Hi, I'm Homer Simpson. I need some guidance, counselor."
156042,25,135,497000,MCINTYRE,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,Okey dokey.
156043,25,136,499000,MCINTYRE,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"Good Lord! Simpson, you should have come to see me a long time ago."
156044,25,137,503000,Homer Simpson,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"Well, yeah, maybe, but I just met this girl, Marge Bouvier and I want to force her to like me."
156045,25,138,508000,MCINTYRE,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,That's not exactly the type of guidance I give.
156046,25,139,510000,Homer Simpson,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,Oh.
156047,25,140,511000,MCINTYRE,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"Well, I like to think I do something helpful for every student N through Z. The only advice I can give you is, try to share a common interest and spend, spend, spend."
156048,25,141,521000,Homer Simpson,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"Well, what interest does she have that I could make common?"
156049,25,142,523000,MCINTYRE,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"Oh, I believe she's very active on the Forensics Team. They meet in the new building. Room two-nineteen."
156050,25,143,525000,Homer Simpson,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,Far out!
156051,25,144,528000,MCINTYRE,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"Homer, do you have any plans for after graduation?"
156052,25,145,531000,Homer Simpson,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,Me? I'm gonna drink a lot of beer and stay out all night.
156053,25,146,535000,MCINTYRE,GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"Oh, no, I meant career-wise. You know, that nuclear power plant will be opening soon. It's one of the few outfits around that won't require a college education."
156055,25,148,544000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"Me, in a nuclear power plant... Kaboom!"
156056,25,149,551000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,"""Bringing up a son, even a blind one, isn't a lifetime occupation. Now, the more you help him... the more you hurt him."""
156057,25,150,557000,Artie Ziff,Springfield High School,Woe unto Shelbyville should they underestimate our strength in Dramatic Interpretation.
156058,25,151,566000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,"Well thank you, Artie."
156059,25,152,568000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,My name's Homer Simpson. I'd like to sign up for something.
156060,25,153,570000,Mrs. Bloominstein,Springfield High School,"Well, we have an opening on the Debate Team."
156061,25,154,572000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"Debate? Like, arguing?"
156062,25,155,573000,Mrs. Bloominstein,Springfield High School,Yes.
156063,25,156,574000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"I'll take that, you stinkpot! Just warming up, Mrs. Bloominstein."
156064,25,157,579000,Mrs. Bloominstein,Springfield High School,"This year's topic is, ""Resolved: The national speed limit should be lowered to fifty-five miles per hour."""
156065,25,158,585000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"Fifty-five! That's ridiculous! Sure, they'll save a few lives. But millions will be late!"
156066,25,159,593000,Mrs. Bloominstein,Springfield High School,"Why don't you take ""con""?"
156068,25,161,603000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,No Way.
156070,25,163,605000,Artie Ziff,Springfield High School,Our current speed limit is an anachronism. The fatuity...
156071,25,164,605000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,Ignoramus.
156072,25,165,608000,Artie Ziff,Springfield High School,Will you shut up?
156073,25,166,610000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,Wait a minute! That word you keep calling me --
156074,25,167,612000,Artie Ziff,Springfield High School,Ignoramus?
156075,25,168,612000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,Ignoramus. It means I'm stupid! Doesn't it?
156076,25,169,615000,Artie Ziff,Springfield High School,There's a difference between ignorance and stupidity.
156077,25,170,617000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,Not to me there isn't!
156078,25,171,617000,Mrs. Bloominstein,Springfield High School,"Homer,"
156079,25,172,617000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,You ignoramus.
156080,25,173,620000,Artie Ziff,Springfield High School,You're the ignoramus.
156081,25,174,620000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"No, you..."

156089,25,182,635000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"Oh, you may not remember me. I'm Homer Simpson. I mooned for rebuttal."

156091,25,184,640000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,So... you wanna go out with me?
156092,25,185,643000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,"Well, I don't think you're my type."
156093,25,186,646000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"Well, a... You see the problem is, you don't know me. I have references. Just ask Coach Flanagan, and ask Mr. Seckofsky and Barney Gumbel."
156094,25,187,658000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,"Hmm, I don't know."
156095,25,188,659000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"Look, I'm not asking you to like me, I'm not asking you to put yourself in a position where I can touch your goodies, I'm just asking you to be fair."
156096,25,189,666000,Coach Flanagan,Springfield High School,"Homer Simpson? Oh, yeah. Junior Varsity shot putter. Hmmm, hmmm. I think if he applies himself, trains real hard, hits the weights, he could go another foot."
156097,25,190,676000,Mr. Seckofsky,Springfield High School,"I had him for four years. Solid ""C"" student. Made a lamp last year."
156098,25,191,681000,Barney Gumble,Springfield High School,"He's all things to all men, and maybe to one lucky gal. Wanna go to the prom with me?"
156099,25,192,687000,Kim,Springfield High School,"Good God, no."
156100,25,193,689000,Barney Gumble,Springfield High School,Well put.
156101,25,194,691000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"Well, what's the good word?"
156102,25,195,693000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,I'm sorry.
156103,25,196,694000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,What?
156105,25,197,695000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,"Well, you seem like a nice enough guy, but I really don't have the time."
156106,25,198,695000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,What?
156107,25,199,695000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,And the City Forensics championship is coming up.
156108,25,200,702000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"Yeah, so...."

156113,25,205,707000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School,Just those who need help with French.
156114,25,206,709000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,French. What a coincidence. Just the subject I'm having trouble with.
156116,25,208,716000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you cagey ol' dog.
156117,25,209,719000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Great story. Positively spellbinding. Work, damn you, work!"
156118,25,210,723000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, pay attention. You may be telling this to your own son one day if something breaks."
156120,25,212,731000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Ooh, lost a few. Oh, well there's plenty more where that came from. Uh-oh, a zit. No problemo."
156121,25,213,742000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,The perfect crime.
156122,25,214,746000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Hel - lo.
156123,25,215,759000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Why is there make-out music on?
156124,25,216,761000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,It helps me study. Heh-heh-heh.
156125,25,217,763000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Well, not me. Shut it off and let's get down to business."
156126,25,218,773000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Cray-on.
156127,25,219,774000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Bien.
156128,25,220,775000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Fenetre.
156129,25,221,778000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Bien.
156130,25,222,780000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Femme.
156131,25,223,781000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Tres bien. Well, I should probably be going. I have a big Forensics meet tomorrow."
156132,25,224,787000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Oh.... wait, Don't go. Don't go. Wait, wait -- why don't we take a little study break?"
156133,25,225,793000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Do the hustle!
156134,25,226,795000,Grampa Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Keep it down!
156135,25,227,797000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Homer, you're amazing. Before you couldn't say bon jour. But now you can conjugate all the regular verbs, two irregular verbs, and sing the first verse of ""Allouette""."
156136,25,228,798000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,ALLOUETTE JAUNTE ALLOUETTE / ALLOUETTE JAUNTE...
156137,25,229,810000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Yeah!
156139,25,230,811000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"I can't believe it, it's sticking. You're telling me new stuff, and minutes later it's still there! And it's all thanks to you. Marge, when I see you forming the vowels and continents --"
156140,25,231,822000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Consonants.
156141,25,232,823000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"-- Consonants, with your beautiful mouth, and your beautiful breath pushing them past your beautiful teeth..."
156142,25,233,829000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Merci, I guess."
156143,25,234,831000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Marge, would you go to the prom with me?"
156144,25,235,835000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"You know, Homer, you're like no one I've ever met before. You're dear and honest and open, without a trace of pretension."
156145,25,236,843000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"I'll take that as a compliment. So, will you go out with me? Please say oui."
156146,25,237,849000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Oui.
156147,25,238,850000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Ohhh! oh, Marge! This'll be the greatest night of your life. I've been saving up for a new engine for my car, but I'm gonna spend it all on us. I'm renting the biggest limo. I'm gonna buy you the biggest corsage. My tux is gonna have the widest lapels, the most ruffles, and the highest platform shoes you ever saw."
156148,25,239,866000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Maybe I'll wear my hair... up.
156149,25,240,869000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Wait, wait, wait, Marge. If honest and open is what you like, get a load of this. I'm not really in any French class. This was just a brilliant scheme to get to know you better."
156150,25,241,881000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,Ow.
156151,25,242,883000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"You knew the City Forensics finals are tomorrow. And you kept me here until one a.m. pretending to be stupid. Homer J. Simpson, I hate you!"
156152,25,243,898000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S HOUSE,"Hey, Barney, guess whose got a date for the prom?"
156154,25,245,908000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Everything I know tells me this story doesn't end with us sitting here, and you telling it to us."
156155,25,246,912000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Get off the edge of your seat. They got married, had kids and bought a cheap TV. Okay?"
156157,25,248,915000,Marge Simpson,Shelbyville High School,Bringing up a son -- even a blind one -- isn't a lifetime occupation. Now the more you help him--
156158,25,249,920000,Marge Simpson,Shelbyville High School,-- The more you hurt him.
156159,25,250,929000,Marge Simpson,Shelbyville High School,"Congratulations, Artie."
156160,25,251,931000,Artie Ziff,Shelbyville High School,"Marge, this may not be the most appropriate forum for what I am about to put forth, but would you go to the prom with me?"
155948,25,252,940000,Marge Simpson,Shelbyville High School,Whoa--
156161,25,253,942000,Artie Ziff,Shelbyville High School,"I can think of a dozen highly cogent arguments. Now the first is from Time Magazine... dated January 8, 1974, ""America's Love Affair with The Prom... Even wallflowers can look forward to one date a year..."""
156162,25,254,950000,Marge Simpson,Shelbyville High School,"No, Artie, Artie. The best argument is that I've known and respected you for eight years, and I would be delighted to go to the prom with you."
156164,25,256,965000,Jacqueline Bouvier,Marge's Bedroom,"If you pinch your checks, they'll glow."
156165,25,257,967000,Jacqueline Bouvier,Marge's Bedroom,"A little more. Try to break some capillaries, dear."
156166,25,258,971000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Bedroom,Couldn't we just use rouge for this?
156167,25,259,972000,Jacqueline Bouvier,Marge's Bedroom,Ladies pinch. Whores use rouge.
156169,25,261,977000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S HOUSE,Is Marge here?
156170,25,262,979000,Patty Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,Who or what are you?
156171,25,263,982000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S HOUSE,I'm her date.
156172,25,264,982000,Patty Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,Mm-hmm. I suppose you want to come in and sit down.
156173,25,265,985000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S HOUSE,"Oh, okay."
156174,25,266,985000,Selma Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,Marge's dates get homelier all the time.
156175,25,267,988000,Patty Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,Mm-hmm. That's what you get when you don't put out.
156176,25,268,993000,Mr. Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,"You know, I usually insist on approving Marge's dates, but from what she's told me I'm sure you're a solid citizen."
156177,25,269,999000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S HOUSE,"Thanks, Mr. B."
156178,25,270,1001000,Jacqueline Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,Here she comes. Get the camera ready.
156179,25,271,1008000,Marge Simpson,MARGE'S HOUSE,Homer!
156180,25,272,1014000,Marge Simpson,MARGE'S HOUSE,What are you doing here?
156181,25,273,1015000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S HOUSE,You said you'd go to the prom with me.
156182,25,274,1018000,Marge Simpson,MARGE'S HOUSE,I also said I hated you and we haven't even talked since then.
156183,25,275,1022000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S HOUSE,"I was afraid you'd cancel our date so I stayed away from you completely, even though it meant skipping school for three weeks and graduating this summer... I hope."
156185,25,277,1031000,Artie Ziff,MARGE'S HOUSE,"I'm Artie Ziff, Marge's date for the prom."
156186,25,278,1035000,Patty Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,"Well, hello."
156187,25,279,1036000,Artie Ziff,MARGE'S HOUSE,"Well, hello... hello."
156188,25,280,1038000,Selma Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,Don't we look handsome.
156189,25,281,1040000,Artie Ziff,MARGE'S HOUSE,Yes indeed we do.
156190,25,282,1041000,Patty Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,"Well come in, young man."
156191,25,283,1043000,Mr. Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,"Wait a second. If he's your date, who are you?"
156104,25,284,1047000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S HOUSE,I'm... a spare. Excuse me.
156193,25,285,1051000,Selma Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,"Now that that unpleasantness is behind us forever, let's take a picture of the happy couple."
156194,25,286,1057000,Mr. Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,Say cheese whiz.
156196,25,288,1057000,Chauffeur,Limo,"Hey, buddy, where's your date?"
156197,25,289,1061000,Homer Simpson,Limo,She's with him.
156198,25,290,1063000,Chauffeur,Limo,"Ouch! So, I guess you want me to take you home?"
156199,25,291,1066000,Homer Simpson,Limo,"Hey, I paid for this car. I paid for this tuxedo and I paid for the two dinners. We're going to the prom."
156200,25,292,1073000,Chauffeur,Limo,The prom it is.
156202,25,294,1082000,Principal Dondelinger,Springfield High School Gym,"Don't dance too closely now. Have a good time. Wait a second -- is that a bong? You have asthma? All right, move along."
156203,25,295,1091000,Principal Dondelinger,Springfield High School Gym,"Homer Simpson, I thought you dropped out."
156204,25,296,1094000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School Gym,"You wish, Dondelinger."
156205,25,297,1096000,PRINCIPAL,Springfield High School Gym,That's Mr. Dondelinger.
156207,25,299,1109000,Waiter,Springfield High School,Steak or chicken?
156208,25,300,1110000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"One of each, please."
156209,25,301,1112000,Barney Gumble,Springfield High School,Comin' through.
156210,25,302,1112000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,Barney!
156211,25,303,1118000,Principal Dondelinger,Springfield High School,That young man's bought himself about a decade of detention.
156212,25,304,1121000,Principal Dondelinger,Springfield High School,"Children, we have tabulated your votes. The King and Queen of Springfield High School's Class of 1974 are -- Artie Ziff and Marge Bouvier!"
156213,25,305,1133000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,"Oh, isn't she great? Hail Queen Marge! Woo woo! Long live the Queen!"
156214,25,306,1141000,Artie Ziff,Springfield High School,"Fellow classmates. Instead of voting for some athletic hero, or a pretty boy, you have elected me, your intellectual superior, as your king. Good for you!"
156215,25,307,1152000,Principal Dondelinger,Springfield High School,Very well said. And now your King and Queen will share their first royal dance.
156216,25,308,1158000,Artie Ziff,Springfield High School,Why do birds suddenly appear? Every time you're near!
156217,25,309,1167000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,I gotta get outta here.
156219,25,311,1173000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School Gym,Homer?
156220,25,312,1175000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School Gym,What?
156221,25,313,1176000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School Gym,Why are you doing this? Why can't you accept that I'm here with someone else?
156223,25,314,1181000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School Gym,"Because I'm sure we were meant to be together. Usually when I have a thought there's a lot of other thoughts in there. Something says yes, something says no. But this time there's only yes. How could the only thing I've ever been sure about in my life be wrong?"
156224,25,315,1200000,Marge Simpson,Springfield High School Gym,"I don't know, but it is."
156226,25,317,1204000,Chauffeur,Springfield High School,"Well, where to now, Romeo?"
156227,25,318,1206000,Homer Simpson,Springfield High School,Inspiration Point.
156228,25,319,1208000,Chauffeur,Springfield High School,"Okay, but I'm only paid to drive."
156231,25,322,1213000,Artie Ziff,Inspiration Point,"Oh, Marge..."
156232,25,323,1213000,Marge Simpson,Inspiration Point,"Gee, Artie. Artie wait. I don't know. I mean, it was it was a beautiful evening. Let's not ruin it."
156233,25,324,1219000,Artie Ziff,Inspiration Point,Just kiss...
156234,25,325,1220000,Marge Simpson,Inspiration Point,"Artie, please!"
156235,25,326,1222000,Artie Ziff,Inspiration Point,"Come on, kiss me."
156236,25,327,1223000,Marge Simpson,Inspiration Point,"Oh, Artie!"
156237,25,328,1224000,Artie Ziff,Inspiration Point,"Please, please."
156238,25,329,1224000,Marge Simpson,Inspiration Point,"Now, really, I mean it. Now stop it!"
156239,25,330,1227000,Artie Ziff,Inspiration Point,"I'm sorry, Marge."
156240,25,331,1230000,Marge Simpson,Inspiration Point,"Take me home, Artie."
156241,25,332,1231000,Chauffeur,Inspiration Point,"Well, it's one o'clock. If you want to keep me, I'm afraid it's gonna be forty-five dollars an hour."
156242,25,333,1237000,Homer Simpson,Inspiration Point,"Naw, that's okay. I'm broke. I'll walk home."
156243,25,334,1241000,Chauffeur,Inspiration Point,"Yeah, why spoil a perfect evening?"
156246,25,337,1255000,Artie Ziff,MARGE'S HOUSE,"Marge, I would appreciate it if you didn't tell anybody about my busy hands. Not so much for myself, but I am so respected it would damage the town to hear it. Good night."
156247,25,338,1267000,Marge Simpson,MARGE'S HOUSE,"Yeah, right."
156248,25,339,1269000,Mr. Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,"You know, when that Simpson boy showed up it took years off my life."
156249,25,340,1273000,Jacqueline Bouvier,MARGE'S HOUSE,Will you stop it? She went out with the good one.
156251,25,342,1281000,Homer Simpson,Road,Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!
156252,25,343,1285000,Homer Simpson,Road,"All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!"
156253,25,344,1290000,Marge Simpson,Road,Homer.
156254,25,345,1292000,Homer Simpson,Road,Marge?
156255,25,346,1293000,Marge Simpson,Road,"Yeah, you want a ride?"
156256,25,347,1294000,Homer Simpson,Road,Sure.
156258,25,348,1297000,Marge Simpson,Road,"You know Homer, when I got home, I realized who I should have gone to the prom with."
156259,25,349,1301000,Homer Simpson,Road,Who? Oh.
156260,25,350,1303000,Marge Simpson,Road,My prom date.
156261,25,351,1305000,Homer Simpson,Road,"Marge, pour vous."
156262,25,352,1310000,Marge Simpson,Road,Why so glum?
156263,25,353,1312000,Homer Simpson,Road,"I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go."
156265,25,355,1322000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And I never have.
