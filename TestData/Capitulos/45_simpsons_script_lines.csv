3890,45,40,236000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it's the law. Heh, heh."

3897,45,47,291000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"What's the matter, Moe?"
3898,45,48,293000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn't for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine."
3899,45,49,301000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, things are tough all over."
3900,45,50,303000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.
3901,45,51,309000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Could I get a beer?
3902,45,52,310000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, yeah, sure."

3905,45,55,315000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, I know, I got behind on my beer payments. The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the ""Love Tester""."
3906,45,56,324000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"You're too late, Homer. Barney sucked it dry. Cut his gums up pretty bad."
3908,45,58,331000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Take it easy, Homer. I learned how to make other drinks at Bartender's School."
3909,45,59,338000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Gin and... tonic? Do they mix?
3910,45,60,341000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself..."
3912,45,62,347000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,One night Marge's beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation.
3913,45,63,351000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,... and this is Patty trying to plug her leg razor into one of those ungodly Czechoslovakian outlets.
3915,45,64,358000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"As you can see, we never did get the hang of it."
3916,45,65,361000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Aye carumba!
3917,45,66,362000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink."
3918,45,67,367000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment?"
3919,45,68,370000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"If you're going for a beer, this is the last one."
3921,45,70,374000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
3922,45,71,378000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup.
3923,45,72,388000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It passed the first test: I didn't go blind.
3924,45,73,394000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"They say everyone can float in the Dead Sea, but Selma sank right to the bottom."
3925,45,74,404000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good."
3927,45,76,409000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Whoa, sounds like one hell of a drink. What do you call it?"
3928,45,77,413000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"A ""Flaming Homer""."
3929,45,78,414000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, why don't you make us up a couple of ""Flaming Homers""?"
3930,45,79,418000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?"
3931,45,80,420000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, let me check the lost and found."
3932,45,81,420000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"What do we got here, Bowie knife, troll doll, glass eye..."
3933,45,82,428000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Oh. Here we are.
3934,45,83,437000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,It's not without its charm.
3935,45,84,439000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Try lighting it on fire.
3936,45,85,447000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Whoa! Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited."
3937,45,86,453000,Larry,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, your Love Tester's busted. I want my nickel back."
3938,45,87,458000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, buddy. Have one on the house."
3939,45,88,462000,Larry,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, hey, this drink is delicious! And my phlegm feels looser. What do you call it?"
3940,45,89,468000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, it's called a ""Flaming..."
3941,45,90,469000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Moe! It's called a ""Flaming Moe""! That's right, a ""Flaming Moe"". My name is Moe, and I invented it. That's why it's called a Flaming Moe. What? What are you lookin' at, Homer? It's a Flaming Moe I'm Moe."
3942,45,91,488000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, what's this?"
3943,45,92,489000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,A sneeze guard.
3944,45,93,491000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Wow, it really works."
3946,45,94,494000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?"
3947,45,95,501000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Who can say? It's probably a combination of things.
3948,45,96,504000,Patron #1,Moe's Tavern,"Another pitcher of those amazing ""Flaming Moe's""."
3949,45,97,506000,Patron #2,Moe's Tavern,"Boy, I hate this joint, but I love that drink."
3950,45,98,509000,Collette,Moe's Tavern,"Barkeep, I couldn't help noticing your sign."
3951,45,99,512000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"The one that says, ""Bartenders Do It 'Til You Barf""?"
3952,45,100,515000,Collette,Moe's Tavern,"No, above that store-bought drollery."
3953,45,101,517000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh great! Why don't we fill out an application? I'll need your name, measurements and turn ons.."
3954,45,102,522000,Collette,Moe's Tavern,You really expect me to tell you my measurements?
3955,45,103,525000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"You could, but I find this way is much more accurate... and fun."
3956,45,104,529000,Collette,Moe's Tavern,what do you offer in the way of salary?
3957,45,105,531000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Minimum wage and tips. Of course there are fringe benefits.
3958,45,106,535000,Collette,Moe's Tavern,Such as?
3959,45,107,536000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,An unforgettable weekend at Club Moe.
3960,45,108,539000,Collette,Moe's Tavern,I prefer to take my vacations someplace hot.
3961,45,109,544000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"I like your moxie, kid. You're hired."
3962,45,110,547000,Collette,Moe's Tavern,You shan't regret this.
3963,45,111,549000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Methinks I shan't.

3968,45,116,561000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh yeah? Hey, what's Mr. McStagger really like?"
3969,45,117,563000,HARV,Moe's Tavern,"Actually, there is no Tipsy McStagger. He's just a composite of other successful logos."
3970,45,118,568000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, you tell him from me that he makes one great mozzarella stick."
3971,45,119,571000,HARV,Moe's Tavern,"Yes, fine, I will. Anyway, I've got a proposition for you."
3972,45,120,575000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Keep talkin'.
3973,45,121,576000,HARV,Moe's Tavern,"We feel your ""Flaming Moe"" is perfect for our restaurant chain. We want to buy the recipe."
3974,45,122,581000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"No dice. The ""Flaming Moe"" is not for sale. Do you know how much of my blood and sweat are in this drink?"
3795,45,123,587000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Figure of speech.
3914,45,124,589000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Sorry, Harv."
3945,45,125,593000,HARV,Moe's Tavern,I'll be back.
3975,45,126,597000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Good for you, Moe. Only an idiot would give away a million dollar idea like that."
3978,45,129,603000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"So the next time you use a gas chromatograph, remember to thank Mister A.J.P Martin."
3979,45,130,610000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Brilliant Martin, brilliant. Once again you've wrecked the grading curve. Oh, I pity the poor student who has to follow you. Bart Simpson? You're next."
3980,45,131,619000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"""The Inventor I Admire"", by Bart Simpson. The inventor I admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. He's my father, Homer Simpson, creator of... the ""Flaming Homer""!"
3981,45,132,635000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"The ""Flaming Homer""? You mean the ""Flaming Moe"". And your dad didn't invent it, ya wuss. Moe the bartender did."
3982,45,133,642000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, everyone knows that."
3983,45,134,643000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"It's not true! My father invented that drink, and if you'll allow me to demonstrate..."
3984,45,135,648000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, are those liquor bottles?"
3985,45,136,650000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I brought enough for everybody.
3986,45,137,651000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Take those to the teacher's lounge. You can have what's left at the end of the day.
3987,45,138,662000,Bernard,Springfield Elementary School,"Good evening, Krusty."

4000,45,151,709000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay.
4001,45,152,710000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, why don't you just go down to Moe's and talk to him? I bet he'd be willing to share some of his success with you."
