147124,566,46,400000,Young Man,Texxon Station,"No. No, no. No. We're a social media-based ride share service. We bring the ""fair"" back to ""fares."" Those aren't air quotes. My fingers start doing that after they're around the wheel all day."
147125,566,47,411000,Marge Simpson,Texxon Station,"Well, I drive all day and I don't get paid a thing. With the money you make, I could buy a fridge with... an icemaker."

But I'm still here, and I'd like to dedicate this song to the one great love of my life... the man who was my third and fifth husband. But you never know what the future holds."
147149,566,72,535000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Not a man in sight. We got the...Cheery Red Tomatoes...a bachelorette party...

147169,566,92,619000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,You guys cost me my chance with a woman of a certain age!
147171,566,94,627000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, come on, all is not lost. This coaster's fine."
147172,566,95,637000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,You are not my friends. To me you're just mouths drinkin' beers!
147173,566,96,642000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,You can't mean that!
147174,566,97,643000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,We don't look at you that way.

147226,566,148,810000,HEAD INSPECTOR,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,We are gonna search this place from top to bottom.
147227,566,149,812000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That's where all the problems are!
147228,566,150,814000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, I'll handle this. So, you're the head inspector?"
147229,566,151,817000,HEAD INSPECTOR,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yes I am.
147198,566,152,818000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"How come on your badge you got a mustache, but now you're not wearin' one, eh?"
147230,566,153,822000,HEAD INSPECTOR,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I was Freddie Mercury in a Queen cover band. But then I got demoted to Brian May.
147231,566,154,827000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, well, I'm thrilled for your musical career and everything, but, uh, we got no way of knowing that this is you."
147232,566,155,832000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I mean, we gotta be careful here. This is one them, uh, highly-sensitive joints."
147233,566,156,838000,HEAD INSPECTOR,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It'll take me weeks to grow that mustache back. Or years to get a new badge!
147234,566,157,843000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, well, that's your problem, ain't it?"
147235,566,158,845000,HEAD INSPECTOR,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You will see us again... in God knows when.
147236,566,159,852000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Young man, how do you fit such brilliance into such an ugly ethnic head?"
147237,566,160,857000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, if you own a bar, you either keep it clean or learn to deal with inspectors. And Moe don't clean."
147238,566,161,864000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Interesting attitude for a janitor. What say we make you the new supervisor of Sector 7-G?!
147239,566,162,869000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Me, a supervisor?! I feel like I overdosed and went to Heaven."
147241,566,164,879000,SIKH CAB DRIVER,Springfield Streets,Those smile cars are cutting into our business. We used to get über amounts of work giving people Lyfts.
147242,566,165,886000,Slava,Springfield Streets,I come to America to drive taxi. Now my cab sits empty like Sochi Marriot.
147243,566,166,891000,JIM IGNATOWSKI,Springfield Streets,"Well, boss... the main problem is Marge Simpson. She's prompt, courteous and a joy to ride with."
147244,566,167,899000,SIKH CAB DRIVER,Springfield Streets,How do you know so much?
147245,566,168,901000,JIM IGNATOWSKI,Springfield Streets,"Oh, she, uh, drives me to work every day. And unlike the rest of you cowards, she's not afraid to parallel park!"
147248,566,171,913000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Whoa, fellas, that is not acceptable. This is a nuclear plant."
147249,566,172,919000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Huh... no one was in there.
147250,566,173,921000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Look Moe, the least you could let me do is anything I want."
147251,566,174,924000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"All right, let me be honest with yous. After all the money this plant lost on that nitwit Elon Musk, they're lookin' for cutbacks. So I've been goin' over your record."
147254,566,176,934000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, the only reason you haven't been fired is because your file here was holdin' up a sofa that was missin' a leg."
147255,566,177,940000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, that's the logic. Where's the affection?"
147256,566,178,943000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well as supervisor, I can't fraternize with the... uh... what's the word... scum. Anyway, because I am your friend, you are safe. But you're gonna be reassigned."
147258,566,180,953000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Smithers, what profit a man if he gain the world and lose his soul. Seriously. I need an amount. In round dollars."
147259,566,181,962000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,Plant-watering guy.
147260,566,182,964000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Yes, yes, go ahead. And be careful with the Venus flytrap!"
147261,566,183,967000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,All right.
147262,566,184,970000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,They say you catch more flies with honey. I say with flytraps!
147263,566,185,974000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,What do I do now?
147264,566,186,976000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Just lean into it. It'll be over soon, one way or another."
147265,566,187,979000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Oh, all right."
147268,566,190,988000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey guys, you mind if I join you? They ran out of Beaujolais Cru in the executive dining room and I ain't drinkin' white with my coq au freakin' vin!"
147269,566,191,997000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I think I'd rather sit somewhere else.
147270,566,192,999000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yeah. I'm gonna take my lunch back to the core.
147271,566,193,1002000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Now they won't even have lunch with me.
147272,566,194,1004000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, you know people can kinda act like they're in grade school."
147273,566,195,1008000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, now you gotta throw your grade school education in my face?!"
147274,566,196,1011000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You know, Moe, you're a real jerk. I didn't mind so much when it came with beer."
147275,566,197,1016000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I don't need youse. I'm all the company I need.
147276,566,198,1023000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I just lost my appetite.
147278,566,200,1027000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, which can makes me look cooler? The Drizzler or Mr. Drip?"
