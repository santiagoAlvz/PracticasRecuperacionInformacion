37842,169,2,28000,TV Announcer,Springfield Penitentiary,"Live! From Springfield Penitentiary's fabulous Big Open Area in Cell Block ""D""! It's the Krusty the Clown Prison Special!"
37843,169,3,40000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Penitentiary,I SLUGGED SOME JERK IN TAHOE / THEY GAVE ME ONE TO THREE / MY HIGH-PRICED LAWYER SPRUNG ME ON A TECH-NI-CAL-I-TY / I'M JUST VISITING SPRINGFIELD PRISON / I GET TO SLEEP AT HOME TONIGHT --
37845,169,5,57000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Penitentiary,"Hey, hey, I kid! I kid 'cause I love. I tell ya, the best folk in the world are prison folk."
37847,169,7,66000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,"Man, those cons love Krusty. Inside every hardened criminal beats the heart of a ten-year-old boy."
37848,169,8,72000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,And vice versa.
37849,169,9,74000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,"Just remember, Bart, convicts aren't ""cool."" They're bad people."
37850,169,10,78000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,"Yeah, maybe so. But they get the job done."
37851,169,11,81000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Penitentiary,"Hey, now I know where my tax dollars are goin', huh?"
37853,169,13,87000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Penitentiary,"Hey hey, it's my old TV sidekick, Sideshow Bob! Why, I haven't seen you in years. Whattya been doing with yourself, Bob?"
37856,169,14,95000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,"Well, Krusty, as you may remember, after I tried to frame you for armed robbery, I tried to murder Selma Bouvier... Let's see, I rigged the mayoral elections, I tried to blow up Springfield with a nuclear device, and I tried to kill you..."
37858,169,16,110000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,"And, whenever I could find a spare moment, I've tried to murder Bart Simpson..."
37860,169,18,118000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,"He said ""tried""!"
37861,169,19,118000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,Someone should really go up there and talk to him.
37864,169,22,128000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,Ho-mer.
37865,169,23,129000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,"Oh, all those stairs..."
37867,169,25,133000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, you have nothing to worry about, honey."
37868,169,26,137000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Your mother's right, Bart. Sure, you're the one who ruined all of Sideshow Bob's criminal schemes --"
37869,169,27,143000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"We're very proud of you, by the way."
37870,169,28,145000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And sure, he's probably so insane with rage that he'd butcher you horribly if he could --"
37871,169,29,151000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But he's safely locked away!
37872,169,30,153000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,In a medium-security prison.
37873,169,31,155000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,For life!
37874,169,32,155000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Unless he gets out somehow.
37875,169,33,156000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Which is impossible!
37876,169,34,157000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Or so you'd think, except he's done it so many times before."
37877,169,35,161000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks for trying, guys, but Sideshow Bob wants me dead, and Sideshow Bob is an unstoppable killing machine."
37879,169,37,169000,Sideshow Bob,SPRINGFIELD PENITENTIARY CHAPEL,I once was lost but now am found...
37881,169,39,177000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,...Was blind but now I see!
37882,169,40,184000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Penitentiary,"Well, that was lovely, Robert. You other cons could benefit from his shining example."
37884,169,42,192000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,"Really, Reverend, your praise is going to get me beaten up."
37885,169,43,196000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Penitentiary,"Oh, I'm sorry, Bob. But your transformation is truly inspiring."
37765,169,44,200000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,"Yes. I'm a good, good man."
37886,169,45,204000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Penitentiary,"You know, it's hard to believe this model prisoner could be the same monstrous fiend who once ran for Mayor. It's a pleasure to have recommended you for the work release program."
37887,169,46,214000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,"Me? I'm touched, I really am. But you'll never find anyone willing to hire a five-time loser like me."
37888,169,47,222000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Penitentiary,I already have.
37889,169,48,228000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,Cecil?
37890,169,49,230000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,Is it really you?
37891,169,50,232000,Cecil Terwilliger,Springfield Penitentiary,"Hello, brother. I'm happy to see you."
37892,169,51,236000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,But it's been ten years! We haven't spoken since the... unpleasantness.
37893,169,52,241000,Cecil Terwilliger,Springfield Penitentiary,You mean Arthur Fiedler's wake?
37894,169,53,243000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,"No, no, no. I mean our falling out."
37895,169,54,245000,Cecil Terwilliger,Springfield Penitentiary,"Oh, that. That's ancient history. Let's make a fresh start. Come work for me."
37896,169,55,251000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,But this is wonderful!... You do know I used to have a... problem with trying to kill people?
37897,169,56,259000,Cecil Terwilliger,Springfield Penitentiary,"Goodness, I had no idea. For, you see, I have been on Mars for the last decade. In a cave. With my eyes shut and my fingers in my ears."
37898,169,57,267000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,"Touché, Cecil."
37899,169,58,269000,Cecil Terwilliger,Springfield Penitentiary,"I'm aware of your felonious past, but you are still my brother. And blood is thicker than bread and water."
37900,169,59,275000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,"You don't have to worry about me, brother. I'm all murdered out."
37901,169,60,279000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Penitentiary,Praise the Lord.
37903,169,62,295000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,How can you even think of releasing Sideshow Bob?
37904,169,63,298000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,He's just faking it to get out of jail! He's a maniac!
37905,169,64,301000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Penitentiary,"Bob is no maniac. He explained his reasons for trying to kill us all, and I assure you they were perfectly sane."
37907,169,66,311000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,"My friends, please! I make no secret of my past, but isn't our system of justice based on the idea that a man can change?"
37908,169,67,320000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Penitentiary,"Uh, have the boys check into that."
37909,169,68,322000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,"I know I don't deserve another chance. But this is America, and as an American, aren't I entitled to one?"
37910,169,69,329000,Man In Crowd,Springfield Penitentiary,Probably!
37854,169,70,330000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,Can't you find it in your hearts just to let me live and work in peace?
37911,169,72,346000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,"Don't you see what you've done? Sideshow Bob hasn't reformed! He's pure evil! Oh, if only you knew what he was thinking..."
37912,169,73,359000,Sideshow Bob's Brain,Springfield Penitentiary,I hope they still make that shampoo I like.
37914,169,75,372000,Cecil Terwilliger,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,Now make yourself at home. Perhaps a glass of Bordeaux? I have the '82 Château Latour and a rather indifferent Rausan-Ségla.
37915,169,76,379000,Sideshow Bob,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"I've been in prison, Cecil. I'll be happy just as long as it doesn't taste like orange drink fermented under a radiator."
37916,169,77,385000,Cecil Terwilliger,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,That would be the Latour then.
37918,169,79,388000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"And God bless Mom and Dad and Lisa and Maggie, and please, God, kill Sideshow Bob --"
37919,169,80,394000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, no!"
37920,169,81,396000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's him or me, O Lord!"
37921,169,82,398000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You can't ask God to kill someone!
37922,169,83,401000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah! You do your own dirty work!
37924,169,85,410000,Sideshow Bob,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"Well, I suppose I should ask you what you do if I'm to be working with you."
37925,169,86,413000,Cecil Terwilliger,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"For me, Bob. For me. I am Springfield's Chief Hydrological and Hydrodynamical Engineer."
37926,169,87,420000,Sideshow Bob,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,Hydrological and hydrodynamical? Talk about running the gamut.
37927,169,88,424000,Cecil Terwilliger,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"Snigger all you like, Bob--"
37928,169,89,425000,Sideshow Bob,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,Thank you. I believe I shall.
37929,169,90,427000,Cecil Terwilliger,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,...but you'll find one gets more respect as a humble civil servant than as a homicidal maniac. Or a clown's sidekick.
37930,169,91,433000,Sideshow Bob,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,Aha! I knew it! You're still angry that Krusty picked me instead of you!
37931,169,92,439000,Cecil Terwilliger,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,I can't imagine what you mean.
37932,169,93,440000,Sideshow Bob,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"Oh, come now! You wanted to be Krusty's sidekick since you were five! What about the buffoon lessons? The four years at Clown Kollege?"
37933,169,94,449000,Cecil Terwilliger,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,I'll thank you not to refer to Princeton that way.
37934,169,95,452000,Sideshow Bob,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"The point is, you obviously still blame me for what happened at your audition."
37937,169,96,462000,1986 Cecil,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"Thanks for driving me, Big Brother. These giant clown mitts are extremely hilarious, but they do make it difficult to shift gears."
37938,169,97,468000,1986 BOB,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"That's the title of Erma Bombeck's latest, isn't it?"
37939,169,98,470000,1986 Krusty,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,Number 73 -- you're next. Make with the laugh-laugh!
37940,169,99,477000,1986 Cecil,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"Hey, children, meet me -- Sideshow Cecil."
37941,169,100,482000,1986 Krusty,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,Next!
37942,169,101,483000,1986 Cecil,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"Uh, I have prepared a pie-in-the-face take?"
37943,169,102,487000,1986 Krusty,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"All right. Knock yourself out, kid. Hal?"
37944,169,103,493000,1986 Krusty,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"Free comedy tip, Slick: the pie gag's only funny when the sap's got dignity. Like that guy! Hey, Hal, pie job for Lord Autumnbottom there!"
37945,169,104,506000,1986 BOB,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"Oh, dear."
37947,169,106,512000,1986 Krusty,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"That guy's a genius! He's going to change the way we think about getting hit by pies! Chumley, you're hired!"
37948,169,107,522000,Cecil Terwilliger,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"When that pie hit your face, I saw my dreams explode in a burst of cream and crust. But I suppose I should thank you. After all, it led me to my true calling."
37949,169,108,531000,Sideshow Bob,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"Cecil, no civilization in history has ever considered ""Chief Hydrological Engineer"" a calling."
37951,169,110,539000,Sideshow Bob,Cecil's Brownstone Apartment,"Yes, yes, the Cappadocians, fine."
37953,169,112,544000,Cecil Terwilliger,SPRINGFIELD RIVER GORGE,There it is -- the future site of the Springfield Hydroelectric Dam.
37954,169,113,549000,Sideshow Bob,SPRINGFIELD RIVER GORGE,Just the thought of all that raw surging power makes me wonder why the hell I should care.
37955,169,114,553000,Cecil Terwilliger,SPRINGFIELD RIVER GORGE,Because you'll be supervising the construction crew.
37956,169,115,556000,Sideshow Bob,SPRINGFIELD RIVER GORGE,"Oh great. Whenever a woman passes by, I suppose it will be my job to lead the hooting. ""Oh, yeah. Shake it, madam. Capital knockers."""
37957,169,116,563000,Cecil Terwilliger,SPRINGFIELD RIVER GORGE,"Come on, Bob. This is your chance to show the people of Springfield you can hold down an honest job."
37958,169,117,570000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD RIVER GORGE,"He's planning something evil, I know it. It must have something to do with the town's water supply."
37959,169,118,575000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD RIVER GORGE,Maybe he's gonna pee in the river.
37960,169,119,577000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD RIVER GORGE,"Um... Nah, that's not his style."
37935,169,120,582000,Sideshow Bob,SPRINGFIELD RIVER GORGE,"Who is that? Why, it's Bart Simpson. Hellllooo, Bart!"
37961,169,121,589000,Sideshow Bob,SPRINGFIELD RIVER GORGE,He's just a little shy because I've tried to kill him so many times.
37962,169,122,592000,Cecil Terwilliger,SPRINGFIELD RIVER GORGE,Ahh.
37964,169,124,594000,Sideshow Bob,The Pimento Grove,"I really must thank you for this moment of tranquillity, Edna. You know, I haven't been on a date in six years."
37965,169,125,600000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,The Pimento Grove,"Oh, the pleasure's mine, Bob. It's so exciting to be dating a killer."
37966,169,126,604000,Sideshow Bob,The Pimento Grove,"To be fair, I never successfully killed anyone."
37967,169,127,608000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,The Pimento Grove,Oh? I see...
37968,169,128,612000,Sideshow Bob,The Pimento Grove,"I did once try to kill the world's greatest lover, but then I realized there are laws against suicide."
37971,169,131,623000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,The Pimento Grove,"Oh, you!"
37972,169,132,624000,Bart Simpson,The Pimento Grove,"Mrs. Krabappel, nooo! That's Sideshow Bob!"
37973,169,133,629000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,The Pimento Grove,"Well, that's the last time I announce my dinner plans in class."
37974,169,134,633000,Sideshow Bob,The Pimento Grove,That was Edna Krabappel. You only get one chance with Edna Krabappel. I hope you're happy.
37975,169,135,641000,Bart Simpson,The Pimento Grove,"I won't be happy until I find out what you're up to. Wherever you go and whatever you do, I'll be there watching and waiting."
37976,169,136,648000,Chief Wiggum,The Pimento Grove,"He says that, but I bet he gives up pretty quickly."
37979,169,139,655000,Cecil Terwilliger,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,"Hello, brother. All's well, I trust?"
37980,169,140,657000,Sideshow Bob,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,It most certainly is not. The workmen you've given me don't know their asses from the hole in the ground they accidentally blew yesterday.
37981,169,141,664000,Cecil Terwilliger,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,"Come now, you speak as if they were a gaggle of slack-jawed yokels."
37982,169,142,668000,Cletus Spuckler,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,"Mr. Terwillidjer, come quick! There's trouble down to the ce-ment mixers, Sir."
37984,169,144,673000,Cletus Spuckler,SPRINGFIELD DAM SITE,"See, Cousin Merl and me was playin' fetch with Geech, that's our ol' smellhound, and..."
37985,169,145,680000,Cousin Merl,SPRINGFIELD DAM SITE,"Geech gone to heaven, Mr. Terwillidjer."
37986,169,146,683000,Sideshow Bob,SPRINGFIELD DAM SITE,"Oh, Cousin Merl, really!"
37987,169,147,686000,Cecil Terwilliger,SPRINGFIELD DAM SITE,"Temper, temper. You know Cousin Merl ain't been quite right lately."
37989,169,148,690000,Sideshow Bob,SPRINGFIELD DAM SITE,"I'm telling you, Cecil, I can't take much more of this! Rustic workmen who've turned the SaniJohn into a smokehouse..."
37990,169,149,696000,Sideshow Bob,SPRINGFIELD DAM SITE,Coveralls that don't quite cover all...
37991,169,150,700000,Sideshow Bob,SPRINGFIELD DAM SITE,And a psychotic little boy who will not stop hounding me. This little boy right here!
37992,169,151,705000,Sideshow Bob,SPRINGFIELD DAM SITE,Sometimes I wish this dam would burst and bury this cursed town.
37994,169,153,714000,Lisa Simpson,Terwilliger Apartment,"Hey, you said we were going to Dairy Queen."
37995,169,154,717000,Bart Simpson,Terwilliger Apartment,I lied. Now help me rummage through Bob's trash for clues. Then I promise we'll go to the water slide.
37997,169,156,728000,Sideshow Bob,Terwilliger Apartment,"You again! Well, that's it. I'm going to do what I should have done a long time ago."
37999,169,158,739000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Madam, your children are no more!... than a pair of ill-bred troublemakers."
38000,169,159,747000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa too?
38001,169,160,748000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Especially Lisa. But especially Bart. If he crosses me one more time, just once more... well, I can't be held responsible for my actions."
38002,169,161,759000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I hope Bob fed you, 'cause I ate your dinners."
38003,169,162,761000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know it's hard to accept, Bart, but face it: Sideshow Bob has changed."
38004,169,163,767000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, he hasn't. He's more the same than ever. And I know where the evidence is. There's only one place it could possibly be."
38005,169,164,774000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Bob's trailer at the construction site?
38006,169,165,776000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That's even better. Let's go there.
38007,169,166,778000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What were you thinking?
38008,169,167,779000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The Haunted Mine.
38011,169,170,788000,Bart Simpson,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,Blueprints... concrete invoices... construction schedule...
38012,169,171,792000,Lisa Simpson,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,"If I didn't know better, I'd swear Bob was building a dam."
38013,169,172,795000,Bart Simpson,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,"Oh, yeah? Then explain this!"
38014,169,173,800000,Lisa Simpson,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,"Bart, there must be millions of dollars there!"
38015,169,174,804000,Bart Simpson,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,What is Sideshow Bob doing with --
38019,169,177,815000,Sideshow Bob,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,Who left the lights on?!! Who's in here? Cletus? Cousin Merl? Big Hungry Joe?
38020,169,178,823000,Bart Simpson,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,I hink he nay have spotted us.
38021,169,179,827000,Lisa Simpson,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,Run!
38022,169,180,828000,Sideshow Bob,CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,You two!
38024,169,182,832000,Sideshow Bob,DAM SITE,Be careful! There's hydroelectricity in there!
38026,169,184,839000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,Will you children stop tormenting me? I've done nothing wrong.
38027,169,185,855000,Bart Simpson,DAM,"Give it up, Bob. We found the money."
38028,169,186,859000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,Where did that come from? I've never seen that money before in my life.
38029,169,187,862000,Lisa Simpson,DAM,Then you must have had your eyes closed when you embezzled it.
38030,169,188,866000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,"I told you, I'm not a criminal anymore. You want to know what I've been up to? Here's a clue for you, Jack: One hundred thousand tons of reinforced concrete."
38031,169,189,882000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,"My God, it's completely hollow! What happened to all the concrete?"
38032,169,190,886000,Lisa Simpson,DAM,You cut back on building materials and kept all the money for yourself! That's what happened.
38033,169,191,891000,Bart Simpson,DAM,"Get 'im, Lis!"
38034,169,192,893000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,But I wasn't in charge of the money. Cecil was. Now let's stop bickering and get out of here. This dam could collapse at any minute.
38035,169,193,901000,Cecil Terwilliger,DAM,"One minute past sunrise, to be precise."
38036,169,194,905000,Cecil Terwilliger,DAM,"Once I blow up the dam, there'll be no evidence of missing concrete, and I walk away with fifteen million."
38037,169,195,912000,Lisa Simpson,DAM,But everyone will know you did this!
38038,169,196,914000,Cecil Terwilliger,DAM,"Perhaps. Or perhaps they'll blame the master criminal. You know, the one who's been working at the dam and has a grudge against Springfield."
38039,169,197,922000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,"Now I know Cousin Merl has had his troubles with the Revenuers, but he's hardly a master crim -- oh, you're referring to me."
38040,169,198,928000,Cecil Terwilliger,DAM,"Yes, I'm framing you and I'm doing a really excellent job, too."
38041,169,199,932000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,"Wait a minute. This is all because I got to be Krusty's sidekick instead of you, isn't it?"
38042,169,200,937000,Cecil Terwilliger,DAM,"Off the record -- yes. But officially, I did it for the money. Speaking of which... hand it over."
38043,169,201,949000,Cecil Terwilliger,DAM,Ta!
38044,169,202,952000,Cecil Terwilliger,DAM,I forgot to mention -- I'm planning to blow up the dam with you inside.
37988,169,203,955000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,"Well, obviously."
38045,169,204,961000,Lisa Simpson,DAM,"It's hopeless. Utterly, utterly hopeless."
38046,169,205,964000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,"Oh, I see. When it's one of my schemes, you can't foil it fast enough. But when Cecil tries to kill you, it's ""Hopeless, utterly utterly hopeless."" Well, if you kids aren't going to foil him, I'll have to do it myself."
38047,169,206,982000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,"Come on, quickly now!"
38048,169,207,985000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,"Bart, for once I'm not trying to kill you. I know it's an awkward situation, and I don't like it any more than you do. But you've got to trust me."
38049,169,208,995000,Bart Simpson,DAM,"Ah, what the hell."
38055,169,214,1024000,Bart Simpson,DAM,Let's go again! Let's go again!
38056,169,215,1026000,Lisa Simpson,DAM,No!
38057,169,216,1027000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,"Come on, children! Let's go thwart my brother!"
38059,169,218,1033000,Cecil Terwilliger,TOP OF DAM,"I'M ON THE / TOP OF THE WORLD, LOOKING / DOWN ON CREATION, AND THE / ONLY EXPLANATION I CAN FIND... BOO-BOO-BOO..."
38061,169,220,1047000,Lisa Simpson,DAM,"Um, do you know what you're doing?"
38062,169,221,1050000,Sideshow Bob,DAM,"Lisa, you don't spend ten years as a homicidal maniac without learning a few things about dynamite."
38064,169,223,1056000,Cecil Terwilliger,DAM OVERLOOK,"Plunger? Check. Hardhat? Check. Fifteen million dollars and a gun? Check-mate. Goodbye, Bob."
38065,169,224,1065000,Bart Simpson,DAM OVERLOOK,Nooo!
38066,169,225,1067000,Bart Simpson,DAM OVERLOOK,Guess who!
38067,169,226,1069000,Cecil Terwilliger,DAM OVERLOOK,Maris?!
38068,169,227,1078000,Cecil Terwilliger,DAM OVERLOOK,Shoot!
38070,169,229,1082000,Lisa Simpson,CENTER OF DAM,"Bob, look!"
38072,169,231,1088000,Cecil Terwilliger,OBSERVATION POST,"At last, I'm going to do what Bob never could -- kill Bart Simpson!"
38073,169,232,1093000,Bart Simpson,OBSERVATION POST,By throwing me off a dam? Isn't that a little crude for a genius like you?
38074,169,233,1098000,Cecil Terwilliger,OBSERVATION POST,"Ooh, I suppose it is."
38075,169,234,1100000,Cecil Terwilliger,OBSERVATION POST,"Heh. If anyone asks, I'll lie."
38078,169,237,1114000,Lisa Simpson,CENTER OF DAM,Bart!
38080,169,239,1122000,Sideshow Bob,CENTER OF DAM,Cecil!
38081,169,240,1123000,Cecil Terwilliger,CENTER OF DAM,And now to kill you. There may be a slight ringing in your ears. Fortunately you'll be nowhere near them.
38082,169,241,1130000,Bart Simpson,CENTER OF DAM,I guess this is it. Thanks anyway.
38083,169,242,1133000,Sideshow Bob,CENTER OF DAM,"You know, I could snip the wires. We'd fall to our deaths, but we'd save the entire town. Bart, how would you like to do something incredibly noble?"
38084,169,243,1142000,Bart Simpson,CENTER OF DAM,Do we have to?
38085,169,244,1144000,Sideshow Bob,CENTER OF DAM,Yes.
38088,169,247,1164000,Sideshow Bob,CENTER OF DAM,"You -- you saved my life, Bart."
38089,169,248,1167000,Bart Simpson,CENTER OF DAM,"Yeah... I guess this means you can't ever try to kill me again, huh?"
38090,169,249,1171000,Sideshow Bob,CENTER OF DAM,"Oh, I don't know about that. Joking! Joking!"
38092,169,251,1183000,Sideshow Bob,DAM OVERLOOK,"You've brought shame to this family, Cecil. Oh, I don't relish having to write the Christmas letter this year."
38093,169,252,1190000,Cecil Terwilliger,DAM OVERLOOK,"Nor I to read it. You know, Bob, all this time I thought you were a bungler, but destroying a city is far tougher than I thought."
38094,169,253,1200000,Lou,DAM OVERLOOK,"Here's your man, Chief."
38095,169,254,1201000,Chief Wiggum,DAM OVERLOOK,Cecil? I think not. This looks like the work of crazy old Sideshow Bob.
38096,169,255,1207000,Lisa Simpson,DAM OVERLOOK,"No, Chief, Bob's innocent! It's the truth!"
38097,169,256,1210000,Chief Wiggum,DAM OVERLOOK,"The truth, huh? That sounds like the testimony of crazy old Lisa Simpson."
38098,169,257,1215000,Lou,DAM OVERLOOK,"Uh, Cecil just voluntarily confessed, Chief."
38099,169,258,1217000,Chief Wiggum,DAM OVERLOOK,"That's some good work, Lou. You'll make sergeant for this."
38100,169,259,1220000,Lou,DAM OVERLOOK,"Uh, I already am a sergeant, Chief."
38101,169,260,1222000,Chief Wiggum,DAM OVERLOOK,Perhaps you are. But I say Bob goes back to jail.
38102,169,261,1225000,Sideshow Bob,DAM OVERLOOK,"But surely -- I mean, I caught Cecil..."
38103,169,262,1229000,Chief Wiggum,DAM OVERLOOK,Maybe so. But Lou here says you were resisting arrest.
38104,169,263,1232000,Lou,DAM OVERLOOK,"No I didn't, Chief."
38105,169,264,1234000,Chief Wiggum,DAM OVERLOOK,"Quiet, Lou. Or I will bust you down to sergeant so fast it'll make your head spin."
38106,169,265,1240000,Bart Simpson,DAM OVERLOOK,"Heh, funny, isn't it, Lis? Those people down there have no idea how close they came to complete destruction."
38108,169,267,1254000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I'm going to look for the kids!"
38110,169,269,1265000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,I think I wet my bed.
38111,169,270,1269000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,But you can't do this! I saved the children's lives! I'm a hero!
38112,169,271,1276000,Cecil Terwilliger,Simpson Home,Tell them they'll live to regret this.
38113,169,272,1278000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"You'll live to regret this! Oh, thanks a lot. Now I look crazy."
38114,169,273,1285000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"There they go. Two criminal geniuses, locked away together.... Who knows what diabolical scheme they might concoct?"
38116,169,275,1301000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,But I'm older! I get the top bunk!
38117,169,276,1305000,Cecil Terwilliger,Springfield Prison,"Oh, poppycock! I called it at the arraignment!"
38118,169,277,1313000,Cecil Terwilliger,Springfield Prison,So... when do they bring us the menus?
