101385,391,3,42000,11-Year-Old Moe,PLAYGROUND,My Dad was a circus freak but my Mom don't remember which one. I like to think it was a little bit of all of them.

101424,391,41,213000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Police Station,"Oh yeah, oh that's the stuff. Thanks for giving me an eight-thirty appointment. You are a life saver."
101425,391,42,219000,32-Year-Old Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Y'know uh... if I was Chief, I could give you eight-thirty every day."

101433,391,50,243000,Lou,Springfield Police Station,Go ahead.

101436,391,53,249000,8-Year-Old Homer,PLAYGROUND,"When I grow up, I'll have a giant mansion, my own pinball machine with infinity quarters, eight pairs of peanut butter and jelly pajamas. How many wishes do I have left?"

101467,391,83,336000,Declan Desmond,Funeral Home,But Homer had found a peanut of hope in his Cracker Jack box of despair...
101469,391,85,343000,Marge Simpson,Homer and Marge's First Apartment,Homer is so amazing! He can chug a beer and pitch woo at the same time.

101474,391,89,359000,24-Year-Old Homer,Homer and Marge's First Apartment,Kids? No way! You'll never see a couple of rug-rats tying me down!
101476,391,91,363000,32-Year-Old Homer,Simpson Home,You'd better not put this shot after the one where I said I won't have kids. That would be a devastating edit!
101477,391,92,369000,Declan Desmond,Simpson Home,"Homer, your life is nothing to be ashamed of -- you've got a loving family and a steady job at a nuclear power plant. You're not English Breakfast, but you're not Lapsang Souchong either."

101484,391,99,409000,Bart Simpson,LAKESIDE MANSION,Wheee! /
101485,391,100,412000,Homer Simpson,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Now that I'm super-wealthy, I can buy them whatever their hearts desire. That's why rich kids turn out so well."

101493,391,108,432000,Marge Simpson,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Oh yes. I'm so proud, I feel my chest might burst. Can you edit that? I don't wanna say ""chest"" in a movie."
101494,391,109,442000,Declan Desmond,LAKESIDE MANSION,You said it and it stays!
101495,391,110,444000,Declan Desmond,LAKESIDE MANSION,But I must know: how did Homer come so far in eight short years?
101497,391,112,450000,32-Year-Old Homer,CAF√â DE MEXICO,This pays a lot better than you think.
101498,391,113,460000,Band Leader,CAF√â DE MEXICO,Nosotros lo pagamos en cales.

101504,391,119,475000,Homer Simpson,LAKESIDE MANSION,I got the idea from the regular pen.
101505,391,120,479000,Declan Desmond,LAKESIDE MANSION,Can I use it on fish and chips?
101506,391,121,481000,Homer Simpson,LAKESIDE MANSION,"I don't know. You can put horseradish on your dead mother for all I care. The point is, I'm rich, rich, rich! Just look -- my dog has his own Jacuzzi!"

101516,391,131,542000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PLAYGROUND,"Yes, yes. All right. All of that means nothing, sir! I have spent my whole life in the lab and never talked to a girl. That's why I built this time machine!"
101517,391,132,551000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PLAYGROUND,I give you the chrono-trike! Now I'll go back in time to tell myself to choose a different career. One where I'll meet a female woman of the girl-u-lar variety.

101551,391,166,683000,24-Year-Old Marge,Dept. Store,Coming right up. Mind if I turn on a little music?

101557,391,172,702000,24-Year-Old Marge,Homer and Marge's Apartment,"I need a full-time job to support Homer, so he has time to work on his rock music, his erotic etchings, his Play-Doh Theater..."
101559,391,174,714000,Declan Desmond,LAKESIDE MANSION,And yet look how things turned out! This overnight affluence must have come as a tremendous shock.
101560,391,175,721000,Marge Simpson,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Oh, yes sir... as shocks go, this one's a real zaparoo."
101561,391,176,726000,Declan Desmond,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Listen, something's been piquing my curiosity. Why is your medicine cabinet full of old man ointments?"
101562,391,177,734000,Marge Simpson,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Oh... well, yeah, the ointments, um..."
101563,391,178,735000,C. Montgomery Burns,LAKESIDE MANSION,What are you people doing in my summer home?

101566,391,181,752000,Homer Simpson,LAKESIDE MANSION,That's the pool chemicals talking.
101567,391,182,759000,Declan Desmond,LAKESIDE MANSION,Homer J. Simpson! Your fabulous millionaire lifestyle is all a lie!
101568,391,183,765000,Lisa Simpson,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Oh Fah-ther, my pony Buttercup can jump ever so high-- Hoo-boy, it's Mr. Burns."
101569,391,184,771000,Homer Simpson,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Please, Mr. Burns, pretend you work for me. You can have the boy, just don't beat him. You can beat him, just don't leave marks."
101570,391,185,778000,C. Montgomery Burns,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Shut up, you waste of skin and fat! You've desecrated my every possession!"
101572,391,187,791000,Waylon Smithers,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Oh, thank you, sir! For three days I've had nothing to read but clock-setting instructions: ""Using the suspension spring above the pendulum leader, hang the pendulum on the pendulum guide..."""
101573,391,188,792000,Marge Simpson,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Mr. Burns, we're so sorry. The plan was just to use your back yard, and the next thing we know, Mr. Smithers is tied up in a grandfather clock."
101574,391,189,809000,Waylon Smithers,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Please get me out of here! It's eleven fifty-nine, fifty-nine!"
101576,391,191,827000,C. Montgomery Burns,LAKESIDE MANSION,I've heard enough! Release the hounds!

101578,391,193,834000,C. Montgomery Burns,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Well, bring them over in the Durango."
101579,391,194,838000,Waylon Smithers,LAKESIDE MANSION,Shadow and Winston have been fighting a lot.
101580,391,195,840000,C. Montgomery Burns,LAKESIDE MANSION,Put Winston in the front.
101581,391,196,842000,Waylon Smithers,LAKESIDE MANSION,Winston doesn't like the front.
101582,391,197,844000,C. Montgomery Burns,LAKESIDE MANSION,Just do it! Do it! Do it now!
101583,391,198,849000,C. Montgomery Burns,LAKESIDE MANSION,...and that's how I got the vending machine contract for the Kremlin.
101585,391,200,857000,Waylon Smithers,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Sorry, sir... traffic was a nightmare. Then I got caught in some kind of garlic festival..."
101265,391,201,862000,C. Montgomery Burns,LAKESIDE MANSION,Release the hounds!
101411,391,202,866000,Homer Simpson,LAKESIDE MANSION,"Stop it, Winston!"
101586,391,204,867000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Street,"In the wake of this deception, I had two questions for Homer: ""Why lie?"" and ""Lies... why?!"" But he seemed less than eager to meet."
101587,391,205,876000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Street,"Homer, I brought a squeaky!"
101589,391,207,903000,Declan Desmond,Simpson Home,"I realized that if this bunny was going to be boiled, I would have to turn up the heat."
101590,391,208,908000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,There you are! I'm ready for my segment.
101591,391,209,912000,Declan Desmond,Simpson Home,Lenny... always exciting to hear from you. Did you ever try that new shampoo?
101592,391,210,919000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"Nope, never did."
101593,391,211,923000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,Wanna watch me pay my cable bill? I got checks with butterflies on 'em.
101594,391,212,929000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,I am interesting.
101595,391,213,930000,Declan Desmond,Simpson Home,No you're not.
101596,391,214,932000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What do you want?
101597,391,215,934000,Declan Desmond,Simpson Home,"Marge, can you just let me in for a minute?"
101598,391,216,936000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We let you in thirty-two years ago and it's brought us nothing but pain.
101599,391,217,940000,Declan Desmond,Simpson Home,"Well, if you want, I can cut you out of the film."
101600,391,218,943000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no, no, no, no! Let's not get crazy."
101601,391,219,945000,Declan Desmond,Simpson Home,Then I just want to know why your husband did what he did.
101602,391,220,949000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll tell you why.
101603,391,221,951000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's been another eight years, and what do I have? Same job, same house, same dirty joke book..."
101605,391,223,964000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I just thought for once I could be the cool guy in your movie. But all I am is the guy who makes everyone else look good.
101606,391,224,971000,Declan Desmond,Simpson Home,Strong words from a dumpy man. And cut.
101607,391,225,975000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait just a cotton-swabbing minute! A good man went to a lot of trouble just to impress you! And I went along with it, because I love him to pieces! And you made him look like a fool. Well, I don't want you anywhere near my house!"
101608,391,226,989000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Now you can cut!
101610,391,228,993000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"What's the matter, Declan? Did a cop give ya a ticket for talkin' like a fruit?"
101611,391,229,996000,Declan Desmond,Moe's Tavern,It's the oddest thing: I actually feel affection for these knuckle-dragging sub-monkeys. I feel sorry for Homer Simpson.
101614,391,230,1004000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Whaddaya been sippin' cuckoo juice? Homer's got it made. He's married to one hell of a woman. All I've got is this porn channel I'm too cheap to de-scramble.
101615,391,231,1012000,Declan Desmond,Moe's Tavern,That's an ad for shoe inserts.
101616,391,232,1015000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,What the?! I've been writin' creepy letters to that?!
101617,391,233,1018000,Declan Desmond,Moe's Tavern,But what you said about Homer it's... it's given me a brilliant idea!
101618,391,234,1021000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,An action movie where I play the Pope who kills the President?
101619,391,235,1024000,Declan Desmond,Moe's Tavern,"No, that's a terrible idea."
101620,391,236,1026000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, I know, it is stupid. I think it could work, though. I even got a title: ""Pontiff No Return"". I came up with it, but I don't really get it."
101622,391,238,1033000,Declan Desmond,EDITING ROOM,"The next day, I invited Homer to my editing bay."
101624,391,240,1041000,Climber #1,Himalayas,"Oh my God, the view!"
101625,391,241,1043000,Climber #2,Himalayas,This makes it all worth it!
101626,391,242,1046000,Blind Climber,Himalayas,It's not so much fun when you're blind.
101627,391,243,1048000,Climber #2,Himalayas,At least you made it up the mountain.
101628,391,244,1050000,Blind Climber,Himalayas,No thanks to you two.
101630,391,246,1052000,Homer Simpson,EDITING ROOM,"All right, you lured me to your bay. Now what sick game are you playing?"
101631,391,247,1058000,Declan Desmond,EDITING ROOM,I have some footage to show you.
101632,391,248,1060000,Homer Simpson,EDITING ROOM,"Oh, spirit. Are you gonna show me my future? My snow-flecked grave, mourned by no man? Well, it's not too late for me to change!"
101633,391,249,1067000,Homer Simpson,EDITING ROOM,"You there, boy! Buy me a Christmas goose! The biggest one in the shop!"
101634,391,250,1072000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,EDITING ROOM,And then what?
101635,391,251,1073000,Declan Desmond,EDITING ROOM,"Homer, come over here and take a look at this. I've gone over a hundred thousand hours of Springfield footage -- twice -- and put together something you must see."
101636,391,252,1085000,Lenny Leonard,EDITING ROOM,If I could trade lives with anybody I'd pick Homer.
101637,391,253,1088000,Moe Szyslak,EDITING ROOM,"Have you been to Homer's house?! It's got a back yard, a front yard... the place is like yard city!"
101638,391,254,1093000,Nelson Muntz,EDITING ROOM,I love his laugh...
101639,391,255,1095000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,EDITING ROOM,He picked the perfect time to lock in his mortgage!
101640,391,256,1097000,Ned Flanders,EDITING ROOM,"He's the kindest, sweetest most generous man ever to drive through my living room."
101612,391,257,1102000,Homer Simpson,EDITING ROOM,I'll pay for most of this!
101642,391,258,1105000,Ralph Wiggum,EDITING ROOM,"He may not be perfect, but he's my Dad."
101643,391,259,1108000,Krusty the Clown,EDITING ROOM,"Homer gave me a kidney. It wasn't his, I didn't need it, and it came postage due, but still a lovely gesture."
101644,391,260,1117000,2-Year-Old Bart,EDITING ROOM,I like when Daddy's out of work 'cause he can spend more time with me.
101645,391,261,1124000,Lisa Simpson,EDITING ROOM,"At bedtime, he tucks me in tighter than anyone else could. And you know what? No monsters have gotten me yet."
101646,391,262,1132000,Homer Simpson,EDITING ROOM,Wow. I have a pretty good life after all.
101647,391,263,1136000,Marge Simpson,EDITING ROOM,Homer! Don't kill the foreign man!
101648,391,264,1138000,Homer Simpson,EDITING ROOM,"Relax, Marge. I wasn't gonna kill him."
101649,391,265,1145000,Homer Simpson,EDITING ROOM,"All those years I was dreaming of other things, I was actually doing what I really wanted... hanging out with my family, drinking with my friends, making friends with my family, and hanging with my drinking!"
101650,391,266,1157000,Homer Simpson,EDITING ROOM,"Marge, you're my real dream come true. And I get to live you every day."
101651,391,267,1163000,Marge Simpson,EDITING ROOM,"Oh, Homie! You make each eight-year interval better than the last!"
