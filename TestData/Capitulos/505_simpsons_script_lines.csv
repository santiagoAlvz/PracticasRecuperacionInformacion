131026,505,13,0,Announcer,CRUISE SHIP,"Royalty Cruises -- one week away from the everyday! Visuals of commercial, if anything, underplays the thrill of actual cruise experience."
131027,505,14,0,Bart Simpson,CRUISE SHIP,"Want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want!"
131028,505,15,0,Bart Simpson,CRUISE SHIP,WANT!

131031,505,18,0,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, sweetie. Maybe we could afford a vacation if some big shot didn't pick up the tab for his buddies at ""Mr. Steak."""
131032,505,19,0,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Again with ""Mr. Steak!"" Do you know why I go to Mr. Steak? Because at Mr. Steak they don't get mad at me for spending a lot of money at Mr. Steak!"

131036,505,23,0,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay... maybe I can pay for the cruise. Let's see how much it costs for a cabin on a low deck, no porthole, group Z lifeboat access... It's still a ton of money."
131038,505,24,0,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Face it, we're just kids. We can't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices. All we have in the world are the things our parents give us."
131039,505,25,0,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! There's a really mean squirrel in the back yard. I need you to dare me to fight him!
131040,505,26,0,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart's been raptured! And his crap's been craptured!

131053,505,39,0,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No. We saw how much this cruise means to you, so we all sold something special. And we made just enough for an economy cabin!"
131054,505,40,0,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I sold a couple of my rare jazz records. After a while they all start to sound the same. Still love the genre, of course. Not even close to getting sick of it."

131058,505,44,0,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"And Dad donated something, too."
131059,505,45,0,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What happened to my mini-pool table? I was training to be a mini-pool hustler.
131060,505,46,0,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We sold it to pay for a family cruise!
131061,505,47,0,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I never even got to realize this jacket was too small.
131062,505,48,0,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's weird to hear myself saying this, but... I love you guys. This is gonna be the best vacation ever!"
131064,505,49,0,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, for you kids maybe. For dads, a family vacation is a twenty-four-hour-a-day babysitting job! ""Are you wearing enough sun block?"" ""Is that splashing or drowning?"""
131065,505,50,0,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why does every sand castle require my participation?
131066,505,51,0,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Then a kid disappears and it's total panic until you find him at the swim-up bar...
131068,505,53,0,Homer Simpson,Highway,...eating a thirty-dollar cheeseburger! Which he drops in the water!
131070,505,55,0,Homer Simpson,PORT,And here's the worst part: I never get any time alone with my wife because we're all sleeping in the same room!
