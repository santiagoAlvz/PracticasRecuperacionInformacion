67020,267,2,86000,Bart Simpson,CHURCH YARD,"Ice cream at church? I'm intrigued, yet suspicious."
67021,267,3,89000,Lisa Simpson,CHURCH YARD,"Wow, look at all these flavors: Blessed Virgin Berry... Command-Mint... Biblegum..."
67022,267,4,96000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,CHURCH YARD,"Or, if you prefer, we also have Unitarian ice cream."
67023,267,5,99000,Lisa Simpson,CHURCH YARD,There's nothing here.

67028,267,10,119000,Professor Jonathan Frink,CHURCH YARD,"Mmm, hi, mm... I've created the first intra-bovine ice cream maker. It makes use of all four stomachs, the first being filled with rock salt, then sugar, cream and of course, freon, so cold it burns me."
67029,267,11,134000,Cletus Spuckler,CHURCH YARD,I'll have the darkety kind.
67030,267,12,137000,Professor Jonathan Frink,CHURCH YARD,"Ah, one chocolate, Mootilda!"
67031,267,13,144000,Marge Simpson,CHURCH YARD,Could I have a swirl of chocolate and vanilla?
66999,267,15,149000,Professor Jonathan Frink,CHURCH YARD,"Oh, nonsense. You can do it."
67033,267,16,151000,Professor Jonathan Frink,CHURCH YARD,Ivan Reitman!

67038,267,21,162000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,MEDICAL TENT,Hold still. You're gonna feel a slight chocolatey sensation.
67041,267,24,172000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,All right. Let's welcome this evening's entertainment. They call her the Christian Madonna... Rachel Jordan.
67042,267,25,183000,Rachel Jordan,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"JESUS LOVES ME, THIS I'M SURE / I'M A GROUPIE ON HIS TOUR / I FOLLOW HIM FROM GIG TO GIG / I KNOW SOMEDAY WE'LL MAKE IT BIG."
67043,267,26,189000,Marge Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Rachel Jordan? Isn't that the woman you had a crush on, Ned?"
67044,267,27,192000,Ned Flanders,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"I didn't have a ""crush"" on her."
67045,267,28,196000,Lisa Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Are you blushing, Mr. Flanders?"
67046,267,29,198000,Ned Flanders,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"No, I'm not!"
67047,267,30,199000,Homer Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,Leave Ned alone.
67048,267,31,201000,Ned Flanders,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Thank you, Homer."
67049,267,32,202000,Homer Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,He can't admit he likes her till he's sure she likes him back. And there's only one way to find out.
67050,267,33,207000,Homer Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,Does -- Rachel -- like -- Ned?
67051,267,34,210000,Ned Flanders,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,It says I have cooties.
67052,267,35,213000,Homer Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Flanders has cooties, Flanders has cooties."
67053,267,36,220000,Lisa Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,That was great. I can't believe she found a rhyme for Hezekiah.
67054,267,37,224000,Homer Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Hey, she's coming this way!"
67056,267,39,227000,Lisa Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,I thought you didn't like her.
67057,267,40,233000,Rachel Jordan,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,Ned Flanders? Now where have you been hi-diddily hiding?
67058,267,41,237000,Ned Flanders,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Uh, uh, huh, oh, hey, Rachel. W-Well what do you know? We both like plain vanilla with nothing on it."
67059,267,42,243000,Rachel Jordan,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Actually, all the toppings were gone."
67060,267,43,247000,Milhouse Van Houten,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,Ants are crawling in my mouth and I don't care.
67061,267,44,252000,Ned Flanders,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"So, uh, uh, where's your band?"
67062,267,45,254000,Rachel Jordan,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"They switched from Christian music to regular pop. All you do is change ""Jesus"" to ""baby."""
67063,267,46,256000,Ned Flanders,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Oh, how horrible!"
67065,267,47,260000,Rachel Jordan,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Eh, they'll all go to hell. Say how's your life going?"
67066,267,48,264000,Homer Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Ooh, she wants to know how your life is going."
67067,267,49,267000,Ned Flanders,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Well, my wife's passing was rough, but I think I'm finally ready to move on."
67068,267,50,271000,Rachel Jordan,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,That's great. Maybe we could have coffee sometime.
67069,267,51,275000,Homer Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Ohh, she wants to have coffee sometime."
67070,267,52,278000,Ned Flanders,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"I can hear her, Homer."
67071,267,53,279000,Homer Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"He can hear you, Rachel."
67072,267,54,282000,Ned Flanders,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"I'd love to get together, but tomorrow I've got lifeguard duty at the baptismal pool."
67073,267,55,287000,Rachel Jordan,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Okay, well maybe another time. You know, I better go check into my hotel."
67074,267,56,290000,Homer Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,Hotel? Why don't you just stay at Ned's place?
67075,267,57,293000,Ned Flanders,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,My place? What would the neighbors think?
67076,267,58,295000,Lisa Simpson,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"We're the neighbors, and we don't think."
67077,267,59,297000,Rachel Jordan,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Ned, I understand if you feel uncomfortable. You're still getting over your wife."
67078,267,60,301000,Ned Flanders,ICE CREAM SOCIAL,"Now wait just a Maude-gone minute, here. I'm through living in the past, and you can see for yourself."
67080,267,62,310000,Rachel Jordan,Flanders Home,"Well, you've certainly got a theme going."
67081,267,63,313000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"All right, I'll take the couch and you can have my room."
67082,267,64,316000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh, ah, c-c-could you sleep on my side? I-I'm trying to preserve Maude's indentation."
67083,267,65,322000,Rachel Jordan,Flanders Home,Sorry.
67084,267,66,323000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Ohh, no problem. A little starch will fix her right up."
67085,267,67,328000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Cold, huh?"
67086,267,68,329000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,This should keep you toasty.
67087,267,69,332000,Rachel Jordan,Flanders Home,How 'bout that? It says Maude.
67088,267,70,337000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Mmm... I love chenille, don't you?"
67089,267,71,338000,Rachel Jordan,Flanders Home,"I don't love it, I don't hate it."
67090,267,72,340000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Mm. Well, goodnight, Maude. I mean, Maude. I mean, Rachel. I mean, Maude."
67092,267,74,357000,Rachel Jordan,Flanders Home,Oh my God! You're trying to make me look like your dead wife!
67093,267,75,361000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"No, n-n-no I know this is a-a-a tad unseemly, but if you'd just let me even out the back..."
67094,267,76,367000,Rachel Jordan,Flanders Home,"I'm calling a cab. Goodbye, Ned."
67095,267,77,371000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not over Maude at all."
67096,267,78,376000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Yeah, maybe it was too soon."
67097,267,79,378000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Well, aren't you gonna invite me in?"
67099,267,81,385000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"I sure appreciate you folks offering to go through Maude's things. If it were up to me, I wouldn't throw anything away."
67100,267,82,390000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Oh, don't you worry. We'll make all the hard decisions so you don't have to."
67101,267,83,394000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,"We can take whatever we want, right?"
67102,267,84,396000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Yea-- What?
67103,267,85,397000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,Don't listen to him. You just have a good time at the eye doctor.
67104,267,86,401000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Always do.
67105,267,87,402000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Say bye, Mr. Flanders."
67106,267,88,402000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,"Bye, Mr. Flanders."
67107,267,89,408000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,Poor Ned. He can't look anywhere without being reminded of Maude.
67108,267,90,413000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Yeah, a lifetime of memories."
67109,267,91,417000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Homer, don't you have any respect?"
67110,267,92,419000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Sure, of course I do, but life goes on, ashes to ashes, turn, turn, turn, long live rock, and so forth."
67111,267,93,428000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,Don't throw this away. It's Rod's first tooth.
67112,267,94,431000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,You're right. We could use this for witchcraft.
67113,267,95,434000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Wow, three pairs of shoes. Someone had a fetish."
67114,267,96,442000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Man, this is taking forever. I know how to speed things up."
67115,267,97,454000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,Her pillow's stuck.
67116,267,98,458000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Oh my. The room looks so bare.
67117,267,99,462000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Are you okay, Ned?"
67118,267,100,463000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Yeah, just a little shocked. What's that? Some kinda sorting machine?"
67119,267,101,468000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,Kinda.
67120,267,102,472000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,Now for the awkward part. We gotta talk about money.
67121,267,103,475000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,You said we were doing this out of friendship.
67122,267,104,478000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,What? That doesn't sound like me.
67123,267,105,479000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,"Hey, Dad, something didn't get, um, ""sorted""."
67124,267,106,479000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Maude's old sketch book. She was quite the little artist, you know."
67125,267,107,487000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,Ahh... Is that a fact? And you think you know someone.
67126,267,108,489000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Here's our house... a rainbow... a white hand shaking a black hand...
67127,267,109,498000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Praiseland? Rides, food, a tithing pond."
67128,267,110,502000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,It looks like an amusement park.
67129,267,111,504000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,You're right.
67130,267,112,506000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Maude designed a Christian amusement park. Oh, it must have been her final dream."
67131,267,113,510000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Hey, how 'bout that?"
67132,267,114,511000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,"Let's build it for her, Daddy."
67133,267,115,514000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Ohhh, that's a nice thought, Toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles..."
67134,267,116,521000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,But Mommy wanted it.
67135,267,117,536000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,But where do you put something that big?
67136,267,118,537000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,You could fix up the old Storytime Village. They've been out of business ever since that kid got his head cut off.
67137,267,119,543000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,Mm. That sounds perfect!
67138,267,120,545000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Well, what the heck. Who's ready to build an amusement park?"
67141,267,123,551000,The Rich Texan,Storytown Village,"Sell Storytime Village?! Why, you gotta be off your tuffet!"
67142,267,124,556000,Ned Flanders,Storytown Village,"Well, it's been closed for so long... and-and I thought I could turn it into a Christian theme park."
67143,267,125,562000,The Rich Texan,Storytown Village,"Christian, eh? Wellll, that's different."
67144,267,126,566000,Ned Flanders,Storytown Village,"Now the thing is, I don't have a lot of money..."
67145,267,127,569000,The Rich Texan,Storytown Village,"Then what the hell good are you?! Beat it, ya hippie!"
67146,267,128,572000,Ned Flanders,Storytown Village,But I...
67147,267,129,573000,The Rich Texan,Storytown Village,"You're right, that was harsh. Tell you what, maybe I could donate the park, as a tax write-off."
67148,267,130,580000,Ned Flanders,Storytown Village,"If you could do that, I'd make this place a shining beacon for the Lord."
67149,267,131,584000,The Rich Texan,Storytown Village,"Oh, you are so full of it! God's grace, that is. It's really sickening...there aren't more people like you. Now get out...your pen and we'll make it official."
67150,267,132,596000,Ned Flanders,Storytown Village,"Oh, bless you, sir."
67151,267,133,601000,Ned Flanders,Storytown Village,"Ah, Gipetto's workshop will make a great stable for the nativity scene."
67152,267,134,609000,Homer Simpson,Storytown Village,You're doing that the sucker way. Try a little vitamin G.
67153,267,135,617000,Bart Simpson,Storytown Village,Are you nuts?
67154,267,136,618000,Homer Simpson,Storytown Village,"Relax. It's a ""controlled burn""... Uh-oh."
67156,267,138,630000,Ned Flanders,Storytown Village,Darn teenagers with their beer bottles.
67157,267,139,632000,Homer Simpson,Storytown Village,"Uh, yeah, teenagers."
67158,267,140,638000,Marge Simpson,Storytown Village,"Ned, I'm worried about you. You've been working non-stop for the past week."
67159,267,141,642000,Ned Flanders,Storytown Village,"Well, it's been a tad harder than I thought, but I'm not complaining 'cause I work for a sweet, sweet, boss. You're our foreman, Maude."
67160,267,142,650000,Homer Simpson,Storytown Village,She's still bossing you around from beyond the grave? Can they do that?
67161,267,143,654000,Ned Flanders,Storytown Village,"Oh, I don't mind, but my greenback stack's gettin' kinda slack."
67162,267,144,658000,Lisa Simpson,Storytown Village,How about asking the community for donations?
67163,267,145,661000,Ned Flanders,Storytown Village,"Ohhh, I'm not very good at begging people for stuff."
67164,267,146,664000,Homer Simpson,Storytown Village,I am. I'd be glad to spearhead the entire begging initiative.
67165,267,147,668000,Ned Flanders,Storytown Village,"Well thanks, Homer."
67166,267,148,669000,Homer Simpson,Storytown Village,No problem. I'll need a sack and something sharp.
67169,267,151,673000,Krusty the Clown,TV Studio,"Well, I guess I could donate these costumes. They're from my Last Supper Pie Throwing sketch."
67171,267,153,681000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Office,"You can have these, ah, fireworks I confiscated. Some Chinese people claimed they were celebrating New Year's in February."
67172,267,154,687000,Homer Simpson,Chief Wiggum's Office,"Oh yeah, those guys and their crazy scams."
67173,267,155,695000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Office,Good food though.
67175,267,157,697000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,This sawdust will soak up the puke from the rooller-cooster. It's Willie's special blend.
67176,267,158,705000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Do I detect a hint of cinnamon?
67177,267,159,708000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, I'll never tell."
67179,267,161,710000,Kent Brockman,Channel 6 Studios,"Praiseland Amusement Park has its Grand Opening today. We now go live to its founder, Mr. Nedward Flanders."
67180,267,162,717000,Ned Flanders,Channel 6 Studios,"Morning, Kent. Our volunteers have done an amazing job getting the park ready here. We're gonna show Springfield that faith and devotion are the wildest thrill rides of all."
67182,267,163,728000,Kent Brockman,Channel 6 Studios,"All right, I hear the Mayor's arriving for the ribbon-cutting."
67183,267,164,733000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Channel 6 Studios,"It is with uh great pride that I dedicate this new school, sports arena or attraction."
67185,267,166,750000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,"Well, Maude, your dream has finally come true."
67187,267,168,759000,King David,RIDE,Halt! Who dares to disturb King David? Silence! You have invaded the chamber where I wrote all of my one hundred fifty psalms.
67189,267,170,772000,King David,RIDE,I hope you enjoy hearing them all.
67190,267,171,776000,King David,RIDE,"Number one: ""Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked..."""
67192,267,173,776000,Nelson Muntz,Praiseland,What do you hit 'em with? There's no mallet!
67193,267,174,786000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,You can stop Satan with your faith.
67194,267,175,789000,Nelson Muntz,Praiseland,My face? You callin' me ugly?
67195,267,176,791000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,"No, no, no, no, no, I think you're beautiful."
67196,267,177,793000,Nelson Muntz,Praiseland,"Oh, that's it."
67197,267,178,796000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,"Ohh, what can I get you, little Christian? How 'bout a Noah's Ark of Jellies?"
67198,267,179,801000,Chief Wiggum,Praiseland,"Oh, are there two of every flavor?"
67199,267,180,803000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,"Nope, they're all the same. Plain."
67201,267,182,807000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,How 'bout a Maude mask?
67202,267,183,809000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,I'm Maude. God is super!
67203,267,184,812000,Ralph Wiggum,Praiseland,Can I sit in the car?

67205,267,186,816000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,Bye bye.
67206,267,187,817000,Lenny Leonard,Praiseland,A Bible park without beer? Now I've seen everything.
67207,267,188,820000,Carl Carlson,Praiseland,"And this candy is sub-par. Any religion that embraces carob is, uh, not for Carl Carlson."
67208,267,189,828000,Moe Szyslak,Praiseland,"Oh, hey, get outta the way, pal. You're blocking the exit."
67209,267,190,831000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,"Ohhh, you want me to stamp your hand so you can get back in?"
67210,267,191,833000,Moe Szyslak,Praiseland,Don't you dare!

67214,267,195,839000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,Whoa! Where's everyone going? What's wrong?
67215,267,196,841000,Sideshow Mel,Praiseland,This place is the height of tedium.
67181,267,197,844000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Praiseland,"Yarrr, she blows."
67216,267,198,851000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,"Oh, Maude, I turned your dream of a Christian amusement park into a bemusement park."
67217,267,199,857000,Homer Simpson,Praiseland,"Don't say that, Ned!"
67218,267,200,859000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,It is! It's a bemusement park!
67219,267,201,865000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,"I'm sorry, sweetheart. Oh, please don't look at me like that."

67224,267,206,882000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,It's almost like she's alive again.

67242,267,224,952000,Seymour Skinner,Praiseland,"But it wasn't clouds and angels playing harps like at the end of so many Three Stooges shorts. It was a golden elementary school, with a teacher's lounge that stretched as far as the eye could see. And no one was ever tardy."
67243,267,225,965000,Bart Simpson,Praiseland,Was I there?

67251,267,232,987000,Bart Simpson,Praiseland,"Yeah, folks, the power of Christ compels you to give Ned an extra ten bucks."
67252,267,233,991000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,"Homer, no! I can't exploit a divine manifestation."
67253,267,234,995000,Homer Simpson,Praiseland,"Oh, why not? Everybody's doin' it."

67271,267,252,1092000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,"Oh, there's no explaining God's will, Roddy. That's like explaining how an airplane flies."
67272,267,253,1098000,Homer Simpson,Praiseland,Stupid grill!
67273,267,254,1099000,Homer Simpson,Praiseland,Why won't you light? The gas is on full blast!
67274,267,255,1102000,Bart Simpson,Praiseland,You better stick your head in and see what's going on.
67275,267,256,1105000,Homer Simpson,Praiseland,Good idea.
67276,267,257,1106000,Lisa Simpson,Praiseland,"No, Dad! I think there's a leak in the line."
67277,267,258,1110000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,Leak in the line?
67278,267,259,1122000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,"Oh, no! This isn't a devine miracle. Everyone's just gettin' goofy from the gas."
67279,267,260,1133000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,"Ah, ah, folks, I've just discovered something about this statue that uh, may disappoint you. You see..."
67280,267,261,1144000,Patches,Praiseland,"What is it, Mr. Fwanders? Is something wrong with the miracle?"
67281,267,262,1149000,Poor Violet,Praiseland,Will there still be money for the orphans?
67282,267,264,1157000,Ned Flanders,FOOD BOOTH,"Hello, Gas Company? How poisonous is your gas?... Wow. But-- Eh, but I'm talkin', you know, about outdoors with plenty of ventilation that... How could that be worse?... Okay, permanent brain damage, or just temporary?... I see."
67283,267,265,1174000,Ned Flanders,FOOD BOOTH,I've gotta close Praiseland down. Someone could get hurt.
67284,267,266,1179000,Homer Simpson,FOOD BOOTH,Could get hurt. Could. There's a chance they won't.
67285,267,267,1183000,Homer Simpson,FOOD BOOTH,"Ned, Praiseland has touched an entire town with its inspiring message and toxic super-freakouts. Look at those smiling faces."

67294,267,276,1223000,Crowd,FOOD BOOTH,Absolutely not! / Never! / No friggin' way!
67295,267,277,1227000,Chief Wiggum,FOOD BOOTH,"Yeah, this place is more like Craze-land!"
67296,267,278,1231000,Chief Wiggum,FOOD BOOTH,Instead of Praise-land.

67307,267,289,1269000,Ned Flanders,Praiseland,"How 'bout I explain it to you over a cup of coffee. That is, if you're willing to give me another shot."
67309,267,291,1284000,Rachel Jordan,Flanders Home,"Are you sure you want to do this, Ned?"
67310,267,292,1287000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,I'm sure.
67311,267,293,1295000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"So, how 'bout a movie tomorrow night?"
67064,267,294,1296000,Rachel Jordan,Flanders Home,Sounds great.
