132109,509,1,88000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Streets,"This is Kent Brockman at the First Annual Springfield Grand Prix, which like all our town's showcase events is not only poorly-planned -- it's horribly-executed!"
132110,509,2,102000,Ken Burns,Springfield Streets,"The Making of the Empire State Building, Part One... The Basement."
132116,509,8,123000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Wait for the gap... wait for the gap...
132117,509,9,126000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Homer, we can buy scotch tape tomorrow!"
132118,509,10,129000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,There's the gap!
132120,509,12,131000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Gap's too small!
132122,509,14,135000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,A peloton?
132123,509,15,137000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Car,"Apparently, today is also the final stage of the Tour de Springfield bike race!"
132124,509,16,143000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Car,"Hey, that's some fancy riding."
132126,509,18,154000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Square,"Truthfully, today there were no losers -- and no winners, since both finish lines were tangled up in this unholy mess."
132127,509,19,163000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,I hear tapping from inside.
132129,509,21,164000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,What's goin' on?
132130,509,22,166000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Square,"Well, let's all start tapping... our toes to the sounds of Scab Calloway and his Non-Union Band."
132131,509,23,175000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Square,Keep it down in there!
132133,509,25,181000,Bart Simpson,BANQUET TENT,"So, is this a date date, or just a meaningless friend thing?"
132134,509,26,185000,Lisa Simpson,BANQUET TENT,Meaningless friend thing.
132135,509,27,185000,Milhouse Van Houten,BANQUET TENT,True love super-date.
132136,509,28,188000,Bart Simpson,BANQUET TENT,"Well, if you two ever get serious and have a baby, it'll look something like this."
132137,509,29,196000,Milhouse Van Houten,BANQUET TENT,Don't listen to Uncle Bart! Lisa and I will raise you in a house of love.
132138,509,30,200000,Lisa Simpson,BANQUET TENT,We're not having a baby!
132139,509,31,203000,Milhouse Van Houten,BANQUET TENT,Jimmy!
132140,509,32,204000,Lisa Simpson,BANQUET TENT,Oh brother. Let's dance.
132141,509,33,210000,Bart Simpson,BANQUET TENT,Geek leak!
132142,509,34,214000,Lisa Simpson,BANQUET TENT,Hey Bart? At least I've got a date!
132144,509,35,218000,Bart Simpson,BANQUET TENT,"Dance with me, please. I need to zing my sister."
132145,509,36,221000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,BANQUET TENT,"Okay, but you have to do your homework. Just kidding. I've given up on that."
132146,509,37,226000,Bart Simpson,BANQUET TENT,"Just move your girdle, Yertel."
132147,509,38,228000,Bart Simpson,BANQUET TENT,"Hey Lis -- your dance partner just made the cover of ""Dorks Illustrated"" Magazine."
132148,509,39,233000,Milhouse Van Houten,BANQUET TENT,"I know that's a zing, but still -- the cover!"
132149,509,40,237000,Lisa Simpson,BANQUET TENT,"Now you listen to me, Bart. Milhouse may not be the perfect date..."
132150,509,41,241000,Milhouse Van Houten,BANQUET TENT,"Please let there be a ""but"" coming. Please!"
132151,509,42,243000,Lisa Simpson,BANQUET TENT,But...
132152,509,43,243000,Milhouse Van Houten,BANQUET TENT,Landed it!
132153,509,44,247000,Lisa Simpson,BANQUET TENT,At least I'm with someone who tries a little too hard because he really likes me.
132154,509,45,251000,Bart Simpson,BANQUET TENT,"Hey, plenty of babes have docked at Porto de Barto."
132155,509,46,255000,Lisa Simpson,BANQUET TENT,"Yeah, for about a week. But as soon as they get to know the real you, they departo de Barto. And that's why you're alone tonight."
132156,509,47,264000,Bart Simpson,BANQUET TENT,"Oh my God, is that true?"
132157,509,48,267000,Moe Szyslak,BANQUET TENT,"I'm afraid Lisa's right, son. If the late, great Nora Ephron taught us anything... Oh! What's my other inflatable doll doing here?"
132158,509,49,278000,Moe Szyslak,BANQUET TENT,What? What? I ain't here with no one.
132160,509,51,290000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Oh man, Lisa's right -- none of these relationships lasted very long. Three days, one recess, half a field trip... why did I have to get so needy at the planetarium?"
132161,509,52,301000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Boy, if anyone needs me I'll be taking a popcorn bath. It's a thing I read about in a Men's Health magazine in a dream."
132162,509,53,307000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Dad, can I ask you a question? How did you ever get a woman like Mom to stay with you?"
132163,509,54,312000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Pfft, look in the mirror, unplanned miracle."
132164,509,55,315000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Is that the only reason?
132165,509,56,316000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Well... I also keep things interesting.
132166,509,57,319000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"All right, who took the microwave?"
132167,509,58,321000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"You see? Hey, what are you looking at?"
132168,509,59,325000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,My ex-girlfriends.
132171,509,60,326000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Aw boy, I feel for ya. Nobody likes to be rejected, and it never gets easier, until you can drink. Because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing."
132172,509,61,336000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Observe. Hey, it's me again. He's there, isn't he? Well, I hope this doesn't sound weird, but I'm inside your closet."
132173,509,62,345000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Um, that's awesome. But I think I'll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me."
132174,509,63,353000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Hey, it's me."
132175,509,64,355000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"I was thinking about you. It's your birthday in like three, four months? Would it be weird if I threw you a party?"
132176,509,65,365000,Jenny,Bart's Bedroom,Eat my shorts!
132177,509,66,367000,Darcy,Bart's Bedroom,Drop dead!
132178,509,67,368000,Gina Vendetti,Bart's Bedroom,"Eat fist, jerk."
132180,509,69,371000,Nikki McKenna,NIKKI'S HOUSE,You've got a lotta nerve showing up here... and not giving me a kiss.
132181,509,70,377000,Nikki McKenna,NIKKI'S HOUSE,Inappropriate!
132182,509,71,378000,Nikki McKenna,NIKKI'S HOUSE,I miss you.
132183,509,72,380000,Nikki McKenna,NIKKI'S HOUSE,Stalker!
132184,509,73,381000,Nikki McKenna,NIKKI'S HOUSE,Save me!
132186,509,75,386000,Bart Simpson,Cletus's Shack,"Mary Spuckler, you're my last chance."
132187,509,76,389000,Milhouse Van Houten,Cletus's Shack,She's pretty cute for Cletus's daughter.
132188,509,77,392000,Bart Simpson,Cletus's Shack,"Yeah, she got to drink milk as a kid instead of white paint."
132189,509,78,396000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,Is you one of my kids?
132190,509,79,398000,Bart Simpson,Cletus's Shack,No sir.
132191,509,80,399000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,Prove it.
132192,509,81,400000,Bart Simpson,Cletus's Shack,"A, B, C..."
132193,509,82,401000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,"All right, all right, you've convinced me, Einstein. What do you want?"
132194,509,83,405000,Bart Simpson,Cletus's Shack,Is Mary here?
132195,509,84,407000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,"I'm afraid Mary done run off, we knows not where."
132196,509,85,411000,Bart Simpson,Cletus's Shack,Dadgummit! Do you think she still likes me?
132197,509,86,413000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,"Um... hey, Brandine! Does Mary still like this boy?"
132198,509,87,418000,Brandine Del Roy,Cletus's Shack,I don't know what that girl likes anymore. She ran away after we engaged her to Old Man Wellbottom.
132199,509,88,424000,Old Man Wellbottom,Cletus's Shack,"And I was gonna be a good husband too, if'n I ever get out of this well!"
132200,509,89,429000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,"All right, all right, now, that's enough out of you."
132201,509,90,432000,Old Man Wellbottom,Cletus's Shack,But I just--
132169,509,91,434000,Bart Simpson,Cletus's Shack,I can't believe she ran away. And this isn't helping.
132170,509,92,439000,Bart Simpson,Cletus's Shack,I'd better switch to the hard stuff.
131869,509,93,440000,Bart Simpson,Cletus's Shack,"Hey, Dubya."
132202,509,94,441000,George W. Bush,Cletus's Shack,I know where my sister run off to -- New York City.
132203,509,95,446000,Milhouse Van Houten,Cletus's Shack,New York? That's where Sesame Street is! Do you ever wonder what happens to Oscar on garbage day?
132204,509,96,452000,George W. Bush,Cletus's Shack,Yep. New York. The Big Somethin'.
132205,509,97,456000,George W. Bush,Cletus's Shack,This yere's her address. Good luck.
132207,509,99,468000,Mary,Simpson Home,"I don't know if we should be up here, Bart Simpson."
132208,509,100,470000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And why is that?
132209,509,101,474000,Mary,Simpson Home,'Cause the floor ain't finished. Daddy just covers things with hay and says they're done.
132210,509,102,482000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, can we go to New York to find this girl I used to know?"
132211,509,103,485000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, that's sweet, but we'd need airplane money, hotel money..."
132212,509,104,490000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"...And five hundred dollars for Yankee tickets, which turn out to be bogus..."
132213,509,105,493000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, don't buy 'em!"
132214,509,106,495000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But they're playing the Purple Sox!
132215,509,107,497000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, Dad. You love New York. Now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated: Old Penn Station and Shea Stadium."
132216,509,108,503000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lousy outdated relics! Boy, do you remember what happened the last time we went to New York?"
132218,509,110,514000,J.J. Hunsecker,'50S NEW YORK NIGHT CLUB,"Keep your meathooks off my sister Marge, or my goons will do a soft-shoe on your solar plexus."
132219,509,111,518000,Homer Simpson,'50S NEW YORK NIGHT CLUB,"You're dead, J.J. Get yourself buried!"
132220,509,112,521000,J.J. Hunsecker,'50S NEW YORK NIGHT CLUB,"Tough cookie, huh? Well, watch me take a bite out of you!"
132221,509,113,523000,Homer Simpson,'50S NEW YORK NIGHT CLUB,"I'm about to go owl shooting... and you just said ""who!"""
132222,509,114,525000,J.J. Hunsecker,'50S NEW YORK NIGHT CLUB,That's some lip ya got on ya. How'd you like me to stretch it like a rubber band and snap ya into last week?
132223,509,115,529000,Homer Simpson,'50S NEW YORK NIGHT CLUB,"You're sellin' milk, J.J., and I've got a sour stomach."
132224,509,116,534000,Marge Simpson,'50S NEW YORK NIGHT CLUB,"Homer, that sounds like ""The Sweet Smell of Success""."
132225,509,117,537000,Homer Simpson,'50S NEW YORK NIGHT CLUB,It didn't feel like success.
132227,509,119,544000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Why, ladies? Why?!"
132230,509,120,547000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Son, you can dial down the crazy. Your mother and I talked about it and we found a way to get to New York. It's all set, boy. To save money, we're swapping houses."
132231,509,121,558000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,But don't the people wreck your house when they stay in it?
132232,509,122,560000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I didn't say I swapped our house.
132233,509,123,564000,N.Y. Father,Bart's Bedroom,How ya doin'? We're stayin' here for two weeks.
132234,509,124,566000,Ned Flanders,Bart's Bedroom,"Lord, you're testin' me, aren't ya?"
132235,509,125,568000,N.Y. Father,Bart's Bedroom,Keep talkin' to your friend up there. We'll be doin' it on your bed.
132236,509,126,571000,N.Y. Mother,Bart's Bedroom,New York style!
132238,509,128,585000,Homer Simpson,Times Square,Look at this place. Things have certainly changed since our ancestor Fievel came here.
132239,509,129,590000,Lisa Simpson,Times Square,Fievel was a mouse in a movie.
132240,509,130,592000,Homer Simpson,Times Square,"Yes, and now look at us. Only in America."
132241,509,131,596000,Vendor,Times Square,Khlav Kalash! Get your Khlav Kalash!
132242,509,132,598000,Homer Simpson,Times Square,"Oh, geez. Not this guy, with his stupid little pushcart."
132243,509,133,602000,Vendor,Times Square,"Fifty thousand square feet, huh? All Khlav Kalash! Used to be book store! Books."
132244,509,134,608000,Bart Simpson,Times Square,"Come on, let's go find Mary! This is the address her brother gave me."
132245,509,135,612000,Lisa Simpson,Times Square,Can't Dad take Bart while we seek out culture?
132246,509,136,614000,Homer Simpson,Times Square,You do that.
132247,509,137,616000,Homer Simpson,Times Square,Do you know you're missing your clothes?
132248,509,138,619000,Buff Cowboy,Times Square,"I thought this was just a dream! Oh, man!"
132251,509,141,631000,Homer Simpson,Subway Car,"All right, I'll spring for a cab."
132253,509,143,633000,Homer Simpson,TAXICAB,Much better.
132254,509,144,636000,New York Cab Driver,TAXICAB,"Here we are! Anything you leave in the cab, you'll never see again!"
132255,509,145,645000,Bart Simpson,TAXICAB,Hey!
132256,509,146,646000,Homer Simpson,TAXICAB,"Oh-oh-oh oh, thank God you woke up!"
132258,509,148,654000,Bart Simpson,Apartment Building,I guess my search for true love is doomed.
132259,509,149,657000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,"You've learned a very valuable life lesson, boy, which is that love doesn't exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage. After that, it's just hanging out with someone who kind of hates you, but you can't get it together to leave. I'll get us some ice cream."
132228,509,150,677000,Sophisticated Girl,Apartment Building,"What's the matter, darling?"
132260,509,151,678000,Bart Simpson,Apartment Building,"Thanks for asking, Duchess. I'm sittin' here waitin' for a girl that's never gonna show up."
132261,509,152,683000,Sophisticated Girl,Apartment Building,What makes you so sure?
132262,509,153,684000,Bart Simpson,Apartment Building,"Girls don't like me. I don't really like them yet either, but I think I'm gonna. There's a storm a-brewin' down there."
132263,509,154,690000,Sophisticated Girl,Apartment Building,"Well, there's a girl a-standing right here! It's me, Mary!"
132264,509,155,694000,Bart Simpson,Apartment Building,Wow. What are you doin' for money?
132265,509,156,697000,Mary,Apartment Building,"Well, it's not very steady and I'm kind of ashamed... I'm a featured player on Saturday Night Live."
132266,509,157,703000,Don Pardo,Apartment Building,Mary Spuckler!
132267,509,158,706000,Mary,Apartment Building,"Aw, I'm lying. My whole life here is a bunch of lies. I'm just a writer with a performing option."
132268,509,159,712000,Bart Simpson,Apartment Building,Let's talk about somethin' else. Something nice.
132270,509,161,719000,Marge Simpson,BROADWAY THEATER,"So, this is basically what we can afford."
132271,509,162,722000,Theater Cashier,BROADWAY THEATER,"Okay, second balcony, partially obstructed view, no bathroom privileges, and you must stipulate that in emergencies you can change a spotlight gel."
132272,509,163,729000,Lisa Simpson,BROADWAY THEATER,"Well, at least I'll be able to say I went to a Broadway show."
132273,509,164,732000,Theater Cashier,BROADWAY THEATER,You're not allowed to say that.
132274,509,165,734000,Marge Simpson,BROADWAY THEATER,"Oh, forget it."
132276,509,167,735000,Mary,Mary's Apartment Building,"So, Bart Simpson, did you really come all the way here just to see me?"
132277,509,168,741000,Bart Simpson,Mary's Apartment Building,Yeah... plus I thought I might get to see an air conditioner fall on someone's head. But I guess that never really happens.
132279,509,170,747000,Mary,Mary's Apartment Building,Is that your father?
132280,509,171,749000,Mary,Mary's Apartment Building,"Bart, I want to see you again, but I don't want a grownup taking me back! Meet me at the High Line tomorrow."
132281,509,172,756000,Mary,Mary's Apartment Building,Keep my secret!
132282,509,173,757000,Homer Simpson,Mary's Apartment Building,Why you little... where's that ice cream?
132284,509,175,761000,Marge Simpson,Times Square,Just once I'd like your father to be on a JumboTron for something good.
132285,509,176,765000,Homer Simpson,Times Square,Damn you and your fluted neck!
132287,509,178,774000,Mary,NEW YORK HIGH LINE,"So, what did you do with your Dad?"
132229,509,179,776000,Bart Simpson,NEW YORK HIGH LINE,We're safe because you have to climb steps to get up here.
132288,509,180,780000,New York Guy,NEW YORK HIGH LINE,Can't move?
132017,509,181,781000,Homer Simpson,NEW YORK HIGH LINE,No.
132289,509,182,784000,Homer Simpson,NEW YORK HIGH LINE,I thought there was no crime in New York any more. Giulianiii!
132290,509,183,789000,Mary,NEW YORK HIGH LINE,Give me some news of Springfield.
132291,509,184,791000,Bart Simpson,NEW YORK HIGH LINE,They let Sideshow Bob out of prison again.
132292,509,185,795000,Bart Simpson,NEW YORK HIGH LINE,Huh. Didn't know they still ran those trains.
132293,509,186,797000,Mary,NEW YORK HIGH LINE,How's your mama and your sister?

132296,509,189,801000,Marge Simpson,LINCOLN CENTER SUBWAY STOP,"No, Lisa! If you click that turnstile, it'll blow our budget!"
132300,509,193,808000,Mary,High Line,"Well, without them around, you and I can walk through the city holding hands just like the men-folk do."
132301,509,194,814000,Bart Simpson,High Line,I could listen to your twang all day.
132302,509,195,816000,Mary,High Line,Would you care to hear it in song? 'Cause I wrote one... about you.
132303,509,196,820000,Bart Simpson,High Line,Can I do a rap in the middle of it?
132304,509,197,821000,Mary,High Line,Or you could just listen!
132305,509,198,824000,Mary,High Line,"Sir, may I borrow your guitar?"
132306,509,199,826000,Guitar Player,High Line,"Sure, sure -- it's the case that makes money!"
132307,509,200,834000,Mary,High Line,A BOY I KNEW TURNED UP AGAIN
