120351,464,196,872000,Simon Cowell,EDITING BAY,"That's not my home number. That's my assistant's work number. Now Moe, I want to give you a friendly warning -- don't do what I did. Don't become the mean judge."
120352,464,197,882000,Moe Szyslak,EDITING BAY,But it's brought you everything a man could want -- I bet you throw out your paper plates instead of reusing 'em till the food drops through.
120353,464,198,889000,Simon Cowell,EDITING BAY,"That's true. Everything you said is true. But there's a cost. I'm lonely, Moe. No one dares be my friend, for fear I'll say something nasty."
120354,464,199,896000,Moe Szyslak,EDITING BAY,"But what we do is just kiddin' around, right? People know that."
120355,464,200,900000,Simon Cowell,EDITING BAY,"Do they? They've been preparing a bio of you, with interviews of people you've judged. Let's have a look."

120362,464,207,916000,Moe Szyslak,EDITING BAY,"Wow. I can't believe this, Simon. Simon? Huh. Was he really here, or was it just my imagination?"
120363,464,208,928000,Simon Cowell,EDITING BAY,I'm here. My black tee shirt makes me blend into the shadows. I'm here...I'm gone. I'm here. I'm gone. I'm here. I'm gone. I'm here...
120364,464,209,936000,Moe Szyslak,EDITING BAY,I get it. I get it. That's your thing.
120366,464,211,942000,Female Singer,American Idol Set,HAPPY BIRTH-DAY TO... YOUUUUUU!
120367,464,212,954000,Simon,American Idol Set,"This is it, Moe -- America's gonna learn just what sort of man you are."
120368,464,213,959000,Ryan Seacrest,American Idol Set,"Okay Randy, what'd you think of that performance?"
120369,464,214,962000,Randy Jackson,American Idol Set,"A'ight, a'ight -- You know what? I was feelin' that, dog. ""Happy"" was very cool, right? But ""birth"" was definitely a little pitchy, but -- I gotta tell you something -- you worked it out on ""day,"" man. And then when you hit that ""to you"" -- dude, that was the bomb! You blew out all the candles, baby!"
120370,464,215,976000,Ryan Seacrest,American Idol Set,"If you think that answer was a yes, text the number at the bottom of the screen. Giant secret charges may apply. Kara?"
120371,464,216,983000,Kara DioGuardi,American Idol Set,"I have to admit, I didn't think you could come back from last week, when your version of ""Brown Sugar"" made Mick Jagger retire from singing forever. But you rocked it!"
120372,464,217,991000,Ryan Seacrest,American Idol Set,"Ellen, what's your ""ramble"" on this?"
120373,464,218,993000,Ellen DeGeneres,American Idol Set,"Ryan, I don't ramble anymore. Although I do love that song ""Ramblin' Man"" by the Allman Brothers. I used to think that they were the ""Almond Brothers,"" which was cool, because I love nuts. Except for filberts, which is weird because I love Dilbert -- 'cause when you're stuck workin' in a cubicle, sometimes you just gotta dance!"
120374,464,219,1018000,Ryan Seacrest,American Idol Set,"Now let's hear from the new guy, Moe Szyslak."
120375,464,220,1024000,Moe Szyslak,American Idol Set,Uh... well let's see here. Um...
120376,464,221,1028000,Thought Bubble Simon Cowell,American Idol Set,Don't become the mean judge.
120377,464,222,1031000,Lisa Simpson,American Idol Set,"Mr. Cowell, would you like some band candy?"
120378,464,223,1034000,Thought Bubble Simon Cowell,American Idol Set,Security!
120379,464,224,1038000,Moe Szyslak,American Idol Set,"Uh, I'm afraid you're wasting your time on this stage..."
120381,464,226,1045000,Moe Szyslak,American Idol Set,...because you should be on Broadway chargin' a hundred bucks a ticket! You're a natural talent!
120385,464,228,1052000,Moe Szyslak,American Idol Set,"I'm gettin' a little emotional here, because your voice, it opened up a little part of me that I thought was closed to truth and beauty forever. If there's a God, I just hope that right now he's votin' your name on that 8-8-8 line. It was, it was really beautiful. Really. Thank you."
120386,464,229,1068000,Ryan Seacrest,American Idol Set,"Okay, that's four thumbs-up. And finally, because this show now has more judges than the Supreme court... Simon, what do you say?"
120387,464,230,1076000,Simon Cowell,American Idol Set,"Well, that was truly a remarkable version of ""Happy Birthday."" Because when it was done, I actually felt like I had lost a year of my life."
120389,464,232,1085000,Simon Cowell,American Idol Set,"But even more objectionable were Moe's insipid comments -- a desperate plea for affection, which fell as flat as the hair on my head."
120391,464,234,1098000,Moe Szyslak,American Idol Set,Why are you raggin' on me? I'm doin' just what you said.
120392,464,235,1101000,Simon Cowell,American Idol Set,"Hmm... let me think, why would I try to sabotage a new judge who just might do what I do for forty-eight million dollars less?"
120393,464,236,1108000,Moe Szyslak,American Idol Set,"Hey, hey, hey! I've been double-crossed here! You're pretty smart huh, Simon?! Let's see how smart you are with your voice box hangin' out!"
120394,464,237,1116000,Ryan Seacrest,American Idol Set,Label to camera! Label to camera!
120395,464,238,1118000,Moe Szyslak,American Idol Set,What?! Oh. I'm Sorry. Sorry.
120396,464,239,1120000,Moe Szyslak,American Idol Set,"Die, ya bastard!"
120399,464,242,1124000,Pro Shop Clerk,Office,"Tees, scorecard, stubby little pencil... you're all set."
120400,464,243,1127000,Marge Simpson,Office,"Have fun, Homie."
120401,464,244,1129000,Friendly Old Golfer,Office,"Looks like Jimmy's starting him off with a three-iron. Now, My first shot was with a three-iron. One shot, and I was hooked for life. Barely saw my family again. Birthdays, anniversaries -- I missed 'em all."
120402,464,245,1144000,Friendly Old Golfer,Office,"I'm missing my daughter's wedding right now. Sweet guy, I'm told."
120403,464,246,1150000,Friendly Old Golfer,Office,One shot...
120404,464,247,1151000,Friendly Old Golfer,Office,Hooked for life...
120405,464,248,1158000,Homer Simpson,Office,Marge! You ruined my shot!
120406,464,249,1161000,Marge Simpson,Office,Well you can take another -- in forty years!
120408,464,251,1168000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,That was awesome. I feel like the Tiger Woods of sex.
120333,464,252,1172000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,In the mood for another round?
120409,464,255,1179000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"...I didn't rip out his voice box, but I did stretch out his tee shirt, then they said I ain't allowed back in California no more and I can no longer make judgments about nothin'..."
120410,464,256,1188000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Hey Moe, am I okay to drive?"
120411,464,257,1192000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Legally, I can't say."
120412,464,258,1193000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,To a drunk man that's a yes!
120413,464,259,1202000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Beep! Beep!
120414,464,260,1203000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,He seems fine. There is one bright side: I'm also forbidden from ever watchin' Fox.
120415,464,261,1208000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,You can't even show it in the bar?
120416,464,262,1210000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,That's right -- and business has never been better.
120417,464,263,1216000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh hey, how's it goin' there, Mr. Murdoch?"
120418,464,264,1220000,Rupert Murdoch,Moe's Tavern,Never mind me -- put on the Jay Leno show.
120419,464,265,1223000,Jay Leno,Moe's Tavern,"Have you seen this? The president says Iran has gotten hold of the most dangerous weapon known to man: the B.P. Oil rig. That's right, ladies and gentlemen. I know how to make that leak disappear -- put it on NBC."
