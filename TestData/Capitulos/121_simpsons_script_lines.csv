25160,121,46,200000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Now I know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions. Like switching to the metric system...
25161,121,47,206000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,The metric system is the tool of the devil. My car gets 40 rods to the hogshead and that's the way I likes it.
25162,121,48,216000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,The old person's remarks will be stricken from the record.
25163,121,49,218000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Who said that?
25164,121,50,219000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,But my new idea is different. I think we should hold a film festival and give out prizes.

25233,121,121,507000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,I don't know what's happening. It seems our profits have dropped thirty-seven percent.
25234,121,122,512000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"I'm afraid we have a bad image, sir. Market research shows people see you as something of an ogre."
25235,121,123,516000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,I ought to club them and eat their bones!
25236,121,124,519000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Heh-heh. Well maybe this film festival could help us. A film biography might let them get to know the real you -- virtuous, heroic, nubile..."

25238,121,126,529000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"But I like that film biography idea. A slick Hollywood picture to gloss over my evil rise to power, like ""Bugsy,"" or ""Working Girl."" Get me Steven Spielberg!"
