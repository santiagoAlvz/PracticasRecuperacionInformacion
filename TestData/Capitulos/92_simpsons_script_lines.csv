17595,92,159,749000,Homer Simpson,Smartline Studio,"Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. Forty percent of all people know that."
17596,92,160,755000,Kent Brockman,Smartline Studio,"I see. Well, what do you say to the accusation that your group has been causing more crimes than it's been preventing?"
17597,92,161,760000,Homer Simpson,Smartline Studio,"Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't committing crimes."
17598,92,162,765000,Kent Brockman,Smartline Studio,Touché.
17599,92,163,767000,Kent Brockman,Smartline Studio,"Well, it looks like we have our first caller. And I mean ever, because this is not a call-in show. Hello, you're on the air."

17606,92,170,799000,Kent Brockman,Smartline Studio,"Homer, that's our stage manager!"
17607,92,171,804000,Homer Simpson,Smartline Studio,Oh sorry. I'm a little nervous.
17608,92,172,807000,Cat Burglar,Smartline Studio,"It may interest you to know that for my next crime I'll be pinching the pride and joy of the Springfield Museum, the world's largest cubic zirconia."

17614,92,178,836000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Museum,"Dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. Just stand around and don't steal anything."

17622,92,186,852000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Museum,He's a burglar.
17623,92,187,855000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Museum,"Well, Mr. Cat Burglar, you'd like to get in here, wouldn't you? There's just one little problem. Thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named Homer J. Sim -- Oh my God! Underage kids drinking beer without a permit!"
17624,92,188,889000,Kids,Springfield Museum,Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

17646,92,210,977000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow! How'd you track him down, Grampa?"
17647,92,211,979000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Good question.
17649,92,213,981000,Grampa Simpson,Hallway,On one of my frequent trips to the ground... I noticed Molloy wore sneakers.
17650,92,214,989000,Grampa Simpson,Hallway,For sneaking! My next clue came just yesterday at the museum. We felt slighted by your age-bashing and started home.
17652,92,216,998000,Grampa Simpson,Museum,"Molloy said, 'I'll catch up with you.'"
17653,92,217,998000,Grampa Simpson,Museum,"I couldn't quite put my finger on it. There was something strange about the way he walked. Much more vertical than usual. And finally, Molloy, unlike most retired people, has the world's largest cubic zirconia on his coffee table."
17654,92,218,1023000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"Aw, Dad, I could kiss you."
17655,92,219,1025000,Grampa Simpson,Museum,Well kiss me right here. It's the only part that still has feeling.
17657,92,221,1029000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No wait! I know where the burglar is!
17658,92,222,1033000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,To the retirement home!
17659,92,223,1033000,Crowd,Simpson Home,Hooray!
17661,92,225,1037000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Retirement Castle,And there she is: the world's largest cubic zirconia.
17662,92,226,1046000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Retirement Castle,What an eyesore.
17663,92,227,1048000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"So, Mr. Molloy. It seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him."
17664,92,228,1056000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Retirement Castle,How ironic.
17665,92,229,1056000,Molloy,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Homer old chum. Well done. If anyone was going to catch me, I'm glad it was you."
17666,92,230,1062000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Actually, it wasn't me. It was my Dad, Grampa."
17667,92,231,1066000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Thanks, son. So you see old people aren't so useless after all. Molloy's old and he outsmarted the lot of ya. And I'm even older and I outsmarted him."
17668,92,232,1078000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Retirement Castle,Shut up.
17669,92,233,1078000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,I've had my moment.
17670,92,234,1082000,Molloy,Springfield Retirement Castle,"And of course, I'm happy to return all of your treasured possessions."
17671,92,235,1086000,Molloy,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Selma, my dear, your lock of MacGyver's hair."
17672,92,236,1092000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield Retirement Castle,Thank you. I'll add it to the ball.
17673,92,237,1096000,Molloy,Springfield Retirement Castle,"And little Lisa, here's your saxophone."
17674,92,238,1099000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Thank you. And thank you, Dad. You got it back, just like you said you would."
17675,92,239,1106000,Molloy,Springfield Retirement Castle,"I sincerely regret any inconvenience I may have caused. And although I have stolen your material goods, let me assure you that your dear town has stolen my heart."
17676,92,240,1115000,Crowd,Springfield Retirement Castle,Awwwww.
17677,92,241,1117000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, he's so charming!"
17678,92,242,1117000,Barney Gumble,Springfield Retirement Castle,Let's let him go.
17679,92,243,1120000,Crowd,Springfield Retirement Castle,Yeah!
17680,92,244,1120000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, sorry, folks. Gee, I really hate to spoil this little love-in, but Mr. Molloy broke the law. And when you break the law, you gotta go to jail."
17681,92,245,1130000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Uh, that reminds me, uh, here's your monthly kickback."
17682,92,246,1133000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Retirement Castle,"You just, you couldn't have picked a worse time."
17684,92,248,1136000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,I caught the cat burglar. I caught the cat burglar. That means you. You are the cat burglar.
17685,92,249,1144000,Molloy,Springfield Police Station,I suppose you're wondering where I hid all the millions of dollars I stole over the years.
17686,92,250,1147000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Shut up.
17687,92,251,1147000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Oh, wait a minute. Maybe we should uh, hear him out. Where'd you hide the loot, Molloy?"
17688,92,252,1152000,Molloy,Springfield Police Station,"It's buried right here in Springfield, under a Big T."
17689,92,253,1152000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,No kidding.
17690,92,254,1158000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Big T, huh?"
17691,92,255,1160000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Well, I guess I'll be going to my home now and... sleep."
17692,92,256,1166000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Yeah, me too. I will also go home for sleep."
17694,92,258,1169000,Homer Simpson,Downtown Springfield,Lemme through! I gotta find a Big T. There's millions of dollars buried under a Big T!
17696,92,260,1180000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,We need more information.
17697,92,261,1193000,Molloy,Springfield Police Station,It's buried at 4723 Maple Valley Road.
17698,92,262,1198000,Molloy,Springfield Police Station,"Ah, you take highway 201 south for 15 minutes... take a left at the left."
17699,92,263,1205000,Barney Gumble,Springfield Police Station,"Oh, that was fun, ladies!"
17700,92,264,1222000,Driver,Springfield Police Station,"Whatsa matter with you, kid? You told me the stream was shallow. Why you... oh kid... I'll kill you..."
17701,92,265,1238000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Police Station,"Hordes of panicky people seem to be evacuating the town for some unknown reason. Professor, without knowing precisely what the danger is, would you say it's time for our viewers to crack each other's heads open and feast on the goo inside?"
17702,92,266,1253000,Professor,Springfield Police Station,"Yes I would, Kent."
17704,92,268,1256000,Otto Mann,Park,"Whoa, I found something!"
17705,92,269,1290000,Chief Wiggum,Park,It's just a piece of paper.
17706,92,270,1290000,Homer Simpson,Park,It's mine!
17707,92,271,1292000,Homer Simpson,Park,"""Frightfully sorry, but there is no hidden treasure. I have already used this time to escape from your jail. Fondest wishes."" Oh, I can't make out this signature."
17708,92,272,1303000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Park,Keep digging. We're bound to find something.
17709,92,273,1307000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Park,Hmmm. I guess we're not gonna find anything.
17710,92,274,1310000,Otto Mann,Park,"Uh, how're we gonna get outta here?"
17711,92,275,1312000,Homer Simpson,Park,We'll dig our way out!
