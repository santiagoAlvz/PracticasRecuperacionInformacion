117541,454,116,508000,Eliza,Grateful Gelding Stables,Why? Because I'm young and I'm a woman?
117542,454,117,510000,Virgil Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,No. Because you're pointing South.

117633,454,212,920000,Colonel Burns,OLD SIMPSON HOUSE,Thatta girl.
117634,454,213,922000,Colonel Burns,OLD SIMPSON HOUSE,Now where's my man?
117635,454,214,924000,Hiram,OLD SIMPSON HOUSE,In the turnip shed. Now what's my surprise?
117636,454,215,926000,Colonel Burns,OLD SIMPSON HOUSE,Your surprise is... a new pair of shoes!
117637,454,216,929000,Hiram,OLD SIMPSON HOUSE,"Oh my God, that surprise is so pleasant!"
117638,454,217,936000,Milford,OLD SIMPSON HOUSE,After that fateful day...
117640,454,219,936000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,"""...I could never even look at Eliza again."" It didn't help that the next day he drank bad well water and went blind."
117613,454,220,947000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,No! You lie! Eliza Simpson can't be a coward! She's the only decent ancestor I have.
117641,454,221,954000,Groundskeeper Willie,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,"Ach! Take it outside, lassie! We've still got three ""Jackie Robinsons"" and a ""Tuskegee Airmen"" to go..."
117642,454,222,961000,Groundskeeper Willie,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,...And so many Obamas!
117643,454,223,963000,Obama Kids,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,Yes we can! / Audacity of hope! / Yes we can! / Let me be clear.
117645,454,225,970000,Librarian,Springfield Library,"As I told you, we just don't have any books pertaining to Eliza Simpson."
117646,454,226,974000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Library,But I need to prove that my ancestor couldn't have backed down to Colonel Burns!
117647,454,227,979000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Library,"Colonel Burns? Why, I haven't heard my father's name in years."
117648,454,228,985000,Librarian,Springfield Library,"You know, you could try our film vault."
117649,454,229,987000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Library,Huh?
117650,454,230,988000,Librarian #2,Springfield Library,We have a film vault?
117651,454,231,990000,Librarian,Springfield Library,It's where we hooked up during the Christmas party.
117652,454,232,993000,Librarian #2,Springfield Library,Ohhh...
117654,454,234,998000,Interviewer,FILM VAULT,"So, Miss Eliza, I understand you just turned one hundred."
117655,454,235,1002000,Eliza,FILM VAULT,It's been quite a life.
117656,454,236,1005000,Interviewer,FILM VAULT,Any regrets?
117657,454,237,1006000,Eliza,FILM VAULT,"Just one. When I was a girl, I witnessed a grave injustice... but I held my tongue. That pat on my head from a wicked man has haunted me to this day."
117658,454,238,1021000,Lisa Simpson,FILM VAULT,There's no noble Simpson.
117660,454,240,1024000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You were right, Dad. I should have quit while I was ahead, instead of learning the horrible truth about our family and Virgil."
117661,454,241,1035000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, don't cry, meat pie. Things worked out pretty well for Virgil in the end."
117662,454,242,1040000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you talking about? Is there something you know about Virgil that you haven't told us?
117663,454,243,1045000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll take that secret to my grave! Or urn, or medical school dissecting table, or wherever you're dumpin' me!"
117664,454,244,1051000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen, Wrinkles! If you know something that'll cheer up my little girl, you'd better spill it. Or I can make things very uncomfortable for you."
117665,454,245,1062000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, I'll talk! D-Day is June 6th! Repeat: June 6th! Allied forces will land on the beaches of Normandy in the following order: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno... are you writing this down, Fritz?"
117666,454,246,1075000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,About Virgil.
117667,454,247,1076000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, right. Well Lisa, Mabel knew her husband well, so she had cooked up a little ""payback pie..."""
117670,454,250,1086000,Mabel,OLD SIMPSON HOUSE,"Get off my property, Colonel Burns! And if I ever see you in these parts again, you're gonna be a Memphis belle."
117671,454,251,1094000,Colonel Burns,OLD SIMPSON HOUSE,"Very well. You may have won this round. But some day my history will be told, by my descendants Ken and Rick Burns."
117672,454,252,1105000,Mabel,OLD SIMPSON HOUSE,I knew you'd break your promise! Now I'm taking Virgil to freedom!
117673,454,253,1109000,Virgil Simpson,OLD SIMPSON HOUSE,"You defied your husband for me? Man, this is the sixties."
117674,454,254,1114000,Mabel,OLD SIMPSON HOUSE,Now let's take you to a place where a black man can blend in: Canada.
117675,454,255,1120000,Grampa Simpson,OLD SIMPSON HOUSE,"So with those words, Mabel and Virgil headed north."
117677,454,257,1120000,Grampa Simpson,Country Road,But their journey was fraught with peril...
117678,454,258,1134000,Virgil Simpson,Country Road,"Mabel, why don't I go on alone, and you go back to Hiram?"
117679,454,259,1137000,Mabel,Country Road,No! There's no life for me with him! I just need to disguise my hair... but how?
117680,454,260,1143000,Abraham Lincoln,Country Road,May I be of assistance?
117681,454,261,1145000,Mabel,Country Road,Abraham Lincoln?!
117682,454,262,1145000,Abraham Lincoln,Country Road,Perhaps this hat will help disguise your hair.
117683,454,263,1150000,Mabel,Country Road,Thank you. How's it look?
117684,454,264,1155000,Abraham Lincoln,Country Road,It makes you look like a potbellied stove.
117686,454,266,1155000,Abraham Lincoln,Country Road,"Hey, hey, ""Honest Abe."" Oh, I'm a riot."
117688,454,268,1162000,Grampa Simpson,Niagara Falls,"As the border drew closer, so did Virgil and Mabel."
117689,454,269,1165000,Virgil Simpson,Niagara Falls,After you.
117690,454,270,1167000,Grampa Simpson,Niagara Falls,"By the time they crossed into Canada, things had changed..."
117692,454,272,1175000,Grampa Simpson,Bridge,...Mabel divorced Hiram...
117694,454,274,1175000,Grampa Simpson,Office,...and got one of his shoes in the settlement...Mabel and Virgil lived out the rest of their days in peace.
117696,454,276,1187000,Grampa Simpson,MODEST SNOW-COVERED HOUSE,"They got married, and since Virgil had no last name, they both took the name Simpson, so that Mabel could keep all her monogrammed table linens."
117698,454,277,1196000,Grampa Simpson,MODEST SNOW-COVERED HOUSE,"And their son, Abraham Simpson, was my great-grandfather."
117700,454,279,1206000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So you're actually descended from Virgil, not Hiram. Are ya happy?"
117701,454,280,1211000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes! I'm thrilled! We've regained our family honor and we're one-sixty-fourth black!
117702,454,281,1218000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,So that's why I'm so cool!
117703,454,282,1221000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's why my jazz is so smooth!
117704,454,283,1223000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And that's why I earn less than my white co-workers!
117705,454,284,1226000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Grampa, why'd you try to keep us from finding this out?"
117706,454,285,1229000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it's hard to explain this to a young person, but people of my generation are... you know..."
117707,454,286,1236000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Racists?
117708,454,287,1236000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it.
117709,454,288,1238000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't know what the big deal is. I mean, it never bothered any of you that my father's French. You know, Bouvier?"
117710,454,289,1245000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,So that's why I love drinking so much.
117711,454,290,1248000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm French, not you."
117712,454,291,1249000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'est la vie, baby."
