71871,283,35,256000,Homer Simpson,FLAMING RUINS OF TROY,Forget it. Sacrificing animals is barbaric. Now have the slaves kill the wounded.
71872,283,37,267000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Mt. Olympus,No sacrifice? We'll teach that mortal to trifle with the gods.
71873,283,38,271000,Dionysus Barney,Mt. Olympus,I got it.

72092,283,257,1181000,Hamlet Bart,KING'S BEDCHAMBER,Someone's behind the curtain. It could be Claudius. Only one way to find out...
72094,283,259,1189000,Hamlet Bart,KING'S BEDCHAMBER,Polonius? What are you doing behind the curtain?
72095,283,260,1193000,Chief Wiggum,KING'S BEDCHAMBER,I hide behind curtains 'cause I have a fear of getting stabbed.
72096,283,261,1197000,Ralph Wiggum,KING'S BEDCHAMBER,Daddy's stomach is crying!
72097,283,262,1199000,Chief Wiggum,KING'S BEDCHAMBER,"Laertes, you gotta do a special big-boy job for daddy. I need you to avenge my death."
