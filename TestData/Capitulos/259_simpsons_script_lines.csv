64592,259,45,236000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Please to note: This is no ordinary comic book. It is in perma-mint condition. If you spill soda on it, the drops fly off harmlessly onto lesser comics."

64636,259,89,452000,Tom Savini,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,That's not a cookie.
64638,259,91,455000,Tom Savini,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,That's a time-release blood pack.

64656,259,108,530000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"My prognosis -- or is it ""diagnosis""? Whichever, you need to avoid stress. What kind of work do you do?"
64657,259,109,538000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield General Hospital,I run a comic book store.
64658,259,110,540000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Oh, dear Lord! We call that profession ""The Widowmaker!"" Or we would, if any of the proprietors were married. You should close down the store for a while."
64659,259,111,549000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield General Hospital,But I'd lose all my business to Frodo's of Shelbyville.
64660,259,112,552000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Well then get a friend to run it for you. You do have friends, don't you?"

64662,259,114,560000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,You should get some friends who aren't printed on paper.
64663,259,115,562000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield General Hospital,You mean action figures?
64664,259,116,564000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield General Hospital,We'll run the store for ya.

64666,259,118,572000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,Calm down. Don't make me put a dog heart in there.
64668,259,120,579000,Milhouse Van Houten,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Can you believe it, Bart? We're actually running a comic book store."
64669,259,121,583000,Bart Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Looks like our lifetime ban just expired.

64684,259,137,653000,Bart Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Less barking, more marking."
64685,259,138,655000,Milhouse Van Houten,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Yes sir, partner."
64687,259,140,661000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Now, when you've got a bum ticker like we do, you need all the friends you can get. And Moe's is the friendliest place in the Rum District."
