138905,534,14,130000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I think I'm gonna throw up the mac and cheese you fed me. I'm not supposed to have it. That's why I had so much.

138948,534,59,392000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm starting to regret saying Yolo."
138949,534,60,392000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, if you don't mind, I'm gonna quit complaining about my life and start wallowing in the past."

138952,534,63,410000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Back in fifth grade, you either had to write to a foreigner or a prisoner. I picked a foreigner because the prisoners wrote back too fast. We'd write each other with our dreams of the future..."
138953,534,64,420000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I was gonna be King of Cheeseburger Mountain. Did I change or did they stop making mountains out of cheeseburgers? Probably a little bit of both.

138963,534,74,474000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Maybe the best way to keep students from cheating is to trust them not to cheat.
138965,534,76,480000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,That's it?! That's all you've got? Something I can read on a tea box?
138966,534,77,484000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What I'm suggesting is we create an honor code.
138967,534,78,488000,Dewey Largo,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh swell, more work for the teachers."
138968,534,79,490000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,The students would do it.

138984,534,95,556000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I thought a visit from your old pen pal would cheer you up."
138985,534,96,561000,Eduardo,Simpson Home,"How eagerly I would wait for a letter from the Estados Unidos, and Homer Simpson."
138986,534,97,569000,10-Year-Old Homer,Simpson Home,"Buenos dias, Eduardo. Can you write back and tell me what that means?"
138987,534,98,569000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What happened to us, Eduardo? We had so many things we were going to do."
138988,534,99,580000,Eduardo,Simpson Home,"And I, my friend, have been doing them!"
138989,534,100,583000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, well listen, pal. I have my treasure: my wife and my children."

138991,534,102,590000,Eduardo,Simpson Home,"I've had eight wives... and two hundred children! Among them artists, doctors and revolutionary chefs."
138992,534,103,596000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Do you have a disrespectful son who calls you by your first name?
138993,534,104,599000,Eduardo,Simpson Home,I cannot imagine such a creature.
138994,534,105,601000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Homer. Did you just fart?"
138995,534,106,603000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Did you just fart, sir."
138996,534,107,605000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Whatever.
138997,534,108,606000,Eduardo,Simpson Home,"Easy, easy, Homer, I want to help you fulfill some of your childhood dreams."
138998,534,109,612000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Really? Now? I have two pizzas coming. I wanted to see who would get here first.
138999,534,110,617000,Eduardo,Simpson Home,"Now, Homer! Get your coat!"
139000,534,111,620000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I asked him here to cheer you up, but I didn't think you'd drop everything to go gallivanting with some, no offense, Spaniard."
139001,534,112,628000,Eduardo,Simpson Home,"I promise you one thing, Madam. When I return your husband, he will be happy, bringing a new sense of adventure to your marriage -- and to the bedroom."
139002,534,113,637000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm not used to strange men saying the word ""bedroom"" around me."
139003,534,114,641000,Eduardo,Simpson Home,"Would you prefer ""sala de amor?"""
139004,534,115,643000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's even worse. Could you say it one more time?
139005,534,116,646000,Eduardo,Simpson Home,Sala de amor.
139006,534,117,647000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Ooh!

139011,534,122,658000,Lisa Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"I know if I can get the toughest kid in class to sign it, the rest of you will sign it. Milhouse?"
139012,534,123,668000,Nelson Muntz,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"He's not the toughest kid, I am!"
139013,534,124,672000,Lisa Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Now, the smartest kid. Milhouse?"
139014,534,125,675000,Martin Prince,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,He's not the smartest kid! I am!

139021,534,132,701000,Eduardo,Homer's Car,"Now, this book of your childhood drawings will come to life."
139022,534,133,706000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Why are you doing this? Wait. Are you in love with me?
139023,534,134,710000,Eduardo,Homer's Car,"In love with the concept of you, yes."
139024,534,135,712000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Woo-hoo! I'm an attractive concept like Liberty!
139025,534,136,722000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,One more ride?

139029,534,141,750000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,How much did this cost to restage?
139030,534,142,753000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,They rented everything from Comic Book Guy for ten bucks.
139031,534,143,757000,Comic Book Guy,Homer's Car,Don't stink up the Gorn head! I need it for a Bar Mitzvah later!
139033,534,145,763000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Now don't forget, this is the first exam under the new honor code."
139034,534,146,768000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Now don't forget, this is the first exam under the new honor code."
139035,534,147,768000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,They're doing it! They're self-proctoring!
139036,534,148,770000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Can't you say anything in a normal way?
139037,534,149,772000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"The answer, sadly, is not yes."
139039,534,151,776000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"I don't know what it is about having all my dreams fulfilled, but I feel great."
139040,534,152,782000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,If you're happy I'm happy.
139041,534,153,785000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,That doesn't sound happy.
139042,534,154,787000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,I feel kind of... melancholy...
139043,534,155,791000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Mmm, melon collie."
139044,534,156,794000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,That's not helping.
139045,534,157,797000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Well, what was your childhood dream?"
139046,534,158,799000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Jumping on the bed. But I never disobeyed my parents, till I married you."
139047,534,159,804000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Let's do it.
139048,534,160,806000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,I'm a little tired. Could we just snuggle again?
139049,534,161,809000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,We do that every night! Come on! Jump on the bed!
139051,534,163,820000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Can I help you, stranger?"
139052,534,164,821000,Eduardo,Simpson Master Bedroom,I am just watching my friend and his wife innocently pleasure themselves in bed.
139053,534,165,826000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Master Bedroom,That sounds salty but you seem sweet. I'm gonna call you kettle corn!
139055,534,167,834000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD TAPAS BAR,Eduardo. I haven't felt this good in years. You're like the Tooth Fairy except you don't collect human bones.

139060,534,172,850000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD TAPAS BAR,"Well, we've gotta do it! I never leave a job unfinished. It's as true now as that week I worked on the high school yearbook. So much infighting. I had to get outta there!"
139061,534,173,860000,Eduardo,SPRINGFIELD TAPAS BAR,"All right, Homer, we shall do this thing."
139062,534,174,863000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD TAPAS BAR,The editor put in like six pictures of this girl 'cause she was his girlfriend.
139063,534,175,868000,Eduardo,SPRINGFIELD TAPAS BAR,Everyone has a bad yearbook story. They spelled my name wrong! Get over it!

139067,534,179,891000,Homer Simpson,SKY ABOVE SPRINGFIELD,"Um, actually, my hero was the actress who provided Rocky's voice, June Foray. A true legend in the voiceover community. I'm just gonna stay on the plane and think about her influence."
139068,534,180,903000,Eduardo,SKY ABOVE SPRINGFIELD,She has lived her life. Now you must live yours.

139073,534,185,932000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I guess I'll be getting some extra credit for this.
139074,534,186,935000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, I'm afraid you've gotten all the extra credit we can give out. So Willie has been growing you a nice pumpkin."
139075,534,187,941000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Here it is, lass. You want me to carve it into a ""Thank-o-lantern?"""
