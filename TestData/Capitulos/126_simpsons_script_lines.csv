26484,126,3,41000,Marge Simpson,GRASSY KNOLL,Aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?
26485,126,4,47000,Homer Simpson,GRASSY KNOLL,They're butchering the classics. Could that bassoon have come in any more late?
26486,126,5,53000,Marge Simpson,GRASSY KNOLL,"Ah, c'mon, Homer, there's lasers. You like lasers."
26487,126,6,57000,Homer Simpson,GRASSY KNOLL,"Laser effects, mirrored balls. John Williams must be rolling around in his grave."
26488,126,7,66000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,GRASSY KNOLL,Devilishishly satirical. I wonder if anyone else got that?
26489,126,8,70000,Homer Simpson,GRASSY KNOLL,We're outta here!
26491,126,10,74000,Homer Simpson,City Street,"Whoa, careful now. These are dangerous streets for us upper-lower-middle-class types... So avoid eye contact, watch your pocketbook and suspect everyone."
26492,126,11,84000,Snake Jailbird,City Street,Three Card Monte.
26493,126,12,85000,Homer Simpson,City Street,Woo hoo! Easy money!
26494,126,13,87000,Marge Simpson,City Street,"Homie, these games are fixed."
26495,126,14,89000,Homer Simpson,City Street,Then how come that guy's winning?
26496,126,15,91000,Shill,City Street,"Whoa, I like totally won again."
26497,126,16,94000,Snake Jailbird,City Street,"Way to go, bro."
26498,126,17,95000,Marge Simpson,City Street,He looks and acts just like the dealer. I think they're related or at least in cahoots.
26471,126,18,100000,Snake Jailbird,City Street,Just pick the red card. It's totally not hard.
26500,126,19,107000,Homer Simpson,City Street,"Twenty on this one, my good man."
26501,126,20,109000,Snake Jailbird,City Street,Sorry dude. Black.
26502,126,21,113000,Marge Simpson,City Street,"Homer, he cheated you."
26503,126,22,117000,Crowd,City Street,Cheater. / Thief. / You're giving Three Card Monte a bad name.
26504,126,23,119000,Snake Jailbird,City Street,Surely you don't blame me.
26505,126,24,121000,Marge Simpson,City Street,"It's people like you who are ruining our downtown promenades and piazzas. How dare you prey on the greedy and stupid, like this."
26506,126,25,129000,Snake Jailbird,City Street,Ba-bye!
26507,126,26,130000,Marge Simpson,City Street,Somebody stop him!

26509,126,28,136000,Homer Simpson,City Street,No Marge!!
26512,126,31,168000,Marge Simpson,Alley,"Uh, I must warn you, um, uh, sometimes ordinary people g-g-get a surge of uh- adrenaline. Wee-aah!"
26513,126,32,178000,Snake Jailbird,Alley,Ugh.
26514,126,33,181000,Marge Simpson,Alley,See?...
26515,126,34,182000,Chief Wiggum,Alley,"Cuff him boys, we're puttin' this dirtbag away."
26516,126,35,185000,Snake Jailbird,Alley,Ha! I'll be back on the streets in twenty four hours.
26517,126,36,189000,Chief Wiggum,Alley,We'll try to make it twelve.
26518,126,37,195000,Homer Simpson,Alley,"Marge, are you okay?"
26519,126,38,197000,Marge Simpson,Alley,"Ah, I think I'm okay. It was scary, but, in a weird way, it was also kind of exhilarating."
26520,126,39,203000,Homer Simpson,Alley,"Yes, it is exhilarating to see the police get their man and save a hysterical woman."
26521,126,40,209000,Marge Simpson,Alley,Oh for crying out loud...
26522,126,41,211000,Homer Simpson,Alley,"Easy now, sweetheart. Homie's here."
26524,126,43,215000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Hey Mom, is this how you caught him?"
26525,126,44,218000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Lisa, please, you're too puny to --"
26527,126,46,224000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Lisa, unhand your brother."
26529,126,48,227000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Yeah, like that really hurt."
26530,126,49,231000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Mom, was catching that guy the most incredibly exciting thing you've ever done?"
26531,126,50,236000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Well, it was pretty exciting, but celery soup's pretty exciting too."
26534,126,53,252000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,"Strange, regular ham doesn't thrill me anymore. I'm crossing over to deviled ham. Whoa!"
26343,126,56,283000,Marge Simpson,GARAGE,Marge!
26535,126,58,285000,News Vendor,Street,"Hey, Mrs. Simpson, I just got the new issue of ""Sponge and Vacuum."""

26544,126,67,321000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"What, what, what, what, what, what, what? This better be about pizza."
26545,126,68,324000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Actually, I'm interested in becoming a police officer."
26546,126,69,342000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Welcome aboard.
26548,126,71,345000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You did what?!!
26550,126,73,347000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"I borrowed your nail clipper, what's the big deal?"
26551,126,74,350000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Nothing. I'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.
26552,126,75,354000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions?
26553,126,76,356000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"You got it, little buddy."
26554,126,77,358000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Marge, you being a cop makes you the man, which makes me the woman. And I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing."
26555,126,78,369000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. You'll always be the man of this house."
26556,126,79,375000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Aw, thanks, honey."
26558,126,81,378000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Academy,"All right, you scrawny beanpoles, becoming a cop is not something that happens overnight... it takes one solid weekend of training to get that badge."
26559,126,82,387000,Psychotic Guy,Springfield Police Academy,Forget about the badge!! When do we get the freakin' guns?!
26560,126,83,391000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Academy,"Hey, I told you, you don't get your gun until you tell me your name."
26561,126,84,395000,Psychotic Guy,Springfield Police Academy,"I've had it up to here with your ""rules."""
26564,126,87,413000,Chief Wiggum,OBSTACLE COURSE,Women always have trouble with the wall. Can't ever seem to find the door.
26566,126,89,435000,Chief Wiggum,SHOOTING RANGE,"You missed the baby, you missed the blind man."
26569,126,92,452000,Chief Wiggum,DRIVING COURSE,"Sorry, Simpson. You'll have to do the course again. I was trying to get this uh, magic eye thing to work. Look at that, heh, a pony."
26571,126,94,466000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey everybody, Mom's home."
26573,126,96,472000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"They didn't have my size shirt, but you get the idea."
26575,126,98,480000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Wow, Mom, I never pictured you as any kind of authority figure before."
26576,126,99,485000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there. You've become very dear to me."
26577,126,100,491000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh, Homie, of course I will."
26578,126,101,492000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Mom, if someone shot at the mayor, would you have to throw yourself in front of him and take the bullet?"
26579,126,102,497000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I suppose I would.
26580,126,103,498000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,What if they shot at a coke machine?
26581,126,104,500000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,No.
26582,126,105,501000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,TV?
26583,126,106,501000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,No.
26584,126,107,502000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,TV with a picture of the mayor on it?
26585,126,108,503000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Whatever you do, mom, we'll be proud of you."
26586,126,109,506000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Well, thank you, honey."
26587,126,110,507000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,As long as it's constitutional.
26589,126,112,511000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Homer, give me my pepper spray."
26590,126,113,513000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh Marge, one squirt and you're south of the border."
26591,126,114,517000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Mmm. Incapacitating.
26593,126,116,526000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"All right, settle people. People settle. People. Wood and Van Zuylen, stake out Donutland. When they fry up a fresh batch, call it in. Keneally and Erhart, back 'em up."
26594,126,117,536000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Fitz and Garcia, it's your turn to sleep in."
26595,126,118,541000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"And Simpson, seeing how this is your first day, you're inexperienced and vulnerable, your beat is Junkyville and Bumtown."
26597,126,120,556000,Marge Simpson,Street,"Hello, Mr. Hutz."
26599,126,121,557000,Lionel Hutz,Street,"I'll have you know the contents of that dumpster are private. you stick your nose in, you'll be violating attorney/dumpster confidentiality."
26600,126,122,565000,Marge Simpson,Street,I just wanted to say hello.
26601,126,123,566000,Lionel Hutz,Street,Oh... hello .
26603,126,125,580000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"So, you are the new cop on the beat. Okay, I know the drill. What will it be? One hundred? Two hundred?"
26604,126,126,586000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Two hundred. No! No! I mean, I mean nothing. I don't take bribes."
26605,126,127,590000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Yes. Of course you don't. I will just leave this money on the table with my unseeing back to the money on the table.
26606,126,128,598000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Apu, no."
26607,126,129,603000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,That's better.
26609,126,131,612000,Marge Simpson,House,I got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address.
26610,126,132,616000,Seymour Skinner,House,"Yes, indeed there is. There's an inflatable bath pillow that mother and I both enjoy. She claimed it was her day to use it. I maintain she was mistaken. We quarreled. Later, as I prepared to bathe, I noticed to my horror, that ""someone"" had slashed the pillow."
26611,126,133,632000,Marge Simpson,House,Um-hmmm. Who called the police?
26612,126,134,634000,Agnes Skinner,House,We both did.
26613,126,135,634000,Marge Simpson,House,"Look, why don't you two settle down. I'm sure you can get another pillow."
26614,126,136,639000,Seymour Skinner,House,"Well, I could send it back to Taiwan for repair, but why should I have to? I've done nothing wrong. And I don't give permission for my face to be on TV. I want it blurred."
26616,126,138,649000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, Mom, what are you gonna do with your day off?"
26617,126,139,653000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I just want to relax and forget that I'm part of that thin blue line which stands between civilization and chaos .
26618,126,140,662000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, it's illegal for you to operate that class nine vehicle without pads and a helmet."
26619,126,141,668000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But Mom--
26620,126,142,669000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's for your own safety.
26622,126,144,672000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Street,"Take that, safety boy."
26623,126,145,674000,Jimbo Jones,Street,This padding's so easy on the knuckles. I could punch all day.
26624,126,146,682000,Bart Simpson,Street,Ugh!
26626,126,148,682000,Maude Flanders,Beauty Parlor,"I just hope they have ""Us"" magazine in heaven."
26627,126,149,684000,Agnes Skinner,Beauty Parlor,He said it was his day to use the tub pillow.
26628,126,150,687000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Beauty Parlor,"I can't go to the library anymore, everybody stinks."
26629,126,151,694000,Marge Simpson,Beauty Parlor,"Don't stop talking on account of me. I may be a cop, but I'm still your friend."
26630,126,152,700000,Marge Simpson,Beauty Parlor,"So, how are you, Mrs. Krabappel?"
26631,126,153,702000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Beauty Parlor,Law abiding. I'm done.
26632,126,154,707000,Marge Simpson,Beauty Parlor,"Moe, I've never seen you here before."
26633,126,155,710000,Moe Szyslak,Beauty Parlor,"These days my roots don't stay so chestnut on their own, Officer Simpson."
26634,126,156,716000,Marge Simpson,Beauty Parlor,"You don't have to call me ""Officer."" I'm not on duty here."
26635,126,157,719000,Hairdresser,Beauty Parlor,Finished.
26636,126,158,723000,Marge Simpson,Beauty Parlor,Whoa!
26638,126,160,724000,Marge Simpson,Beauty Parlor,"Oh. Uh, a looks nice. It's a, it's a good length for you."
26640,126,162,734000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,"Mom's police tape isn't a toy, Dad."
26641,126,163,737000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Shush, dear, you'll wreck Daddy's fun."
26642,126,164,741000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... Oh my Lord!! Something horrible has happened!"
26643,126,165,752000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,". Fooled you Flanders. Made you think your family was dead. Didja get it? They're not, though."
26644,126,166,762000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Oh.
26645,126,167,763000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,But you thought they were.
26646,126,168,765000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Yeah.
26647,126,169,767000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,That's why it was so funny. But they're not.
26648,126,170,770000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,That's a good one.
26650,126,172,772000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"And that's the drunk tank, and this is mommy's desk."
26651,126,173,776000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Mom, I know your intentions are good, but aren't the police a protective force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy elites? Don't you think we ought to attack the roots of social problems instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons?"
26652,126,174,787000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Look, Lisa. It's McGriff the Crime Dog."
26653,126,175,792000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Hello, Lisa. Help me bite crime. Ruff, ruff."
26655,126,177,799000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Kitchen,"Hey, great news, guys. I picked up a nudie deck for our game."
26656,126,178,803000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"""The Girls of the Internet."" Ooh, I'd go on line with them any day."
26657,126,179,810000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh, hey, hey, we've offended Herman."
26658,126,180,812000,Herman Hermann,Simpson Kitchen,"No, I'm just goin' out for some fresh air."
26659,126,181,815000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Kitchen,"That guy sure likes his fresh air. None of that for me. Oh, yeah! Yeah!"
26660,126,182,824000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Kitchen,"Hey, Homer, you sure it's okay to smoke Cuban cigars and gamble here now that your uh, wife's a cop?"
26661,126,183,829000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Are you kidding? Being a cop-husband is one mighty sweet deal: this police radio entertains me with other peoples' miseries; we get a free funeral for Marge, God forbid; and I can run background checks on whomever I want Mohammar--"
26662,126,184,844000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Kitchen,"Homer, please, please, ix-nay on the ohammar-may."
26663,126,185,848000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Hey, hurry it up with the cards, Lenny. I've got you clocked at two miles per hour."
26664,126,186,853000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Kitchen,"C'mon, put that away. Those radar guns give you cancer."
26665,126,187,855000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"All the more reason to hurry up. Hey, what could be going a hundred miles per --"
26666,126,188,862000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Illegal gambling in my house?!
26667,126,189,865000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Kitchen,"Yo-your house?! Your house? Gee, it's so glamorously decorated I thought I was in Vegas. Hey you guys lied to me! You said it was Vegas!"
26668,126,190,874000,Players,Simpson Kitchen,"We'll be goin'... / We'll just be goin'... / We don't want no trouble, officer..."
26669,126,191,877000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Marge, you chased away all my poker buddies."
26670,126,192,880000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I didn't mean to.
26671,126,193,882000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh, you've become such a cop! And, not that long ago, you were so much more to me - you were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs."
26672,126,194,891000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"I'm still all those things. Only now I'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric, and unplugging the clogs of our legal system."
26673,126,195,900000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,You're cooking what for dinner?
26675,126,197,905000,Marge Simpson,Street,"Everywhere I look, someone is breaking the law. Dog, no leash. Man littering. Horse not wearing diaper. Car parked across three handicapped spaces..."
26676,126,198,919000,Marge Simpson,Street,Homer!
26677,126,199,920000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Hey, Marge. How's my little piglet?"
26678,126,200,923000,Marge Simpson,Street,"Homer, I'm on duty."
26679,126,201,924000,Homer Simpson,Street,"That's okay. I'm supposed to be workin', too."
26680,126,202,927000,Marge Simpson,Street,You have to move your car.
26681,126,203,929000,Homer Simpson,Street,"I'll just be a second, Marge. I'm going to get some beer for those kids over there."
26682,126,204,935000,Marge Simpson,Street,"I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that, but you have to move your car now."
26683,126,205,939000,Homer Simpson,Street,I'll be right back. Now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.
26684,126,206,943000,Marge Simpson,Street,"Oh, that's it. I'm gonna write you a ticket."
26685,126,207,945000,Homer Simpson,Street,"C'mon, we're family."
26686,126,208,947000,Marge Simpson,Street,You're breaking the law.
26687,126,209,948000,Homer Simpson,Street,"I'll make you a deal. You rip up that ticket, and I'll give you back your hat. Wuh, wuh, wuh! Hee, hee-hee!"
26688,126,210,958000,Marge Simpson,Street,"Homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense."
26689,126,211,962000,Homer Simpson,Street,"What're you gonna do about it? What're you gonna do? Ooh, I'm Officer Marge, I'm gonna arrest you! Whoa! etc."
26690,126,212,970000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Whuh! Marge, not here. Hey, you're not really arresting me...?"
26691,126,213,974000,Marge Simpson,Street,You have the right to remain silent...
26692,126,214,977000,Homer Simpson,Street,I choose to waive that right.
26695,126,217,988000,Chief Wiggum,Jail,"All right, Simpson, you're free to go."
26696,126,218,990000,Homer Simpson,Jail,Lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.
26697,126,219,996000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Jail,"All right, Hans. Time to go."
26698,126,220,999000,Hans Moleman,Jail,"But, he ate my last meal."
26699,126,221,1000000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Jail,"Well, if that's the worst thing that happens to you today, consider yourself lucky."
26700,126,222,1005000,Hans Moleman,Jail,Are you really allowed to execute people in a local jail?
26701,126,223,1008000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Jail,"From this point on, no talking."
26703,126,225,1014000,Marge Simpson,Bedroom,"I'm sorry I had to arrest you, Homer. But what I did was right. Someday, when you really need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there."
26704,126,226,1023000,Homer Simpson,Bedroom,"I have nothing more to say to you, Marge. I'm drawing a line down the center of the house à la ""I Love Lucy"" -- you stay on your side and I'll stay on my side."
26707,126,229,1033000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Boy, when Marge first told me she was going to the Police Academy, I thought it'd be fun and exciting, you know, like that movie, ""Spaceballs."" But instead, it's been painful and disturbing, like that movie ""Police Academy."""
26708,126,230,1046000,Barney Gumble,KITCHEN,"Hey, Homer, I'm worried about the beer supply. After this case and the other case, there's only one case left."
26709,126,231,1053000,Barney Gumble,KITCHEN,"Yeah, yeah, Barney's right. / Yeah. / Let's get some more beer. / Hey what about some beer? / Yeah, Barney's right!"
26710,126,232,1060000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"All right guys, pipe down. I've got some more in the garage."
26711,126,233,1064000,Herman Hermann,KITCHEN,"I'll, I'll-I'll get it, Homer."
26712,126,234,1067000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,Hmm... I wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage.
26713,126,235,1070000,Moe Szyslak,KITCHEN,"""Garage?"" Hey fellas - ""the garage"". Ooo la de da, Mr. Frenchman."
26714,126,236,1076000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Well, what do you call it?"
26715,126,237,1077000,Moe Szyslak,KITCHEN,A car-hole.
26717,126,239,1083000,Sinister Man,GARAGE,"You're late, Herman."
26718,126,240,1084000,Herman Hermann,GARAGE,"Surely you don't mind waiting for merchandise of this quality, Mr. Jericho."
26719,126,241,1089000,Sinister Man,GARAGE,"Ah, looks like good stuff. But, of course, I'll have to sample it first."
26720,126,242,1094000,Sinister Man,GARAGE,"Well, these are fabulous."
26721,126,243,1095000,Herman Hermann,GARAGE,"Yeah, who would suspect that they're... counterfeit jeans."
26722,126,244,1101000,Sinister Man,GARAGE,And what better place to make the buy than in a cop's garage where no one would suspect a thing.
26723,126,245,1114000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,"Hey Herman, I had to come out here to see what's so funny - A counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole! I'm gonna tell everyone! Wait here."
26724,126,246,1122000,Herman Hermann,GARAGE,Not so fast.
26725,126,247,1124000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,Okay.
26726,126,248,1126000,Herman Hermann,GARAGE,Maybe you should just stop entirely.
26727,126,249,1130000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,"Herman, how could you? We've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? Hard working designers, like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt, or Antoine Bugle Boy. These are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, ""me too."""
26728,126,250,1143000,Herman Hermann,GARAGE,"Advance on him, men."
26729,126,251,1150000,Marge Simpson,GARAGE,I don't think that's a very good idea.
26730,126,252,1153000,Henchman,GARAGE,"Oh, no. It's Gloria Vanderbilt out for revenge!"
26731,126,253,1156000,Marge Simpson,GARAGE,"No, it's Officer Simpson - of the police!"
26732,126,254,1165000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,"Herman, your beef is with me. Leave the girl out of this."
26733,126,255,1169000,Herman Hermann,GARAGE,Okay.
26734,126,256,1170000,Marge Simpson,GARAGE,Homer!
26735,126,257,1172000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,"It's too late for me, Marge! Sell the jeans and live like a queen."
26598,126,259,1178000,Milhouse Van Houten,Backyard,Is Bart home?
26737,126,260,1180000,Grampa Simpson,Backyard,Just taking Maggie for a stroll.
26738,126,261,1186000,Ned Flanders,Backyard,"Well, I guess I am putting up the Halloweenie decorations a little early. Criticism accepted."
26740,126,263,1193000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,Marge!
26741,126,264,1196000,Lisa Simpson,Backyard,"Bust 'im, Mom! / Get 'im, Mom! / Nail 'im! / You can do it!"
26742,126,265,1196000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,Go back to bed! Don't make me come up there!
26744,126,267,1207000,Herman Hermann,Bart's Treehouse,Looks like your wife is embarking up the wrong tree.
26745,126,268,1215000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Freeze!
26746,126,269,1216000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Freeze! Every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house.
26747,126,270,1220000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Oh, Marge. You saved my life! I'm sorry I teased you. You're a really good cop. I'm proud of you."
26748,126,271,1231000,Herman Hermann,Bart's Treehouse,"So long, gotta catch the 501."
26749,126,272,1233000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"He's gettin' away! You blew it, Marge!"
26750,126,273,1235000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I don't think so.
26751,126,274,1238000,Herman Hermann,Bart's Treehouse,Oh! Foiled by my own shoddy merchandise. Gee!
26753,126,276,1241000,Grampa Simpson,Backyard,That's my ambulance! I called for it four hours ago.
26754,126,277,1243000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Marge, how did you know..."
26755,126,278,1245000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,That the pants would rip?...
26756,126,279,1246000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"No, what I was wondering is..."
26757,126,280,1247000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,"Years of buying pants for two active children and a full-seated husband has given me a sixth sense for shoddy stitching, which these jeans have in spades."
26758,126,281,1254000,Chief Wiggum,Backyard,"That's some nice work, Simpson. But um, we can't hold him, there's no evidence."
26759,126,282,1259000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans."
26760,126,283,1261000,Chief Wiggum,Backyard,"Ah, they've uh, mysteriously, uh, disappeared."
26761,126,284,1265000,Chief Wiggum,Backyard,"Looking good, boys."
26762,126,285,1267000,Marge Simpson,Backyard,That's it! There's too much corruption on this force. I quit!
26763,126,286,1282000,Chief Wiggum,Backyard,"Sorry to lose you, Simpson."
26765,126,288,1287000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,I don't think they're comin' back.
26766,126,289,1289000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Well, that does it. That does it! I'm lookin' at his cards."
26767,126,290,1291000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Aw crap. I fold.
