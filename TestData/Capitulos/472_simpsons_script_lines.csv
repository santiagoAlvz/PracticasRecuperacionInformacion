122319,472,11,51000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Next you'll have a problem with my gingerbread house.
122320,472,12,54000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean your gingerbread McMansion.
122321,472,13,59000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, show some respect. Three gingerbread workmen died making that."
122322,472,14,64000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, but this leg's gonna have to go."
122323,472,15,69000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're gonna be okay.

122328,472,20,84000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yep. Come midnight, I'll be sittin' here with cold cookies, warm milk, and hot lead."

122330,472,22,90000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"For the last three years, I've asked that rosy-cheeked nog-hog for a dirt bike. And all he brought me was a zillion lame-o toys that I immediately broke and threw in this bag."
122331,472,23,102000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But you wanted those toys.
122332,472,24,105000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I wanted them till I got them! But this year I'm gettin' my dirt bike.

122350,472,43,200000,Moe Szyslak,TRAIN PLATFORM,You start in the wrapping room! That'll take you right down.
122351,472,44,205000,Moe Szyslak,TRAIN PLATFORM,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doin'? That leads to the daycare center. You take the freight elevator."
122353,472,46,220000,Bart Simpson,WRAPPING ROOM,Isn't this the busy season? Where is everybody?
122354,472,47,225000,Milhouse Van Houten,WRAPPING ROOM,Laid off.
122355,472,48,226000,Nelson Muntz,WRAPPING ROOM,"After NAFTA, a lot of these jobs went to the South Pole."
122356,472,49,230000,Bart Simpson,WRAPPING ROOM,"Well, who needs wrapping paper anyway? Just stick a bow on the toy and you're ready to go."
122357,472,50,234000,Bart Simpson,WRAPPING ROOM,"Bow, bow, bow, bow, bing, bang, boom!"

122363,472,56,267000,Moe Szyslak,TOY INSPECTION AREA,"Kid, you got a lot of shoddy, money-saving ideas. Like a major airline but you were here on time. Come with me."
122365,472,58,283000,Lisa Simpson,CLAUSCO BUILDING,So you're the brown nosed reindeer that's jingled all the way to the top.
122366,472,59,287000,Bart Simpson,CLAUSCO BUILDING,Just point me to Santa.
122367,472,60,288000,Lisa Simpson,CLAUSCO BUILDING,"Oh, I know what you're after. The toy you never got."
122368,472,61,292000,Bart Simpson,CLAUSCO BUILDING,You're outta your elfin mind!
122369,472,62,294000,Lisa Simpson,CLAUSCO BUILDING,"Oh really? Well let me ask you this, how many kids bring a gun to meet Santa?"
122370,472,63,300000,Bart Simpson,CLAUSCO BUILDING,Okay. You got me. But I'm gettin' my dirt bike -- and you can't stop me.
122371,472,64,304000,Lisa Simpson,CLAUSCO BUILDING,Security!
122373,472,66,321000,Bart Simpson,CLAUSCO BUILDING,"No disrespect, fat man, but you'd better poop out a dirt bike."
122374,472,67,326000,Santa Claus,CLAUSCO BUILDING,"Close the door, boy. I can't afford to heat the whole North Pole."
122376,472,68,334000,Bart Simpson,CLAUSCO BUILDING,"Listen here, Kringle. I may have been naughty this year. But by today's standards, naughty's nothing. I didn't get anybody pregnant, I didn't Facebook a kid to death... make with my dirt bike!"
122377,472,69,343000,Santa Claus,CLAUSCO BUILDING,Kid... this company's bust. For years I've been giving out free toys and gettin' cookies in return. It's not a sustainable business model.
122378,472,70,352000,Bart Simpson,CLAUSCO BUILDING,"Oh c'mon, man. Things aren't that bad."
122379,472,71,355000,Santa Claus,CLAUSCO BUILDING,They're pretty bad. I'm eating my own reindeer here!
122380,472,72,359000,Bart Simpson,CLAUSCO BUILDING,You win.

122382,472,74,364000,Santa Claus,CLAUSCO BUILDING,You go home now. And maybe there'll be a nice pair of work socks under your tree.
122383,472,75,370000,Bart Simpson,CLAUSCO BUILDING,You don't have to do that. I have socks. I'll give you socks!
122384,472,76,374000,Santa Claus,CLAUSCO BUILDING,"Thanks, kid. Now you'd better head home. I'm sure in the twenty-five years of Earth time you've been gone, your parents have gotten worried."
122385,472,77,383000,Santa Claus,CLAUSCO BUILDING,Kids never change. Always dumb as potatoes.
122386,472,78,406000,Chief Wiggum,CLAUSCO BUILDING,Pull over!
122388,472,80,408000,Otto Mann,Train,"Hey kid, you ever wanted a train for Christmas? This one's yours!"
122390,472,82,423000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why can't they leave a poor tree in the woods where it belongs?
122391,472,83,428000,Bing Crosby,Simpson Home,I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS...
122393,472,85,432000,Bing Crosby,1940S VERSION OF SIMPSON HOUSE,"IF ONLY IN MY DREAMS... Hey, hey, that song goes out to all the G.I.s overseas and the folks missing 'em here at home. Brought to you by Chesterton cigarettes. Chesterton. They feel like me, singin' in your throat."
122394,472,86,450000,Lisa Simpson,1940S VERSION OF SIMPSON HOUSE,Can it really be Christmas when one of our parents is facing the German army?
122396,472,88,454000,Gruff Sergeant,ARDENNES FOREST,Simpson! Get your helmet on!
122397,472,89,454000,Marge Simpson,ARDENNES FOREST,I'm trying! It just keeps popping off.
122399,472,91,464000,Marge Simpson,ARDENNES FOREST,"You can make it through this, Marge. Just think of Homer."
122401,472,93,474000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Aircraft Plant,"Hey, Simpson! How come you ain't in combat like a real man?!"
122402,472,94,479000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Aircraft Plant,I'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.
122404,472,97,484000,Homer Simpson,1940S VERSION OF SIMPSON HOUSE,"Kids, remember when I promised to feed us from that victory garden? Well, instead I grew this tree!"
122405,472,98,489000,Lisa Simpson,1940S VERSION OF SIMPSON HOUSE,Don't dare bring that thing in here!
122406,472,99,492000,Homer Simpson,1940S VERSION OF SIMPSON HOUSE,You don't want a Christmas tree? That's crazy! Next you won't want a Christmas ham.
122407,472,100,497000,Lisa Simpson,1940S VERSION OF SIMPSON HOUSE,Don't worry about that. I love meat and I always will.
122408,472,101,501000,Lisa Simpson,1940S VERSION OF SIMPSON HOUSE,"Mmm-mm, that is some sweet pig meat. But as for Christmas trees... I used to love them -- until last year, when I went tree shopping with Mom..."
122410,472,103,512000,Marge Simpson,1943 SPRINGFIELD,"This tree reminds me of your father. It's round in the middle, thinning on top, and your hands get sticky when you touch it."
122411,472,104,520000,Selma Bouvier,1943 SPRINGFIELD,"Simpson, you're shipping out tonight!"
122412,472,105,522000,Marge Simpson,1943 SPRINGFIELD,Right before Christmas?
122413,472,106,523000,Patty Bouvier,1943 SPRINGFIELD,Hitler doesn't take a holiday!
122414,472,107,526000,Selma Bouvier,1943 SPRINGFIELD,"Well he does, but he doesn't tell people till the last minute so they can't make plans."
122415,472,108,530000,Patty Bouvier,1943 SPRINGFIELD,Bastard.
122416,472,109,532000,Marge Simpson,1943 SPRINGFIELD,But I...
122418,472,111,538000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So I never want to see another Christmas tree... until Mom comes back, safe and sound."
122419,472,112,546000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetie, if your mother was in trouble, they'd tell us as soon as they could."
122420,472,113,550000,Western Union Boy,Simpson Home,Telegram!
122422,472,115,555000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge is Mia? Oh my God, she changed her name?"
122423,472,116,561000,Western Union Boy,Simpson Home,"No, that says she's missing in action."
122425,472,118,565000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"See? Every time we get a tree, Mom disappears!"
122426,472,119,571000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why couldn't it have been me?
122427,472,120,571000,Western Union Boy,Simpson Home,It still could be. You just have to go down to the recruiting station and--
122428,472,121,576000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Shut up.
122431,472,124,592000,Lisa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Oh no! This is where they took Mom from me!
122433,472,126,599000,Tree Salesman,Evergreen Terrace,I've been waiting for you.
122434,472,127,603000,Tree Salesman,Evergreen Terrace,"Your mom paid for this tree last year, but never took it. I've watered it, kept it fresh, and every time I look at this blue spruce, it reminds me of your good old mom."
122435,472,128,613000,Tree Salesman,Evergreen Terrace,Here. Let me trim it for you.
122436,472,129,617000,Tree Salesman,Evergreen Terrace,"And uh, decorate it a little."
122437,472,130,621000,Lisa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,It's a sign. Mom's okay! Thank you.
122438,472,131,627000,Tree Salesman,Evergreen Terrace,Yeah. My only sale all year and it's not even a sale.
122439,472,132,631000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Whose turn is it to cry?
122440,472,133,633000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Yours.

122443,472,136,641000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Look at that picture!
122445,472,138,647000,Grampa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Oh, for cryin' out loud."
122448,472,141,652000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Huh? I thought you said you didn't want a tree.
122449,472,142,655000,Lisa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Yes, but then I learned that there's always hope. Someday this war will be over. Someday our Mom will be back."
122450,472,143,663000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Someday TV will be invented, and it will be free. Then it will cost money."
122451,472,144,668000,Lisa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"But until then this tree will stand for everything Mom believes in: home, family and constantly sweeping up needles."
122452,472,145,675000,Lisa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"O TANNENBAUM, O TANNENBAUM..."
122453,472,146,679000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,...WIE TREU SIND DEINE BLÄTTER!

122458,472,151,715000,Hamlet,Movie Theater,I pooped my tights.
122459,472,152,744000,Hitler,Movie Theater,Nein! Nein! Why did I go to the nine o'clock show?

122461,472,154,756000,Marge Simpson,Movie Theater,Auf Wiedersehen.
122462,472,155,760000,Lisa Simpson,Movie Theater,This is the last time I bring these two to bed at the same time.
122464,472,157,769000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I've always believed in you even when others didn't. Can you help save our family Christmas? Marge Simpson.
122467,472,161,803000,Martha Stewart,House,"Marge Simpson, I'm on my way!"
122469,472,163,812000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,"Wake up, Marge! Magical memories don't make themselves!"
122470,472,164,815000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Martha Stewart! How did you get in here?!
122471,472,165,819000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,A picket fence stood on its end makes a sturdy and attractive ladder.
122474,472,168,822000,Martha Stewart,Marge's Bedroom,Now let's make that bed.
122475,472,169,833000,Martha Stewart,Marge's Bedroom,A smattering of pinecones...
122476,472,170,836000,Martha Stewart,Marge's Bedroom,"And with a little bit of work, this wedding dress can make a great dust ruffle!"
122477,472,171,840000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Bedroom,But I was gonna-- Oooh!
122479,472,173,846000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, this stuff will just shampoo out, huh?"
122480,472,174,849000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,Why would you want to shampoo it out?
122481,472,175,853000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Me and Milhouse had a snowball fight, then an ice-ball fight, then a fight-fight!"
122482,472,176,858000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,You boys want to play soldier?
122483,472,177,860000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't think of a better way to spend Jesus' birthday.
122484,472,178,869000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I'm not sure I like where this is going.
122485,472,179,873000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,Well I'm not sure anyone asked your opinion.
122487,472,181,887000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,Squeeze your shoulder blades together!
122488,472,182,890000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,"Now march -- and after an hour you can relax with some hand-shaved hot cocoa and a trial subscription to ""Martha Stewart Living."""
122490,472,184,902000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,And out!
122491,472,185,902000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ms. Stewart, I made a star for the tree out of discarded water bottles!"
122492,472,186,907000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,"Lovely, dear. Except I would've soaked the labels off with warm water. Then I would've melted the plastic down in a double-boiler, and poured it into a candy mold. And finally, I wouldn't have presented it quite so proudly."
122493,472,187,918000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll go outside and make snow angels.
122494,472,188,920000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,Lie face down and your beautiful smile will be molded into the snow!
122495,472,189,924000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay.
122496,472,190,936000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,Now this... is a challenge.
122498,472,191,947000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,There: a slumbering hubby is now a traditional Christmas tableau. Copyright Martha Stewart.
122500,472,193,956000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He's starting to wake up.
122501,472,194,957000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,"A little of my ""Hubby's Holiday Helper"" will calm him right down."
122503,472,196,963000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Marge. It's a good thing."
122505,472,198,965000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,"There, there..."
122507,472,200,967000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,Shh...
122509,472,202,972000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Martha, the house looks beautiful -- it's like Christmas with a childless gay couple. But it's just not the same without my family being themselves."
122510,472,203,980000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,"Well, thanks for wasting my time. I'll just wave my magic wand and turn everything back the way it was!"
122511,472,204,986000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You have a magic wand?
122512,472,205,988000,Martha Stewart,Simpson Home,"Yes, I made it myself. Take an old car antenna, marinate it overnight in the tears of a heartbroken leprechaun, bake at 350 till a rainbow shoots out of the oven, and there you go."
122513,472,206,999000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess I'll never have a perfect Christmas.
