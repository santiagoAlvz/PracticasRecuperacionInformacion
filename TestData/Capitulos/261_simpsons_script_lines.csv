65191,261,23,161000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"The answer is ""bonbon""!"
65192,261,24,162000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Living Room,"Ahh, I'm gonna say ""bonbon."""

65197,261,29,181000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Living Room,"Well... Gee, I really do love currency... but, um, I think I'm gonna play it safe and stick with what I got."
65198,261,30,187000,Game Show Host,Simpson Living Room,You're the boss.
65199,261,31,187000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Living Room,"Yes, I am."

65203,261,35,196000,Male Executive,Krustylu Studios,"Well, fad or not, it's here to stay."
65204,261,36,197000,Female Executive,Krustylu Studios,And it's killing your show in the ratings.
65205,261,37,199000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Hey, whaddaya want from me? I do a kid show!"

65212,261,44,220000,Male Executive,Krustylu Studios,Did that exit work for you?
65213,261,45,221000,Female Executive,Krustylu Studios,I'd like to see it without the scream.
65214,261,46,223000,Male Executive,Krustylu Studios,I was just thinking that.
65216,261,48,228000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Hey, hey, kids. Let's hear it for Madame Mimi and her Cheese-Seeking Poodles!"
65217,261,49,230000,Kids,Krustylu Studios,Yayyy!
65218,261,50,236000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,We'll be back with a sketch set in the craaaziest place -- a restaurant!
65219,261,51,245000,Stage Manager,Krustylu Studios,Aaand roll commercial.
65220,261,52,246000,Female Executive,Krustylu Studios,Krusty? Yeah. Quick thought about this restaurant set.
65221,261,53,249000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,Whuh?
65222,261,54,250000,Female Executive,Krustylu Studios,Could it look more like a diner?
65223,261,55,252000,Male Executive,Krustylu Studios,Ooo! The Seinfeld diner!
65224,261,56,253000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,Are you nuts? I'm on in five seconds.
65225,261,57,255000,Male Executive,Krustylu Studios,'Cause the great thing about Seinfeld was the--
65226,261,58,257000,Stage Manager,Krustylu Studios,"You're on, Krusty."
65227,261,59,260000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Ah... Nothing like a meal in a fine restaurant. Ah, here comes the waitress."
65228,261,60,268000,Female Executive,Krustylu Studios,We're losing male teens. Can you get jiggy with something?
65229,261,61,271000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,You're givin' me notes while I'm on the air?! That tears it!
65230,261,62,275000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Folks, I've been in show biz for 61 years, but now these jerks have sucked all the fun out. I don't need twelve suits tellin' me which way to pee..."
65231,261,63,285000,Male Executive,Krustylu Studios,"Uh, for ""pee"" could you substitute ""whiz""?"
65232,261,64,287000,Female Executive,Krustylu Studios,"I... don't know. That could upset the ""Cheez Whiz"" people."
65233,261,65,290000,Male Executive,Krustylu Studios,I was just thinking that.
65234,261,66,291000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"I can't take it anymore! Folks, don't miss this Friday's show. It'll be my last."
65236,261,68,299000,Male Executive,Krustylu Studios,"Quitting showbiz -- yeah, I know I like the area, but where does it go?"
65237,261,69,303000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,Get away from me!
65238,261,70,304000,Male Executive,Krustylu Studios,Wait!

65241,261,73,310000,Krusty the Clown,Stage,"Get off, damn you! Ah!"
65242,261,74,312000,Male Executive,Stage,You can kill me but two more will take my plaaace!
65244,261,76,320000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,I can't believe Krusty's retiring. This is tragic!
65245,261,77,324000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,A world without Krusty -- what would that be like?
65246,261,78,330000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,What's on TV?
65247,261,79,331000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,Nutsy the clown.
65248,261,80,332000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
65249,261,81,337000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Well, I think it's good for a show to go off the air before it becomes stale and repetitive."
65250,261,82,342000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Dining Room,Maggie shot Mr. Burns again!
65252,261,84,350000,Kent Brockman,TV Studio,Krusty the Clown's retirement has provoked an outpouring of anguish not seen since the small plane crash that killed the Banana Splits. We now go live to Krustylu Studios.
65253,261,85,363000,Kent Brockman,TV Studio,"What's the mood there, Chief Clancy Wiggum?"
65254,261,86,365000,Chief Wiggum,TV Studio,"These kids are gettin' a little out of hand, Kent, so we're gonna have to fire the time-out gas."
65255,261,87,373000,Chief Wiggum,TV Studio,"Hey Kent, are you guys still having that contest where we guess what city the weather girl's in?"
65256,261,88,378000,Kent Brockman,TV Studio,That was eight years ago.
65257,261,89,380000,Chief Wiggum,TV Studio,Is it Pittsburgh?
65258,261,90,381000,Kent Brockman,TV Studio,I spoke to Krusty about his legacy of laughter.
65259,261,91,385000,Krusty the Clown,TV Studio,"Kent, the young people today, they think comedy is dirty words. It's not. It's words that sound dirty. Like mukluk."
65261,261,93,396000,Krusty the Clown,TV Studio,Mukluk. You like that? No charge. Mukluk.
65263,261,95,401000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,Mukluk.
65265,261,97,402000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,"Oh, can it, you tiresome tot-sitter. I was the risible one in our dyad."
65266,261,98,406000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,Ever watch the old episodes?
65267,261,99,408000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,"Ohh, Kent, that's a sad story."
65268,261,100,410000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,"I taped over all my old episodes. Well, you know, I had a thing for Judge Judy, and blank tape was 3.99. What would you do?"
65269,261,101,420000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,Those are my shows!
65270,261,102,423000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,"Frankly Kent, those episodes were no big loss. The show didn't really get funny until we fired Sideshow Bob and hired Who'sits."
65271,261,103,431000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,You've erased my past. Now I'll erase your future.
65272,261,104,438000,Guard,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,"Hey, hey, lights out!"
65273,261,105,439000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,"Oh, honestly. At Chino they get to stay up till nine."
65274,261,106,443000,Guard,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,"Now Bob, I've talked to the warden at Chino, and that's just not true."
65277,261,109,451000,Sideshow Bob,Courtroom,"Your Honor, my incarceration is cruel and unusual punishment. First, my prison-issued shower sandals are grossly undersized."
65279,261,110,459000,Sideshow Bob,Courtroom,"Secondly, the prison book club consists mainly of prisoners who club me with books."
65280,261,111,466000,Sideshow Bob,Courtroom,"These are from the new Tom Clancy. Although it's less painful than reading him. Am I right, folks?"
65281,261,112,471000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,Motion granted! Release the prisoner!
65283,261,114,479000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,"Now, don't try anything funny this time, Bob. I'm gonna be on you like red beans on, ah... uh, hey, hey, hey, don't walk so fast."
65284,261,115,487000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,"Hey, no fair. You got long legs. I got these little bitty hooves..."
65285,261,116,492000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Minimum Security Prison,Bob!
65287,261,118,496000,Attendant,STORAGE LOCKER DEPOT,"Okay, here's your storage locker. Just the way you left it."
65288,261,119,500000,Sideshow Bob,STORAGE LOCKER DEPOT,"Thank you, Raphael. Now, this is a ticklish question, but..."
65289,261,120,504000,Attendant,STORAGE LOCKER DEPOT,You wanna live in the box? Cost ya two bucks a day.
65290,261,121,506000,Sideshow Bob,STORAGE LOCKER DEPOT,"Oh, thank you, kind innkeeper."
65291,261,122,511000,Attendant,STORAGE LOCKER DEPOT,You gonna want a wake-up jab?
65292,261,123,513000,Sideshow Bob,STORAGE LOCKER DEPOT,Please.
65293,261,124,513000,Attendant,STORAGE LOCKER DEPOT,No problemo.
65296,261,127,518000,Gil Gunderson,STORAGE LOCKER,"Hiya, neighbor!"
65298,261,129,521000,Gil Gunderson,STORAGE LOCKER,"Hey, wai-wai-wait. Wha-whatcha writin' there?"
65299,261,130,523000,Sideshow Bob,STORAGE LOCKER,"If you must know, it's an exquisite scheme for revenge."
65300,261,131,527000,Gil Gunderson,STORAGE LOCKER,"Ah, revenge, huh? Half the guys in here are workin' on that."
65301,261,132,534000,Sideshow Bob,STORAGE LOCKER,"Well, mine's better."
65303,261,134,539000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,"Phase One begins in ten... nine... eight... Oh, I can't wait!"
65305,261,136,548000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, Bob, uh, your graduate degrees more than qualify you to be assistant janitor."
65306,261,137,554000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,My blushes.
65307,261,138,555000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,But I am a bit troubled by your constant attempts to murder people.
65308,261,139,559000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,"To be fair, most of those people were Bart Simpson."
65309,261,140,562000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Good luck. That kid's like the Road Runner. He won't go down.
65310,261,141,568000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,Tell me about it.
65311,261,142,572000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I-- You know, Bob, your voice would be perfect for the school's morning announcements."
65312,261,143,577000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,Attention: the French club picnic has been canceled. Quel dommage.
65313,261,144,582000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Ha! You're hired.
65314,261,145,584000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,It begins.
65315,261,146,592000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,"I mean, my announcing career. That's what's beginning."
65316,261,147,601000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,"Good morning, Springfield Elementary."
65317,261,148,603000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,In the lost and found today we have one plaid kilt.
65319,261,150,606000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,"I believe the clan is ""Graham of Montrose."""
65322,261,153,610000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,This new morning announcer sounds awfully familiar.
65323,261,154,614000,Sideshow Bob,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"And finally, Bart Simpson should immediately proceed, unescorted, to the old sports equipment shed behind the school."
65324,261,155,625000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Ha. So long, suckers!"
65326,261,157,634000,Children,Springfield Elementary School,RING AROUND THE ROSEY...
65328,261,159,650000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,"Hello, Bart."
65329,261,160,653000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, it's you, Bob. How ya doin'?"
65330,261,161,656000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,"No screams? Not even an ""eep""?"
65331,261,162,659000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, I'm not afraid of you. Every time we tangle, you wind up in jail. I'm 6 and 0."
65332,261,163,664000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,I'll admit that the record is a little one-sided. But this time I cannot fail.
65333,261,164,674000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,Rakes. My old arch-enemy.
65334,261,165,677000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I thought I was your arch-enemy.
65335,261,166,679000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,"I have a life outside of you, Bart."
65337,261,168,686000,Bart Simpson,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,What are you gonna do to me?
65338,261,169,687000,Sideshow Bob,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,"Oh, believe me, I have a plan. Let's see... Get job as school announcer...lure Bart to shed...secure same to chair with rope... Ah, here we are. ""Have Bart kill Krusty."""
65339,261,170,695000,Bart Simpson,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,Krusty?! That's the one man I would never kill.
65342,261,171,701000,Sideshow Bob,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,"Oh, you will kill Krusty, during his final show -- and you won't even know you're doing it."
65343,261,172,710000,Sideshow Bob,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,"Watch the shiny quarter, Bart... that's it... Oh, dammit, where'd it go?"
65344,261,173,717000,Sideshow Bob,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,I needed that for laundry!
65345,261,174,718000,Bart Simpson,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,"Hey, stupid."

65348,261,177,731000,Sideshow Bob,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,"Watch the spiral, Bart. Let it entrance you with its twirliness. Twirliness!"
65349,261,178,740000,Sideshow Bob,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,You are in my power!
65350,261,179,741000,Bart Simpson,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,I am at your command.
65351,261,180,743000,Sideshow Bob,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,"I didn't say anything about command. If you're in my power, say so."
65352,261,181,747000,Bart Simpson,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,I am in your power.
65353,261,182,749000,Sideshow Bob,SPORTS EQUIPMENT SHED,"Excellent... Actually, go back to ""command."" No, ""power,"" ""power."""

65356,261,185,761000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, family."
65357,261,186,763000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Where have you been, young man? It's nearly bedtime."
