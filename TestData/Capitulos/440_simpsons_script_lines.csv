114286,440,137,585000,Lisa Simpson,Hilltop,So Snow White slept and waited for her prince to come... but he never did.
114288,440,139,592000,Lisa Simpson,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,"Because a woman shouldn't have to depend on a man. Snow White was brought back to life, by a lady doctor."
114289,440,140,598000,Marge Simpson,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,And she lived happily ever after?
114291,440,141,599000,Lisa Simpson,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,"Well, she couldn't indulge in strenuous activities like handball, but otherwise she was fine."
114292,440,142,605000,Marge Simpson,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,That's nice.

114300,440,150,629000,Marge Simpson,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,Macbeth!
114302,440,152,630000,Marge Simpson,SCOTTISH CASTLE,"Out, damn'd spot! Out, I say!"
114303,440,153,635000,Chazz Busby,SCOTTISH CASTLE,"Marge, please. If you don't like getting barbecue sauce out of a leotard, why'd you get into show business? Think before you do."
114304,440,154,641000,Marge Simpson,SCOTTISH CASTLE,I wouldn't be stuck washing costumes if my husband had a better role.
114305,440,155,647000,Homer Simpson,SCOTTISH CASTLE,"Well, I may be playing a tree but at least I'm getting my face out there."
114307,440,157,653000,Marge Simpson,SCOTTISH CASTLE,I thought I was marrying a man who could play Macbeth.

114310,440,160,667000,Chazz Busby,SCOTTISH CASTLE,Mel's like the son Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud always wanted but never had. But oh how they tried.
114311,440,161,674000,Marge Simpson,SCOTTISH CASTLE,I think Mel would be happier as an understudy. A six-feet-understudy.
114312,440,162,681000,Homer Simpson,SCOTTISH CASTLE,You're not suggesting... murder.
114313,440,163,683000,Marge Simpson,SCOTTISH CASTLE,"Wouldst thou live a coward in thine own esteem, letting ""I dare not"" wait upon ""I would?"""
114314,440,164,683000,Homer Simpson,SCOTTISH CASTLE,"Whatever you say, sweetie."

114321,440,170,715000,Homer Simpson,Sideshow Mel's Dressing Room,Why does everyone around here talk that crazy talk?
114322,440,171,718000,Sideshow Mel,Sideshow Mel's Dressing Room,"That ""crazy talk"" is the work of the immortal Bard, William Shakespeare."
114323,440,172,724000,Homer Simpson,Sideshow Mel's Dressing Room,"Well, if you see him in heaven, tell him he sucks."
114325,440,174,731000,Chazz Busby,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,"As you all know, this afternoon, the bone fell out of Mel's hair and beat him to death. Let us observe a moment of silence. Moment over. Homer, you got the lead!"

114339,440,188,796000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,He's the one getting the good reviews! Which makes him the next one you've got to kill.
114340,440,189,801000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Wouldn't it be easier if I just took acting lessons?
114341,440,190,803000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Screw your courage to the sticking-place and we'll not fail.

114373,440,225,959000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,It's my moment.
114375,440,227,965000,Homer Simpson,Theater,"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools. The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player. That struts and frets his hour upon the stage. And then is heard no more."
114376,440,228,995000,Marge Simpson,Theater,"Oh Homie, you were brilliant. I knew you could do it. I knew it..."
114378,440,229,1002000,Marge Simpson,Theater,Now nothing will stop you from taking on all of Shakespeare's greatest roles: King Lear... Hamlet...
114379,440,230,1009000,Marge Simpson,Theater,Othello... Richard The Third...
114380,440,231,1011000,Marge Simpson,Theater,"Henry the Fourth, Part One... Henry The Fourth, Part Two..."
114381,440,232,1014000,Marge Simpson,Theater,Henry The Fifth... Titus Andronicus...
114382,440,233,1018000,Homer Simpson,Theater,Me having to read all those plays would be the real tragedy.
114385,440,236,1026000,Marge Simpson,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,"That's it, three stories. That's what we always tell."
114386,440,237,1031000,Lisa Simpson,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,Looks like Maggie wants a story too.
114387,440,238,1035000,Marge Simpson,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,"Ooo, ""The Fountainhead."""
114388,440,239,1037000,Lisa Simpson,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,"Mom, isn't that book the bible of right-wing losers?"
114389,440,240,1041000,Agnes Skinner,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,"Yeah, but the guy on the book jacket is one sexy slice of beefcake."
114390,440,241,1048000,Marge Simpson,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,"So, anyway, this is the story of Maggie Roarke, an architect who refused to compromise."
114393,440,244,1057000,Mr. Toohey,Day Care Center,"Now children, while I do traffic school online, you'll be playing with blocks."
114394,440,245,1067000,Marge Simpson,Day Care Center,Maggie's genius and creativity far exceeded that of the others. And I'm not just saying that 'cause I'm her mother.
114395,440,246,1073000,Marge Simpson,Day Care Center,"But her teacher, Mr. Ellsworth Toohey, wanted every child to conform."
114396,440,247,1081000,Mr. Toohey,Day Care Center,"Banal. Very banal. Ooo, wonderfully pedestrian."
114397,440,248,1084000,Mr. Toohey,Day Care Center,"Oh, oh, this isn't right. Maggie, dancers shouldn't kick too high, and buildings mustn't reach the sky."
114398,440,249,1095000,Mr. Toohey,Day Care Center,"There. Well, hmm. Your rubble is still a little bit higher than the others. So let's just..."
114399,440,250,1101000,Mr. Toohey,Day Care Center,"Welcome to the real world, baby."
114400,440,251,1103000,Marge Simpson,Day Care Center,He would not let Maggie's creativity flower:
114401,440,252,1141000,Mr. Toohey,Day Care Center,Mediocrity rules!
114404,440,255,1147000,Mr. Toohey,Day Care Center,"Alright, Maggie. Today is parent-teacher day. So I want everyone to see how uncreative and beaten-down you've become. That's right, you're beaten-down. Yes, you are!"
114407,440,256,1164000,Homer Simpson,Day Care Center,"I don't know how you put up with all these kids, Toohey. If I were you there'd be a lot of strangled babies."
114408,440,257,1170000,Mr. Toohey,Day Care Center,"Now let's see what your children have done, shall we? Don't brace yourself, you will believe your eyes."
114410,440,259,1179000,Mr. Toohey,Day Care Center,You will be tried as a toddler!
114413,440,262,1189000,Mr. Toohey,Day Care Center,"Babies and gentlemen of the jury... this child's crime was to remind the rest of us that we are merely ordinary. When a blade of grass rises above the others do we applaud it -- no, we cut it down! I recommend nine time-outs: served consecutively!"
114415,440,264,1213000,Maggie Simpson,Day Care Center,"Throughout the ages, the finger painter, the Play-Doh sculptor, the Lincoln-logger, stood alone against the daycare teacher of her time. She did not live to earn approval stickers. She lived for herself, that she might achieve things that are the glory of all humanity. These are my terms: I do not care to play by any other's. And now, if the court will allow me, it's nap time."
114417,440,266,1239000,Marge Simpson,City Street,Maggie grew up to be a world-famous architect.
114418,440,267,1242000,Marge Simpson,City Street,Her building became one of the wonders of the world.
114419,440,268,1250000,Marge Simpson,City Street,And on the very top floor was a daycare center...
114420,440,269,1250000,Marge Simpson,City Street,Where every child was free to follow their dream. Because nothing is... Maggie! Get away from there!
114422,440,271,1262000,Marge Simpson,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,Bad baby!
114423,440,272,1272000,Doc,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,HO-HI!
114424,440,273,1275000,Dwarves,Finger-Looking Good Nail Salon,"HO-HI / HO-HI / IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE / IF DISNEY SUES / WE'LL CLAIM ""FAIR USE"" / HO-HI / HO-HI, HO-HI, HO-HI....
