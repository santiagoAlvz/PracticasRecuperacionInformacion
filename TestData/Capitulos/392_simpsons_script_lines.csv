101896,392,244,1063000,Dr. Swanson,Dr. Swanson's Office,Send him in.
101897,392,245,1067000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Swanson's Office,"Bart, honey, this is all we can afford for now. If it doesn't work, maybe when you're an adult you can pay some lady to make you happy for an hour."

101899,392,247,1082000,Bart Simpson,Dr. Swanson's Office,"...And I wasn't planned, so when I came, my parents had to get married. And they were too young and not ready for a kid to screw up their lives. Maybe... I act out because... if my parents are mad at me, they can't fight with each other!"
101900,392,248,1098000,Dr. Swanson,Dr. Swanson's Office,And maybe that's why you do things like scare your classmates with Dark Stanley?
101901,392,249,1102000,Bart Simpson,Dr. Swanson's Office,"Yeah, that and ""Stanley"" was the brand of hammer my dad used to hit me with."
101902,392,250,1108000,Dr. Swanson,Dr. Swanson's Office,"Very good. Bart, we have twenty minutes left. Is there anything else you want to talk about?"

101904,392,252,1118000,Dr. Swanson,Dr. Swanson's Office,Oh. Good. Good. Good. Will I see you again?
101905,392,253,1122000,Bart Simpson,Dr. Swanson's Office,Anything could happen. One of these days I might have a complete psychotic breakdown.
101906,392,254,1127000,Dr. Swanson,Dr. Swanson's Office,I'd like that.
101908,392,256,1130000,Dr. Swanson,Different Psychologist's Office,I just can't stop thinking about him.
101909,392,257,1132000,Psychologist,Different Psychologist's Office,Do you think maybe... Bart is replacing your son... who was killed by Dark Stanley?
