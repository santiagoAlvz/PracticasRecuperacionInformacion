56002,231,101,438000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Marge, that's in the past. Just let it go."
56004,231,103,442000,Colonel,OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR,"Suh, I say, suh, the hour is upon us, suh."
56005,231,104,447000,Marge Simpson,OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR,"Hello, my husband will be right with you. We're just taking this old Christmas tree to the dump."
56006,231,105,452000,Colonel,OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR,"Ah, well now, I wouldn't be much of a southern gentleman if I didn't help you carry that tree..."

56008,231,107,460000,Colonel,OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR,"Well, at least let me shoot it into smaller pieces for you, madam."
56010,231,109,464000,Bart Simpson,OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR,"Well, it's worth a try don't you--"
56011,231,110,466000,Marge Simpson,OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR,"We're fine, Colonel. Good day."

56015,231,114,475000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,And somebody wanted to get rid of it in April.
56017,231,116,478000,Homer Simpson,Gas Station,"Flanders, you gotta help me. Is there a southern couple parked in front of my house?"
56019,231,118,483000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oooh, yes indeedy, Homer. Looks like they're settling in for a long stay."
56020,231,119,489000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"I was afraid of that. Well, goodbye, my gentle neighbor. You know, I've always wanted to tell you how mu..."

56030,231,129,512000,Lisa Simpson,Car,"Could you build us a house, President Carter? We can't go back to ours."
56031,231,130,516000,Jimmy Carter,Car,"I'm sorry, these are for the truly needy."
56032,231,131,518000,Cletus Spuckler,Car,"Yeah, git yer own habitat."
56033,231,132,521000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Come on, Carter, build us a house, you lazy bum."

56039,231,138,535000,Marge Simpson,Car,Then why are you driving so fast?
56040,231,139,537000,Homer Simpson,Car,'Cause I'm trying to think! What would Zorro do?
56041,231,140,544000,Homer Simpson,Car,Zo-rrooo!
56042,231,141,544000,Homer Simpson,Car,"""Rural route 9?"" That's it! We can hide out at the farm where I grew up!"
56043,231,142,552000,Bart Simpson,Car,You mean Grampa's old farm?
56044,231,143,554000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Yeah, it'll be fun. Fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides..."
56045,231,144,560000,Bart Simpson,Car,What a dump!

56052,231,151,596000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,You little scamp.
56053,231,152,599000,Lisa Simpson,Farmhouse,Are we really gonna live here and grow crops?
56054,231,153,601000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,Absolutely. This is our big chance. The Simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins.
56055,231,154,608000,Bart Simpson,Farmhouse,I'll dig an outhouse.
56056,231,155,609000,Lisa Simpson,Farmhouse,I'll weed the floor.
56057,231,156,610000,Marge Simpson,Farmhouse,I'll repress the rage I'm feeling.
56058,231,157,612000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,That's my girl. Let the agriculture begin!
56060,231,159,616000,Homer Simpson,Behind Farmhouse,"All right, let's see what the old girl can do."
56061,231,160,621000,Bart Simpson,Behind Farmhouse,It doesn't sound very tractor-y.
56062,231,161,624000,Homer Simpson,Behind Farmhouse,Hang on.
56063,231,162,624000,Homer Simpson,Behind Farmhouse,And... there.

56069,231,170,639000,Lisa Simpson,Barn,"Oh, you poor little sheep! No one's sheared you for years!"
56070,231,171,645000,Lisa Simpson,Barn,"All right. Almost done, my little friend. Soon you'll be a nice, cool... RAT?!"
56072,231,173,656000,Farmer,Feed Store,"Well, well, look at the city slicker pullin' up in his fancy German car."
56073,231,174,661000,Homer Simpson,Feed Store,This car was made in Guatemala.
56074,231,175,662000,Farmer #2,Feed Store,"Well pardon us, Mr. Gucci loafers."
56075,231,176,666000,Homer Simpson,Feed Store,I bought these shoes from a hobo.
56076,231,177,668000,Farmer,Feed Store,"Well la-dee-da, Mr. Park-Avenue manicure."
56077,231,178,671000,Homer Simpson,Feed Store,"I'm sorry, I believe in good grooming."
56078,231,179,677000,Storekeeper,Feed Store,You're not gonna grow nothin' on the old Simpson place. That's why your daddy abandoned it.
56079,231,180,681000,Homer Simpson,Feed Store,"Aw, what do you know?"
56080,231,181,682000,Storekeeper,Feed Store,"Well, I know your soil pH is up around 9.6, and you need it seven to eight, max."
56081,231,182,686000,Homer Simpson,Feed Store,"Oh, that's just superstition."
56082,231,183,689000,Homer Simpson,Feed Store,You watch me. I'll grow something out there.
56083,231,184,692000,Storekeeper,Feed Store,Not if you're plantin' Gummi Bears.
56085,231,186,698000,Bart Simpson,Feed Store,"Wow, Dad, this is the juiciest watermelon I ever tasted."
56086,231,187,702000,Homer Simpson,Feed Store,"Yeah, I hope I can grow some like that."
56087,231,188,704000,Bart Simpson,Feed Store,What are you planting?
56088,231,189,705000,Homer Simpson,Feed Store,"Oh, a little bit of everything."
56089,231,190,707000,Homer Simpson,Feed Store,"Something will thrive in this harsh, merciless soil."
56090,231,191,710000,Homer Simpson,Feed Store,"And for those who face nature unafraid, it is they who reap the... ah... I'm down."
56091,231,192,715000,Bart Simpson,Feed Store,Paw!
56092,231,193,716000,Homer Simpson,Feed Store,Move the handbrake...
56094,231,195,719000,Homer Simpson,Feed Store,"Ohhh, that's heaven."
56096,231,197,723000,Homer Simpson,Farm,"Oh, it's been a month. Why won't anything grow?"
56097,231,198,726000,Marge Simpson,Farm,Maybe it needs more fertilizer.
56098,231,199,728000,Homer Simpson,Farm,"I'm only one man, Marge."
56099,231,200,730000,Marge Simpson,Farm,"Well, it's probably just a bad growing season."
56100,231,201,733000,Farmer,Farm,"Hot diggity! It's up to her eye. Time to harvest, boys!"
56101,231,202,738000,Farmer,Farm,"Nice work, Petunia. Here you go."
56103,231,204,741000,Homer Simpson,Farm,"Oh, who am I kidding? I'm no farmer."
56104,231,205,747000,Farmer,Farm,"Well, if it isn't Mr. Salad Fork. You couldn't grow stink on a monkey."
56105,231,206,752000,Homer Simpson,Farm,"Leave me alone, you big bully."
56106,231,207,753000,Farmer,Farm,"Oh, I'm just razzin' ya. It's my way. Here, have an ear on me."
56109,231,210,761000,Marge Simpson,Farmhouse,"More tumbleweed, Lisa?"
56110,231,211,763000,Lisa Simpson,Farmhouse,No thanks. I'm still finishing my thistles.
56111,231,212,765000,Bart Simpson,Farmhouse,"Dad, if we leave for town right now, we can catch the dinner special at Krusty-Burger."
56112,231,213,769000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"Sorry, boy. Going back to Springfield would be a coward's way out."
56113,231,214,772000,Bart Simpson,Farmhouse,Wasn't skipping town in the first place a coward's way out?
56114,231,215,775000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"Oh, you're right. I'm a coward. I've made such a mess of things. If only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow..."
56115,231,216,787000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,Wait a minute.
56117,231,218,792000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Plutonium?! Gee, Homer, isn't that kinda risky?... Yeah, I guess you're right. It's not."
56118,231,219,800000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey Lenny, you sendin' some outgoing mail?"
56119,231,220,802000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You know it.
56120,231,221,804000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'll probably send some tomorrow.
56121,231,222,805000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I hear that.
56124,231,225,817000,Homer Simpson,Barn,Easy... careful... steady...
56125,231,226,830000,Homer Simpson,Barn,Time to give Mother Nature a little goose.
56127,231,228,833000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Well, Marge, have you ever seen a field glow like that?"
56128,231,229,836000,Marge Simpson,Field,"It's eerily beautiful, but are you sure this is safe?"
56129,231,230,840000,Homer Simpson,Field,Of course not. But you know something? Sometimes you have to break the rules to free your heart.
56130,231,231,847000,Marge Simpson,Field,You got that from a movie poster!
56131,231,232,850000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Well, when there's nothing left to believe in, believe in hope."
56132,231,233,854000,Marge Simpson,Field,Where'd you get that?
56133,231,234,855000,Homer Simpson,Field,"From the producers of ""Waiting to Exhale."""
56134,231,235,858000,Marge Simpson,Field,Is that plutonium on your gums?
56135,231,236,860000,Homer Simpson,Field,Shut up and kiss me.
55202,231,238,869000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"Wake up, honey!"
56137,231,239,870000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,It's time to harvest our radioactive supercrop!
56138,231,240,874000,Marge Simpson,Farmhouse,But it's only been one night.
56139,231,241,876000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"That's all it takes. If we learned one thing from ""The Amazing Colossal Man,"" and ""Grasshopperus,"" it's that radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast."
56140,231,242,886000,Marge Simpson,Farmhouse,"Yeah, but didn't Grasshopperus kill Chad Everett?"
56141,231,243,889000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,Only 'cause he tried to reason with him.
56142,231,244,891000,Marge Simpson,Farmhouse,Oh.
56143,231,245,892000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"Brace yourselves, everybody. You're about to see the hugest, juiciest, possibly super-intelligent vegetables man has ever known. You might want to crane your necks upward now to save time."
56144,231,246,904000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,Ta-da!
56146,231,248,909000,Homer Simpson,Field,"All right, now don't panic. It's possible the giant vegetables are invisible."
56147,231,249,917000,Homer Simpson,Field,Ah-ha!
56148,231,250,917000,Homer Simpson,Field,Oh... Where are you?
56150,231,252,920000,Marge Simpson,Field,"Oh, honey, give it up."
56151,231,253,921000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Oh, you're right. This farm's hopeless. Why didn't I listen to those inbred hicks? I guess I'll just go hang myself in the barn."
56152,231,254,928000,Marge Simpson,Field,"Homer, no!"
56153,231,255,929000,Bart Simpson,Field,"Let 'im go, Mom."
56154,231,256,930000,Lisa Simpson,Field,"Wait, Dad, you don't have to kill yourself."
56155,231,257,932000,Homer Simpson,Field,This better be good.
56156,231,258,935000,Lisa Simpson,Field,Something's growing.
56157,231,259,936000,Homer Simpson,Field,A sprout!
56158,231,260,938000,Homer Simpson,Field,And there's some more!
56159,231,261,939000,Marge Simpson,Field,What is it? Carrots? Peas? Maybe it's okra.
56160,231,262,943000,Homer Simpson,Field,Who cares what it is? It's growing! I've saved the farm!
56161,231,263,956000,Homer Simpson,Field,Look at my babies. This tomato will be Heinz ketchup. And this to-mah-to will be Hunt's catsup.
56162,231,264,968000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Bup, no fighting, boys."
56163,231,265,968000,Bart Simpson,Field,Bleh! Tastes like cigarette butts.
56164,231,266,970000,Marge Simpson,Field,"That's odd. The outside looks like a tomato, but the inside is brown."
56165,231,267,975000,Lisa Simpson,Field,Maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds.
56166,231,268,978000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Oh, great. I got a field full of mutants."
56167,231,269,981000,Bart Simpson,Field,Gimme! I want more!
56169,231,271,984000,Lisa Simpson,Field,I thought you said it tasted terrible.
56170,231,272,986000,Bart Simpson,Field,It does. But it's smooth and mild. And refreshingly addictive.
56171,231,273,993000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Addictive, eh?"
56173,231,275,997000,Lisa Simpson,ROADSIDE STAND,"""ToMacco?"" That's pretty clever, Dad. I mean, for a product that's evil and deadly."
56174,231,276,1002000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE STAND,"Aw, thanks honey."
56175,231,277,1004000,Marge Simpson,ROADSIDE STAND,"Well, I'm not crazy about the plutonium or nicotine, but it is very nice to see Bart eating his vegetables."
56176,231,278,1014000,Chief Wiggum,ROADSIDE STAND,"Excuse me, Mr. Farmer man. I promised my son he could tip over his first cow, and I... ""ToMacco?"""
56177,231,279,1021000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE STAND,"Yes, it's the latest craze. Try some, won't you?"
56178,231,280,1025000,Chief Wiggum,ROADSIDE STAND,"Go ahead, Ralphie. The stranger is offering you a treat."
56179,231,281,1028000,Ralph Wiggum,ROADSIDE STAND,Mmm...
56180,231,282,1030000,Ralph Wiggum,ROADSIDE STAND,"Oh Daddy, this tastes like Grandma."
56181,231,283,1035000,Chief Wiggum,ROADSIDE STAND,"Holy Moses, it does taste like Grandma."
56182,231,284,1038000,Ralph Wiggum,ROADSIDE STAND,I want more.
56183,231,285,1038000,Chief Wiggum,ROADSIDE STAND,"Yeah, me too. We'll take a bushel or a peck or just, just give it to me."
56185,231,287,1047000,Marge Simpson,ROADSIDE STAND,Can I interest you in a mincemeat pie? There very...
56186,231,288,1050000,Chief Wiggum,ROADSIDE STAND,Does it have tomacco in it?
56187,231,289,1051000,Marge Simpson,ROADSIDE STAND,"No, but I use only the fre..."
56188,231,290,1051000,Chief Wiggum,ROADSIDE STAND,Pass.
56189,231,291,1053000,Customers,ROADSIDE STAND,"I was here first! / C'mon, c'mon people!"
56190,231,292,1055000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE STAND,Don't push. There's plenty of tomacco for everyone.
56191,231,293,1058000,Bart Simpson,ROADSIDE STAND,Have your cash or food stamps ready!
56192,231,294,1060000,Marge Simpson,ROADSIDE STAND,Don't forget your mincemeat pie!
56193,231,295,1062000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE STAND,"You're scaring the customers, honey."
56194,231,296,1068000,Executive,ROADSIDE STAND,"Hello, folks. Would you and your family like to take a ride with us?"
56195,231,297,1072000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE STAND,Okay.
56197,231,299,1074000,Sandy,Van,"Meet the Laramie cigarette team. This is Mindy, J.P. and Emile."
56198,231,300,1078000,Mindy,Van,"Homer, we're in a bit of a pickle. Kids are crazy about tobacco, but the politicians won't let us sell it to them."
56199,231,301,1085000,Homer Simpson,Van,Those dirty rotten...
56202,231,302,1085000,Mindy,Van,"Tell me about it. But there's no law against selling kids tomacco. That little ""M"" is worth a lot of money to us... and to you."
56203,231,303,1093000,Homer Simpson,Van,How much?
56204,231,304,1094000,Sandy,Van,"Well, let's say a hundred..."
56206,231,306,1096000,Sandy,Van,... and fifty...
56208,231,308,1097000,Sandy,Van,... million dollars.
56209,231,309,1098000,Homer Simpson,Van,One hundred and... May I speak to my family for a moment?
56211,231,311,1104000,Homer Simpson,LAVATORY,"Did you see the way Emile's lookin' at Mindy? Hoo-hoo, I think something's going on there."
56212,231,312,1108000,Marge Simpson,LAVATORY,Shouldn't we be talking about the hundred and fifty million dollar offer?
56213,231,313,1111000,Homer Simpson,LAVATORY,"Oh, yeah. Let's take it."
56214,231,314,1113000,Lisa Simpson,LAVATORY,"Dad, it's a tobacco company. They make billions off the suffering and deaths of others."
56215,231,315,1117000,Bart Simpson,LAVATORY,"She's right, Dad. They can afford a lot more."
56216,231,316,1118000,Lisa Simpson,LAVATORY,"No, I..."
56217,231,317,1120000,Marge Simpson,LAVATORY,I'm with Lisa. Let's take 'em to the cleaners.
56219,231,319,1123000,Homer Simpson,Van,We all agree that a hundred and fifty million is an insult. The least we can accept is a hundred and fifty billion.
56221,231,321,1134000,Homer Simpson,Road in Front of Simpson Farm,They'll be back. We control the world's supply of tomacco and no one can take that away from...
56222,231,322,1141000,Homer Simpson,Road in Front of Simpson Farm,Stop eating our future!
56223,231,323,1142000,Homer Simpson,Road in Front of Simpson Farm,Get the... get outta... bad animals! Go home!
56224,231,324,1146000,Homer Simpson,Road in Front of Simpson Farm,"Thank God, there's one left!"
56227,231,327,1148000,Homer Simpson,Road in Front of Simpson Farm,"Look, a flying saucer!"
56231,231,331,1157000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"There, there. We had quite a scare today. But you're gonna make us millions. Yes you are."
56232,231,332,1164000,Lisa Simpson,Farmhouse,You're about to launch a terrible evil on the world. You've gotta destroy this plant.
56233,231,333,1168000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"I know, honey. But what can I do, as an individual? I wouldn't know where to begin."
56234,231,334,1173000,Lisa Simpson,Farmhouse,Just burn that plant right now and end this madness.
56200,231,335,1176000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"I wish I could make a difference, Lisa, but I'm just one man."
56235,231,337,1180000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"I agree, but how?"
56237,231,339,1188000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,They're after the tomacco!
56238,231,340,1194000,Lisa Simpson,Farmhouse,Now you can't tell me nicotine's not addictive.
56239,231,341,1197000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"Lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is..."
56240,231,342,1202000,Cow,Farmhouse,Tomaaaccohhhh!
56241,231,343,1210000,Marge Simpson,Farmhouse,"Give them the plant, Homer!"
56242,231,344,1212000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"No, I'd rather die!"
56243,231,345,1215000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,Take it!
56244,231,346,1221000,Mindy,Farmhouse,Well! What a lovely gift. Gotta run!
56245,231,347,1224000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"So, Mindy? How did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million?"
56246,231,348,1228000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,Cash'll be okay! Or stock? Does your company have stock?
56247,231,349,1233000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,Mindy?
56248,231,350,1234000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,Mindy and I are just hammering out a payment plan. We'll talk Monday!
56250,231,352,1239000,Sandy,Helicopter,"Hey, props to Mindy on the grab."
56251,231,353,1239000,Sandy,Helicopter,Booya!
56252,231,354,1243000,Pilot,Helicopter,"Guys, we seem to be carrying a little extra weight."
56253,231,355,1245000,J.P.,Helicopter,"Don't look at me, I'm on Sugar Busters."
56258,231,360,1257000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,I've never been so glad to be home.
56259,231,361,1260000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,I don't know why we ever left in the first place.
56262,231,364,1264000,Colonel,Simpson Front Yard,"Five! Six! Seven! Eight, I say, eight! Nine! Aaannnd ten-- What is that intoxicatin' aroma? Could that be, I say, could that be mincemeat pie?"
56263,231,365,1278000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,It certainly is. Why don't you put down your gun and have a slice?
56264,231,366,1282000,Colonel,Simpson Front Yard,I don't mind if I do.
56265,231,367,1284000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,"Hey, are we duellin' or what?"
56266,231,368,1286000,Colonel,Simpson Front Yard,"Oh, where are my manners?"
56268,231,370,1292000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,"You okay, Dad?"
56269,231,371,1293000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,I think so. The bone stopped the bullet.
56270,231,372,1296000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,"Dad, this might be one of those things you should go to the hospital for."
56271,231,373,1300000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,After pie.
