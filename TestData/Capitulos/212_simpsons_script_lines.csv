50110,212,124,584000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's not the point. And another thing. I asked you to take out the garbage three days ago and you still haven't--
50111,212,125,593000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmm, still half an hour till dinner. Oh, well..."
50114,212,128,601000,Homer Simpson,Limo,"It's a real honor to be guarding your body, sir."

50133,212,146,685000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"That ""change"" was a bribe."
50134,212,147,687000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, honey, don't be so naive. That's how the world works. Sure, the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time."
50135,212,148,695000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No he doesn't. Trains are regulated by the Federal Department of Transportation. And recent studies have shown that...

50155,212,168,791000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, get that away from me!"
50156,212,169,793000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Kids, I don't want you drinking any more milk. Ever."
50157,212,170,795000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Can I still drink it?
50158,212,171,797000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Go nuts.

50163,212,176,813000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"And to think, I respected you! And defended you! You wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me!"
50165,212,178,824000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Okay, we'll call it even."
50166,212,179,829000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Oh my God, I killed the mayor. All right, stay calm. I'll just use the body to stage an elaborate farce, à la ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" and..."
50167,212,180,835000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Help! Help!
50168,212,181,838000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,His corpse is climbing the building!
50169,212,182,841000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"I'm alive, you idiot! Pull me in!"
50170,212,183,845000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,A-- Wait a second. I'm not saving you unless you promise to get that rats' milk out of the schools.
50171,212,184,851000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,But the gangsters will kill me.
50172,212,185,853000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"You're forgetting, you've got the best bodyguard in the business. Now promise, or I'll let you fall to your death."
