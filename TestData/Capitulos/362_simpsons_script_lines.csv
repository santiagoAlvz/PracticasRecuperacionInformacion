93802,362,56,286000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I still don't understand how her feelings can be hurt. It's my day.

93804,362,58,293000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but I know how to win women back. I even won you back after I lost our wedding album in a bar bet."

93826,362,81,388000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Googolplex Theatres,I'd rather not go than lie.
93827,362,82,393000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Googolplex Theatres,How you doin'? So... is that your jacket on the back of that chair?

93837,362,92,434000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, it had to be a boy, did it? You think a girl can't flip out? Well, you're wrong!"
93838,362,93,443000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,My flexi-cast!
93840,362,95,452000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, I hold in my hand a sticker with a frowny-face on it. Don't make me affix it to your file!"
93841,362,96,460000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Don't make me affix it to your file.
93842,362,97,464000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I'm peeling off the back...

93849,362,104,497000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Your daughter broke a window, upended an ashcan, and hurled a Thermos-brand thermos onto the street!"
93850,362,105,503000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,Does it still keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold?
93851,362,106,506000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,I'm afraid it doesn't keep any drinks anything.
93853,362,108,510000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,I've asked the school psychologist to shed some light on your daughter's sudden burst of inappropriateness.
93854,362,109,516000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Skinner's Office,"I'm afraid Lisa's rage stems from extraordinary disillusionment with a parental figure. In this case, her father."
93855,362,110,523000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Oh yeah, oh sure, it's easy to point out my faults. It's a little harder to shut up."
93856,362,111,529000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Skinner's Office,"Looking at your daughter's essays, this isn't a new trend."
93857,362,112,533000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"""Daddy's Face-down Thanksgiving,"" ""Left at the Grand Canyon,"" ""The Day a Policeman Came to My Soccer Game."""
93858,362,113,533000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Skinner's Office,"Mr. Simpson, Lisa is at a crucial juncture. If she doesn't see her father as a positive role model, she could hate men for the rest of her life."
93859,362,114,549000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Oh, I know! But how can I undo eight years of jerkiness in two easy sessions at no cost to me?"
93860,362,115,557000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,If I may make a suggestion.
93861,362,116,559000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"The school is looking for a new ""Safety Salamander"". When Lisa sees you teaching children to avoid downed power lines, it could restore her faith in you and the male gender."
93862,362,117,569000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,I don't know. What happened to the last Safety Salamander?
93863,362,118,572000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Uh... he fell asleep in the suit and suffocated.
93864,362,119,575000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,I can do that!
93866,362,121,576000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, Lisa. Time for Daddy's big surprise!"
93868,362,123,583000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sometimes it's scary when your dreams come true, isn't it, sweetie?"
93869,362,124,586000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess.
93870,362,125,587000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah. Now, I'm off to bring safety to Springfield Elementary and win back your love!"
93872,362,127,594000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What's that, honey? I can't hear you very well!"
93874,362,129,598000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Salamander awayyy!
93875,362,130,605000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Bart!"
93878,362,133,606000,Homer Simpson,School Bus,The first rule of bus safety is always wear your seat belt.
93879,362,134,611000,Milhouse Van Houten,School Bus,School buses don't have seat belts.
93880,362,135,613000,Homer Simpson,School Bus,Then what protects you if we crash?
93881,362,136,615000,Otto Mann,School Bus,A metal bar at tooth level.
93882,362,137,616000,Homer Simpson,School Bus,Stop this bus!
93885,362,140,620000,Milhouse Van Houten,Streets,My teeth!
93887,362,142,621000,Homer Simpson,Bus,"Look, Lisa. I made safety happen!"

93890,362,145,630000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,Son-of-a... Questions? Comments?
93891,362,146,635000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,Are you a girl? 'Cause I don't see a sala-wiener.
93892,362,147,641000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"Did I hear ""where are the fireworks?"" 'Cause heeere they are!"

93898,362,153,674000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"So, sweetie, am I your hero again?"
93899,362,154,676000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Janey's father just takes her to the zoo once a month. Couldn't you be that kind of dad?
93900,362,155,682000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Now honey, you know Daddy's not allowed in the zoo anymore."
93901,362,156,686000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, yeah."

93970,362,223,931000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, we've got to do something."
93971,362,224,932000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What can I do? I'm only one man.
93972,362,225,935000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Lincoln was only one man.
93973,362,226,936000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you sure there wasn't a midget in his hat? I read an email that said there was.
93974,362,227,940000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, as the Safety Salamander, you are beloved by all. And if you were the Mayor, we could make sure that only good people, like me, tell you what to do."
93975,362,228,949000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmmm. I will run for Mayor!
93976,362,229,952000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,And I will be your campaign manager!
93977,362,230,955000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And I'll find out what a Mayor does!
93978,362,231,958000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Expand my brain, learning juice!"
93980,362,233,973000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Oh, I hate press conferences."
93981,362,234,975000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Homie, you might score more points if you didn't wear that Salamander suit. You look like the mascot for some horrible Southern college."
93982,362,235,983000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Marge, without this outfit, I'm just Homer Simpson, multiple felon. With it, I'm a costumed hero like George Washington or Dame Edna."
93983,362,236,993000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Today marks a new dawn for Springfield. This salamander is sitting on eggs labeled ""elder care"", ""flex-time,"" and ""downtown pedestrian mall."" And those eggs are ready to hatch!"
93985,362,238,1007000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Now, I will take your questions."
93986,362,239,1008000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Town Square,"Uh, what special powers would a salamander bring to the office of mayor?"
93987,362,240,1012000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Well, there's my X-ray vision, my fire breath... and I can get big laughs with tennis balls."
93988,362,241,1019000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Bloop, bloop, bloop. Bloop, bloop, bloop."
93990,362,243,1025000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Town Square,"Wow, I didn't know salamanders could do all those things."
93991,362,244,1028000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Town Square,"And to think, for all these years I've been a gecko man."
93992,362,245,1031000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Town Square,"Take a hike, jerk."
93993,362,246,1033000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Town Square,"Mr. Simpson, what about those photos of you strangling your child?"
93994,362,247,1038000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Why should we let this election be influenced by a photo taken hours ago?
93995,362,249,1045000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Now, restaurant matchbooks for everyone!"
93996,362,250,1048000,Crowd,Springfield Town Square,Sala-mander! Sala-mander!
93998,362,252,1053000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, you're doin' great. You're way ahead in the polls... even those negative campaign ads aren't hurting you."
93999,362,253,1058000,Waylon Smithers,Moe's Tavern,Simpson barely even comes into work anymore. He pays a homeless man to do it for him.
94000,362,254,1062000,Bum,Moe's Tavern,"I, um, I don't feel so good, Blue."
94001,362,255,1067000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, people may not love Homer Simpson, but they love this suit. Just like they love their stupid American flag."
94003,362,257,1079000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's that smell?
94004,362,258,1081000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's the smell of impending victory.
94005,362,259,1085000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Did you just vomit in that suit?
94006,362,260,1087000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A little.
94007,362,261,1089000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Have you cleaned that suit once since you got it?
94008,362,262,1092000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, but I swam in it."
94009,362,263,1094000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'd better wash that thing. It's hard to know where the suit ends and you begin.
94010,362,264,1100000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But aren't you gonna have fun finding out?
94011,362,265,1103000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
94012,362,266,1107000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's weird. He started off as an egg.
94014,362,268,1113000,Kent Brockman,TV SOUNDSTAGE,"Our next question goes to Eleanor Abernathy, also known as the crazy cat lady. Cat Lady, how would you boost the city's commercial tax base?"
94015,362,269,1125000,Cat Lady,TV SOUNDSTAGE,... small business incentives... ... corporate accountability... ... cats in everyone's pants!
94016,362,270,1136000,Kent Brockman,TV SOUNDSTAGE,"All right, thank you, Cat Lady. See you in the spin room."
94017,362,271,1138000,Cat Lady,TV SOUNDSTAGE,Okay...
94018,362,272,1141000,Kent Brockman,TV SOUNDSTAGE,Our next question is for the Safety Salamander.
94020,362,274,1146000,Kent Brockman,TV SOUNDSTAGE,"Sir, how would you restore our city's crumbling infrastructure?"
94021,362,275,1151000,Homer Simpson,TV SOUNDSTAGE,"That's an excellent question, Kent. First of all..."
94022,362,276,1155000,Homer Simpson,TV SOUNDSTAGE,What the? It must have shrunk when my wife washed it!
94023,362,277,1159000,Sideshow Mel,TV SOUNDSTAGE,"Why without his costume, he's naught but a man!"
94024,362,278,1162000,Moe Szyslak,TV SOUNDSTAGE,"Hey, screw this. I'm not gonna let any human tell me what to do."
94026,362,279,1166000,Homer Simpson,TV SOUNDSTAGE,"That's right, I am a man! The man who dressed like a salamander to win back his daughter's love. Let's meet her now."
94027,362,280,1176000,Homer Simpson,TV SOUNDSTAGE,"Uh, well, my son is here too. Let's meet him now."
94028,362,281,1180000,Bart Simpson,TV SOUNDSTAGE,Heeere's Bart!
94029,362,282,1185000,Milhouse Van Houten,TV SOUNDSTAGE,Whasssup!
94030,362,283,1188000,Carl Carlson,TV SOUNDSTAGE,Bo-ring.
94031,362,284,1189000,Lenny Leonard,TV SOUNDSTAGE,We're sick of you and your hatchlings!
94032,362,285,1194000,Homer Simpson,TV SOUNDSTAGE,"Please, stop throwing fruit!"
94035,362,288,1200000,Kent Brockman,Ballroom,"Our exit polls show no candidate attained the five per cent necessary to win, and Mayor Joe Quimby will keep his job, which I didn't want anyway. Your loss, jackasses."
94036,362,289,1218000,Lisa Simpson,Ballroom,"Well, Dad, you tried to make this town a better place. And no matter what, that makes you my hero."
94037,362,290,1226000,Homer Simpson,Ballroom,"Aw, thanks. Now how 'bout a dance with your Daddy?"
94038,362,291,1237000,Homer Simpson,Ballroom,I can't believe I lost after Ben Affleck campaigned day and night for me.
94039,362,292,1242000,Lisa Simpson,Ballroom,"Yeah, I warned you about that."
94040,362,293,1244000,Homer Simpson,Ballroom,"Whups, be careful of my tail."
94041,362,294,1246000,Lisa Simpson,Ballroom,You don't have a tail anymore.
94042,362,295,1248000,Homer Simpson,Ballroom,I still feel it. It's so itchy. Itchy...
