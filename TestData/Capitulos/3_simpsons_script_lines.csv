149458,3,19,163000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Bus,"Now, class, remember: do not stick any part of your body out the window. We all know the tragic story of the young man who stuck his arm out the window and had it ripped off by a big truck coming in the other direction."

149485,3,46,278000,Waylon Smithers,Conference Room,"...And so this plant harnesses the power of the atom so that we have the energy to run everything from your favorite video game to yummy cotton candy machines. Let's learn more about nuclear energy, shall we? Lights."

149504,3,66,404000,Bart Simpson,PLANT,"What does ""incompetent"" mean?"
149505,3,67,405000,Terri Mackleberry,PLANT,It means he spends more time yakking and scarfing down donuts than doing his job.
149506,3,68,410000,Bart Simpson,PLANT,"Oh, okay. I thought you were puttin' him down."
149508,3,70,413000,Homer Simpson,COFFEE ROOM,"You know, I defy anyone to tell the difference between these donuts and ones baked today. Hey, my boy's s'posed to be here any second on a field trip. They been through here yet?"
149509,3,71,426000,Workman #1,COFFEE ROOM,"Come on, Simpson. If they wanted the kids to see you sitting around on your butt and stuffing your face they'd take them on a tour of your house."

149518,3,80,462000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"But, sir, I --"
149519,3,81,462000,Foreman,PLANT,"I don't want to hear about it, Simpson. You're fired. Oh, hi, girls!"
149520,3,82,467000,TERRI & SHERRI,PLANT,"Hi, Daddy."
149522,3,84,484000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Here's a good job at the fireworks factory.

149524,3,86,489000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How 'bout this: Supervising Technician at the toxic waste dump.
149525,3,87,493000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm no Supervising Technician. I'm a Technical Supervisor. I've never done anything worthwhile in my life. I'm a big worthless nothing.
149526,3,88,503000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"There, there, Homer. You'll find a job. You've caused plenty of industrial accidents and you've always bounced back."
149527,3,89,510000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, Dad. You can do it!"
149528,3,90,511000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, go for it, Dad."
149529,3,91,512000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're right! I'm young, I'm able-bodied, and I'll take anything. Watch out, Springfield, here I come."
149530,3,92,525000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't give up, Dad."
149532,3,94,527000,Homer Simpson,Bar,I'm just a Technical Supervisor who cared too much.

149537,3,99,539000,Moe Szyslak,Bar,"Hold on, I'll check. Ah, is, I.P. Freely here? Hey everybody, I.P. Freely?"
149538,3,100,549000,Moe Szyslak,Bar,"Wait a minute. Listen, to me you lousy bum! When I get a hold of you you're dead. I swear I'm gonna slice your heart in half!"
149541,3,103,563000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"You'll get that punk someday, Moe."
149542,3,104,565000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ahh, I don't know. He's tough to catch. He keeps changing his name."
149543,3,105,569000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, I think I'll have another -- -- Whoops. Moe, I'm a little low on funds. You think could cover me just this once?"

149545,3,107,578000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Why not? I think after all these years I deserve an explanation.
149546,3,108,582000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I don't think you're ever going to get another job and be able to pay me back.
149547,3,109,586000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Oh.
149548,3,110,587000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Don't worry, we're still friends."
149550,3,112,596000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Are you all right, Homer?"
149551,3,113,599000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm fine. I'm just thinking.
149554,3,114,601000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I've been thinking, too. You know, Homer, you've always been such a good provider, but when we got married, Mr. Berger promised I could come back to my old job anytime I wanted."
149555,3,115,615000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You think you can still do that kind of work?
149556,3,116,618000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Sure! You never forget. It's just like riding a bicycle.
149558,3,118,623000,PUNK TEENAGER,Berger's Burgers,"Hey, Mama, where's my fries already?"
149561,3,121,632000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Dad, eat something. It's got mustard on it."
149562,3,122,638000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,All he does is lie there like an unemployed whale.
149563,3,123,642000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I don't know what else to do.
149564,3,124,647000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"There's only one thing we can do. Take advantage of the old guy. You gotta sign my report card, Dad."
149566,3,126,657000,Tv Announcer #1,Simpson Home,"Loaftime, The Cable Network For The Unemployed, will be back with more tips on how to win the lottery right after this."
149567,3,127,666000,Tv Announcer #2,Simpson Home,"Unemployed? Out of work? Sober? You sat around the house all day, but now it's Duff time. Duff's the beer that makes the days fly by."
149568,3,128,678000,Jingle Chorus,Simpson Home,YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THAT WONDERFUL DUFF / DUFF BEER.
149569,3,129,681000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Beer! Now there's a temporary solution.
149571,3,131,686000,Homer Simpson,REFRIGERATOR,"There must be some beer here somewhere... Ah, maybe in here."
149572,3,132,693000,Homer Simpson,REFRIGERATOR,Damn!
149573,3,133,695000,Homer Simpson,REFRIGERATOR,I need money!
149576,3,136,710000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Oh, no, what have I done? I smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? A few measly cents. Not even enough to buy one beer. Wait a minute, lemme count and make sure..."
149577,3,137,726000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,Not even close.
149578,3,138,730000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"""Dear Family: I am an utter failure and you'll be better off without me. By the time you read this, I will be in my watery grave. I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: 'Stand tall, have courage and never give up.' I only hope I can provide a better model in death than I did in life. Warmest regards, Love Homer J. Simpson."""
149492,3,141,796000,Homer Simpson,Street,Nothin's easy.
149581,3,143,807000,Sylvia Winfield,Simpson Neighborhood,"Oh, looks like young Simpson is going to kill himself."
149582,3,144,811000,Old Man Winfield,Simpson Neighborhood,"Well, maybe not. Maybe he's just taking his boulder for a walk."
149584,3,146,818000,Bart Simpson,Master Bedroom,Mom! Mom! Wake up!
149585,3,147,819000,Lisa Simpson,Master Bedroom,We've been robbed!

149601,3,163,857000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Boy, this intersection is dangerous! Someone ought to put a stop sign here."
149602,3,164,864000,Marge Simpson,Street,"Oh, Homer, how could you think of killing yourself? We love you."
149603,3,165,869000,Bart Simpson,Street,"Yeah, Dad. / Yeah. / We love you."
149604,3,166,873000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Kill myself? Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do. Now I have a purpose, a reason to live. I don't care who I have to face. I don't care who I have to fight. I will not rest until this street gets a stop sign."
149607,3,169,891000,Councilman #1,CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS,"Ah, next on the agenda, Police Chief Wiggum will give us an update on our graffiti problem."

149612,3,174,921000,Marge Simpson,CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS,"Don't be nervous. We believe in you, Homer."
149616,3,175,927000,Homer Simpson,CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed Councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do. Danger comes in many, many forms, from the dinosaurs that tormented our cavemen ancestors to the --"

149629,3,188,990000,Homer Simpson,Park,Proud. Proud of what?
149630,3,189,991000,Marge Simpson,Park,"Well, everything. Your dip sign, for instance. Now people won't be caught off-guard by that little in the road."
149631,3,190,999000,Homer Simpson,Park,"Ah, what a great family! But come on, we all know this is small potatoes. There is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together."

149633,3,192,1010000,Homer Simpson,Park,I'm talking about that!
149634,3,193,1013000,Marge Simpson,Park,You don't mean you're going to take on your old bosses?

149639,3,198,1021000,Homer Simpson,Park,That's okay. I'll just assume you said what I thought I heard you say.

149650,3,208,1064000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Look at that man. He has the crowd in the palm of his hand. Haven't seen anything like it since Jolson. Who is he?
149651,3,209,1074000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"That's Homer Simpson, sir. He used to work here in the plant, but we fired him for gross incompetence."
149652,3,210,1081000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Oh, so that's his little game. Get this Simpson character up here right now."
149653,3,211,1086000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"But, Mr. Burns --"
149654,3,212,1087000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"I said, DO IT! NOW, DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!"
149656,3,214,1091000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I. Many of them, incompetent boobs.

149662,3,220,1120000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Stay here, I'll be right back."
149664,3,222,1127000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Ah, Homer Simpson, at last we meet."
149665,3,223,1132000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,Same here.
149666,3,224,1134000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Simpson. I want you to rejoin our power plant family.
149667,3,225,1138000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Sorry, no can do!"
149668,3,226,1140000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Hear me out, Simpson. I don't want you to come back as a Technical Supervisor, or Supervising Technician, or whatever the hell you used to do. I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant."
149669,3,227,1154000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about."
149670,3,228,1163000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"The generous offer I'm making is good for exactly thirty seconds, Simpson."
149674,3,229,1169000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Me in charge of safety? This place could blow sky-high. Nah. I'll concentrate on my work now. Gee, this guy's desk sure is big. I can't let Marge support the family. This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen. What should I..."
149675,3,230,1185000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Simpson! Time's up!
149676,3,231,1186000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,Umm... What the hey. I'll take the job.
149677,3,232,1188000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Excellent! Your first duty will be to step out on the balcony and tell that crowd this plant is safe.
149678,3,233,1198000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,What?
149679,3,234,1199000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Go on, Homer."
149680,3,235,1207000,Lisa Simpson,Burns's Office,"Go, Dad!"
149681,3,236,1209000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --"
149682,3,237,1219000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Oh, sit tight. I'll be right back."
149683,3,238,1227000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"I can't do it, Mr. Burns."
149684,3,239,1229000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,You mean you're willing to give up a good job and a raise just for your principles?
149685,3,240,1235000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Hmm. When you put it that way, it does sound a little far-fetched. But that's the lug you're looking at. And I vow to continue spending every free minute I have crusading for safety. Of course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job."
149686,3,241,1252000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,You're not as stupid as you look... or sound... or our best testing indicates.
149687,3,242,1257000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,You've got the job. Now get to work.
149688,3,243,1260000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,I'll get to work. But first I have to say goodbye to some friends.
149690,3,245,1269000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up, but you can't depend on me all your lives. You have to learn that there's a little Homer Simpson in all of us."
149691,3,246,1287000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,...and I'm gonna have to live with out your respect and awe. The only reason I'm telling you this is I'm going to be leaving you.
149692,3,247,1299000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"But, don't worry. I've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!"
149693,3,248,1312000,Bart Simpson,PLANT,"Hey, that's my pop up there! Dad watch out!"
149694,3,249,1317000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,Whoa! Easy! Don't drop me! Be careful.
