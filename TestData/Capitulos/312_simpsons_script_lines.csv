80026,312,1,37000,TV Announcer,Simpson Home,"Next on Comedy Central, an all-new ""South Park""!"
80027,312,2,59000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I hear those kids' voices are done by grownups.
80028,312,3,62000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, there's nothing wrong with that. I just wonder how they keep it so fresh after forty-three episodes."
80030,312,5,67000,Stan,CONCERT STADIUM,"I can't believe we paid to see a band with Steve Guttenberg, Calista Flockhart, and Farty the crippled Robot."
80031,312,6,74000,Farty,CONCERT STADIUM,Look who's in my fart: O.J.!
80032,312,7,78000,O.J.,CONCERT STADIUM,I'm gonna kill you all!
80033,312,8,83000,Milhouse Van Houten,CONCERT STADIUM,Cartoon violence! Cartoon violence!
80034,312,9,87000,O.J.,CONCERT STADIUM,Now I'm gonna find the real killers!
80038,312,12,91000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Kids, that cartoon's not life-affirming. We're going to watch a show about the everyday problems of angels."
80039,312,13,97000,Pax Announcer,Simpson Living Room,"Now back to ""Good Heavens."""
80040,312,14,100000,Silver-haired Woman,Simpson Living Room,Jesus called today.
80041,312,15,102000,Silver-haired Man,Simpson Living Room,He did?!
80044,312,18,104000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I'm bored.
80045,312,19,107000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I've got an idea. Let's tie a string around a fly."
80046,312,20,110000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Cool. Do you think bugs feel pain?
80047,312,21,114000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"If they don't, I've wasted a lot of my life."
80048,312,22,118000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I wish I could fly. Then I'd be the most popular kid in school.
80049,312,23,122000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Knowing you, you'd mess it up somehow."
80051,312,25,140000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,The fly's stuck in Flanders' house!
80052,312,26,142000,Milhouse Van Houten,Flanders Home,I'll go contact the nearest adult!
80053,312,27,144000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,There's no time. We're going in!
80054,312,28,148000,Milhouse Van Houten,Flanders Home,My eyeglass repair kit!
80055,312,29,150000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,Let it go.
80056,312,30,157000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,"Well, what do you know, cats eat flies."
80057,312,31,159000,Milhouse Van Houten,Flanders Home,Sometimes I wish a cat would eat me.
80058,312,32,162000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,"Dude, we're in Flanders' house -- unsupervised."
80059,312,33,166000,Milhouse Van Houten,Flanders Home,Wow! Let's go nuts!
80060,312,34,168000,Milhouse Van Houten,Flanders Home,"Bright, brighter, brightest... off, bright, brighter, brightest... off."
80061,312,35,177000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,That is so gay.
80062,312,36,184000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,These losers are out of peanut butter.
80063,312,37,186000,Milhouse Van Houten,Flanders Home,I know how to make some.
80064,312,38,188000,Milhouse Van Houten,Flanders Home,"Peanuts... butter... now, we just put the top on..."
80065,312,39,194000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,"Hey, I didn't get where I am putting tops on things."
80066,312,40,200000,Milhouse Van Houten,Flanders Home,Now let's make jelly!
80067,312,41,206000,Milhouse Van Houten,Flanders Home,I feel like luge silver medalist Barbara Niedernhuber!
80070,312,44,221000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,"Wow, Mr. Flanders is really into the Beatles."
80071,312,45,224000,Milhouse Van Houten,Flanders Home,What are the Beatles?
80037,312,46,225000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,They wrote all the songs on Maggie's baby records.
80073,312,47,229000,Milhouse Van Houten,Flanders Home,"John Lemon, Orange Harrison, Paul McIced Tea, Mango Starr? Hey Bart, how 'bout a blast from the past?"
80074,312,48,239000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,A forty-year-old novelty beverage? Hand it over!
80076,312,50,261000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,Yellow matter custard... dripping from a dead dog's eye...
80077,312,51,265000,Milhouse Van Houten,Flanders Home,I don't feel so fab.
80078,312,52,269000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Well, the folks at the senior center sure will love that peach tree we planted."
80079,312,53,273000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,I wish we could see their happy faces.
80080,312,54,275000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Sin of pride, Roddy."
80081,312,55,277000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,I'm sorry.
80082,312,56,278000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Sin of regret.
80083,312,57,283000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,The house is slightly askew! To the panic room!
80084,312,58,294000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,"Daddy, I'm scared!"
80085,312,59,296000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Scared of what? All the funny camp songs we're gonna sing? WE'LL BE SAFE INSIDE OUR FORTRESS WHEN THEY COME / WE'LL BE SAFE FROM CREEPS AND KILLERS WHEN THEY COME / UNLESS THEY HAVE A BLOWTORCH / OR A POISON GAS INJECTOR / THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN WHEN THEY COME!
80087,312,61,316000,Chief Wiggum,FRONT OF FLANDERS HOUSE,"Okay, home invaders! We don't want to hurt you -- we just want to talk."
80088,312,62,322000,Lou,FRONT OF FLANDERS HOUSE,"Well, if you just wanna talk, why don't we talk about Eddie sleeping with my ex-wife."
80089,312,63,326000,Chief Wiggum,FRONT OF FLANDERS HOUSE,I thought the divorce was final.
80090,312,64,327000,Lou,FRONT OF FLANDERS HOUSE,When is a divorce ever final?
80091,312,65,329000,Chief Wiggum,FRONT OF FLANDERS HOUSE,"All right, let's just move in."
80093,312,67,339000,Chief Wiggum,Flanders Home,"All right, perps. We know you're in here somewhere."
80094,312,68,349000,Chief Wiggum,Flanders Home,"Well, well, well. Looks like a couple of punks are gonna be taking the last train to Clarksville."
80095,312,69,356000,Lou,Flanders Home,"That's the Monkees, Chief."
80096,312,70,357000,Chief Wiggum,Flanders Home,Go wait in the car.
80097,312,71,359000,Lou,Flanders Home,It was the Monkees.
80098,312,72,361000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,Please don't call our parents!
80099,312,73,363000,Chief Wiggum,Flanders Home,"I'm afraid I have to for hijinks like these. Heh. ""Hijinks."" Funny word. Three dotted letters in a row."
80100,312,74,370000,Eddie,Flanders Home,Is it hyphenated?
80102,312,75,371000,Chief Wiggum,Flanders Home,"It used to be. Back in the bad old days. Of course, every generation hyphenates the way it wants to. Then there's NSYNC. Ha. What the Hell is that? Jump in any time, Eddie. These are good topics."
80103,312,76,386000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Ned, I am so sorry."
80104,312,77,390000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,I never knew you were such a Beatles fan.
80105,312,78,392000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Of course I am. They were bigger than Jesus! But your boy went Yoko and broke up my collection.
80106,312,79,398000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,"Hey, boys will be boys."
80107,312,80,400000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,I am so tired of that tautology.
80108,312,81,403000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,It's not all his fault. I blame this latchkey kid.
80109,312,82,406000,Chief Wiggum,Flanders Home,"People, people. Calm down. Both these kids are total write-offs. Uh, I assume you're pressing charges. Because I get paid by the charge."
80110,312,83,414000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Oh our courts aren't fit to keep children in line. The only thing they're good for is telling women what to do with their bodies. What these boys need is adult supervision.
80111,312,84,422000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"You are so right, Ned. There won't be a single minute where Bart's not under the watchful eye of myself or... Homer, get over here!"
80112,312,85,431000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Look at me, I'm Brian Epstein!"
80113,312,86,433000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Now I'm Michael Jackson. I own all your songs, losers. Hee, hee, hee."
80115,312,88,439000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here are some supervised activities we can all do together. Future Veterans of Foreign Wars, The 5-H Club..."
80116,312,89,443000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Five-H?
80117,312,90,449000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,They had to admit homosexuals.
80118,312,91,452000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,How come I'm not doing this stuff with Milhouse?
80119,312,92,455000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You won't be seeing Milhouse for a while. Something about that boy just shakes up your soda. Ooh, this looks interesting: The Pre-Teen Braves."
80120,312,93,460000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, these freaks do a lot of cool stuff. ""Cookouts, hayrides, bowling..."""
80121,312,94,468000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Just like real Indians!
80122,312,95,473000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, maybe you could lead Bart's tribe."
80123,312,96,475000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean like some sort of madman?
80124,312,97,477000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ideally no, but..."
80125,312,98,478000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll do it!
80101,312,99,479000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I AM HOMER TRIBAL CHIEF / I AM WEARING TINY BRIEFS / BRAVES TEACH VALUE BOYS SHOULD KNOW / NOW EXTENDED DRUM SO-LO
80126,312,100,506000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I will now give each of you your specially selected tribal name.
79972,312,101,510000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Pick one.
80127,312,102,512000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"I am ""Burger With Fries."" Man, is that uninspired."
80128,312,103,516000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Let's see. What Native American activities should we do? Making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the Civil War."
80129,312,104,527000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Lazy Horse! Find us something cool to do."
80130,312,105,534000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The noble Chiefs outsmarted the treacherous Cowboys with a seven-yard screen pass. Unfortunately, after further review, the great father in the sky determined that the receiver's moccasins were out of bounds. I shall bet no more forever."
80132,312,107,551000,Lisa Simpson,KITCHEN,I don't think Dad is accurately portraying Native American life.
80133,312,108,555000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,"Yeah, Indians don't sit around drinking beer and watching TV."
80136,312,111,559000,Nelson Muntz,LIVING ROOM,I smell smoke.
80137,312,112,561000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Without the talking stick, we don't hear you."
80138,312,113,563000,Nelson Muntz,LIVING ROOM,I smell smoke.
80141,312,116,569000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I see you Braves received our smoke signal.
80142,312,117,572000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Wow! / Neat-o! / Awesome!
80144,312,119,574000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh no! The Pawnee have returned. They probably want their souls back.
80145,312,120,579000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Wow Mom, I wish you were our tribe leader."
80146,312,121,582000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hail to our new Chief! The surprisingly hot Mrs. Simpson.
80147,312,122,586000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, thank you. I'm gonna make sure you boys have the best possible Pre-Teen Brave experience."
80148,312,123,593000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"But I was chosen by the Great Spirit to teach these young braves the ways of the antelope and the ear of corn... which we call maize... that the papoose... eh, I'll be at Moe's talking normal."
80150,312,125,610000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nelson, leggings?"
80151,312,126,612000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"No way! If my old man sees me in these, he'll kill me."
80152,312,127,616000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You haven't seen your dad in years.
80153,312,128,617000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"Hey, today might be the day!"
80154,312,129,619000,Man's Voice,Simpson Home,Nelson?
80155,312,130,622000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"Poppa, is that you? You came back from the store!"
80072,312,131,629000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Who is he talking to?
80156,312,132,631000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Let's admire Nelson's love of nature.
80157,312,133,634000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Poppa! Poppa! Never leave me again!
80158,312,134,639000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,All right. Everyone inside. Let's go.
80160,312,136,644000,Marge Simpson,Woods,Our nature walk will be hosted by a full-blooded Native American. Say hello to Jim Proudfoot from the Mohican tribe.
80161,312,137,652000,Bart Simpson,Woods,Mohican? I thought you guys were all gone.
80162,312,138,656000,Jim Proudfoot,Woods,No. But we encourage the myth. Chicks really dig you when you're the last of something.
80163,312,139,661000,Database,Woods,Are we on Indian land?
80164,312,140,664000,Jim Proudfoot,Woods,It once was. My tribe's land stretched from that Krusty Burger down to Gary's Waterbed Warehouse.
80165,312,141,671000,Kids,Woods,Wow...
80166,312,142,673000,Jim Proudfoot,Woods,The great spirit blessed us with beauty and abundance.
80167,312,143,684000,Jim Proudfoot,Woods,"The land gave birth to the trees, the animals frolicked in the waters, and the wind was so gentle it would tie your shoes for you."
80168,312,144,692000,Jim Proudfoot,Woods,But that harmony has been shattered.
80169,312,145,695000,Jim Proudfoot,Woods,And now the land weeps.
80170,312,146,706000,Homer Simpson,Woods,"Hey, treadmill! How do you like this incline?"
80171,312,147,713000,Homer Simpson,Woods,"Uh, I'm giving it back to the earth."
80173,312,149,722000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What are we gonna do to that field?
80174,312,150,724000,Boys,Simpson Home,Clean it!
80175,312,151,725000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And why are we gonna do it?
80176,312,152,726000,Boys,Simpson Home,Liberal guilt!
80177,312,153,728000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Yay!
80178,312,154,729000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm so proud of what you guys are doing. I even tipped off the local paper.
80179,312,155,734000,Dave Shutton,Simpson Home,"Yeah, she sure did! And I've already got the perfect headline: ""Activity Participated in by Some."" Hey, that's great."
80181,312,157,744000,Marge Simpson,Wooded Area,"Let's go, boys. Make sure you use Pine Sol on those pine trees, for that pine fresh smell."
80182,312,158,751000,Nelson Muntz,Wooded Area,Poppa?
80183,312,159,753000,Marge Simpson,Wooded Area,"Oh for God's sake, I can see why he left. Now all of you, get cleaning."
80185,312,161,767000,Bart Simpson,Wooded Area,Hey! Some jerks cleaned our field!
80186,312,162,769000,Nelson Muntz,Wooded Area,It's awful. It looks like Wisconsin!
80187,312,163,773000,Kirk Van Houten,Wooded Area,I hereby declare this area cleaned up by the Cavalry Kids!
80003,312,164,781000,Kirk Van Houten,Wooded Area,Whoops.
80188,312,165,784000,Kirk Van Houten,Wooded Area,It was already dead.
80189,312,166,789000,Kirk Van Houten,Wooded Area,"Boy, I got up on the wrong side of the futon today."
80190,312,167,793000,Bart Simpson,Wooded Area,"""Cavalry Kids?"" That's pathetic."
80191,312,168,796000,Milhouse Van Houten,Wooded Area,We're the bad boys of non-denominational community youth groups.
80192,312,169,800000,Marge Simpson,Wooded Area,"Well, surely there's room in this town for two well-meaning juvenile associations."
80193,312,170,806000,Kirk Van Houten,Wooded Area,Yeah. But the Girl Scouts already control the south side.
80194,312,171,809000,Marge Simpson,Wooded Area,Then I guess this means war.
80195,312,172,818000,Ralph Wiggum,Wooded Area,Will you be my mommy?
80196,312,173,821000,Ralph Wiggum,Wooded Area,You smell like dead bunnies.
80198,312,175,829000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Those Cavalry Kids are bigger credit hogs than the Red Cross.
80199,312,176,833000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"I must disagree, Mrs. Bart. They've painted this town with a fresh coat of give-a-hoot."
80200,312,177,838000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Well you ain't seen nothin' till you've seen the Pre-Teen Braves.
80201,312,178,842000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Pre-Teen Braves? Is this another of those youth groups that apes the cultures of those indigenous peoples you invaded and destroyed?
80202,312,179,849000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Exactly. The Pre-Teen Braves.
80203,312,180,887000,Drederick Tatum,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hello. I'm heavyweight champ Drederick Tatum, here to issue a challenge to the youth groups of Springfield. Whichever one of you sells the most candy will be honorary batboys at the next Isotopes home game!"
80205,312,182,901000,Drederick Tatum,Simpson Home,"Proceeds will go towards keeping people like me off the streets. I can't help myself: punch and grope, punch and grope. That's all I was taught."
80207,312,184,908000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,This is a perfect opportunity. We'll beat those Cavalry Kids by selling candy!
80208,312,185,915000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Living Room,I'm a brick!
80209,312,186,917000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"""We will crush you and smother your dreams. Yours in Christ, the Cavalry Kids."""
80210,312,187,920000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Marge, you were an excellent peace-time Chief. But these times call for men of cruelty."
80211,312,188,929000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, it's too tight! Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!"
80212,312,189,933000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Men of cruelty.
80214,312,191,949000,Homer Simpson,Van Houten Home,"Okay, Bart. Back up the truck."
80216,312,193,953000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,"Mr. Leonard, Mr. Carlson? Would you like to buy some candy bars for charity?"
80217,312,194,958000,Carl Carlson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh sure. We were just gonna buy the same candy inside the store, but for less."
80218,312,195,965000,Lenny Leonard,Kwik-E-Mart,"Aw man, that went south quick. I gotta find a bathroom."
80219,312,196,970000,Sideshow Mel,Kwik-E-Mart,Your candy is tainted! The batboy prize is forever beyond your reach!
80220,312,197,976000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Candy for sale!
80221,312,198,978000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Get your un-poisoned candy!
80222,312,199,980000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,It's laxative-free for today's lifestyle!
80223,312,200,983000,Nelson Muntz,Kwik-E-Mart,"Melts in your mouth, not in your pants!"
80225,312,202,987000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Greetings, fellow Springfielders. It gives me great pleasure to announce the group which has sold the most candy. Could everyone please lean forward expectantly."
80226,312,203,1002000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,...The Cavalry Kids!
80227,312,204,1006000,Junior Dandy Chief,Springfield Town Hall,"Oh, the indignity!"
80228,312,205,1010000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Wait a minute. How could those stupid jar-heads win?
80229,312,206,1013000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Who'd want candy filled with laxatives?
80231,312,208,1017000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Holy moly, I'm movin' like Ginger Rogers!"
