75091,294,174,823000,Bart Simpson,STATE LEGISLATURE,Homework on a field trip? What have you been huffin'?
75094,294,177,828000,Lisa Simpson,Hotel Room,"Well, Bart's being his usual jerky self... but Mom, I'm really excited about this new flag design. Oh, and the hotel gives you a free USA Today outside your room... No, I'm sure it's free... Okay, I won't touch it."

75166,294,248,1082000,Lisa Simpson,THICK WOODS,"Bart, you're my big brother. You should act like it more often. You know, protect me from the bad things in the world."

75175,294,257,1110000,Bart Simpson,THICK WOODS,"Yeah, funny story. One day, I was really bored. And Dad had left the steam roller idling in the driveway..."
75177,294,259,1117000,Homer Simpson,Capitol Building,This is where the kids were last seen.
75178,294,260,1121000,Marge Simpson,Capitol Building,The plastic casing from the tip of Bart's shoelace! A mother knows!
75179,294,261,1126000,Homer Simpson,Capitol Building,"Well, he's not gonna get very far without that."

75202,294,284,1215000,Seymour Skinner,Capital City,"And Lisa, you have a choice. You may continue to be challenged in third grade, or return to second grade and be merely a big fish in a small pond--"
