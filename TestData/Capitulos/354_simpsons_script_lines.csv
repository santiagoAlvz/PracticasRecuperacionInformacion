91600,354,1,29000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, kids! I scream, you scream, we all scream for..."
91601,354,2,33000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Haircuts!
91603,354,4,40000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, Bart and I have been talking..."
91604,354,5,42000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You have?! That's so nice!
91605,354,6,45000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"What Lisa's trying to say is... there's a new kids' barbershop in the mall, and we'd like to start going there."
91606,354,7,52000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,A kids' barbershop? But they don't have my templates.
91607,354,8,56000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, the templates had a great run. But we'd like our hair to look like um... people hair."
91608,354,9,61000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh. I see. Well, good luck getting to your precious mall barber, 'cause I'm not driving you."
91609,354,10,67000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, wanna go to the mall?! They're baking fresh Cinnabons... which means they're throwing out the old ones!"
91610,354,11,73000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Yay!
91611,354,12,80000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess I'll just cut my own hair.
91613,354,14,82000,Baha Men,Springfield Mall,WHO WANTS THEIR HAIR CUT? / WHO? WHO? WHO? WHO? WHO? / WHO WANTS THEIR HAIR CUT? / WHO? WHO? WHO? WHO? WHO? / WHO WANTS THEIR HAIR CUT? / WHO? WHO? WHO? /
91614,354,15,94000,Barber,Springfield Mall,Which side do you want your part on?
91615,354,16,96000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Left! Right! Stab! Stab! Stab!
91583,354,17,99000,Barber,Springfield Mall,You're the boss.
91584,354,18,101000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,What the Hell?
91585,354,19,104000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Whoa!
91616,354,20,107000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Bart, you look worse than Aunt Patty in the morning. And there ain't nothin' looks worse than Aunt Patty in the morning."
91618,354,22,124000,Stylist,Springfield Mall,Next!
91619,354,23,126000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Mall,Can you make me look like this?
91621,354,25,132000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,My bad-boy spikes!
91622,354,26,135000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,My good-girl points!
91624,354,28,147000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Mall,"The best photographs, or ""photos"", will be prominently displayed in the school lobby all year long."
91627,354,31,159000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Mall,After 'em!
91629,354,33,163000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Oh, I love you, Dumpster-bons."
91630,354,34,167000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,Dad?!
91631,354,35,168000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Oh, big surprise. The fat guy's eating garbage."
91632,354,36,172000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,Come on -- we'll hide in the theater!
91633,354,37,173000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Mall,"Well, I guess you didn't find anything interesting to photograph."
91634,354,38,182000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Mall,Check it out! The principal's got a shirt wiener!
91635,354,39,189000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Mall,"Leave your body, Seymour. Leave your body."
91636,354,40,195000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"""Left Below."" Ooh, a ""He Is Risen"" production!"
91637,354,41,203000,Wife,Springfield Mall,"I wish you'd come to church with us, sweetheart."
91638,354,42,205000,Businessman,Springfield Mall,Church? I'd rather play golf on the holiest day of the week.
91639,354,43,209000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Finally, a character I can relate to. I bet good things happen to him."
91640,354,44,214000,Wife,Springfield Mall,"But, honey, with recent troubles in the Mideast and other ominous signs, the Rapture could soon be upon us."
91641,354,45,220000,Businessman,Springfield Mall,"The Rapture? Easy there, Helen. Science has shown religion is just an old wives' tale."
91643,354,47,222000,Businessman,Springfield Mall,"I'm sorry, but the only thing I'm praying for is that you take it easy on our credit cards."
91645,354,49,236000,Secretary,Limousine,"Oh, Mr. Thompson, what if your wife finds out?"
91646,354,50,240000,Businessman,Limousine,"Hey, it's modern times. Everyone's doing it."
91647,354,51,244000,Businessman,Limousine,Where did my Christian limo driver go?
91649,354,53,252000,Old Woman,Street,My pious husband is missing!
91586,354,54,254000,Mother,Street,The baby I chose to have baptized is gone!
91650,354,55,260000,Secretary,Street,"Mr. Thompson, what's happening?!"
91651,354,56,263000,Businessman,Street,"It's the Rapture, Shawna. The Rapture. The virtuous have gone to heaven, and the rest of us have been... left below!"
91652,354,57,269000,Homer Simpson,Street,Left below?! Where have I heard that before?
91653,354,58,273000,Lisa Simpson,Street,It's the title of the movie.
91654,354,59,275000,Homer Simpson,Street,It's everywhere!
91655,354,60,276000,Businessman,Street,We were fools! And because we rejected God -- tacitly accepting Satan -- we must suffer through the Apocalypse.
91656,354,61,287000,Buddhist Monk,Street,I thought all religions were a path to God. I was wrong!
91657,354,62,294000,Anguished Woman,Street,Why did I put my faith in science and technology?!
91658,354,63,299000,Man,Street,Why did I choose to be gay?
91659,354,64,302000,Homer Simpson,Street,"This movie will haunt me for the rest of my life, just like Cannonball Run Two."
91661,354,66,309000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge... what if the Rapture is coming and I haven't led a good enough life? I could be... left below!
91662,354,67,315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetie, don't worry. God wouldn't spring the Rapture on us unannounced. He'd send us signs, like, I don't know, all the dogs getting on a spaceship and leaving."
91663,354,68,326000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I'll bet the cats would be psyched about that. Thanks Marge, you've put my mind at ease. Now how about a little ""rapture"" for Mama?"
91664,354,69,337000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, I could be the Rachel to your Jacob."
91665,354,70,340000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, but it's tough for me not to think about their hardship."
91668,354,73,347000,Homer Simpson,Car,Marge is right -- the Rapture isn't coming! There haven't been any ominous signs!
91669,354,74,352000,Devil,Car,Follow me!
91670,354,75,359000,Store Manager,Car,"It's just not workin' out, Barry."
91671,354,76,361000,MAN IN DEVIL SUIT,Car,Yeah. I guess I'd better study for the police exam again.
91672,354,77,364000,Store Manager,Car,Good luck.
91673,354,78,364000,MAN IN DEVIL SUIT,Car,You too.
91674,354,79,370000,Homer Simpson,Car,Blood is raining from the sky!
91675,354,80,375000,Marine Biologist,Car,"Hang on there, big fella! We'll save ya!"
91676,354,81,380000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Car,"This ain't personal, I just love to scrimshaw."
91678,354,83,387000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Judgment day is at hand.
91680,354,86,397000,Bookstore Clerk,Gospel for Less,Can I help you? We're having a sale on Bible magnifying glasses.
91681,354,87,400000,Homer Simpson,Gospel for Less,"Begat. Uh, do you have any books on the Rapture?"
91682,354,88,405000,Bookstore Clerk,Gospel for Less,"Yes, this one is fifteen per cent off."
91683,354,89,409000,Homer Simpson,Gospel for Less,I'll take everything you've got!
91684,354,90,410000,Bookstore Clerk,Gospel for Less,"And would you like to take advantage of our ""Friends of Flanders"" discount?"
91685,354,91,413000,Homer Simpson,Gospel for Less,"No, thank you."
91687,354,93,416000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here's a pretty little wig for Lisa, and a handsome toupee for Bart!"
91688,354,94,425000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, you still think I'm crazy for saving all your hair trimmings?"
91689,354,95,429000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, ma'am."
91690,354,96,430000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay then. Let's get the rest of this hair back in the freezer.
91692,354,98,433000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,"Homer, you didn't touch your second dinner tonight. And you're reading books! Word books! What's going on?"
91693,354,99,442000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Marge, the Rapture is nigh. These books will help me figure out how nigh."
91694,354,100,446000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,This whole deal is scientifically proven. The Book of Revelation has four hundred and four verses... add the number of people at The Last Supper...
91695,354,101,454000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,...minus the number of Filipinos in the Bible...And you get...
91696,354,102,458000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"He writes ""3150518"" on the board."
91697,354,103,458000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,"Three million, one hundred and--"
91698,354,104,458000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,Up bup bup!
91699,354,105,461000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Three fifteen p.m., May 18th! That's when the Rapture will be!"
91700,354,106,466000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,May eighteenth? That's one week from today!
91701,354,107,468000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,A week? That's...seven days from now!
91703,354,109,474000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,The world will end next week! Spend your children's college fund! Thaw that turkey now!
91704,354,110,481000,Kent Brockman,Springfield,"This is Kent Brockman reporting live from downtown Springfield, where overweight doomsayer Homer Simpson is predicting the world will end... next Wednesday! Homer, what turned you from sad drunk to mad monk?"
91705,354,111,493000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Funny story, Kent. It's the end of the world! God loves you! He's gonna kill you!"
91707,354,112,500000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Here's my angle: there's no way in God's Heaven I should get into God's Heaven. But maybe he'll let me in, if I warn others the Apocalypse is coming, as I previously shouted."
91708,354,113,510000,Kent Brockman,Springfield,"I see. Well, we have thirty seconds left -- any other cuckoo yip yap?"
91709,354,114,515000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Uhhh...
91710,354,115,516000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Here's one -- Revelation 6:13. Just before the Rapture, ""the stars will fall to the Earth."" So all you hippies out there might want to for that one."
91711,354,116,526000,Kent Brockman,Springfield,"There you have it, folks. And if I can make a prediction of my own, this weekend's Springfield Lettuce Festival is gonna be bigger and better than ever. We've got romaine, ice berg, radicchio, and everyone's favorite, baby bibb. Even a few cabbages are getting in on the fun."
91713,354,118,542000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I'm glad you're getting exercise, I just wish it wasn't crazy exercise."
91714,354,119,547000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, in a world gone mad, only a lunatic is truly insane."
91715,354,120,552000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, we love you, but we just don't think the world is coming to an end. Yet. A hundred years, global warming... we're goners. But for now, do you think you could lighten up on this ""left below"" stuff?"
91716,354,121,566000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... I guess this thing does look pretty silly. Let's all take off our sandwich boards and watch TV.
91717,354,122,573000,Sideshow Mel,Simpson Home,"Live, from Springfield Stadium, it's Krusty the Clown's Celebrity Salute to Specials!"
91718,354,123,579000,Sideshow Mel,Simpson Home,"The crowd is abuzz and agog as the celebrity blimp approaches. And look, here's America's favorite waste of taxpayer dollars -- the Blue Angels!"
91720,354,125,593000,Krusty the Clown,Blimp,What the...? The Blue Angels? I thought we were gettin' Charlie's Angels.
91721,354,126,601000,Krusty the Clown,Blimp,Oh God! We're going down! I don't wanna die next to Kathy Griffin!
91723,354,128,611000,Marge Simpson,Simpson TV Room,The stars are falling to the earth!
91724,354,129,611000,Marge Simpson,Simpson TV Room,Just as you predicted.
91725,354,130,618000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson TV Room,"Well, that's our show for tonight."
91726,354,131,620000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson TV Room,"I'd like to thank all the very talented people who broke my fall. To all the fans of Los Lobos, mucho, mucho condolences."
91727,354,132,630000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson TV Room,Goodnight everybody!
91316,354,134,634000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"Homer, you were right!"
91706,354,135,635000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,That must mean you're right about the Rapture too.
91729,354,136,638000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I was wonderin' if you could help save my soul. I've done stuff I ain't proud of. And the stuff I am proud of is disgusting."
91730,354,137,645000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"So, what are we supposed to do on Wednesday? Lie naked on our roof?"
91731,354,138,648000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,'Cause that girl's school says I can't do that no more.
91732,354,139,650000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"When the time comes, we won't be in our homes...because we're all gonna go here."
91733,354,140,657000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,"That's Springfield Mesa! It's fifteen miles north, past the Warren Harding Memorial Through-hole!"
91734,354,141,664000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Exactly. It came to me in a vision. Or maybe it was a drunken haze. Or, possibly, an ice cream headache."
91735,354,142,669000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, well, well, looks like someone's having a pre-Rapture party."
91736,354,143,673000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Flanders. It's... uh... a meeting of gay witches for abortion. You wouldn't be interested."
91737,354,144,682000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, everybody. Pair up with a Rapture buddy who will watch your back through all eternity."
91738,354,145,687000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"Chief Wiggum, wanna be my buddy?"
91739,354,146,689000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,What's wrong with Carl? Trouble in paradise?
91740,354,147,692000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, please don't go through with this. All through history, self-anointed seers have predicted the end of the world, and they've always been wrong."
91741,354,148,701000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But sweetheart, I have something they didn't have -- a good feeling about this."
91742,354,149,706000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's all right, Lisa. Don't go. More Heaven for me."
91743,354,150,709000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa's going! We're all going!
91744,354,151,711000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, Lisa. No one in this family is being left below."
91745,354,152,714000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Wait for me! I'm a-comin'!
91746,354,153,718000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Dad! There's a bus coming for you! Drive, drive!"
91748,354,155,721000,Townsfolk,DESERT HIGHWAY,NINETY-NINE MINUTES UNTIL WE'RE ALL SAVED
91750,354,157,724000,Townsfolk,Bus,"NINETY-NINE MINUTES TO GO / UNLESS IT TURNS OUT, THAT YOU'RE NOT DEVOUT"
91751,354,158,729000,Townsfolk,Bus,THEN YOU'RE GONNA BE LEFT DOWN BELOW... NINETY-EIGHT MINUTES UNTIL WE'RE ALL SA...
91753,354,160,735000,Grampa Simpson,Desert,Wait for me! Wait for me!
91755,354,162,742000,Homer Simpson,MESA,"Okay, guys. Get ready! We're just seconds away!"
91756,354,163,746000,Townsfolk,MESA,"/ You saved us, Homer. / I can't wait."
91757,354,164,749000,Moe Szyslak,MESA,I'm gonna steal God's secrets and sell 'em to Satan!
91758,354,165,751000,Townsfolk,MESA,Six... five... four...
91759,354,166,754000,Marge Simpson,MESA,"I'm so proud of you, Homie!"
91760,354,167,757000,Townsfolk,MESA,Two... one...
91761,354,168,757000,Homer Simpson,MESA,"Goodbye, stupid Earth!"
91762,354,169,765000,Sideshow Mel,MESA,There appears to be some delay!
91763,354,170,767000,Homer Simpson,MESA,Huh. My watch must be running fast. Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...
91764,354,171,777000,Homer Simpson,MESA,Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...
91765,354,172,785000,Homer Simpson,MESA,Wait for it... wait for it...
91766,354,173,789000,Nelson Muntz,MESA,Haw haw. Life goes on!
91768,354,175,795000,Homer Simpson,MESA,Please don't go! Please? Please? I command you!
91769,354,176,800000,Marge Simpson,MESA,Homie... I'd better start dinner.
91770,354,177,805000,Homer Simpson,MESA,"Lisa, you still believe in me, don't you?"
91771,354,178,808000,Lisa Simpson,MESA,"Dad, if you'll recall, I never believed in you, not for one second."
91772,354,179,813000,Homer Simpson,MESA,"Aw, that's my girl."
91774,354,181,822000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield Street,"Hey, Nostra-dumbass -- did the Rapture come? I can't recall. Oh, in fact I can recall, and it didn't, and you suck."
91775,354,182,829000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Street,"Hey, Fatwad! Here's another thing you didn't predict."
91776,354,183,835000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Let's go to Moe's. We'll walk and punch.
91777,354,184,840000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Huh?
91779,354,186,852000,Homer Simpson,SUSHI BAR,"Moe, what happened to your eponymous tavern?"
91780,354,187,854000,Moe Szyslak,SUSHI BAR,"Yeah, funny thing, that. You said the end was comin', so I sold the bar to some Japanese businessmen and gave the money to charity. Now them orphans got new skip ropes, and I end every day smelling like eel. Cats are all over me. Thank you, though. You did me a solid."
91781,354,188,870000,Agnes Skinner,SUSHI BAR,"Hey, there's that jerk who tried to save us!"
91782,354,189,873000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,SUSHI BAR,"Nice Rapture, Einstein!"
91784,354,191,891000,Homer Simpson,SUSHI BAR,"Hey, you with the tempura -- your arm broken?"
91786,354,193,894000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"...Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen?! Twelve apostles... but Jesus was at the last supper too! This changes everything."
91787,354,194,918000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Multiply by seven... don't forget to carry the six, six, six..."
91788,354,195,922000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wake up! The Rapture is coming in half an hour! There's no time to waste! Marge, grill a chicken! No, make sandwiches! And some Kettle Chips would be nice! Original, not barbecue!"
91789,354,196,936000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We've got school tomorrow.
91790,354,197,939000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, school."
91791,354,198,942000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Forget school! We have to get to the mesa!
91792,354,199,944000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"We're not going anywhere, except to bed!"
91793,354,200,947000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But my prediction says--
91794,354,201,948000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You couldn't predict six o'clock at five thirty! Now good night!
91796,354,203,965000,Homer Simpson,DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE SPRINGFIELD,Stupid family... won't even come to my Rapture... I went to Lisa's school play -- which had serious pacing problems.
91798,354,205,975000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MESA,Three... two... one...
91799,354,206,982000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MESA,"Oh, I'm wrong again. I'm nothing but a big, fat... oh!"
91800,354,207,986000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MESA,Woo hoo! I was right!
91801,354,208,990000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MESA,And there's the Earth. So beautiful with your many rings.
91803,354,210,1003000,EURO-TRASH VOICE,UPSCALE RESORT LOBBY,Coming!

91809,354,216,1022000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,How come it's not open yet?
91810,354,217,1024000,ARCHANGEL,HEAVEN,"Look, just don't use leprechaun labor. Okay? Don't do it."
91811,354,218,1028000,ARCHANGEL,HEAVEN,"And the best part of Heaven is, anything you wish for, you get... lickity split!"
91812,354,219,1034000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,Hm...
91814,354,221,1041000,ARCHANGEL,HEAVEN,"Okay, just for that, your room's next to the kiddie pool. All right, Mister smarty-head exploder?"

91818,354,224,1054000,Homer Simpson,Swanky Hotel Suite,"Oh, sorry, uh -- I'd tip you, but I don't have any cash."

91821,354,227,1062000,Homer Simpson,Swanky Hotel Suite,"Wait! Before you go, there's one thing I gotta know. What happened to my family?"
91822,354,228,1069000,TV Announcer,Swanky Hotel Suite,Heaven has a wide array of fine dining just steps from your room. Have a light bite at the Pope of Sandwich Village.
91823,354,229,1075000,ARCHANGEL,Swanky Hotel Suite,"Okay, let's see... Earth is channel twenty-three, I think."
91824,354,230,1087000,Lisa Simpson,Swanky Hotel Suite,Why didn't we listen to Dad?
91825,354,231,1090000,Marge Simpson,Swanky Hotel Suite,The worst part is I'll never see my Homie again!
91826,354,232,1094000,Demon,Swanky Hotel Suite,That's the worst part? Then I'm not doing my job.
91828,354,234,1101000,Homer Simpson,Swanky Hotel Suite,I've gotta save them.
91830,354,236,1112000,God,God's Office,"Homer, what's wrong?"
91831,354,237,1115000,Homer Simpson,God's Office,"Lord, you got a first-class destination resort here. Really top notch. But I can't enjoy myself knowing my family is suffering."
91832,354,238,1122000,God,God's Office,"Oh, don't tell me about family suffering. My Son went down to Earth once. I don't know what you people did to Him, but He hasn't been the same since."
91833,354,239,1135000,Homer Simpson,God's Office,"Oh, he'll be fine. And you could still spare my family by--"
91834,354,240,1138000,God,God's Office,Pass.
91835,354,241,1139000,Homer Simpson,God's Office,"Buddy, you just made yourself a powerful enemy."
91837,354,243,1155000,Dean Martin,HEAVEN,"Hey, what's the big idea, pally? Why so crabby?"

91840,354,246,1167000,Dean Martin,HEAVEN,Squandered my gift? I made sixty-eight albums.
91841,354,247,1178000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,I'm sorry. But Heaven isn't Heaven without my family in it.
91842,354,248,1183000,God,HEAVEN,"What do you want, Homer?"
91843,354,249,1185000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,"Just send me back to Earth, and put off this whole Rapture hoop-de-do for another couple of years or so."
91844,354,250,1190000,God,HEAVEN,"But it's already started. To do what you're asking, I'd have to turn back time."
91845,354,251,1195000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,Superman did it.
91846,354,252,1196000,God,HEAVEN,"Fine, Mr. Smarty-pants. I will undo the Apocalypse."
91816,354,253,1200000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,Thanks. Listen... could you do me one more favor?
91848,354,254,1204000,God,HEAVEN,You want me to help you with your alcoholism?
91849,354,255,1207000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,"No, I'm in a good place with that."
91850,354,256,1209000,God,HEAVEN,Why don't you just take these pamphlets?
91851,354,257,1211000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,"Yeah, I'll definitely read those later."
91852,354,258,1214000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,"Now listen, if you could just see your way clear to..."
91853,354,259,1219000,God,HEAVEN,Very well. Deus ex machina!
91856,354,262,1229000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MESA,It was all just a dream.
91857,354,263,1232000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MESA,"But what are these wings? Oh, it's just a seagull stuck in my back."
91858,354,264,1238000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MESA,"Dad, we've been so worried about you!"
91859,354,265,1241000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MESA,The Warren Harding Through-hole never seemed so long.
91860,354,266,1245000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD MESA,"Yeah, I missed you guys too. Now if you'll excuse me..."
