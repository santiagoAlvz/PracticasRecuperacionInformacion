101308,390,174,927000,Bart Simpson,North Haverbrook Courthouse,"Look, Darcy, maybe there's still a way we can get married."
101309,390,175,931000,Darcy,North Haverbrook Courthouse,How? You're just a kid!
101310,390,176,933000,Female Clerk,North Haverbrook Courthouse,"Maybe I shouldn't be telling you this, but there is a state where the marriage laws are a little looser. Utah."
101311,390,177,940000,Bart Simpson,North Haverbrook Courthouse,Utah? Home of America's most powerful weirdoes?
