116105,449,126,504000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Girls are easy: girls love daddy, girls make birthday cards with glitter on them, girls can marry a hockey player and get me seats to hockey games, girls don't steal my knives...and I don't have to tell girls how their bodies work, 'cause I don't know."
116106,449,127,519000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You never told me how my body works.
116107,449,128,521000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Point and shoot.
116109,449,130,526000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,My Dad is such a jerk. I want a brother and he said no.
116110,449,131,530000,Nelson Muntz,Evergreen Terrace,Maybe you could trick your parents into making a baby. The way my Mom nearly tricked Charles Barkley.
116111,449,132,535000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Trick 'em, I like it. But how?"
116113,449,134,540000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,A romantic dinner? That's a great idea!

116127,449,148,585000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,There comes a time in every marriage when it comes down to this. Do we eat dessert or do we make love?
116128,449,149,592000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe we could do both.
116129,449,150,593000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah!
116130,449,151,597000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We couldn't do both.
116131,449,152,599000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No... we could not.
116133,449,154,608000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you sure this'll work?
116134,449,155,611000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Hey, this is the DVD my parents used to make me."
116135,449,156,615000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,So it kinda works...
116136,449,157,618000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer Simpson, look what the snuggle fairy left in our DVD player."
116137,449,158,624000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, people in other countries make love? It's about time."
116138,449,159,629000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Which position should we try?
116139,449,160,630000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""The Yawning Monkey?"" ""The Pair Of Tongs?"""

116144,449,165,642000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And turn that upside down...
116145,449,166,645000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Mm-hmm... and swivel that till you hear a grinding noise...
116146,449,167,648000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,...don't look at that...
116147,449,168,650000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"A few more minor adjustments, aaand..."

116152,449,173,675000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,DRAINAGE PIPE,Nice loog! / Wish I'd hocked that!
116153,449,174,678000,Bart Simpson,DRAINAGE PIPE,"Look, I want a baby brother, but I can't get my parents to do it."
116154,449,175,681000,Jimbo Jones,DRAINAGE PIPE,"Here's the thing, Simpson. No matter how dead their relationship seems, all parents eventually commit the heinous act of love."

116156,449,177,696000,Jimbo Jones,DRAINAGE PIPE,What you've got to worry about is the pill.
116157,449,178,699000,Bart Simpson,DRAINAGE PIPE,The pill? What's that?
116158,449,179,701000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,DRAINAGE PIPE,It's medicine doctors give moms to keep babies up in Heaven.
116159,449,180,704000,Bart Simpson,DRAINAGE PIPE,"Well, I need a baby now and I'm not getting any younger!"
116160,449,181,707000,DOLPH,DRAINAGE PIPE,Then get rid of the pills.
116161,449,182,708000,Bart Simpson,DRAINAGE PIPE,Got it. How can I thank you?
