122859,474,2,103000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,We're down to our final four huckers -- three wily fourth graders and one scrappy fifth gradesman.
122860,474,3,111000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,To the death!
122862,474,5,154000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw!
122863,474,6,155000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw?
122864,474,7,156000,Erik,Springfield Elementary School,Where do you want your ball mark? Face or belly?
122865,474,8,159000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,How about... in your dreams!
122868,474,11,177000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,I'm not the coach. There is no coach.
122869,474,12,180000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I just wanted to see if you were wearing a bra.
122870,474,13,183000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Oh.
122871,474,14,183000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Your four eyes saw a lot today, Milhouse. What's the skinny?"
122872,474,15,190000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"The fifth graders played a great game. They got a great program up there, great fans, but this was just our day. Whatever happens, they can never take away--"
122874,474,17,199000,Erik,Springfield Elementary School,The ball never touched the ground -- and I caught it!
122875,474,18,203000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,That means... fifth graders win!
122876,474,19,205000,4th Graders,Springfield Elementary School,No way! / What a rip! / Mannn!
122877,474,20,207000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Shut your gobs! I only took this refereeing job 'cause I was cold and needed a shirt!
122879,474,22,226000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I hate you fifth graders!
122880,474,23,228000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,I deem this victory Pyrrhic.
122881,474,24,230000,4th Graders,Springfield Elementary School,Pyr-rhic! Pyr-rhic!
122882,474,25,232000,Erik,Springfield Elementary School,Your response is puerile.
122883,474,26,235000,5th Graders,Springfield Elementary School,Puerile! Puerile!
122885,474,28,237000,Bart's Class,Art Classroom,THERE GOES THE FIFTH GRADE / FLOATIN' DOWN THE DELAWARE / CHEWIN' ON THEIR UNDERWEAR / CAN'T AFFORD ANOTHER PAIR / TEN DAYS LATER / BITTEN BY A POLAR BEAR / THAT'S HOW THE POLAR BEAR DIED!
122886,474,29,253000,Erik,Art Classroom,"How dare they dishonor the lyrics of ""Old Grey Mare!"" How dare they!"
122888,474,31,260000,Erik,5th Grade Classroom,Zach! Zach! Who did this to you?
122889,474,32,264000,Zach,5th Grade Classroom,It was... it was... the fourth graders!
122891,474,34,276000,Mr. Benzie,Teachers' Lounge,"I like to think my kids would know how to lose gracefully. In the fifth grade, we teach character."
122892,474,35,281000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Teachers' Lounge,"Mike, let's be adults here."
122893,474,36,283000,Mr. Benzie,Teachers' Lounge,"You're right, Edna. Fourth sucks!"
122894,474,37,284000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Teachers' Lounge,"Oh, that's it!"
122898,474,41,308000,Erik,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey fourth graders, can you help us with our fractions? Oh wait, you can't."
122900,474,43,315000,Tough 5th Grader,Springfield Elementary School,"They ain't even read ""Where The Red Fern Grows"" yet!"
122902,474,45,319000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That's it! We challenge you to a rumble.
122903,474,46,322000,Erik,Springfield Elementary School,Challenge accepted.
122843,474,47,325000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,This is gonna be great! A real rumble! Just like in that movie where the Jets fought the Sharks!
122904,474,48,350000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Rumble it is. After school. Rain or shine.
122906,474,50,356000,Bart Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Anybody wanna wait for shine?
122907,474,51,357000,Other Boys,PLAYGROUND,Yeah. Shine. / Yeah. / Definitely shine.
122909,474,53,359000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"It's agreed -- no biting, no throwing rocks, no face farts, flying face farts, backdoor haircuts, 'nad noogies, moist Michaels, and absolutely no ""Brazilian hardwood."""
122910,474,54,359000,Erik,Springfield Elementary School,Is this a rumble or a harvest dance?
122911,474,55,373000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, you want hardwood?"
122912,474,56,374000,Erik,Springfield Elementary School,"No, no, no, no."
122913,474,57,375000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Then let's do this thing!
122915,474,59,379000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"You know, if they do this regularly, maybe it could count as gym."
122916,474,60,383000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,Did you wear those same clothes yesterday?
122917,474,61,385000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"No, I have two identical sets of these clothes."
122918,474,62,388000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"I see, with a stain on the shirt in the exact same place?"
122919,474,63,391000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Things aren't good at home.
122921,474,65,397000,Martin Prince,SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND,Rumble!!!!!
122922,474,66,399000,Nelson Muntz,SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND,"Why don't you head on home, pal?"
122923,474,67,402000,Martin Prince,SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND,Bless you.
122924,474,68,407000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND,Where'd you get that scar?
122925,474,69,409000,Erik,SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND,Had it as long as I can remember. Why?
122926,474,70,414000,Groundskeeper Willie,SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND,You call that a scar? This is a scar.
122927,474,71,418000,Nelson Muntz,SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND,That's your bellybutton. Everybody's got one.
122928,474,72,421000,Groundskeeper Willie,SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND,I thought I was special!
122930,474,74,430000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,When did this happen?
122931,474,75,430000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,You sure none of you guys gave me this?
122932,474,76,433000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Street,"I'm going through my bully logbook here, but I just don't see it."
122933,474,77,433000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Street,Don't be afraid to use your glasses.
122934,474,78,439000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Street,You shut up!
122935,474,79,440000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Street,January 9th -- whaled on Jimbo with this book. Awaiting results.
122937,474,81,443000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Street,Unqualified success.
122938,474,83,443000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower?
122939,474,84,454000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Can't start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling.
122940,474,85,460000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, do you have any idea how I got this scar?"
122941,474,86,463000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I was afraid this day would come.
122942,474,87,466000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ew, you're sitting on the toilet."
122943,474,88,468000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"When it's closed it's a chair! When you were little, I used to take you to a Mommy-and-Me toddler gym."
122944,474,89,474000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You were friends with three other boys and I became close with their moms.
122945,474,90,478000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But they were a bad influence on you.
122946,474,91,492000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, such an innocent time. Before cooties ravaged our community. How come we don't get together anymore?"
122947,474,92,498000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"The Moms and I had a falling out, which was a shame. We had been such good friends."
122948,474,93,503000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa. You don't look like a mom, you look happy."
122949,474,94,507000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"We called ourselves ""the Cool Moms."""
122950,474,95,507000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,There's nothing cooler than calling yourself cool.
122951,474,96,517000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe we could get back together...
122952,474,97,519000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Awesome! I'll get the white wine.
122953,474,98,521000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You can't buy white wine!
122954,474,99,523000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why not? Are you having red meat?
122956,474,101,525000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you through with the chair? I've got to do the taxes.
122957,474,102,526000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's all yours.
122958,474,103,531000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay let's see, number of dependents: three. Um, add to line thirteen..."
122959,474,104,536000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, better check last year's return."
122960,474,105,539000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hm.
122961,474,106,542000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Seven years. A lot of memories. Talking, chatting..."
122962,474,107,547000,Anita,Simpson Home,Remember how we used to reminisce?
122964,474,109,550000,Connie,Simpson Home,You know who was really happy to get back together: our husbands.
122965,474,110,555000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Been a while since our wives got together, huh?"
122966,474,111,557000,Mike,Simpson Home,Uhm. / Whatever. /
122967,474,112,557000,Mike,Simpson Home,Why are we getting together again? I was so happy when it stopped!
122968,474,113,562000,Chris,Simpson Home,"Let's just shut up and get through this, all right?"
122970,474,115,567000,Andy Hamilton,Simpson Home,"Homer, stop doing that."
122972,474,117,571000,Andy Hamilton,Simpson Home,Homer!
122973,474,118,574000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, I got a text!"
122974,474,119,575000,Andy Hamilton,Simpson Home,I got a text!
122975,474,120,576000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you gonna open it?
122976,474,121,577000,Andy Hamilton,Simpson Home,"No, that page isn't optimized for cell phone u... why am I talking to you?"
122977,474,122,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because you're my best friend in the room.
122978,474,123,583000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Wow! We all have the same scar!
122980,474,125,586000,Tyler Winklevoss,Bart's Treehouse,So how'd you get yours?
122981,474,126,588000,Ross,Bart's Treehouse,My Mom won't tell me.
122982,474,127,590000,Erik,Bart's Treehouse,"My Mom'll tell me how my dad is in bed, but not about this."
122983,474,128,593000,Erik,Bart's Treehouse,Ever do a cold drop out of a treehouse?
122984,474,129,595000,Tyler Winklevoss,Bart's Treehouse,Only like every day.
122985,474,130,597000,Ross,Bart's Treehouse,More like all day every day.
122986,474,131,600000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Cowabungaaa--
122988,474,133,605000,Ross,Bart's Treehouse,Check out my gnarly backwards foot!
122991,474,136,614000,Anita,Bart's Treehouse,"I said, ""for the price of this coffee, I should've just flown to Brazil!"""
122993,474,138,614000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Anyone see a good beer commercial lately?
122994,474,139,625000,Andy Hamilton,Bart's Treehouse,Asinine. Everything you say is asinine.
122996,474,141,629000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Those dudes were... intense.
122997,474,142,632000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm glad you had fun, because we're all getting together next week."
122998,474,143,636000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Great, great."
122999,474,144,638000,MARGE 40-YEAR-OLD,Simpson Home,"Oh, and Homie, can you come home early from work tomorrow so I can have a girls' night out?"
123000,474,145,643000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure, I'll stay home and Skype with the guys at Moe's."
123001,474,146,647000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Hey, how ya doin', Hom--"
123002,474,147,651000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Stupid Flanders' wi-fi!
123003,474,148,653000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,That wasn't the wi-fi. My Bell's Palsy's acting up.
123004,474,149,659000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Yeah, it can be tough, but y'know I try to stay posit--"
123007,474,152,669000,Rachel,The Enchanted Snail,I've been dying to try it.
123008,474,153,671000,Anita,The Enchanted Snail,"Marge, who are you cutting up that chicken for?"
123009,474,154,674000,Anita,The Enchanted Snail,The kids aren't here.
123010,474,155,676000,Marge Simpson,The Enchanted Snail,"Huh? Oh, myself, I guess."
123011,474,156,679000,Marge Simpson,The Enchanted Snail,Who's kicking?
123012,474,157,681000,Anita,The Enchanted Snail,No one. No one's kicking.
123013,474,158,683000,Marge Simpson,The Enchanted Snail,"Sorry, I'm just not used to everyone behaving."
123014,474,159,686000,Rachel,The Enchanted Snail,"Oh Marge, if you don't have a life outside your kids, how do you expect to be happy?"
123015,474,160,691000,Connie,The Enchanted Snail,"I've got a great idea: from now on, the four of us will get together every Tuesday."
123016,474,161,696000,Marge Simpson,The Enchanted Snail,"Go out on a Tuesday? Who am I, Charlie Sheen?"
123017,474,162,701000,Marge Simpson,The Enchanted Snail,"Fine, I'll do it!"
123022,474,167,724000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ion. Hmm... No. ""Irene Ryan is TV's Granny."""
123023,474,168,728000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Thanks for the ride!
123024,474,169,734000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This is late for Marge. I assume. I've never been home at this hour.
123026,474,171,741000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Shh!!!
123027,474,172,745000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Marge. Partaking of the grape, were we?"
123028,474,173,749000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Just a little Merloooot.
123030,474,175,753000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You wanna stay up and talk a while? I'm not sleepy.
123031,474,176,762000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"And Anita's family rented a beach house, and guess what? They went to the beach every day!"
123032,474,177,767000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Great. That's great. But I have to get to work in the morning.
123033,474,178,772000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But I don't want a beach house. Sand makes me sad. Because it used to be big rocks. But not anymore. Not anymore...
123035,474,180,790000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Four Seasons Hotel,"It's kind of weird, us all being naked in here."
123036,474,181,793000,Andy Hamilton,Springfield Four Seasons Hotel,We're not naked.
123037,474,182,795000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Four Seasons Hotel,Right... neither am I.

123039,474,184,806000,Tyler Winklevoss,Springfield Four Seasons Hotel,Don't be a wuss. We all did it.
123040,474,185,809000,Erik,Springfield Four Seasons Hotel,Chicken!
123043,474,188,820000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Four Seasons Hotel,"If I do it, you're supposed to stop!"
123044,474,189,823000,Erik,Springfield Four Seasons Hotel,Don't tell a chicken when to cluck.
123045,474,190,824000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Four Seasons Hotel,"You're not the chicken, I'm the chicken!"
123046,474,191,826000,Erik,Springfield Four Seasons Hotel,Chicken!
123050,474,195,826000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, three!"

123052,474,197,836000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey.
123053,474,198,839000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,They dared me to see how many TV remotes I could stick in my mouth.
123054,474,199,842000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We've got to stop Mom from going out with those women.
123055,474,200,845000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Something drove them apart once before...
123056,474,201,849000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And I bet it has something to do with this scar.
123058,474,203,852000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"I've seen this mark before... On you, every time you come in! I believe it had something to do with Comic Book Guy."
123059,474,204,861000,Bart Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Comic Book Guy! Thanks.
123060,474,205,863000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Listen, are you gonna see him now? You can give him some news from me. Tell him it's the ""worst prognosis ever."""
123062,474,207,872000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"I knew this day would come. Although frankly, I thought it would have been a long time ago. You are very uncurious about your body."
123063,474,208,880000,Bart Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"All right, Comic Book Guy, tell me my origin story."
123064,474,209,884000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"I will not relive the horror of that day! The answer is ""no,"" and I can say it in Na'avi or Klingon, which are pretty much the same. I have some theories on that which I will share with you never!"

123068,474,213,912000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,How do I know that is not a cheap reprint?
123069,474,214,915000,Bart Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Are you willing to take that chance?
123070,474,215,917000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Yes.
123071,474,216,922000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,No! No! No! I'll tell you what you want to know.
123072,474,217,925000,Lisa Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Could we hurry this up? I am really uncomfortable being a girl in this store.
123073,474,218,930000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Very well. I shall tell you what happened to you and your friends several years ago. But for you to understand it, I must go back a little further."

123088,474,233,1026000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield High School,While I was busy tending to a critical matter of great delicacy...you and your diaper-wearing droogs ruined everything!
123089,474,234,1059000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield High School,And that is when the four of you each received the mark of the sword.

123099,474,243,1098000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Can I go home and think of a lie?
123100,474,244,1100000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, you may."

123103,474,247,1112000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I love you kids with all my heart, but dammit, I need something for myself!"

123121,474,265,1191000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I think they were never my friends... Maybe true friends aren't random people you meet at a Mommy and Me class. They're random people you meet in a college dorm.
123122,474,266,1202000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe Lisa and I can be friends -- not with each other, but with you."
