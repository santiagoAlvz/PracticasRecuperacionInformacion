84655,328,162,791000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Okay, okay. Remember the rules for drinking and driving. Drive slow but not too slow. Drink some cola to keep yourself alert."

84669,328,176,854000,Lou,EMBANKMENT,What was that?
84670,328,177,855000,Chief Wiggum,EMBANKMENT,Maybe someone else is here. And maybe he'll step forward and admit to being the real culprit.
84672,328,179,863000,Homer Simpson,EMBANKMENT,"Aw, this is a new low for me."
84674,328,181,875000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"I paid your bail, honey. You're free to go."

84687,328,194,911000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"What are you? You're like a monster! That's like the worst thing I ever heard anybody do to anybody. You should be drinkin' watered-down beer in-in-in a chipped glass, on a stool with a nail sticking up."
84688,328,195,929000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Can I have some peanuts?

84697,328,204,953000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Today's service is concluded. I suggest you all get on the road before Marge.
84698,328,205,960000,Barney Gumble,First Church of Springfield,"Marge, when I finally decided to stop drinkin', there was a place that really helped me out. Maybe they can help you."
84699,328,206,969000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,This is a pamphlet for chimney sweeping.
84700,328,207,971000,Barney Gumble,First Church of Springfield,"Is it, Marge? Is it? Oh, it is."
84701,328,208,975000,Barney Gumble,First Church of Springfield,Here you go -- this place is great. It cured me five times!
84704,328,211,983000,Marge Simpson,Quitters,"My drinking problem is out of control. At Oktoberfest, all I could think about was beer! I couldn't even celebrate... the harvest."
84706,328,213,992000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I can't talk to my wife for twenty-eight days? Sir, she is not an alcoholic! You can't put me on hold! I'll put you on hold!"

AND I DRIVE THE MAIN ROAD There are... eight... calls ahead of you. AND THE WICHITA LINEMAN IS STILL ON THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LINE!
84708,328,215,1027000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I still have a couple-a questions about this. Mom never drives drunk, and the crash was in your car. Also, the driver's seat was adjusted for your stomach..."
84711,328,216,1038000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, Lisa, your suspicions are important to me and will be answered in the order received. MacARTHUR PARK IS MELTING IN THE DARK / ALL THAT SWEET GREEN ICING ROLLING DOWN / SOMEONE LEFT MY CAKE OUT IN THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI- LI... LI... LI... LI..."
84713,328,218,1062000,Otto Mann,Quitters,"You know how some people are chocoholics? Well, I'm an alcoholic."
84715,328,220,1067000,Marge Simpson,Quitters,"Look, I'm not sure this place is working. The drinkers are smoking, the smokers are drinking, and the gamblers are having sex with everything that moves."
84716,328,221,1076000,Gambler,Quitters,"Hey baby, d'want to play Caribbean stud? I'll show you what I'm holding."

84721,328,226,1087000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh, thank God. You're finally fighting your demons."
84722,328,227,1090000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,My demons and I are closer than ever. Next year we're gonna visit every major league baseball park. I'm just goin' in to bust Marge out.
84723,328,228,1098000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Well, that's good too, I guess."
84724,328,229,1100000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,Feed my pets and tape my shows!
84726,328,231,1103000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,I'm here to deliver a package to Marge Simpson.
84727,328,232,1107000,Kyle,Quitters,Where's the package?
84728,328,233,1111000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,Dammit!
84729,328,234,1113000,Marge Simpson,Quitters,Homer?
84730,328,235,1113000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,Marge!
84731,328,236,1114000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,"I have an awful confession to make: you didn't crash that car, it was me. I put you behind the wheel and I'm so, so, so sorry."
84732,328,237,1122000,Marge Simpson,Quitters,You let me believe that I'd done such a terrible thing?
84733,328,238,1126000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,"Marge, I did it out of love. Love of not being arrested. But I realize now that nothing is more important than you."
84734,328,239,1133000,Marge Simpson,Quitters,I can't believe you did that to me.
84735,328,240,1137000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,That woman means the world to me. Would it be all right if I read from my Bible?
84736,328,241,1142000,Kyle,Quitters,Of course.
84737,328,242,1147000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,"No wonder they call it ""the good book."""
84739,328,244,1147000,Marge Simpson,REC ROOM,I am so cheesed off. I need a drink!
84709,328,245,1155000,Agnes Skinner,REC ROOM,Then you should thank God you're in a rehab center. 'Cause we're packin'!
84740,328,246,1161000,Captain Horatio McCallister,REC ROOM,"Yarrr, a couple of these and your first mate turns into Reese Witherspoon."
84741,328,247,1169000,Marge Simpson,REC ROOM,Pour me another.
84742,328,248,1170000,Captain Horatio McCallister,REC ROOM,Just take the whole leg.
84743,328,249,1173000,Agnes Skinner,REC ROOM,"What's with all those rapping grannies in the movies? If I ever start rappin', just shoot me in the head."
84744,328,250,1180000,Agnes Skinner,REC ROOM,"How you doin', Big Blue?"
84745,328,251,1182000,Marge Simpson,REC ROOM,"Well, I feel a buzz, but I don't feel happier. It's not like when I was drinking with Homer."
84746,328,252,1187000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,REC ROOM,Maybe it wasn't the alcohol you liked.
84747,328,253,1190000,Marge Simpson,REC ROOM,"Hey, you're right! What I enjoyed was spending time with my husband."
84748,328,254,1197000,Agnes Skinner,REC ROOM,"You're hooked on love, Marge. I know that feelin'. Nine months later Seymour plopped outta me. I woulda kept walking, but there were cops everywhere."
84749,328,255,1208000,Marge Simpson,REC ROOM,"Well, I love my husband and I'm glad I do. My name is Marge S. And I'm a Homer-holic!"
84750,328,256,1216000,Otto Mann,REC ROOM,You're drinkin' Homer-hol? I'll take a swig.
84751,328,257,1218000,Marge Simpson,REC ROOM,"I'm afraid what I like can't be swallowed, sniffed or smoked."
84752,328,258,1222000,Otto Mann,REC ROOM,Hmmm. Then you better inject it between my toes. 'Cause my Mom checks my arms!
84754,328,260,1226000,Marge Simpson,Quitters,"Thanks for everything, Kyle."
84755,328,261,1229000,Kyle,Quitters,"Yes, I really don't think you two should leave. He's a chronic alcoholic and you're in complete denial."
84756,328,262,1234000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,"Aw, shut up, Captain Bringdown."
84757,328,263,1240000,Marge Simpson,Quitters,"Homie, I want you to promise me you'll cut down on the drinking."
84758,328,264,1245000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,"Okay, Marge. For you I'll give up rum-based cocktails. Except mojitos and rum and coke."
84759,328,265,1250000,Marge Simpson,Quitters,"Well, that's no promise at all!"
84760,328,266,1252000,Marge Simpson,Quitters,It's important for me to see you take at least one step. Then maybe we can have some memories together that aren't just a nauseous blur.
84761,328,267,1263000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,"All right. For you, I will give up all clear liquors."
84762,328,268,1268000,Marge Simpson,Quitters,Really? Even Zima?
84763,328,269,1270000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,"Hey, I only drink that when I'm already drunk."
84764,328,270,1272000,Marge Simpson,Quitters,You really mean it?
84765,328,271,1274000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,"Hey, anything's possible. With a little help from my Bible."
84766,328,272,1279000,Homer Simpson,Quitters,"Oh no! It's a real one! Noooooo! Why God, why?"
