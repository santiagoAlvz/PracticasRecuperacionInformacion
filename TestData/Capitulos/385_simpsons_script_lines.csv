99862,385,1,37000,Lisa Simpson,KITCHEN,"Bart, what are you doing?"
99863,385,2,38000,Bart Simpson,KITCHEN,I only eat the clown heads.
99864,385,3,40000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,That's so wasteful.
99865,385,4,41000,Bart Simpson,KITCHEN,I've always done it. Just like I only eat the eyes off a lobster.
99866,385,5,46000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,"Oh, you should be ashamed! Your father works very hard to put lobsters on our table. Every night, he comes home exhausted, with his voice too hoarse to talk."
99869,385,8,62000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'm the king of goofing off!
99870,385,9,67000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Ow! Unnecessary roughness!
99871,385,10,70000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,So what? That's legal in Rolo-Polo!
99872,385,11,72000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I thought we were playing Cincinnati Time-Waste.
99873,385,12,74000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, in that case..."
99874,385,13,77000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What'd I do?
99876,385,14,79000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"When you pass the coffee machine you're supposed to yell ""hot pot"" and eat a sugar cube."
99877,385,15,83000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"He's right, Homer. That's a two-minute penalty!"
99878,385,16,86000,Other Men,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Penalty, penalty, penalty! Penalty, penalty, penalty ..."
99880,385,18,92000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"On your feet, you sniggering Oran-gu-tan!"
99882,385,20,102000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"My fat friend, you are hanging by a very thin thread..."
99885,385,23,109000,C. Montgomery Burns,BREAK ROOM,"If you want to keep your job, then you better start... BA-BA, BA-BA, BA-BA-BA-BA-BA..."
99886,385,24,116000,C. Montgomery Burns,BREAK ROOM,"You're thinking about that ice cream truck, aren't you? Well, you can just forget about..."
99887,385,25,121000,C. Montgomery Burns,BREAK ROOM,"Come and lick me, Big Boy! I said lick me!"
99888,385,26,130000,Homer Simpson,BREAK ROOM,You're not ice cream... faker!
99889,385,27,135000,Homer Simpson,BREAK ROOM,Ice cream man! Wait!
99890,385,28,136000,C. Montgomery Burns,BREAK ROOM,You're fired!
99891,385,29,137000,C. Montgomery Burns,BREAK ROOM,"As for the rest of you, you're supposed to be a chair-hockey team! All I see is five show-boaters!"
99892,385,30,144000,C. Montgomery Burns,BREAK ROOM,Now sit down and give me fifty twirls!
99893,385,31,148000,C. Montgomery Burns,BREAK ROOM,That's more like it.
99895,385,33,151000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Ice cream man! Ice cream man!
99896,385,34,155000,Max,Springfield Street,"Homer, there you are! What does my best customer want today?"
99897,385,35,159000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"One butter-crusted choco-rocket, please."
99898,385,36,161000,Max,Springfield Street,I wish I had more customers like you. I'm barely scraping by.
99899,385,37,167000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Yeah, this economy is tough on everyone. Change a hundred?"
99900,385,38,170000,Max,Springfield Street,"Sure. That's one-fifty, one-seventy-five, two dollars..."
99902,385,40,177000,Max,Springfield,...ninety-nine-fifty... ninety-nine-seventy-five...
99903,385,41,186000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Nooooo!
99905,385,43,216000,OLDER WOMAN'S VOICE,Springfield Cemetery,You must be Homer.
99906,385,44,218000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,Max told you about me?
99908,385,45,220000,Max's Widow,Springfield Cemetery,"Oh, yes! Max loved to talk about his work. How he bored me."
99909,385,46,228000,Max's Widow,Springfield Cemetery,And now I'm left with nothing but my lover and this worthless truck.
99910,385,47,234000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"Wait a minute. You don't want the truck, I need a job, you need money, I'm flush with severance pay..."
99911,385,48,241000,Max's Widow,Springfield Cemetery,You'll buy Max's truck?
99912,385,49,243000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"Why, doesn't he need it? Oh, right."
99914,385,51,246000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Remember that crappy ice cream truck I bought?
99915,385,52,248000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How can we forget? Mom says now we can't afford to go to the orthodontist.
99916,385,53,252000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, sink your crooked rotting teeth into this!"
99918,385,55,275000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Otto, you totally pimped Dad's ride!"
99919,385,56,278000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,He was following my design.
99920,385,57,282000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And now to get dressed in a most unusual way:
99922,385,59,323000,Homer Simpson,BLACK VOID,Butter-brickle!
99924,385,61,330000,Opal,Simpson Home,"Welcome back! Today we're celebrating women who didn't waste their lives being mommies. Professor Stein, tell us about your book, ""Life Beyond Wife."""
99925,385,62,341000,Prof. Stein,Simpson Home,"Well Opal, it's about women who want to breastfeed their own dreams and change the poopy diapers of fulfillment."
99927,385,64,351000,Prof. Stein,Simpson Home,"I call it ""leaving your lega-she."""
99929,385,66,351000,Opal,Simpson Home,Does this book have any examples?
99930,385,67,357000,Prof. Stein,Simpson Home,"Yes, eight!"
99931,385,68,359000,Prof. Stein,Simpson Home,"Take Gail Tucker. She wrote hip-hop lyrics to the beat of her washing machine with an off-center load. Last year, she won all the Grammys."
99932,385,69,369000,Prof. Stein,Simpson Home,"Or how about Becky Tyson, who invented the pink VCR. Now her husband asks her for money - or as I call it, mon-she."
99933,385,70,375000,Opal,Simpson Home,"You go, girl!"
99935,385,72,381000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,All those women are so impressive.
99936,385,73,383000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I've been doing the same thing for the last ten years. And all I have to show for it is a clean floor.
99937,385,74,393000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My lega-she!
99757,385,76,398000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Street,"Boy, it's hot."
99939,385,77,400000,Martin Prince,Springfield Street,"I feel like Icarus, flying too close to Apollo's golden orb! Punch away, Nelson."
99940,385,78,409000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Street,It's too hot. I'll get ya later.
99941,385,79,412000,Martin Prince,Springfield Street,I'll pencil you in for next week.
99942,385,80,414000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Street,"Eh, what the hell."
99943,385,81,430000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,You kids like ice cream?
99944,385,82,433000,Disclaimer,Springfield Street,Product contains neither ice nor cream. May contain trace elements of Mexican cheese. Do not consume.

99947,385,85,446000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"What's the matter, son? Don't you have enough money for ice cream?"
99948,385,86,449000,Skinny Kid,Springfield Street,"I do, but I'm lactose-intolerant."
99949,385,87,454000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Son, I will not stand for intolerance!"
99950,385,88,456000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,You give this delightful frozen treat the same respect you would give any lactose-free food. God bless America!
99951,385,89,464000,Skinny Kid,Springfield Street,But my doctor says that I...
99952,385,90,465000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"I said, God bless America!"
99953,385,91,474000,Skinny Kid,Springfield Street,Call the number on my bracelet.
99954,385,92,477000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Ooh! Thomeone wearth a brathelet. Who'th your boyfriend? Dr. Osterberg?!
99956,385,94,488000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa Marge, for the first time in my life, I'm excited about going to work!"
99957,385,95,492000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm glad someone in this house feels their life has meaning.
99958,385,96,496000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're glad? You don't look glad. Are you sure you know what glad means?
99959,385,97,501000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I just wish I could do something to be remembered by... something that says ""Marge was here!"" after I'm gone."
99961,385,99,516000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Love you!
99962,385,100,519000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"The story of my life. They get the popsicles, I get the sticks."
99964,385,102,534000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, Maggie, I made another you! Out of sticky orange wood!"
99966,385,104,542000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I... Folk art!? That's my favorite kind of folk medium!"
99967,385,105,547000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I made it myself.
99970,385,106,548000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you're a genius. You should make sculptures of other people! Like Lenny, or Carl, or the new James Bond. Will America accept a British James Bond? I can't wait to find out!"
99973,385,109,593000,Kent Brockman,Helicopter,This is Kent Brockman. A high-speed pursuit is taking place on the streets of Springfield!
99974,385,110,597000,Kent Brockman,Helicopter,"We responded immediately after seeing it on Channels two, four, five, seven and sixty-three."
99975,385,111,602000,Kent Brockman,Helicopter,"The driver is getting out of his car... he's running to a helipad... he's taking off in a copter... what, here he is next to us!"
99976,385,112,609000,Snake Jailbird,Helicopter,"Kent, there seems to be a traffic tie-up at the one-oh-one four-oh-five interchange. I recommend taking surface streets. Jailbird away!"
99977,385,113,619000,Kent Brockman,Helicopter,"Well, there you have it, people-- Sweet Morley Safer -- do I see a telegenic housewife making art out of popsicle sticks? Set this baby down -- I smell soft news!"
99979,385,115,634000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Backyard,"Ma'am, I'd like to feature you on my award-submitted segment, Kent Brockman's ""Kent-resting People""!"
99980,385,116,639000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Really? You think people would be Kent-rested in me?
99981,385,117,642000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Backyard,I do.
99983,385,119,648000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"I'm here with local sculptress Marge Simpson who works in, of all media, popsicle stick! Our viewers want to know two things: why, and how come?"
99984,385,120,656000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why did cavemen paint on walls? Why do you scratch your name on Tupperware? So when you die, something's left behind that says, ""I was here. I mattered. That's my Tupperware."""
99985,385,121,667000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Human feelings, expressed by a human!"
99986,385,122,672000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,And here's a local nobody enjoying his likeness. Let's take a sneaky-peeky.
99987,385,123,677000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"My God, it's beauty-ful! I-I-I finally see the goodness in myself. C'mere, you."
99988,385,124,683000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm so glad you like it, Moe."
99989,385,125,686000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"That's right, tell me all your little wooden dreams. You're not alone any more. No you ain't."
99990,385,126,692000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Aw, you're shivering, are you cold? Where you goin', Marge?"
99991,385,127,698000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, I brought you more sticks."
99907,385,128,701000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This is the most fun I've ever had giving you wood.
99993,385,129,704000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, this sculpting has made me feel so fulfilled. I'm as hopeful and full of life as I was in the years before I met you."
99994,385,130,712000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's good to see you smile again. I was lonely being happy all by myself.
99995,385,131,717000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well no one's gonna be lonely tonight.
99996,385,132,723000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Let me just put on some romantic music.
99998,385,134,732000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, we got the whole night, baby -- let's slow things down."
100000,385,136,751000,The Rich Texan,Simpson Home,"Marge, you are one fantastic artist -- and no one knows art like a Texan with too much money!"
100001,385,137,757000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're from Texas?
100002,385,138,758000,The Rich Texan,Simpson Home,"That's right. And I wanna finance a fancy-shmancy art show, starring your wooden wonders. Yee hah!"
100003,385,139,765000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My own art show?! I'm so happy... do you mind?
100004,385,140,772000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Yee-hah!
100005,385,141,775000,The Rich Texan,Simpson Home,I'm excited you're excited!
100006,385,142,776000,The Rich Texan,Simpson Home,Yee-hah! Yee-hah!
100007,385,143,779000,The Rich Texan,Simpson Home,"Shoot on the ""yee,"" not the ""hah""!"
100008,385,144,779000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Hey lady, you gotta pay to use my likeness. It's a registered trademark!"
100010,385,146,791000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Hey, I do more than TV. I had a one-man show on Broadway. That's who showed up -- one man! Long story short, I won a Drama Desk Award."
100011,385,147,802000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, everything looks wonderful!"
100012,385,148,806000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm off to pedal my frosty wares!"
100013,385,149,808000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You can't go to work! I need you here for emotional support -- plus you make a small crowd look huge!
100014,385,150,815000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetie, I can't abandon my route even for one day. If those kids discover the link between eating right and feeling good, I am screwed. But I'll be back in time for your show."
100015,385,151,825000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The show starts at three. You promise you'll be here?
100016,385,152,827000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I would never let you down. Our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream. And trust is the hard chocolate shell that keeps it from melting onto our carpet. In cone-clusion, here's the scoop: I love you."
100018,385,154,852000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What the hell do you kids want? Oh right, ice cream."
100020,385,156,862000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Oh my God! It's the opportunity of a lifetime!
100021,385,157,865000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Attention, losers: this is your chance to buy your kids some frozen love."
100022,385,158,870000,Kirk Van Houten,Springfield Street,I'm not gonna fall for such a cheap stunt.
100023,385,159,873000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Street,Mom would.
100024,385,160,874000,Kirk Van Houten,Springfield Street,"Hey, give me one of everything! Hey!"
100025,385,161,885000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Sorry, I'm all out of ice cream."
100026,385,162,887000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Springfield Street,Already? It's only thirty-eight seconds to three.
100027,385,163,890000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Marge's show!
100029,385,165,899000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Truck,Must jettison excess weight!
100030,385,166,910000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Truck,"Oh my God, I've only got nine seconds till Marge's show!"
100032,385,168,914000,Crowd,Simpson Home,Eight... seven...
100033,385,169,916000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, where are you?"
100035,385,171,922000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,I'll never make it! Unless...
100036,385,172,931000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Woo hoo! I'm gonna be on time!
100042,385,178,958000,Moe Szyslak,Evergreen Terrace,"No, no, no -- save your energy. Eh, eh -- don't try to talk."
100043,385,179,962000,Lenny Leonard,Evergreen Terrace,I don't know where Carl ends and I begin.
100044,385,180,964000,Carl Carlson,Evergreen Terrace,"See, statements like that are why people think we're gay."
100045,385,181,971000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"I made it back for your show, honey..."
100046,385,182,974000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Well, Homer, you destroyed my artwork and my dreams. Good job. Very thorough."
100047,385,183,982000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Marge, let me explain: I had a chance to make a little more money by exploiting broken families..."
100048,385,184,987000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Oh, stop. Just stop. You don't care about anyone else's happiness but your own!"
100049,385,185,994000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Well excuse me for having enormous flaws that I don't work on!
100051,385,187,1006000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge? Marge?
100052,385,188,1009000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, you've been in there all day. You gotta eat something. Why don't you come downstairs and cook dinner? Lasagna would be awesome. Marge?"
100053,385,189,1027000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I wrote you a check for three hundred dollars to pay for all the sculptures I broke. Okay?"
100054,385,190,1035000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I see. You'd prefer a wire transfer. What's your routing number?"
100055,385,191,1041000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's okay, I can get it from the bank, honey. I just need to know your birthday."
100056,385,192,1051000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge? I have an apology that I hope is better than all the other ones. So please listen carefully. The thing I liked best about being an ice cream man wasn't the free ice cream, or the colorful toppings, or the love I received from obese children. It was giving you those sticks, and watching you smile as you turned them into art."
100057,385,193,1073000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If it would win you back, I would gradually eat all the parts of a motorcycle. I hope it doesn't come to that. Could you please just give me a sign that you still love me a little?"
100058,385,194,1085000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you won't talk to me, I'll send in Polaroids to show you how sad I am that I let you down."
100060,385,196,1107000,Homer Simpson,Bedroom,"I'm laughing in the last one, but it's only 'cause the cat fell down the stairs."
100062,385,198,1123000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge?
100063,385,199,1123000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge?
100064,385,200,1124000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,She's been gone for a while.
100065,385,201,1126000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Grampa's been watching us.
100066,385,202,1127000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,You kids have been real good tonight.
100068,385,204,1131000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,Mom! Mom!
100069,385,205,1132000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Marge, where are you? Did you change your name? Is it Kelly? Kelly!!!"
100070,385,206,1141000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,Comic Book Guy! Have you seen our Mom?
100071,385,207,1143000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield Street,"A complete list of things I have seen or not seen is available on my blog. Your mother is on the ""not seen"" list, along with a Star Wars film that was any good since the first one. And even that has been ruined by CGI additions! Bravo, George."
100072,385,208,1158000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,There's Mom!
100073,385,209,1159000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Oh my God. She's gonna jump. Marge, don't do it! Give divorce a chance!"
100074,385,210,1165000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Homer, I wanna show the world how I feel about you."
100075,385,211,1168000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,The world's not that interested!
100076,385,212,1170000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"They will be! Ready, bullies?"
99992,385,213,1174000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Street,Ready!
100077,385,215,1184000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Homer, you wanted a sign that I still love you, so here it is."
100078,385,216,1188000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Wow! You made me a sculpture of Magilla Gorilla.
