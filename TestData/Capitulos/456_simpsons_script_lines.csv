118000,456,3,99000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Meters?
118002,456,4,100000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,"Dad, a meter is three inches longer than a yard, which is thirty-six inches, so fifty divided by thirty-nine times thirty-six, equals--"
118003,456,5,107000,Gps,Homer's Car,You have missed your turn. Recalculating. Turn right in point five meters.
118004,456,6,113000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,"Dad, no! That takes us into a construction site!"
118005,456,7,115000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Stupid kid. Thinks he's smarter than a computer.
118006,456,8,119000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Seatbelts, kids!"
118007,456,9,125000,Gps,Homer's Car,"Turn left, turn right, turn left, turn right..."

118020,456,22,175000,Seymour Skinner,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Mrs. Krabappel had to go to Portland. Apparently, the people she hired to de-program her sister from that cult turned out to be an even worse cult."
118021,456,23,182000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"So, who's gonna take her place? Me, I hope?"
118022,456,24,184000,Seymour Skinner,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Not you. Never you. And due to budget cuts, until Edna comes back, I have no choice but to merge the school's two fourth-grade classes."
118024,456,26,191000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,The other fourth grade?! But they're so different from us. They have music on Tuesdays!
118025,456,27,197000,Milhouse Van Houten,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Their teacher takes her shoes off!
118026,456,28,200000,Sherri Mackleberry,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Their twins are one boy, one girl!"
118027,456,29,203000,Nelson Muntz,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Weird!
118029,456,31,207000,Miss Stringham,Springfield Elementary School,"All right, new kids, jam your chairs into my kids' desks."
118030,456,32,213000,Miss Stringham's Class,Springfield Elementary School,S'anyone here? / Whatever. / S'anyone here? / Whatever. / S'anyone here? / Whatever / S'anyone here? / Whatever.
118031,456,33,220000,CHILLED-OUT KID,Springfield Elementary School,"'Sup, I'm Bodhi. Do you surf?"
118033,456,34,221000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"No. My parents took me to Hawaii once, but I was intimidated by the physiques of the local kids, so I just stayed in the hotel room."
118034,456,35,230000,Bodhi,Springfield Elementary School,That's cool.
118035,456,36,231000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"No, it's not cool."

118037,456,38,238000,Kevin,Springfield Elementary School,"Sorry, let me get that for you."
118038,456,39,240000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,You're blind!
118039,456,40,243000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"If anyone messes with this kid, I will destroy them!"
118040,456,41,246000,Kevin,Springfield Elementary School,"It's okay, no one's messing with me."
118041,456,42,248000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"You're not a freak, and I won't let you think that about yourself!"
118042,456,43,251000,Kevin,Springfield Elementary School,I don't think I'm a freak.
118043,456,44,253000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,So brave.
118044,456,45,257000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Um, this is the last seat, so..."
118045,456,46,263000,Girl,Springfield Elementary School,My side. Your side.
118046,456,47,266000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hi, Nikki. I'm Bart. This situation, it's nuts, right?"
118047,456,48,270000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh look at you, opening a book so you won't have to talk to me. Well I'm just gonna be tuning up the old armpit."
118049,456,50,280000,Miss Hoover,MISS HOOVER'S ROOM,"Good news, children. Everyone did well on this test, except..."
118050,456,51,284000,Miss Hoover,MISS HOOVER'S ROOM,"Lisa Simpson, F."
118051,456,52,286000,Lisa Simpson,MISS HOOVER'S ROOM,"An F?! Okay, this is the time when I always wake up."
118052,456,53,289000,Lisa Simpson,MISS HOOVER'S ROOM,"Come on, alarm clock -- get me out of this!"
118053,456,54,295000,Miss Hoover,MISS HOOVER'S ROOM,"Sorry, Lisa -- this F is all too real."
118054,456,55,298000,Lisa Simpson,MISS HOOVER'S ROOM,"No it's not, dream-Hoover! And as long as I'm asleep, I'm gonna have some fun. I can fly! Wheeee!"
118055,456,56,307000,Lisa Simpson,MISS HOOVER'S ROOM,This isn't a dream. I really did fail.
118056,456,57,310000,Miss Hoover,MISS HOOVER'S ROOM,I take no joy in this. Little Miss Perfect.
118058,456,59,314000,Bart Simpson,Miss Stringham's Classroom,"Whoa. Damn, this caterpillar can eat! Damn! DAMN!!!"
118059,456,60,322000,Nikki McKenna,Miss Stringham's Classroom,Do you mind?!
118060,456,61,324000,Bart Simpson,Miss Stringham's Classroom,"Oh man, you girls ruin everything -- even vampires."
118061,456,62,327000,Nikki McKenna,Miss Stringham's Classroom,"Hey, vampires are cool outsiders who love girls who hate cheerleaders."
118062,456,63,332000,Bart Simpson,Miss Stringham's Classroom,"No, they're all about chomping neck. And they don't put product in their hair like this loser."
118032,456,64,339000,Bart Simpson,Miss Stringham's Classroom,They look like this!
118063,456,65,342000,Nikki McKenna,Miss Stringham's Classroom,Awesome picture.
118064,456,66,344000,Bart Simpson,Miss Stringham's Classroom,Can I draw a robot barfing screws on your arm with my Sharpie?
118065,456,67,347000,Nikki McKenna,Miss Stringham's Classroom,I... I'd like that.
118066,456,68,354000,Bart Simpson,Miss Stringham's Classroom,"Annnnd, finished."
118068,456,70,360000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,An F. An F! I hope Harvard never finds out about this.
118070,456,72,370000,COOL SECOND-GRADER #1,Springfield Elementary School,"Can I teeter while you totter? Ever since you got that bad grade, you seem a lot cooler."
118071,456,73,375000,COOL SECOND-GRADER #2,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, you want to come skip rope? You can replace the tree."
118072,456,74,378000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,Eat lunch with me! / Share my locker! / Come to my birthday party! / Love meee!
118073,456,75,387000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, can I speak to you for a moment?"
118074,456,76,389000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh-oh, looks like I'm in more trouble. Born to be bad."
118076,456,78,397000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,There was a mix-up with your test. You got an A-triple-plus.
118077,456,79,399000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Seems the ""F"" belonged to Ralph."
118078,456,80,403000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"I cheated wrong! I copied the ""Lisa"" name and used the ""Ralph"" answers!"
118079,456,81,411000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,Gif-ted! Gif-ted! Gif-ted!
118080,456,82,414000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'm just advanced! You can catch up!

118083,456,85,418000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I know we don't normally talk about this stuff, but there's this girl at school I kind of like."
118084,456,86,424000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Anyway, I'm really hoping you could... Dad?"
118085,456,87,428000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey boy.
118087,456,89,428000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Your mother thinks I'm working on the car!
118088,456,90,432000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, that is genius, but I need some advice--"
118089,456,91,435000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer?
118090,456,92,436000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought you were fixing my brakes!
118092,456,94,441000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But I need to talk about man stuff!
118093,456,95,443000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Talk to Grampa. He used to be a man.
118094,456,96,444000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,He did?
118095,456,97,447000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Give up the goods, you yellow devil!"
118097,456,98,450000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,So I kinda like this girl at school but I'm not sure if she likes me back.
118098,456,99,454000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,There's one sure way to find out if a girl likes you -- steal a kiss!
118099,456,100,460000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Really? Did that ever work for you?
118100,456,101,463000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Sure did! I remember it like it was yesterday...
118101,456,102,471000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh.
118103,456,104,478000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Whoa, she boards, too?"
118104,456,105,514000,Nikki McKenna,Springfield Elementary School,"So, what should we do now?"
118105,456,106,518000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Kiss her, ya idjit!"
118106,456,107,525000,Nikki McKenna,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart Simpson kissed me! Oh my God, and that was my first kiss! It will always be my first kiss! Ewww!"
118107,456,108,540000,Kevin,Springfield Elementary School,Haw-haw.
118108,456,109,543000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,That was great! Really great!
118110,456,111,555000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Marge, Homer, this is Brody and Madison McKenna. Bart has been sharing a desk with their daughter Nikki."
118111,456,112,560000,Nikki's Mom,Skinner's Office,"Earlier today, your son engaged in inappropriate mouth-on-mouth contact with our daughter."
118112,456,113,566000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,You mean... he kissed her?
118113,456,114,569000,Nikki's Dad,Skinner's Office,On the top of the slide.
118114,456,115,571000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,That's all that happened? And I got to miss work?
118115,456,116,574000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,I could kiss you.
118116,456,117,576000,Nikki's Mom,Skinner's Office,"Mr. Simpson, I'm an attorney, and my husband is a federal prosecutor, and neither of us is happy."
118117,456,118,582000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,Well maybe you guys should look for easier jobs.
118118,456,119,585000,Nikki's Mom,Skinner's Office,"Unless you make this an affection-free environment, we will sue this school for its last dime."
118119,456,120,591000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"All right, here it is."
118120,456,121,592000,Nikki's Mom,Skinner's Office,And we will make you regret the day your son was born.
118121,456,122,596000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,"You're halfway home, lady."
118123,456,124,601000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not my fault -- Grampa told me to kiss her!
118124,456,125,604000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why didn't you just tell him to club her on the head and drag her into a cave?
118125,456,126,608000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You mean second base? Whoa, he's a little young for that."
118126,456,127,612000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"If I talk to Nikki, I'm sure I can--"
118127,456,128,614000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No! If you go near her one more time, we'll be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever."
118128,456,129,619000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That's no problem -- Mom can make garbage taste great.
118129,456,130,622000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Thank you.
118130,456,131,623000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I mean it."
118131,456,132,624000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And it means the world to me.
118132,456,133,627000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, don't worry, boy. I know a wholesome way to take your mind off girls."
118134,456,135,634000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD IMAX THEATER,This is awesome! If only real life was in 3-D.
118135,456,136,637000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD IMAX THEATER,And the glasses smell like the last guy who wore them had pizza!
118137,456,138,719000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD IMAX THEATER,Look at that.
118138,456,139,721000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD IMAX THEATER,"Oh, look at their guts."
118139,456,140,726000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD IMAX THEATER,"""Dear fellow organic gardening enthusiasts: I'm afraid I am too sad to post my list of garden-friendly snails. Yet again I have seen the bitter truth of how difficult it is to be smart and accepted."" ""With mulch love, Lisa Simpson."" Mulch love, that's cute."
118140,456,141,744000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD IMAX THEATER,Somebody posted a comment?
118141,456,142,745000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD IMAX THEATER,"""Don't stop achieving just yet, Lisa. You are not alone -- Flotus-one."" ""Flotus-one?"" Who could that be?"
118142,456,143,754000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD IMAX THEATER,"Attention all students. Please report to an attorney-mandated school assembly. To make time for this, the third grade's performance of ""My Fair Lady"" is cancelled."
118143,456,144,763000,Henry Higgins,SPRINGFIELD IMAX THEATER,"I say, that's rum news. Very rum indeed."
118145,456,146,770000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"By now you've probably heard that one of our fourth graders did something that a hundred years ago would've been considered innocent, but in today's overly-litigious society has been blown completely out of proportion."
118146,456,147,783000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, what he said was..."
118147,456,148,785000,Kevin,Springfield Elementary School,I can hear.
118148,456,149,787000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"The following skit, or ""sketch,"" demonstrates the behavior we wish you would save for middle school. Annnd action!"
118149,456,150,797000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, I'm just a wee little lass, combin' me beautiful hair. COMB, COMB, COMB-ERY DOO..."
118150,456,151,805000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I'm Bart Simpson. Disruptive fourth-grader.
118151,456,152,808000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I finally caught one of Bart's school plays.
118152,456,153,811000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"That's not Bart, it's Principal Skinner. Bart's sitting right next to you."
118153,456,154,816000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, now that I look closer, that guy couldn't fool anybody."
118154,456,155,820000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Shut up, fatso."
118155,456,156,821000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Why you little...
118156,456,157,821000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, players, recreate the incident in question."
118158,456,159,835000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey Willie, does he taste like failure?"
118160,456,161,840000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Stop that laughter!
118162,456,163,843000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,I can make these two kiss all day if I have to!
118164,456,165,846000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"If you want them to keep on kissing, just keep laughing..."
118169,456,170,868000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Maybe I did do something wrong.
118170,456,171,873000,Nikki McKenna,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh Bart, I hate to see you like this."
118171,456,172,878000,Nikki McKenna,Springfield Elementary School,Look who's all confused.
118172,456,173,880000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Huh?
118173,456,174,885000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What the hell are you doing?
118174,456,175,886000,Nikki McKenna,Springfield Elementary School,"Kissing you, stupid."
118175,456,176,888000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You are the biggest psycho I ever met.
118176,456,177,890000,Nikki McKenna,Springfield Elementary School,You wanna stop?
118177,456,178,891000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Absolutely not.
118179,456,180,906000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,A VH-60N Whitehawk!
118180,456,181,919000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,First Lady Michelle Obama?!
118182,456,183,927000,Michelle Obama,Springfield Elementary School,I flew in from Turkmenistan because there's a wonderful young person here who's feeling a little discouraged.
118183,456,184,935000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,I sure am!
118184,456,185,936000,Michelle Obama,Springfield Elementary School,This young lady...
118185,456,186,938000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Oh.
118187,456,187,939000,Michelle Obama,Springfield Elementary School,"...thinks just because she's a high achiever, no one will ever like her. Well, as I tell school children all over the world, I was a high achiever. I got ""A""s back when ""A""s were hard to get. I was just like Lisa Simpson."
118188,456,188,956000,Michelle Obama,Springfield Elementary School,"That's right, Lisa. As an avid organic gardener, I've read your blog."
118189,456,189,960000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"""Flotus1"" is ""First Lady Of The United States... one!"""
118190,456,190,965000,Michelle Obama,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes. I wanted just ""Flotus,"" but someone had it."
118191,456,191,968000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"That's me, 'cause I swim with my flotuses on!"
118192,456,192,971000,Michelle Obama,Springfield Elementary School,"Everything I have I got through academics. I went to Chicago's first magnet high school, then Princeton, then Harvard Law."
118193,456,193,980000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,And now you're the most elegant and popular woman in the world!
118194,456,194,984000,Michelle Obama,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I don't know about that... there's Carla Bruni... Queen Noor of Jordan..."
118195,456,195,989000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,They're nothing compared to you!
118196,456,196,992000,Michelle Obama,Springfield Elementary School,"It's not a contest. But if it were, I think we know how it would go. But before I was who I am today, I was a nerd."
118197,456,197,1000000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"So the lesson is, children..."
118198,456,198,1002000,Michelle Obama,Springfield Elementary School,I'll tell them what the lesson is.
118199,456,199,1003000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,He's our Joe Biden.
118200,456,200,1005000,Michelle Obama,Springfield Elementary School,"Understood. So kids, be nice to Lisa, because the over-achievers will some day be running the country and you don't want them to be too screwed up. Now, who else is an overachiever? Come on now!"
118201,456,201,1018000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,I am.
118202,456,202,1019000,COOL SECOND GRADER #1,Springfield Elementary School,I am too.
118203,456,203,1021000,Navy Seal,Springfield Elementary School,And so am I. Fifth in my class at Annapolis. Scaled the summit of the highest peaks on six of seven continents...
118204,456,204,1026000,Michelle Obama,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, that's great. Don't forget to bring the scooper when you walk the dog."
