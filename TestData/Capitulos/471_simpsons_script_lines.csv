122079,471,3,109000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh, don't be scared, boys. That's just the angels bowling."
122081,471,5,125000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And so The Bloody Hangman, his hair sticky with blood, skittered along the cobblestones, gunk dripping from his one good eye, singing his evil land chantey."
122082,471,6,140000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"KER-SHAW, KER-SHEW / I'M AFTER YOU / WITH MY BLOODY NOOSE / STRONG ENOUGH TO HANG TEN MOOSE / KER-SHAW, KER-SHEW / IT'S JUST A STORY, BUT IT'S REALLY TRUE!"
122084,471,8,165000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, are you scaring those kids?"
122085,471,9,168000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I'm no-ot! Yes I am. The Bloody Hangman walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of London..."
122086,471,10,181000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You said it was Boston.
122087,471,11,183000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Did I? Anyway, the Bloody Hangman set to his gory work. Bodies piled up like those stackable plastic chairs."
122088,471,12,194000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Like those chairs in the music room?
122089,471,13,196000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Possibly!
122093,471,17,203000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,The Hangman's here!
122095,471,19,204000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ker-shaw, ker-shew, my lies have come true!"
122097,471,21,208000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Huh. It's a pigeon.
122098,471,22,210000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,The poor guy hurt his wing.
122040,471,23,213000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Hey, there's a number on him. What is it?"
122099,471,24,216000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I bet it's a combination to a safe!
122100,471,25,219000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Or, more likely, the phone number of the bird's owner."
122101,471,26,225000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Ask about the safe. No, better yet, act like you know about the safe."
122102,471,27,228000,Man On Phone,Bart's Bedroom,Hello.
122103,471,28,230000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Yes, I believe I have your pigeon, ""Raymond Bird,"" and I need to know how to return him to you."
122104,471,29,235000,Wiseguy,Bart's Bedroom,"He's a homing pigeon, girlie. Why don't you let him fly home? Unless you wanna spring for a limo."
122105,471,30,240000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Yes, he could fly home, except that he has a broken wing. Perhaps you and your sarcasm could come to Springfield and retrieve him."
122106,471,31,248000,Wiseguy,Bart's Bedroom,"Are you kidding? Wherever I go, two hundred birds gotta come with me. And they all want to sit in the front seat with daddy."
122107,471,32,258000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Looks like you're gonna have to take care of him, Bart."
122108,471,33,261000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Me? Just what in my long, sad history with frogs makes you think I can take care of a bird?"
122109,471,34,266000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"No, no... Listen, don't tell anyone, but... I can't stand pigeons! They're like rats with wings!"
122110,471,35,274000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,He's crawling on your arm.
122111,471,36,277000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Oh... Okay, maybe he's not so bad."
122112,471,37,281000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,No! No! No! Get off! Get off! Get off!
122114,471,39,331000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Okay, Ray, your wing is healed. Go on. Live your life."
122115,471,40,338000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Aw, c'mon, man. Admit it -- you knew this day would come."
122116,471,41,361000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,You and I have shared too many seed bells to just walk away from this.
122118,471,43,369000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Go ahead, make fun of me. I lost my heart to a bird."
122119,471,44,373000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,Haw-haw.
122120,471,45,374000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Man, you were not into that. What's wrong?"
122121,471,46,377000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,My mom ran off with my birthday clown.
122123,471,48,388000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"All finished, boy."
122124,471,49,390000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,That coop looks a little flimsy.
122125,471,50,391000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Flimsy? This gentle pat says different.
122129,471,52,403000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Now that you're officially my bird, let me fill you in on the pecking order around here."
122130,471,53,407000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"The top dog is me, followed by the top dog, the dog... ...then the cat... then you... but don't feel bad, you're ahead of Milhouse."
122131,471,54,414000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Backyard,C'mon Bart. How long can you stay mad?
122132,471,55,417000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Backyard,I thought your race car was a Transformer! Nothing's one thing anymore!
122133,471,56,423000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Sorry man, it's still too soon."
122134,471,57,425000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Backyard,"No problem. I'll just be right behind this fence, whenever you're ready to forgive me."
122135,471,58,431000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Backyard,Now? Do you forgive me now? Now? Now?
122136,471,59,441000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Backyard,"I'm scared, Bart."
122138,471,61,443000,Announcer,Simpson Home,Bored by black and white footage of World War II? Recently uncovered color footage will get you back in the game!
122139,471,62,450000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"Order this DVD now, featuring dictator's commentary by Hitler and Mussolini."
122140,471,63,461000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"And as a special bonus, the story of the carrier pigeon -- the Allies' winged warrior."
122141,471,64,467000,Aide,Simpson Home,"General Patton, this bird has a message for you."
122142,471,65,470000,General Patton,Simpson Home,There's a bomb in my helmet!
122143,471,66,474000,General Patton,Simpson Home,"Caesar can have his eagle, Alexander the Great his gryphon... I'll take the American fighting pigeon any damn day!"
122144,471,67,485000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, Ray, you have hidden talents!"
122145,471,68,488000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Is he good at tic-tac-toe like that chicken I played, lost to, and ate at the State Fair?"
122146,471,69,492000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth."
122147,471,70,495000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Way ahead of you.
122148,471,71,503000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, why am I so repulsed by pigeons? It doesn't make any sense."
122149,471,72,508000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Amoebas, The League of Women Vultures, the N-double-A-C-Porcupines, Kids for Squids, the A.C.L. Unicorns, Clamnesty International and, uh... well, those are the best ones."
122150,471,73,522000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetie, everyone has an animal they can't stand. Indiana Jones had snakes, the Grizzly man had grizzlies, and... you know, I'm not crazy about opossums."
122151,471,74,535000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Really?
122152,471,75,536000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Those creepy little claws...
122127,471,76,539000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Opossum!
122128,471,77,542000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, it's just Maggie."
121728,471,78,544000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Awww.
122153,471,79,544000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Who's a possum? You're a possum.
122154,471,80,551000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's that?
122155,471,81,552000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll tell you later.
122158,471,84,557000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Four sixty-five divided by seven equals...
122159,471,85,562000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,What the? All right. I won't ask who sent this note if I can use the bird to send a note of my own.
122160,471,86,572000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,As long as it means we're not learning.
122161,471,87,574000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Deal.
122163,471,89,577000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Every day since we broke up is the greatest day of my life.
122164,471,90,577000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,Is that from Edna?
122165,471,91,584000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"I feel for you, Seymour. If you ever need a shoulder to lean on, I'm here for you."
122166,471,92,591000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"P.S., Chalmers and I are doing it."
122167,471,93,594000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,She was on the rebound from Willie.
122169,471,95,598000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ooh, a carrier pigeon. Perhaps an update on the siege of Khartoum."
122170,471,96,605000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"""Do a ballet dance without no clothes on."" Bad grammar, but good advice."
122172,471,98,625000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'll catch up with you guys later.
122179,471,105,652000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Backyard,"Hey Homer, you ever think about racing that bird?"
122180,471,106,655000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,You can race pigeons?
122181,471,107,656000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Backyard,"Hey, if it moves, you can bet on it."
122182,471,108,658000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,What about the Detroit Lions?
122183,471,109,660000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Backyard,"Ah, now lay off Detroit. Them people is living in Mad Max times. But I was thinking you could enter this bird in the annual Springfield to Shelbyville Birditarod. Hm?"
122184,471,110,672000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Hmm... me, the patriarch of a bird-racing dynasty..."
122185,471,111,678000,Danica Patrick,Simpson Backyard,"Congratulations, Homer."
122186,471,112,680000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Danica Patrick in my thoughts!
122187,471,113,682000,Danica Patrick,Simpson Backyard,"That's right, Homer. I'm contractually obligated by my sponsors to appear in random fans' fantasies. Better not tell Marge about this."
122188,471,114,690000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,You Brickyard Bimbo!
122189,471,115,696000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Ended that a little too soon.
122190,471,116,701000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,What they don't suspect is that I'm into this.
122191,471,117,705000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Hear that, boy? You're gonna be a racing pigeon!"
122192,471,118,709000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,It's getting a little chilly -- I'd better put a blanket on Ray.
122193,471,119,713000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Dad! Help!
122194,471,120,715000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Stupid dog! Let go of that delicious bird!
122195,471,121,724000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Nooooo!
122196,471,122,730000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Come on out, birdie! Follow the sound of my voice-voice-voice."
122197,471,123,739000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Backyard,It's just as well. There's no such thing as a Birditarod. It was just a trick to scam you out of your house. Good day.
122198,471,124,756000,Database,Simpson Backyard,TAPS TAPS TAPS / TAPS TAPS TAPS / TAPS TAPS TAPS / TAPS TAPS TAPS / TAPS TAPS TAPS... TAPS TAPS TAPS...
122199,471,125,769000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Backyard,"What did you think, Mom?"
122200,471,126,771000,Mrs. Muntz,Simpson Backyard,Well ask your new father.
122201,471,127,774000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Backyard,You haven't earned the right to say that to me.
122202,471,128,777000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Dearly beloved. I'd like to open this service with the words of Emily Dickinson: ""Hope is the thing with feathers..."""
122203,471,129,777000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Stupid dog!
122204,471,130,792000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Backyard,This funeral just got depressing.
122205,471,131,795000,Martin Prince,Simpson Backyard,"Let's lighten up the mood, boys!"
122206,471,132,798000,Database,Simpson Backyard,GRAY SKIES ARE GONNA CLEAR UP / PUT ON A HAPPY FACE / BRUSH OFF THE CLOUDS AND CHEER UP / PUT ON A HAPPY FACE
122207,471,133,807000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Thanks. That song does make me feel a little better.
122208,471,134,810000,Martin Prince,Simpson Backyard,"It's from ""Bye-Bye Birdie""!"
122211,471,137,821000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You really don't get it.
122213,471,139,834000,Itchy,Simpson Living Room,Your crimes against the animals / have gone before the jury.
122214,471,140,838000,Scratchy,Simpson Living Room,We prob'ly should deliberate / but we're kind of in a hurry.
122215,471,141,846000,Will Rogers,Simpson Living Room,I never met a dog I didn't hate. /
122216,471,142,851000,W.C. FIELDS,Simpson Living Room,"Ah, yes. A little hair of the dog that bit me."
122217,471,143,863000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I hope you learned something here.
122220,471,146,870000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, Bart has been very sad lately."
122221,471,147,873000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,We know. And we're going to do something about it.
122222,471,148,877000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Please don't do anything. Not only have his grades gone up, but the enthusiasm has gone out of his pranks."
122223,471,149,883000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"I mean, take a look at this. If anything, I was wondering if you could make him sadder."
122224,471,150,889000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,How can you say a thing like that?
122225,471,151,891000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Marge, listen to the man -- he pays Bart's salary."
122226,471,152,894000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,No he doesn't!
122227,471,153,896000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,Why can't you support my gibberish? I'd do it if you were stupid!
122228,471,154,899000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Marge, Homer, this marital discord is perfect. But please, save it for home where your son could see it."
122231,471,157,910000,Dr. Thurston,Therapist's Office,"Bart, Santa's Little Helper, come on in."
122233,471,159,914000,Homer Simpson,Doctor Thurston' Office,A shrink who takes kids and pets?
122234,471,160,917000,Dr. Thurston,Doctor Thurston' Office,"Hey, in this economy, I'll even remove tattoos."
122235,471,161,920000,Homer Simpson,Doctor Thurston' Office,Even my tramp stamp?
122236,471,162,922000,Homer Simpson,Doctor Thurston' Office,I got the idea from a show where people regret these.
122237,471,163,926000,Marge Simpson,Doctor Thurston' Office,"Homie, why don't you study these?"
122238,471,164,939000,Homer Simpson,Doctor Thurston' Office,Oh baby! Well whaddaya know! Oh come on!
122239,471,165,943000,Dr. Thurston,Doctor Thurston' Office,"So, Marge, what I understand from our phone conversation is, you have a very poor service provider."
122240,471,166,950000,Marge Simpson,Doctor Thurston' Office,I bought it because Catherine Zeta Jones told me to. What a fool I was.
122241,471,167,956000,Dr. Thurston,Doctor Thurston' Office,"Secondly, there's been a major breach of trust between Bart and Santa's Little Helper."
122242,471,168,961000,Bart Simpson,Doctor Thurston' Office,"Well, he shouldn't kill birds. It's not right!"
122243,471,169,964000,Dr. Thurston,Doctor Thurston' Office,"That is correct... according to human standards. But all a dog can do is follow his animal inclinations, right?"
122244,471,170,971000,Bart Simpson,Doctor Thurston' Office,I guess.
122245,471,171,972000,Dr. Thurston,Doctor Thurston' Office,"So, Bart, as the one with the larger brain..."
122246,471,172,975000,Homer Simpson,Doctor Thurston' Office,"Nicely done, boy."
122247,471,173,977000,Dr. Thurston,Doctor Thurston' Office,...maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
122248,471,174,984000,Bart Simpson,Doctor Thurston' Office,"See? He's a questionable character! He used to hang around racetracks, you know!"
122249,471,175,988000,Dr. Thurston,Doctor Thurston' Office,"Bart, could you wait outside?"
122250,471,176,996000,Dr. Thurston,Doctor Thurston' Office,It's not gonna work. You have to give the dog away.
122251,471,177,998000,Marge Simpson,Doctor Thurston' Office,Are you sure?
122252,471,178,1000000,Dr. Thurston,Doctor Thurston' Office,As sure as I am that I'll be billing you for that torn magazine.
122253,471,179,1003000,Homer Simpson,Doctor Thurston' Office,"Oh, that's pretty sure. Subscription rate, right?"
122254,471,180,1006000,Dr. Thurston,Doctor Thurston' Office,Newsstand.
122257,471,183,1014000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why is it coming with us? And for once, I'm not talkin' about Lisa."
122258,471,184,1018000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's amazing how I can feel sorry for you and hate you at the same time. I'm sure there's a German word for it.
122259,471,185,1027000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We're bringing the dog because we've found him a new home at a farm upstate where he can run and play all day.
122260,471,186,1034000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You're gonna put him down?
122261,471,187,1036000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No! For once, a pet ""going to a farm upstate"" really is going to a farm upstate."
122262,471,188,1042000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What about all the other pets you told us went to a farm upstate?
122263,471,189,1046000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmm... Back yard, back yard, toilet, ocean, don't know, back yard, Flanders' mailbox, Lenny's freezer, tire fire."
122265,471,191,1057000,Lisa Simpson,Country Road,This is where we're ditching the dog?
122266,471,192,1059000,Marge Simpson,Country Road,"Well, ""ditching"" is a harsh word."
122267,471,193,1061000,Homer Simpson,Country Road,Enough chitchat. Time for operation dog dump.
122268,471,194,1064000,Marge Simpson,Country Road,It wasn't really a lot of chitchat.
122269,471,195,1066000,Homer Simpson,Country Road,It was still too much.
122271,471,197,1073000,Caretaker,OSTRICH FARM,We'll take good care of your dog.
122272,471,198,1075000,Homer Simpson,OSTRICH FARM,"I'm sure you will, because you take such good care of your ostriches."
122273,471,199,1081000,Homer Simpson,OSTRICH FARM,Maybe we should get going.
122274,471,200,1084000,Marge Simpson,OSTRICH FARM,"Bart, sweetie... would you like to say goodbye?"
122277,471,201,1089000,Bart Simpson,OSTRICH FARM,"Well, boy, I guess this is it. We've shared a lot of great memories, like the time we got our picture in the paper with the caption ""Who's Walking Who?"""
122278,471,202,1092000,Homer Simpson,OSTRICH FARM,I mailed them the answer but they never printed it.
122279,471,203,1102000,Bart Simpson,OSTRICH FARM,"But it's not my fault you're leaving, it's yours. Because you should never, ever kill a bird. Ever!"
122280,471,204,1109000,Bart Simpson,OSTRICH FARM,I'd like a moment to ourselves.
122281,471,205,1115000,Homer Simpson,OSTRICH FARM,"Ooo, unknown caller!"
122282,471,206,1118000,Homer Simpson,OSTRICH FARM,Hey!
122283,471,207,1123000,Homer Simpson,OSTRICH FARM,"All right, you, gimme back my phone, and nobody gets hurt."
122284,471,208,1127000,Homer Simpson,OSTRICH FARM,You said nobody gets hurt. Those were your exact words!
