144590,557,2,10000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey... but today's not Pork Chop Tuesday... or Gravy Thursday.
144591,557,3,16000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I also set up some mirrors so you could watch hockey fights while you eat.
144592,557,4,20000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo!
144593,557,5,23000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I love Canadian on Canadian violence. Oh baby, this is so great! Thank you so much!"

144594,557,7,34000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wait a minute -- that's not something people really feel. What's going on?
144595,557,8,39000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I do have a favor. Patty and Selma came home early from their vacation, but the cleaners still haven't gotten all the black mold out of their apartment..."
144597,557,10,50000,Marge Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,...so they need a place to stay. Here.
144599,557,12,54000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Paris was a bust. They wouldn't even let us see the Mona Lisa.
144600,557,13,58000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"They kept yelling ""La Joconde -- her smile will die!"""
144601,557,14,60000,Homer Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"No, Marge... no! You can't invite a couple of Riddlers to stay in the Bat Cave!"
144602,557,15,67000,Marge Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,You ate the food and looked in the mirrors! They're staying.
144603,557,16,79000,Homer Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Hm, oh honey, one teensy problem with this plan. I'm a teensy bit concerned about them smoking around the children. You know, their lungs are so teensy."
144604,557,17,92000,Marge Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,He has a point...
144605,557,18,94000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"No, no, no, no. We don't have to smoke!"
144606,557,19,96000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,We can stop whenever we want! See?
144608,557,21,102000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Okay, how about this: if you catch us smoking in the house even one time, you can throw us out on the street. Hm?"
144609,557,22,109000,Marge Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,You know what? I trust them not to smoke.
144610,557,23,112000,Homer Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"And if you trust them, I trust them too."
144611,557,24,119000,Homer Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Safety first.
144612,557,25,121000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Screw this. We'll just go outside.
144613,557,26,123000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Nature is God's ash tray.
144614,557,27,131000,Homer Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Bad news, bears. Forecast calls for nothing but rain."
144616,557,29,148000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Here we go, problem solved. Electric cigarettes."
144617,557,30,156000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,Choke on our harmless fumes.
144618,557,31,162000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you fall asleep with them, will you even burn to death?"
144619,557,32,165000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,Mmm-mmmm.
144621,557,34,171000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"They call these cigarettes? They don't stain my fingers, my hair smells like hair, and what do I stub out in my scrambled eggs?"
144622,557,35,177000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Sure, it's got the nicotine... but where's the tar? Where's the stab from every breath that reminds me I'm alive?"
144623,557,36,186000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,No smoke detector! Let's roll!
144624,557,37,197000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Wait, wait. Turn on the faucet so no one'll get suspicious."
144625,557,38,210000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ha! I gotcha!
144626,557,39,212000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You can't resist smoking in the house any more than I can resist drinking in the car.
144627,557,40,217000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What happened?
144628,557,41,217000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,I don't know. The water caught on fire!
144630,557,43,222000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And now I banish you from paradise! I'm glad I never bothered to learn which one of you is which.
144631,557,44,229000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Please, show some compassion for two good people who just can't stop smoking."
144632,557,45,236000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I know just the place.
144634,557,47,243000,Patty Bouvier,Springfield Downs Dog Track,Ohhh. Oooh... tobacco.
144635,557,48,252000,Patty Bouvier,Springfield Downs Dog Track,"Who needs Paris? This is our ""City of Lights."""
144637,557,50,264000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Flaming tap water. I saw something about that in a documentary...
144638,557,51,269000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, cute! This one..."
144639,557,52,278000,Narrator,Simpson Home,"In this rural community, Hydraulic Fracturing, or ""fracking,"" was greeted as a windfall."
144640,557,53,284000,Narrator,Simpson Home,"By pumping high-pressure liquid into underground shale deposits, ""fracking"" releases natural gas, but can lead to devastating environmental consequences."
144642,557,55,295000,Farmer,Farmhouse,"Yep. Used to be, you could try burnin' yer water all day, and nothing would happen."
144643,557,56,300000,Farmer,Farmhouse,"Henry, did you remember to turn off the slip 'n slide?"
144645,557,58,307000,Farmer,Farmhouse,I reckon not.
144646,557,59,310000,Farmer,Farmhouse,I think someone is fracking under our neighborhood. And I know who...
144648,557,61,314000,Farmer,THE RICH TEXAN'S MANSION,"It's you Mr. Texan. Oil wasn't enough, now you're going after our natural gas."
144649,557,62,320000,Farmer,THE RICH TEXAN'S MANSION,"Aw now. Ain't nothing ""natural"" about gas."
144650,557,63,323000,The Rich Texan,THE RICH TEXAN'S MANSION,"If you can't dance in it, I ain't drilling for it. I don't do this for the money. It's the dancin'. It's always been the dancin'."
144652,557,66,343000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh man, he made us watch him dance for three hours. And he really only has one move."
144653,557,67,349000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"If someone was fracking in our neighborhood, wouldn't we know it?"
144654,557,68,353000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue.
144655,557,69,355000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,This is clearly a fracking site. How are they keeping people away?
144657,557,71,363000,Lisa Simpson,"LARGE, BOXY BUILDING",It's a terrific sport that--
144658,557,72,365000,Bart Simpson,"LARGE, BOXY BUILDING",SHHH!
144660,557,74,369000,Lisa Simpson,STRANGE BUILDING,This whole building is just a façade for a drilling operation.
144661,557,75,375000,C. Montgomery Burns,STRANGE BUILDING,"Indeed it is. ""Evergreen Terrace"" is built atop a massive shale deposit."
144662,557,76,380000,C. Montgomery Burns,STRANGE BUILDING,"Think of it, all that poor natural gas, trapped underneath your shanties and lean-to's. Smithers, give these two brats what they deserve for sticking their noses in my business."
144664,557,78,395000,Lisa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Stopping Mr. Burns may be beyond the power of an eight-year-old girl with a book report due on ""Beezus and Ramona."" But I know someone who can help..."
144666,557,80,395000,Lisa Simpson,CAPITOL CITY,The first female speaker of the state assembly...
144668,557,82,395000,Lisa Simpson,STATE HOUSE,A politician who would never ignore a fellow environmentalist in need... my hero...

144671,557,85,416000,MAXINE LOMBARD,Office,Charge the electric limo. We're going to Springfield.
144672,557,86,420000,Aide,Office,What about your cool down period?
144673,557,87,421000,MAXINE LOMBARD,Office,What about it?
144675,557,89,425000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa! Motorcade!
144676,557,90,429000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Assemblywoman Lombard! You got my emails!
144677,557,91,432000,MAXINE LOMBARD,Simpson Home,"I'll go anywhere, anytime to defend our precious Bay Area values."
144678,557,92,437000,MAXINE LOMBARD,Simpson Home,"Oh, terrible."
144679,557,93,439000,MAXINE LOMBARD,Simpson Home,Just shocking. Does anybody have a baby we can hold near the flames?
144680,557,94,444000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess I do.
144681,557,95,447000,MAXINE LOMBARD,Simpson Home,I'm gonna hit this Mr. Burns with a politician's most powerful weapon: an invitation to a committee hearing.
144683,557,97,455000,MAXINE LOMBARD,STATE CAPITOL BUILDING,"Mr. Burns, do you admit that you illegally pumped toxic chemicals into the groundwater below Evergreen Terrace?"
144684,557,98,465000,C. Montgomery Burns,STATE CAPITOL BUILDING,I don't recall.
144685,557,99,466000,MAXINE LOMBARD,STATE CAPITOL BUILDING,"Mr. Burns, have you no regard for the life and health of your fellow human beings?"

144689,557,103,489000,C. Montgomery Burns,MAXINE'S OFFICE,I demand to see that capitalism-castrating suffragette this instant!
144690,557,104,495000,C. Montgomery Burns,MAXINE'S OFFICE,You haven't bested me! I will find a way to shatter that shale!
144691,557,105,499000,MAXINE LOMBARD,MAXINE'S OFFICE,What makes men like you think you can do whatever you want to our planet?
144692,557,106,503000,C. Montgomery Burns,MAXINE'S OFFICE,Maybe the planet wants a strong man to take her by the hand and lead her!
144693,557,107,507000,MAXINE LOMBARD,MAXINE'S OFFICE,You don't know what the planet wants.
144694,557,108,509000,C. Montgomery Burns,MAXINE'S OFFICE,"Oh, and I suppose you do?"
144695,557,109,511000,MAXINE LOMBARD,MAXINE'S OFFICE,"The planet wants to be protected and nourished, and maybe even..."
144696,557,110,516000,C. Montgomery Burns,MAXINE'S OFFICE,Kissed.

144698,557,112,528000,MAXINE LOMBARD,MAXINE'S OFFICE,No. Am I?
144699,557,113,530000,C. Montgomery Burns,MAXINE'S OFFICE,I don't think so.
144700,557,114,531000,MAXINE LOMBARD,MAXINE'S OFFICE,"Oh, good."
144705,557,119,547000,MAXINE LOMBARD,MAXINE'S OFFICE,You!
144706,557,120,547000,C. Montgomery Burns,MAXINE'S OFFICE,Me?
144707,557,121,553000,MAXINE LOMBARD,MAXINE'S OFFICE,This was all a mistake. An impulsive...
144708,557,122,556000,MAXINE LOMBARD,MAXINE'S OFFICE,Knee-buckling...
144709,557,123,558000,MAXINE LOMBARD,MAXINE'S OFFICE,Spanx-shredding mistake. It was great.
144710,557,124,563000,C. Montgomery Burns,MAXINE'S OFFICE,Best I've ever had. And that includes... Nellie Taft.
144711,557,125,569000,MAXINE LOMBARD,MAXINE'S OFFICE,"So, Monty, should we find a way to continue this purely passionate affair?"
144712,557,126,574000,C. Montgomery Burns,MAXINE'S OFFICE,But you're a soft-hearted liberal!
144713,557,127,576000,MAXINE LOMBARD,MAXINE'S OFFICE,And you're a hard-hearted capitalist.
144714,557,128,583000,MAXINE LOMBARD,MAXINE'S OFFICE,Now get out of my office.
144715,557,129,585000,C. Montgomery Burns,MAXINE'S OFFICE,As soon as I collect my things.
144717,557,131,593000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,If I want to resume fracking...
144718,557,132,593000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I have to buy the mineral rights for every single parcel of land in Evergreen Terrace. To win people over, I'll need a salesman whose folksy façade masks a deep gusher of greed."
144719,557,133,615000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Congratulations Simpson. You're now my Chief Energy Innovation Marketing Officer.
144720,557,134,615000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Woo-hoo!
144721,557,135,620000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,All you've got to do is sell fracking to your friends and neighbors.
144722,557,136,624000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Woo-hoo? I don't know... ""Fracking"" is one of those scary Lisa words."
144723,557,137,628000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Bah! Fracking produces enough clean natural gas to make America independent of sheikhs, caliphs and... Scandinavians. Not to mention it doesn't create any of that awful worker-mutating nuclear waste."
144724,557,138,639000,MUTANT CHARLIE,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Homer, game starts in an hour. Don't forget to set your fantasy lineup."
144725,557,139,643000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Thanks, Charlie. Maybe fracking isn't so bad."
144726,557,140,647000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Then say yes to this raise, this promotion, and this flannel shirt which says ""I'm not screwing you over!"""
144728,557,142,647000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm not screwing you over. No, uh... I'm not screwing you over. I'm not screwing you over."
144729,557,143,661000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm so proud of you, poppa."
144731,557,145,664000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,Some folks will tell you that fracking's no good. But what they don't tell you is... hydraulic fracturing creates jobs.
144732,557,146,671000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,And all those new workers are gonna want to spend their earnings buying what you're selling: beer.
144733,557,147,677000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,Authentic Italian food.
144734,557,148,679000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,Useless left-handed crap.
144735,557,149,681000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,Magical nonsense.
144736,557,150,683000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,Expensive toys for grownups they don't open or play with.
144737,557,151,686000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,Pornography and nachos.

144740,557,154,693000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,"Laundry. Homework. Pranks. Poop, poop and poop."
144741,557,155,696000,Marge Simpson,Skinner Home,But our water was on fire.
144742,557,156,699000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner Home,How could you sell fracking for Mr. Burns?
144743,557,157,702000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,"Because I've never gotten a promotion before. Once I thought I had, but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing. So judge me all you want."
144744,557,158,704000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner Home,I am judging you.
144745,557,159,711000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,"Good, judge away."
144746,557,160,713000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner Home,Judge-judge-judge--
144748,557,162,718000,Kent Brockman,Channel 6 News Desk,Pumping frack cash... it's a gas cash blast?
144749,557,163,722000,Kent Brockman,Channel 6 News Desk,Residents of Evergreen Terrace are undecided whether to sell their mineral rights to Mr. Burns.
144750,557,164,728000,MAXINE LOMBARD,Channel 6 News Desk,"Mr. Burns is a vampire, sucking the life blood of this town and lining his coffin with cash."

144753,557,167,739000,MAXINE LOMBARD,UPSCALE HOTEL ROOM,"Oh, Monty. You're such a sexy little Nosferatu."
144754,557,168,743000,C. Montgomery Burns,UPSCALE HOTEL ROOM,Same time tomorrow night? I'll bring the oxygen!
144755,557,169,747000,MAXINE LOMBARD,UPSCALE HOTEL ROOM,Better bring two tanks.
144757,557,171,750000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Elementary School,"And so, we see a clear correlation between industrial hydro-compounds and water table contamination well outside the margin of error."
144758,557,172,764000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Mr. Simpson? Rebuttal?
144759,557,173,767000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Everyone who signs over their mineral rights to Mr. Burns gets five thousand dollars!
144760,557,174,772000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Elementary School,Five thousand smackers?
144761,557,175,773000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Elementary School,Money is like a job you don't even have to do!

144764,557,178,787000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Elementary School,I think my arguments were more cogent !
144765,557,179,790000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,WHAT!?!?
144766,557,180,791000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Elementary School,COGENT !
144768,557,182,795000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Mr. Burns, we did it! Everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights."
144769,557,183,803000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Excellent?
144770,557,184,812000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Well... one.
144771,557,185,814000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I have embarked on a ""beneficial friendship"" with a woman with whom I have nothing in common. Her opinions are abhorrent to me. But the passion... well, look at these racy texts she sends me."
144772,557,186,830000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh baby...
144773,557,187,837000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, I'm no Carl when it comes to this stuff. But I ain't no Lenny neither. And I would say... no matter how much you try to keep things casual, someone always gets hurt."
144774,557,188,848000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hmm... Well then I must harden my heart against such an outcome.
144775,557,189,860000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Glad I could be of help...
144777,557,191,865000,Mayor Joe Quimby,FRACKING BUILDING,Do you have the signed gas leases?
144778,557,192,870000,C. Montgomery Burns,FRACKING BUILDING,Hold on. This feels light. One of these deeds is missing a signature.
144779,557,193,877000,C. Montgomery Burns,FRACKING BUILDING,The gas rights transfer form for 742 Evergreen Terrace was never signed by Marge Simpson!
144780,557,194,884000,Homer Simpson,FRACKING BUILDING,Marge? Why didn't you sign?
144781,557,195,886000,Marge Simpson,FRACKING BUILDING,Our water was on fire!
144782,557,196,889000,Mayor Joe Quimby,FRACKING BUILDING,"I'm sorry, but the law states that unless every single resident sells their rights, Burns can't frack drop one."
144784,557,198,899000,Lenny Leonard,FRACKING BUILDING,I was counting on that money to pay for my other calf implant!
144785,557,199,903000,Seymour Skinner,FRACKING BUILDING,I already felt the pride of energy independence!
144786,557,200,908000,Homer Simpson,FRACKING BUILDING,Marge Simpson... I'm as mad at you as you usually are at me.
144788,557,202,920000,MAXINE LOMBARD,FRACKING BUILDING,"Cheer up, Monty. All you lost was money, but what you get is... me."
144789,557,203,931000,C. Montgomery Burns,FRACKING BUILDING,"""All I lost was money?"" Let me make one thing perfectly clear -- our dalliance meant nothing to me! You were but a sprig of parsley garnishing my beefsteak, and now I cast you aside for the busboys to gnaw upon! Consider this ill-conceived affair terminated!"
144791,557,205,953000,Waylon Smithers,FRACKING BUILDING,I played this just perfectly.
144793,557,207,960000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh yeah, great. Great, Marge. Great work. Thanks to you, Springfield will never be a natural gas boom town. And like all boom towns it would have lasted forever."
