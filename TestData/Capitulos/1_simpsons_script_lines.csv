148867,1,104,458000,Bart Simpson,DERMATOLOGY CLINIC,Cool!
148868,1,105,458000,DOCTOR ZITSOFSKY,DERMATOLOGY CLINIC,"However, it is rather expensive and we must insist on a cash payment up front."

148881,1,118,491000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow! Quit it. It used to be a real boss tattoo.
148882,1,119,494000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But Mom had to spend all the Christmas money having it surgically removed.
148883,1,120,504000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's true. The jar's empty. Oh, my God, we're ruined. Christmas is cancelled. No presents for anyone."

148891,1,128,560000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you tell me that all the time."
148892,1,129,561000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, good. Because I do love you and I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping."
148893,1,130,570000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"But I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus. I keep asking for it, but..."

148994,1,230,895000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Workshop,"Don't kill me, Dad. I didn't know it was you."
148995,1,231,897000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Workshop,"Nobody knows. It's a secret. I didn't get my bonus this year, but to keep the family from missing out on Christmas, I'd do anything."
148996,1,232,904000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Workshop,"I'll say, Dad. You must really love us to sink so low."
148997,1,233,910000,Homer Simpson,Santa's Workshop,"Now let's not get mushy, son. I still have a job to do."

149019,1,255,961000,Homer Simpson,PERSONNEL OFFICE,What?
149020,1,256,961000,Barney Gumble,PERSONNEL OFFICE,You heard me. I'm going to the dog track. I got a hot little puppy in the fourth race. Wanna come?
149022,1,257,967000,Homer Simpson,PERSONNEL OFFICE,"Sorry, Barney. I may be a total washout as a father, but I'm not gonna take my kid to some sleazy dog track on Christmas eve."
149023,1,258,975000,Barney Gumble,PERSONNEL OFFICE,"Come on, Simpson. The dog's name is Whirlwind, ten to one shot. Money in the bank."
149024,1,259,980000,Homer Simpson,PERSONNEL OFFICE,Uh-uh.
149025,1,260,982000,Bart Simpson,PERSONNEL OFFICE,"Ah, come on Dad, this can be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas. If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it's gonna happen to us."
149026,1,261,999000,Homer Simpson,PERSONNEL OFFICE,"Well, okay. Let's go."
149027,1,262,1001000,Homer Simpson,PERSONNEL OFFICE,Who's Tiny Tim?

149031,1,266,1015000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, no!"
149032,1,267,1016000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, brother!"

149034,1,269,1018000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,Yeah.
149035,1,270,1018000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,It's getting late.
149036,1,271,1019000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He said he went caroling with Bart.
149038,1,273,1022000,Barney Gumble,Springfield Downs Dog Track,WE'RE IN THE MONEY / WE'RE IN THE MONEY / WE GOT A LOT OF WHAT IT TAKES TO GET ALONG.
149039,1,274,1029000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Downs Dog Track,I can't believe I'm doing this.
149041,1,276,1031000,Little Boy,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"Can we open our presents now, Dad?"
149042,1,277,1034000,Father,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"You know the tradition, son. Not till the eighth race."
149044,1,279,1037000,Homer Simpson,PADDOCK,"Hey, Barney, which one is Whirlwind?"
149045,1,280,1039000,Barney Gumble,PADDOCK,"Number six. That's our lucky dog, right over there. He's won his last five races."
149046,1,281,1046000,Homer Simpson,PADDOCK,What! That scrawny little bag of bones?
149047,1,282,1049000,Bart Simpson,PADDOCK,"Come on, Dad. They're all scrawny little bags of bones."
149048,1,283,1052000,Homer Simpson,PADDOCK,"Yeah, you're right. I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas."
149049,1,284,1057000,Announcer,PADDOCK,"Attention racing fans. We have a late scratch in the fourth race. Number eight, Sir Galahad, will be replaced by Santa's Little Helper. Once again, Sir Galahad has been replaced by Santa's Little Helper."
149021,1,285,1069000,Homer Simpson,PADDOCK,"Bart, did you hear that? What a name -- ""Santa's Little Helper"". It's a sign! It's an omen!"
149051,1,286,1075000,Bart Simpson,PADDOCK,"It's a coincidence, Dad."
149053,1,288,1077000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWN,What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper?
149054,1,289,1079000,Ticket Seller,SPRINGFIELD DOWN,Ninety nine to one.
149055,1,290,1080000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWN,Whoa! Ninety-nine times thirteen equals MER-RY CHRISTMAS!
149056,1,291,1086000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWN,I got a bad feeling about this.
149057,1,292,1088000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWN,"Don't you believe in me, son?"
149058,1,293,1089000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWN,Uh...
149059,1,294,1089000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWN,"Come on, boy. Sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going."
149060,1,295,1095000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWN,"Oh, go for it, Dad."
149061,1,296,1098000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWN,That's my boy. Everything on Santa's Little Helper.
149063,1,298,1102000,Elf #1,Simpson Home,Three cheers for Brainy.
149064,1,299,1104000,Elves,Simpson Home,"Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray!"

149067,1,302,1109000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,It's almost nine o'clock.
149068,1,303,1110000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,Where is Homer anyway?
149069,1,304,1111000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,It's so typical of the big doofus to spoil it all.
149070,1,305,1114000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"What, Aunt Patty?"
149071,1,306,1115000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Oh, nothing dear. I'm just trashing your father."
149072,1,307,1119000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well I wish you wouldn't because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have. Therefore he is my model of manhood and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me. And I am far to young to defend myself against such onslaughts."
149073,1,308,1142000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Um-hm. Go watch your cartoon show, dear."
149075,1,310,1147000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"Come on, Bart. Kiss the ticket for good luck, not that we need it. Heh-heh-heh."
149076,1,311,1155000,Announcer,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,Here comes Screwy the Mechanical Rabbit. And they're off!
149077,1,312,1159000,Announcer,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,Around the first turn.

149079,1,314,1161000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"Come on, dog! Go, man! Go! Come on Santa's Little Helper! Run baby run!"
149080,1,315,1161000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"Come on Santa's Little Helper! Go, go, go! Run your tail off!"
149082,1,316,1162000,Announcer,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"It's ""Whirlwind"" in the lead..."
149083,1,317,1162000,Announcer,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"And coming up on the left is ""Quadruped"", followed by Dog O' War and ""Fido""."
149084,1,318,1168000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,Go! Go!
149085,1,319,1168000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,Go Santa's Little Helper!

149090,1,324,1180000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"Don't worry, Dad. Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens."
149091,1,325,1186000,Announcer,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"Around the clubhouse turn, Whirlwind is staking out a big lead, a couple of lengths. Quadruped fighting it out and coming up fast, Chew My Shoe."
149092,1,326,1194000,Announcer,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"And it's ""Whirlwind"" by a country mile, and in second, ""Chew My Shoe"" followed by ""Dog O' War""."
149094,1,328,1200000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me."
149095,1,329,1204000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,I don't want to leave till our dog finishes.
149096,1,330,1212000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS,"Ah, forget it. Let's go."
149098,1,332,1223000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS PARKING LOT,"Find any winners, son?"

149105,1,339,1254000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS PARKING LOT,"Oh, can we keep him Dad, please?"
149106,1,340,1257000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS PARKING LOT,But he's a loser. He's pathetic. He's...
149107,1,341,1263000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOWNS PARKING LOT,-- a Simpson.
149109,1,343,1268000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe I should call the police.
149110,1,344,1270000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Oh, he'll sober up."
149111,1,345,1272000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Yeah, and come staggering home."
