138399,532,3,187000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,But the Simpson abode was deep down in the dumps. 'Cause from little to bigger the kids had the mumps.
138401,532,5,193000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, I'm off to a party, my outfit is chic. It's a Catwoman costume I'm sure is unique."

138423,532,28,302000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"I don't hand out candy, you son of a Gritch."
138424,532,29,305000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"He pulled out bamfoozlers, and side-winding whizzles..."
138425,532,30,310000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,He laughed as he heard that old codger's house-sizzles.

138433,532,38,355000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, hey, hey! This is supposed to be a children's story!"
138434,532,39,358000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Go grab all his money and vodka and gin. And I'll knit a nice thnord from his leathery skin.
138436,532,41,364000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGVILLE,"Say, Mr. Hat, I don't mean to complain, but you promised us candy, not mayhem and pain."
138437,532,42,371000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGVILLE,"The dude thought a while, then said:"
138438,532,43,371000,Fat In The Hat,SPRINGVILLE,"...I know a man. With an over-priced store, who'll give all that he can..."

138447,532,55,420000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,...so we hitched us a ride on a three-hump gumbamel!
138448,532,56,423000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"A gumbamel's a camel but faster and humbler. It doesn't take tips and it's never a grumbler. So if you must leave in a kind of a scramble, then jump on the hump of a humble gumbamel."
138449,532,57,433000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"But if the gumbamel should ramble, then stumble, then just hop atop a Krustiferous Krumbull. But then if that Krumbull should happen to tumble, just call your amigo, the bee man of bumble."

138454,532,62,449000,Fat In The Hat,Simpson Home,"I'm staying forever. You're all stuck with that. 'Cause I'm your new daddy, the Fat in the--"
138455,532,63,460000,Fat In The Hat,Simpson Home,"I'm frightened of nothing, not even Hell fires. Just don't let me ever be played by Mike Meyers."
138456,532,64,470000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So please do not worry, 'cause we did okay."
138457,532,65,474000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, kids will get candy, whatever you say."

138461,532,69,493000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield,"Bart, isn't it dangerous to fly your kite by an airport?"

138491,532,98,610000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Man cave! Everyone's welcome to my man cave!
138493,532,100,620000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I assure you, we've spared no effort to accommodate your special-needs student."

138503,532,110,655000,Ralph Wiggum,Miss Hoover's Classroom,That was gonna be my show and tell!
138505,532,112,657000,Therapist,CHILD THERAPY OFFICE,"Bart, Lisa... I'm afraid you two are going to be together for a long time. Why don't you try to say something good about each other?"

138507,532,114,669000,Therapist,CHILD THERAPY OFFICE,"Bart, aren't Lisa's ears clean?"
138508,532,115,671000,Bart Simpson,CHILD THERAPY OFFICE,"Yeah, it's like looking down a Canadian tunnel."

138536,532,144,785000,Lisa Simpson,LUMBER MILL,Why Bart? I thought we were friends!
138537,532,145,788000,Bart Simpson,LUMBER MILL,A brother can never be friends with his sister!

138612,532,217,1046000,Moe Szyslak,CIRCUS,My mother's ring. She gave it to me on her deathbed. She also acquired it on her deathbed. That was a very busy deathbed.
138613,532,218,1054000,Homer Simpson,CIRCUS,With an emerald that big I could buy anything -- a jalopy! An icebox! A steamer trunk full of fedoras! But how do I get my hands on it?
138614,532,219,1064000,Homer Simpson,CIRCUS,"I'm an idiot! Of course! I get Marge to marry Moe, then I kill Moe, then she gets the ring, then I marry her, and the ring is mine. And the brilliance of my plan is its simplicity!"
138615,532,220,1076000,Barney Gumble,CIRCUS,You're gonna be sorry you said that.
138616,532,221,1078000,Homer Simpson,CIRCUS,You're gonna be sorry you said that.
138617,532,222,1087000,Barney Gumble,CIRCUS,"I just lost my keys! What do you know, I am gathering moss!"
138619,532,224,1096000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S WAGON,"Hey Marge, you wanna marry Moe?"
138620,532,225,1098000,Marge Simpson,MARGE'S WAGON,"I'm engaged to you, my love."
138621,532,226,1100000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S WAGON,The poor lonely fellow is about to die.
138622,532,227,1103000,Marge Simpson,MARGE'S WAGON,Really? How?
138623,532,228,1104000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S WAGON,"Let me worry about how. But you know, you could make his last day a happy one. And the ring is just the icing on the cake."
138624,532,229,1111000,Marge Simpson,MARGE'S WAGON,What ring?
138625,532,230,1112000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S WAGON,The ring that'll get me outta this lousy circus and into a good circus. Now let's get you married.
138626,532,231,1118000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S WAGON,"But won't you be jealous, my love?"
138627,532,232,1120000,Homer Simpson,MARGE'S WAGON,"Dear, I am not the jealous type. And from you, I have learned to feel compassion for these disgustos."
138628,532,233,1128000,Marge Simpson,MARGE'S WAGON,Awww...
138630,532,235,1130000,Marge Simpson,CIRCUS,"She's a superfreak, superfreak, she's superfreaky, yow!"
138631,532,236,1146000,Marge Simpson,CIRCUS,"Moe, whatever small time together we have will be wonderful."
138632,532,237,1152000,Homer Simpson,CIRCUS,Ho ho ho! A very small time!
138633,532,238,1154000,Homer Simpson,CIRCUS,"Those are strange things to say, but a wedding is no place to worry about threats from the bride's former lover. Now, the toast..."
138634,532,239,1162000,Homer Simpson,CIRCUS,"To you, Marge. Now you are one of us."
138635,532,240,1164000,Homer Simpson,CIRCUS,One of us! Gooble goo!
138636,532,241,1168000,Freaks,CIRCUS,One of us! Gooble goo!
138542,532,242,1172000,C. Montgomery Burns,CIRCUS,Why is it company parties always get weird?
138637,532,244,1177000,Moe Szyslak,MARGUERITE'S WAGON,"God, you are so beautiful in that peignoir there. I uh, better freshen up a little bit."
138638,532,245,1185000,Moe Szyslak,MARGUERITE'S WAGON,"Set it to ""massage,"" Jumbo!"
138639,532,246,1192000,Marge Simpson,MARGUERITE'S WAGON,What are you doing?
138640,532,247,1193000,Homer Simpson,MARGUERITE'S WAGON,"Trying to kill Moe so we'll get his emerald. By the way, I haven't checked, but emeralds are valuable, right?"
138641,532,248,1201000,Homer Simpson,MARGUERITE'S WAGON,"Strong man, Moe may be ugly on the outside, but inside, you are the true monster. Leave my trailer forever!"
138642,532,249,1210000,Homer Simpson,MARGUERITE'S WAGON,"You're rejecting me? But I'm in the best shape anyone is, in the nineteen thirties."
138643,532,250,1216000,Marge Simpson,MARGUERITE'S WAGON,I said go!
138645,532,252,1222000,Freaks,CIRCUS,One of us! Gooble goo! One of us! Gooble goo!
138646,532,253,1226000,Homer Simpson,CIRCUS,What the hell does gooble goo mean?
138647,532,254,1228000,Freaks,CIRCUS,We don't know! Gooble goo! We don't know! Gooble goo!
