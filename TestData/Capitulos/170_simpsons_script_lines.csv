38129,170,10,87000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that sounds fabulous, Homer. Stores throw the best parties."
38130,170,11,93000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You like parties, huh? Well, I just remembered they're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend."
38131,170,12,98000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You didn't remember that. You just saw it on TV.
38132,170,13,101000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The important thing is I didn't imagine it.
38134,170,15,105000,JANEY,Lisa's Bedroom,"I can't get enough of ""The Babysitter Twins""! They arrested the counterfeiters, rescued the President and made four dollars!"
38135,170,16,113000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"I love everything about the world of babysitting: the responsibility, the obligation, the pressure..."
38136,170,17,119000,JANEY,Lisa's Bedroom,And full refrigerator privileges!
38137,170,18,122000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"That's a trust, Janey. A sacred trust."
38138,170,19,125000,JANEY,Lisa's Bedroom,"Geez, lighten up, Lisa."
38140,170,21,130000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"That concludes our service. All right. I have two announcements. Friday you will have the chance to ""party down"" in the church basement to the Jesus-rock stylings of ""Testament"". That's Friday, six p.m. sharp."
38141,170,22,144000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,All the best bands are affiliated with Satan.
38142,170,23,147000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Also, anyone in need of a reliable and affordable babysitter should call Lisa Simpson."
38143,170,24,153000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Mention the topic of today's sermon to get a dollar off.
38144,170,25,162000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,The topic was love.
38146,170,27,165000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why hasn't anyone called?
38147,170,28,166000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe people don't want an eight-year-old babysitter, honey. Parents need to be sure their sitter can handle anything that might happen. That's why they hire teenagers."
38148,170,29,176000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But... but I'm very mature for my age. People often mistake me for nine.
38149,170,30,183000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Homer, I've got a fozzie of a bear of a problem. Y'know, Maude and her mother were visiting Tyre and Sidon, the twin cities of the Holy Land. They must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong God, because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort."
38150,170,31,198000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Militants, huh? Well, if I were you, I'd kick their asses."
38151,170,32,201000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but I have to drive to Capital City, fill out some forms to get 'em out. Could you possibly watch the kids tonight?"
38152,170,33,210000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, gee, I'd really love to want to help you, Flanders, but uh, Marge was taken prisoner in the... Holy Land and uh..."
38153,170,34,222000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll do it! I'll babysit!
38154,170,35,224000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, I don't know, Lisa. You're awfully young, and the boys can be a handful. Todd's been pinching everyone lately."
38155,170,36,231000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"But I'm smart and responsible, and my parents will be right next door!"
38156,170,37,235000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, what do you say, Homer? Can Lisa babysit for my kids?"
38157,170,38,238000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Please, please, please!"
38158,170,39,239000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll have to ask her.
37795,170,42,246000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,Where are the dice?
38159,170,43,248000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,Daddy says dice are wicked.
38160,170,44,250000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,We just move one space at a time. It's less fun that way!
38161,170,45,255000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,Moth! Moth! Moth!
38162,170,46,258000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,Don't worry. A moth is no more harmful than a ladybug.
38163,170,47,262000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,A ladybug?!
38164,170,48,266000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,"Oh, they're going to get eaten alive in middle school."
38165,170,49,270000,Rod Flanders,Flanders Home,And thank you for sending Lisa to protect us from the bug you sent.
38166,170,50,274000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,And please make Lisa tell us a bedtime story... about robots... named Rod and Todd. Amen.
38167,170,51,285000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,Once there was a robot named Todd...
38168,170,52,288000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,Did he have a brother?
38169,170,53,289000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,"Yes, he had a brother robot named Rod, who was two space-years older than him."
38170,170,54,295000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,I don't like this story.
38171,170,55,298000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh, imagine that -- sleeping quietly after a bug attack! Oh, and Todd's as dry as a bone! Lisa, you're a wonder! I'm going to recommend you to everybody!"
38173,170,57,312000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"So long, Lisa. If anything goes wrong, just dial 9-1-1. Unless it's an emergency."
38174,170,58,318000,Lisa Simpson,Wiggum Home,"Okay, Chief. Enjoy Bob Saget!"
38175,170,59,320000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,Heh. It's Bob Seger!
38176,170,60,323000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"Aw, crap..."
38177,170,61,325000,Lisa Simpson,Wiggum Home,Now put your left leg into the left side of the pants -- and you're done.
38178,170,62,329000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,I dressed myself!
38180,170,64,334000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Dad, how come you're wearing a tuxedo?"
38181,170,65,337000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.
38182,170,66,339000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you wearing it now?
38183,170,67,341000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, it's like a rent-a-car, son. You get all the mileage you can. Then ball it up and cram it through the mail slot."
38185,170,69,352000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Thanks for the ride!
38186,170,70,353000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Bart's Bedroom,"Well, you did a first-rate job of babysitting. I've never seen such a responsible young lady."
38187,170,71,358000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Thank you, Dr. Hibbert. Your trust means so much to me."
38188,170,72,361000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Bart's Bedroom,I only wish my Volvo mechanic were as reliable.
38190,170,73,366000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Bart's Bedroom,"Good night, Lisa..."
38192,170,75,373000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,You made all that money for sitting around and watching TV and eating food?
38193,170,76,377000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"There's a lot more to it than that, Bart. I don't just babysit; I sell peace of mind for a dollar an hour -- two dollars after nine o'clock."
38194,170,77,385000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Man, if I was making that kind of money, I'd be out of here so fast..."
38196,170,79,395000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,"You look so glamorous, Mom! Oh, and you smell like vanilla flowers!"
38197,170,80,400000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,"And Dad, you look totally classy. You could be Abe Lincoln's father's boss!"
38198,170,81,404000,Homer Simpson,TV ROOM,Can you see the pie stains?
38199,170,82,405000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,It'll be dark.
38200,170,83,407000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,So when's Grampa getting here to babysit?
38201,170,84,409000,Marge Simpson,TV ROOM,"Uh, Grampa's not coming..."
38202,170,85,411000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,Not Patty and Selma!
38203,170,86,413000,Marge Simpson,TV ROOM,"Actually, Bart, Lisa is going to be in charge tonight."
38204,170,87,416000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,What?!
38205,170,88,417000,Marge Simpson,TV ROOM,"I know she's young, but Lisa has proven herself mature and dependable."
38206,170,89,421000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,"Dad, help me out!"
38207,170,90,422000,Homer Simpson,TV ROOM,"Take it like a man, boy. And do everything your little sister says."
38208,170,91,425000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,This is an outrage! I am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is! This is the greatest injustice in the history of the world!
38209,170,92,431000,Marge Simpson,TV ROOM,"Well, we have to run. I'm sure you kids will work things out. Good night!"
38210,170,93,438000,Marge Simpson,TV ROOM,"Make sure he brushes his teeth, Lisa."
38212,170,95,448000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, I know you're not wild about having me for a babysitter, but I'm not some ogre. I think you will find me fair and fun."
38213,170,96,454000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're dead.
38214,170,97,456000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You should wash up for dinner. To make it fun, you can use the Mr. Bubble -- it'll be like giving your fingers a bubble bath!"
38215,170,98,462000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You are so dead.
38217,170,100,467000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Aw, I love this pedestrian mall! There's practically no traffic!"
38218,170,101,474000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Uh, I don't think we should be driving here. The mayor's yelling at us."
37829,170,102,479000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Simpson Car,"Stop, you idiots!"
38219,170,103,481000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"All right, all right, geez. Okay, honey, remember where we're parked."
38221,170,105,494000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,May I have some more lima beans?
38222,170,106,497000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Certainly.

38228,170,112,504000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, maybe you should eat the ones you have."
38229,170,113,506000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I didn't say I was gonna eat them. I just wanted to look at them, because they're so gross. What's for dessert?"
38230,170,114,512000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, if you don't want to have a babysitter, maybe you should stop being such a baby."
38231,170,115,517000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm a baby, huh? Well, then I'll act like a baby."
38232,170,116,521000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ga-ga-goo-goo.
38233,170,117,523000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Even babies know how to open and close their mouths. You need a bib.
38234,170,118,527000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, baby hate bib. Waah! Waah!"
38235,170,119,529000,Maggie Simpson,Simpson Home,Waah! Waah!
38236,170,120,534000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, look, Bart, now you got Maggie all upset!"
38237,170,121,537000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Relax. I'll give her some ice cream.
38239,170,123,543000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, that's coffee ice cream! It has caffeine in it!"
38240,170,124,547000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I guess that'll make things more interesting for you now, won't it?"
38242,170,126,553000,Marge Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Oh, it's so beautiful! This is what I imagine Paris must be like!"
38243,170,127,560000,Homer Simpson,South Street Squidport,You've never been?
38244,170,128,561000,Marge Simpson,South Street Squidport,"I'm so honored that Springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores. I guess this makes us ""yuppies,"" huh, Homie?"
38245,170,129,569000,Homer Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Nah, I'm really more of a slacker."
38246,170,130,571000,Marge Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Oooh, Malaria Zone! That's where all the explorers shop."
38247,170,131,577000,Homer Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Look, Marge! A restaurant owned by celebrities! I always wanted to be a celebrity!"
38248,170,132,584000,Rainier Wolfcastle,South Street Squidport,"Ha, ha, yes, it's true. The entire menu was personally approved by my secretary."
38249,170,133,591000,Marge Simpson,South Street Squidport,Isn't that clever? It looks like a Cadillac drove right into the building.
37936,170,134,595000,Hans Moleman,South Street Squidport,Help me!
38250,170,135,597000,Homer Simpson,South Street Squidport,"Wow, even Moe's moved to fancy new digs."
38251,170,136,608000,Distressed Yuppie,South Street Squidport,"Hey, this isn't faux dive. This is a dive."
38252,170,137,613000,Moe Szyslak,South Street Squidport,"You're a long way from home, Yuppie boy. I'll start a tab."
38254,170,139,617000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mag-gie, if you come down, I'll give you some more cof-fee."
38256,170,141,623000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lots more coffee. Are you getting ready for bed, Bart?"
38257,170,142,629000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I am!
38259,170,144,631000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,"That's right, I want the 25-foot Italian party sub. And don't skimp on the vinegar. It's time Lisa learned what babysitting Bart Simpson is all about..."
38260,170,145,643000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,"Um, yes, I'd like to host an A.A. meeting. Tonight, if possible."
38262,170,147,648000,Lisa Simpson,Maggie's Bedroom,"Come on, Maggie... Good Maggie... The talcum powder's not to play with..."
38265,170,150,663000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,"Okay, Bart, now it's really time for you to go to bed!"
38266,170,151,673000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,Why do you have to make this so hard?
38267,170,152,677000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,I'm using non-violent resistance.
38268,170,153,679000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,Uch! The idea that you would compare yourself to Mahatma Gandhi...
38269,170,154,683000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,Who?
38270,170,155,683000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,I'll answer it. You go to bed!
38271,170,156,691000,Young Italian Man #1,TV ROOM,"Good evening there, miss. Here's yer giant sub, swimmin' in vinegar just the way you like it. It's gonna be $225, plus tip."
38272,170,157,700000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,What? I didn't order any giant sub!
38273,170,158,704000,Krusty the Clown,TV ROOM,Hey hey! Are you ready to get rowdy?!

38278,170,163,717000,Paramedic,TV ROOM,Who called for an emergency sisterectomy?
38279,170,164,728000,Colonel Leslie Hapablap,TV ROOM,We got a report that a Lisa Simpson spotted a U.F.O...
38280,170,165,731000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,I didn't see any U.F.O.!
38281,170,166,734000,Colonel Leslie Hapablap,TV ROOM,"That's right, miss. You didn't."
38282,170,167,739000,Limo Driver,TV ROOM,I'm here to pick up the ambassador from Ghana.
38283,170,168,741000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,"Well, he's not here! Nobody's here! And none of you should be here! You've all been tricked!"
38284,170,169,747000,Limo Driver,TV ROOM,Why would the ambassador do such a thing?
38285,170,170,751000,Lisa Simpson,TV ROOM,"Bart, you are going to be in so much trouble when Mom and Dad get home. Now go to bed!"
38286,170,171,758000,Bart Simpson,TV ROOM,You're the boss.
