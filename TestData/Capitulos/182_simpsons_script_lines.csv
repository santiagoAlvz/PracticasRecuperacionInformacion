41405,182,92,511000,Homer Simpson,PROFESSOR FRINK'S HOUSE,He's crazy.
41406,182,93,512000,Bart Simpson,PROFESSOR FRINK'S HOUSE,"Hey Einstein , how much for the mood pants?"
41407,182,94,517000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROFESSOR FRINK'S HOUSE,Buuuhll... how much you got?
41408,182,95,523000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROFESSOR FRINK'S HOUSE,"Nice try, Floyd. But you were designed for scrubbing, and scrubbing is what you shall do."
41410,182,97,539000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROFESSOR FRINK'S HOUSE,"I take it from that little impressed noise that you are interested in purchasing that matter transporter, sir."
41411,182,98,546000,Homer Simpson,PROFESSOR FRINK'S HOUSE,"Hmmm, two bucks... And it only transports matter? Umm... Well, ah... I'll give you 35 cents."
41412,182,99,557000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROFESSOR FRINK'S HOUSE,"Sold! But I must warn you, this device carries a frighteningly high risk of catastrophic..."
41413,182,100,564000,Homer Simpson,PROFESSOR FRINK'S HOUSE,I said I'll take it.

41421,182,108,605000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Dad, can I use the transporter sometime? Please, I swear I'll be careful."
41422,182,109,610000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, but this is a highly sophistimicated doowhackey. If you don't use it responsibly... Kablamo!"
41423,182,110,618000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow! Someone just punched me in the face!
41424,182,111,620000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It was your mother.
41425,182,112,626000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, cat. Now, if this works, your next trip will be to the bank vault."
41428,182,115,642000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, cool! Twice the pet and none of the mess."
41429,182,116,647000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ohh. Uhl. You can be Lisa's.
41430,182,117,654000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmm...

41432,182,119,665000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'd be stupid not to do this.
41433,182,120,682000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"It worked! I was hoping to be humongous. Oh well, at least I don't have two butts."
41434,182,121,690000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's going on down there? What's all this mist?
41435,182,122,694000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh.
41436,182,123,695000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh! Ow! Uh!
41437,182,124,700000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, are you in there? Have you forgotten our little ""kablamo"" talk?"
41439,182,126,714000,Fly-head,Simpson Home,Bluggh! Blarrr!
41440,182,127,716000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, stop! According to this, it says Bart mixed up his DNA with a fly's. I think that's Bart!"
41441,182,128,724000,Fly-head,Simpson Home,Bluggh? Blarrr! Blagh!
41442,182,129,726000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I think she's right. The pants are a dead giveaway.
41443,182,130,729000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, well, he may be a horrible freak, but he's still my son. I'm sure we'll grow to accept him in time."
41444,182,131,744000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, stop that!"
41445,182,132,744000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So then Lenny says, ""As if! Don't even go there, sister."""
41447,182,134,744000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good one, Dad."
41448,182,135,751000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, well Lenny said it."
41449,182,136,755000,Fly-head,Simpson Home,Blaahh!

41451,182,138,759000,Fly-head,Simpson Home,Blah!
41452,182,139,759000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"There's one thing I still don't understand. When Bart went through the transporter, what happened to his head?"
41453,182,140,765000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Eh, it'll turn up somewhere."
41454,182,141,769000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Help me! Help meeeee!
41455,182,142,774000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Sucker!
41456,182,143,787000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, okay. It's your sugar, Bart."
41457,182,144,791000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That imposter!
41458,182,145,796000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom! Dad! I'm the real Bart! That's just some overgrown fly with my body! Somebody listen to me!
41459,182,146,803000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mm! Shoo! Shoo, fly!"
41460,182,147,808000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen, buddy -- this is all a mistake. If you'll just go through the transporter with me again, we'll have you back eating garbage in no time."
41462,182,149,818000,Fly-head,Simpson Home,BLARRGH!
41463,182,150,821000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Get 'im, boy! Smash that fly! Mush him up good!"
41464,182,151,826000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nice work, son."
41465,182,152,832000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! Is that you?!
41466,182,153,836000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't hear you. Wait! Fly into my saxophone!
41467,182,154,842000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Help me, Lis! That giant fly stole my body, and now he's trying to kill me!"
41468,182,155,847000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh no! And I let him use my toothbrush! Well, that hideous creep doesn't scare me."
41470,182,157,857000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Mom, Dad, help! He's trying to kill me!"
41471,182,158,860000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Nobody likes a tattletale, honey."
41472,182,159,862000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,They're like this every rainy day.
41475,182,162,876000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Get my filthy hands off my sister!
41476,182,163,878000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoa! No! Don't eat me! You don't know where I've been!
41477,182,164,885000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You just made a big mistake, Fly Boy."
41478,182,165,893000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey! It worked!
41479,182,166,895000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we were lucky this time. But it's all too clear that some things in this universe aren't meant to be trifled with."
41480,182,167,904000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, what are you doing?"
41481,182,168,906000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Something I should have done a long time ago.
41482,182,169,909000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll teach you to mess with my machine!
41483,182,170,913000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna chop you good!
41484,182,171,916000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That cost me 35 cents!
41485,182,172,918000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're just making it worse. I promise I won't hurt you.
41487,182,174,932000,Governor Quimby,Springfield Town Square,You are all hereby found guilty of the crime of witchcraft. I sentence you hags to be burned at the stake until you are deemed fit to re-enter society.

41493,182,180,953000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Square,How horrible.
41494,182,181,954000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"If they're really witches, why don't they use their powers to escape?"
41495,182,182,958000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"That sounds like witch talk to me, Lisa."
41496,182,183,961000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Never mind.
41497,182,184,962000,Goodman Flanders,Springfield Town Square,"Well, that's seventy-five witches we've processed. That oughta show God whose side we're on, eh Pastor?"
41498,182,185,967000,Pastor Lovejoy,Springfield Town Square,"Yes, Nedwin, but we have many more strumpets to incinerate."

41502,182,189,980000,Homer Simpson,Town Meeting House,Woo hoo! I accuse Goody Flanders.
41504,182,191,985000,Goodman Skinner,Town Meeting House,I accuse Goody Badwife.
41505,182,192,986000,Constable Wiggum,Town Meeting House,"Uh, we killed her on Sunday."

41515,182,202,1008000,Marge Simpson,Town Meeting House,This is crazy! I'm not a witch!
41516,182,203,1011000,Goody Krabappel,Town Meeting House,Ha! Then how come your laundry is always much whiter than mine?!
41517,182,204,1015000,Goodman Moe,Town Meeting House,"Oh, I've heard enough! Burn her!"
41518,182,205,1016000,Crowd,Town Meeting House,Burn her! / Burn her! / Put the match to her! /
41519,182,206,1020000,Governor Quimby,Town Meeting House,"People, let us not turn into an angry mob. Goody Simpson is entitled to due process."
41521,182,208,1027000,Constable Wiggum,SPRYNGE-FIELDE GORGE,"Okay, here's how the process works. You sit on the broom and we shove you off the cliff."
41522,182,209,1031000,Marge Simpson,SPRYNGE-FIELDE GORGE,What?!
41523,182,210,1032000,Constable Wiggum,SPRYNGE-FIELDE GORGE,"Well, hear me out. If you're innocent, you will fall to an honorable Christian death. If, however, you are the bride of Satan, you will surely fly your broom to safety. At that point you will report back here for torture and beheading."
41524,182,211,1046000,Goodman Skinner,SPRYNGE-FIELDE GORGE,"Tough, but fair."
41525,182,212,1047000,Lisa Simpson,SPRYNGE-FIELDE GORGE,"Stop! Doesn't the Bible say ""Judge not lest ye be judged""?"
41526,182,213,1055000,Crowd,SPRYNGE-FIELDE GORGE,/ Ohh... / That's a good point. / Hmmm... / Yeah.
41527,182,214,1055000,Constable Wiggum,SPRYNGE-FIELDE GORGE,The bible says a lot of things.... Shove her.
41529,182,216,1063000,Pastor Lovejoy,SPRYNGE-FIELDE GORGE,"Brothers and sisters, we have performed the Lord's work, and sent a good woman into his waiting..."
41402,182,218,1075000,Homer Simpson,SPRYNGE-FIELDE GORGE,"Okay, now let's not jump to conclusions, everyone."
