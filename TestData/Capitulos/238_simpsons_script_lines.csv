58174,238,19,127000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Our first Springfield Pride Award goes to a local legend.
58175,238,20,131000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,A man who brings laughter and joy to the children of Springfield...
58177,238,22,136000,Britney Spears,Springfield Civic Auditorium,With his big red nose and baggy pants...
58178,238,23,139000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Krusty the Clown!
58179,238,24,140000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Hey hey!
58180,238,25,141000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Wha...?!
58181,238,26,142000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Who are you?
58182,238,27,144000,Young Man,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Seat filler.
58183,238,28,155000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Everyone gets an award but me.
58184,238,29,157000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"I can't help it if I donated the most blood. Oh, I'm feeling kinda woozy."
58185,238,30,168000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"Oh, why won't anyone give me an award?"
58186,238,31,171000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,You won a Grammy.
58187,238,32,172000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,I mean an award that's worth winning.
58188,238,33,186000,Britney Spears,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"You know, Kent, in today's youth-obsessed culture, we sometimes forget that older people are still alive."
58189,238,34,191000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,I told ya!
58190,238,35,193000,SEAT FILLER,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Sor-ree.
58191,238,36,196000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"And that's why our final award honors a man who's lived in Springfield for a hundred and eight years: our oldest resident, Cornelius Chapman."
58192,238,37,207000,Britney Spears,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Cornelius Chapman built the first log cabin in Springfield and introduced the tooth brush to our fair city.
58193,238,38,217000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"For years he was Springfield's only basketball player, but he still managed to entertain the crowd."
58194,238,39,223000,Britney Spears,Springfield Civic Auditorium,In the market crash of 1929 he helped people jump out of windows to avoid disgrace.
58195,238,40,228000,Chapman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"You're doing the right thing... oh, oh out you go... my, you're a big one... no, no, no turning back now..."
58196,238,41,235000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Off a tall building. That's a great way to do it!
58197,238,42,238000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,And in 1935 our honoree took a bullet for Huey Long.
58198,238,43,244000,Chapman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Noooo!
58199,238,44,247000,Britney Spears,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"And now, Springfield's oldest citizen, he is, like, totally venerable: Cornelius Chapman!"
58200,238,45,259000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"Well, I guess we should have expected that."
58201,238,46,264000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"Well, this award has to go to somebody. Would everyone who is sixty or older please stand up?"
58202,238,47,272000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Over eighty?
58203,238,48,274000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Ninety?
58204,238,49,276000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,One hundred years old?
58205,238,50,281000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"Homer, sit down."
58206,238,51,282000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"What's that, sonny?"
58208,238,53,290000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Huh... This is all so sudden...
58209,238,54,292000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"Don't give me that kiss of death, you black widow!"
58210,238,55,297000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"Boy, he didn't want to let go of that."
58211,238,56,301000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"Oh, okay... let's see... I don't have a speech prepared, but uh, abra-cadaver..."
58212,238,57,308000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"""Thank you all so much. I love Springfield, from the cuddliest infant to th... ... puppies... patriotism... bluebirds..."" I'm not reading this drivel. This speech is over."
58213,238,58,329000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"Well, that was a great night for us all."
58214,238,59,332000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"That's not an award, that's part of the set."
58215,238,60,335000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,Nothing you can say will diminish this honor.
58217,238,62,344000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Now that I'm the town's oldest man, I'm starting to realize I'm not a young man anymore. I'll have to start taking better care of myself. You know, I haven't had a medicino checkup in ages."
58218,238,63,354000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, you deserve the finest doctors in the world. I'm taking you to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota."
58219,238,64,358000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Very well.
58220,238,65,358000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,But I'll need someone to watch my house. Who's that fellow who always screws up and creates havoc?
58221,238,66,365000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Homer Simpson, sir."
58222,238,67,368000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes. The way I figure it, he's due for a good performance."
58224,238,69,374000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Now if the house catches fire, I want you to call this number."
58225,238,70,378000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,Uh-huh. The Fire Department.
58226,238,71,381000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Yes. They're new, but they're good."
58227,238,72,383000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"Sir, we should get going."
58228,238,73,386000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,Don't worry about a thing. We'll take good care of your house!
58229,238,74,391000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Look at me, I'm a billionaire!"
58230,238,75,397000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,I forgot my...
58231,238,76,405000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,Good Lord! This bedroom is as big as our house!
58232,238,77,409000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,And the bed never needs to be made. Check it out.
58233,238,78,417000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,Seems a little wasteful.
58234,238,79,419000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Wasteful AND practical.
58235,238,80,421000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"A mechanical dressing dealy! Watch this, Marge."
58236,238,81,432000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Now I'm ready to hit the town.
58237,238,82,454000,Guard,Burns Manor,Close that door.
58239,238,84,457000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,"Wow, he's got every Nancy Drew! Even the controversial ""Clue in the Clock."" So many swears."
58240,238,85,469000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,I'm Al Unser Jr.!
58241,238,86,470000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,I'm Princess Margaret!
58242,238,87,472000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,I'm drunk!
58244,238,89,481000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,"It's nothing serious, just lay off the chili and you should be fine."
58245,238,90,486000,The Pope,Mayo Clinic,"Don't you laugh, Fidel. I've been in the car with you."
58246,238,91,490000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,"Let's see, social security number... naught-naught-naught, naught-naught, naught-naught-naught-two. Damn Roosevelt. Cause of parents' death... Got in my way."
58248,238,93,506000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,Mom! Bart's making faces at me. I think.
58249,238,94,512000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Look how loud I have to yell!
58250,238,95,515000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,This all seems a little elaborate for sloppy joes.
58251,238,96,519000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Hmm, I know what the other eleven forks are for, but what do you do with this one?"
58252,238,97,524000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Why, Marge, I believe you're supposed to scratch your ass with it."
58253,238,98,528000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Homer, watch your lang... Oooooh. That's a lifesaver."
58254,238,99,535000,Bart Simpson,Burns Manor,"Man, this is livin'."
58255,238,100,541000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Stop that! Cigars are for rich people and legendary comedians, like Bill Crosby and David Letterson."
58256,238,101,551000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Oops, forgot to swirl it."
58257,238,102,554000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Homer, did you jimmy open Mr. Burns' liquor cabinet?"
58258,238,103,558000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Jimmy is such an ugly word, Marge. Unless you're talking about Jimmy Smits."
58259,238,104,558000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,But housesitting is a sacred...
58260,238,105,558000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,Hey!
58261,238,106,566000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Stop swirling, Homer!"
58262,238,107,569000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Listen, I worked long and hard for this place. And no one's going to take it away from me. Not you, not its rightful owner, not anybody."
58263,238,108,579000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,And another thing: If I ev...
58264,238,109,585000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Operator, get me Thailand. T...i... and so on."
58265,238,110,593000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Homer, who are you calling?"
58266,238,111,595000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Everybody. I found Burnsie's address book. I called the New York Yankees and told them to bunt, and then I called the Queen of England and asked her how it was going, and then I..."
58267,238,112,603000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Well, don't run up Mr. Burns' phone bill."
58268,238,113,606000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Just a second, Marge. Hello! Thailand? How's everything on your end? Uh-huh. That's some language you got there. And you talk like that twenty-four seven, huh?"
58269,238,114,614000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Hey!
58270,238,115,617000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Homer, you've got to stop pretending this is your house. You're not a billionaire."
58271,238,116,623000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Geez, way to burst my bubble, Marge."
58272,238,117,626000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,All I'm saying is don't get too comfortable. Mr. Burns will be back tomorrow.
58273,238,118,630000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Marge, you're right. We do have to have a party."
58274,238,119,634000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,Party? No! No parties.
58275,238,120,637000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,What about partays?
58276,238,121,639000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"No partays, no shindigs, no keggers, no hootenannies, no mixers, no raves, no box socials..."
58277,238,122,645000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Damn!
58278,238,123,646000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,And I looked so good on that box.
58280,238,125,651000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,"Now Doctor, I want you to test me for everything. Every disease on this chart."
58281,238,126,657000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,Fine. We'll start by drawing some blood.
58282,238,127,661000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,"Well, isn't that odd. It's like poking through meringue."
58283,238,128,664000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,"Oh, try this arm. I saw some blood in there the other day."
58284,238,129,671000,Nurse,Mayo Clinic,Come on. Keep blowing.
58285,238,130,675000,Nurse,Mayo Clinic,"Okay, twelve centimeters. Excellent."
58286,238,131,679000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,I'm a big boy!
58287,238,132,690000,Workman,Mayo Clinic,There's your problem.
58291,238,136,700000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Havin' a party, Moe. I'll need four kegs of your finest imported-sounding beer."
58292,238,137,705000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,How 'bout Tuborg? The beer of Danish Kings.
58293,238,138,709000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Mmmm, Danish."
58294,238,139,712000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Now, you know I can't sell you no beer till two P.M., on accounta it's Sunday."
58295,238,140,715000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Huh? If you can't sell beer, what are Lenny and Carl doing here?"
58296,238,141,719000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Huh? Uh, we're just watching the sun move across the sky."
58297,238,142,722000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"When it gets to here, we can drink again."
58298,238,143,725000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,But I need that beer now.
58299,238,144,727000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Sorry. Two P.M. Or you can steal a boat and sail out to International Waters.
58300,238,145,733000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"What's that, a theme park?"
58301,238,146,734000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"No, the ocean. Once you get twelve miles out, there's no laws at all. That's where they held the Tyson/Secretariat fight."
58302,238,147,741000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"They were so drunk. Gentlemen, get off your knees. Your rich uncle Homer is throwing the wildest box social the high seas have ever seen!"
58303,238,148,756000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,And you're invited.
58306,238,151,760000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Oh no, you don't! I'm not going to let you trash Mr. Burns' yacht."
58307,238,152,766000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Marge, you know I normally listen to you, but I've gotta seize this opportunity. Just in case I never become a real billionaire."
58308,238,153,774000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Oh, Homie, I don't care if you're a billionaire. I love you just because you're..."
58309,238,154,779000,Lenny Leonard,Burns Manor,"Hey, there's another way to get on the boat!"
58310,238,155,782000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Woo hoo!
58311,238,156,788000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Propellers... SPINNING! Turn... LEFT! Boat go... THERE!
58313,238,158,796000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,"Don't worry, Mom. I'm sure he'll be okay."
58314,238,159,798000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,The boat's going sideways!
58315,238,160,801000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Ships ahoy!
58316,238,161,803000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Well done, Mr. Lenny. Well done."
58318,238,163,811000,Carl Carlson,Burns's Yacht,"Homer, have we hit international waters yet? Because uh, things are gettin' real ugly."
58319,238,164,817000,Moe Szyslak,Burns's Yacht,I can't sell ya beer till we cross the line!
58320,238,165,819000,Barney Gumble,Burns's Yacht,"Legally, you could give us free beer."
58321,238,166,823000,Barney Gumble,Burns's Yacht,Ow!
58322,238,167,824000,Lenny Leonard,Burns's Yacht,"Well, could you at least give us rubbing alcohol for our wounds?"
58323,238,168,828000,Lenny Leonard,Burns's Yacht,Hey. Sucker.
58324,238,169,832000,Lenny Leonard,Burns's Yacht,Ow!
58325,238,170,838000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Yacht,"We made it, son. International waters -- the land that law forgot."
58326,238,171,853000,Bart Simpson,Burns's Yacht,"Wow, you can do anything out here."
58327,238,172,856000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Yacht,That's right. See that ship over there?
58328,238,173,859000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Yacht,"They're rebroadcasting Major League Baseball with implied oral consent, not expressed written consent! Or so the legend goes."
58329,238,174,869000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Burns's Yacht,"Arrr, I now pronounce ya man and cow."
58330,238,175,874000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Burns's Yacht,Please accept these illegal fireworks with my blessing. Yarrr.
58331,238,176,884000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Yacht,There are no laws. We can do anything we want! Anything!
58332,238,177,889000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Yacht,"Ow, ow! Oh, real mature, Lenny."
58334,238,179,894000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,"Well, Doc, I think I did pretty well on my tests. You may shake my hand if you like."
58335,238,180,899000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,"Under the circumstances, I'd rather not."
58336,238,181,901000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,Eh?
58337,238,182,902000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,"Mr. Burns, I'm afraid you are the sickest man in the United States. You have everything."
58338,238,183,907000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,You mean I have pneumonia?
58339,238,184,907000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,Yes.
58340,238,185,909000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,Juvenile diabetes?
58341,238,186,909000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,Yes.
58342,238,187,910000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,Hysterical pregnancy?
58343,238,188,911000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,"A-a little bit, yes. You also have several diseases that have just been discovered. In you."
58344,238,189,916000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,I see. You're sure you just haven't made thousands of mistakes?
58345,238,190,920000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,"Uh no, no, I'm afraid not."
58346,238,191,922000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,"Well, this sounds like bad news."
58347,238,192,923000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,"Well, you'd think so, but all of your diseases are in perfect balance."
58348,238,193,927000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,"I-i-i-f you have a moment, I can explain."
58349,238,194,929000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,Well...
58352,238,195,930000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,"Here's the door to your body, see. And these are oversized novelty germs. Uh, that's influenza, that's bronchitis, and this cute little cuddle bug is pancreatic cancer. Now, here's what happens when they all try to get through the door at once."
58353,238,196,948000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,"Whoop, whoop whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop! Move it, Chowderhead."
58354,238,197,948000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,We call it Three Stooges Syndrome.
58355,238,198,948000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,So what you're saying is... I'm indestructible.
58356,238,199,954000,Doctor,Mayo Clinic,"No, no. In fact, even a slight breeze could..."
58357,238,200,957000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mayo Clinic,Indestructible...
58359,238,202,964000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,Why are we cleaning this room? I don't think we were even in here.
