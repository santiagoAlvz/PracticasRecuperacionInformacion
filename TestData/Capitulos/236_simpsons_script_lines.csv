57624,236,129,567000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Hospital Room,"Sweetie, it's nice that you want to take charge around the house, but don't be a hero. Just make sure your father eats all his meals over a tarp. But not the good tarp. I want you to get married on that some day!"
57625,236,130,580000,Lisa Simpson,Marge's Hospital Room,"Oh, Mom. I've seen what you do around the house, and I can handle it. Maybe I can even make things more efficient."

57644,236,149,647000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, I'll do the dishes when I pick it out of the chore hat, and it's not a practice. See, there it is. But that was a practice. The system works!"
57645,236,150,659000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, eat, you lazy fish."
57646,236,151,662000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh! You're gonna be late.
57647,236,152,665000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Here are your lunches. And no trading your fruit for firecrackers.

57661,236,165,695000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,"Oh, I don't want to be a bother."
57662,236,166,697000,Nurse,Hospital Room,Wouldn't bother us. It just turns up your morphine.
57663,236,167,701000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,So it does.
57664,236,168,704000,Nurse,Hospital Room,Stop pushing that.

57677,236,181,764000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,They need to soak.
57678,236,182,765000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You said that four days ago.
57679,236,183,767000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, they're rusted through."
57680,236,184,769000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's an illusion.

57686,236,190,786000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I gave you a list!"
57687,236,191,788000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah. You were way off.

57756,236,260,991000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Excellent.
57757,236,261,996000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Leprosy? I can't believe it! That fortune cookie was right.
57758,236,262,999000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why would God punish a kid? I mean, an American kid?"
57759,236,263,1003000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now guys, leprosy thrives in filthy conditions, so your only chance is to clean up the house. I'll get you a couple of mops."
57760,236,264,1010000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Mops? The cure sounds worse than the disease.
57761,236,265,1013000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,At Sunday School they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude.
57726,236,266,1016000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Jesus?
57762,236,267,1016000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, that sounds right."
57763,236,268,1018000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I think we're on the outs with Him, but I know someone who's even holier than Jesus."

57768,236,273,1033000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,/ Help us. / We're diseased.
57769,236,274,1036000,Maude Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh no, that's leprosy! Remember those scary lepers in ""Ben-Hur""?"
57770,236,275,1040000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"You saw ""Ben-Hur"" without me?"
57771,236,276,1042000,Maude Flanders,Flanders Home,We were broken up then.
57772,236,277,1043000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Well, that's no..."
57774,236,279,1046000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,Brains... Brains...
57775,236,280,1049000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,Use your brains to help us. Your delicious brains.
57776,236,281,1053000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh, those poor souls. What's the Christian thing to do?"

57781,236,286,1073000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Here you go, lad."
57782,236,287,1074000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Uh, listen, Homer, we'd love to help you, but we're not really set up for lepers."
57783,236,288,1085000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,So you're shunning us.
57784,236,289,1087000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just thinking we could send you to a better place... you know, a place where they can really take care of you."
57785,236,290,1093000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Oh, thank you good sir."
57786,236,291,1101000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Ooh, that smarts. Boys, get the alcohol-free alcohol."
57789,236,294,1106000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Marge, we'll just get this cast off, and you can go home to y-- Oh, my Lord!"
57790,236,295,1110000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,"Well, it has been a week."
57791,236,296,1113000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Code blue! A thousand CC's of leg wax, stat!"
57793,236,298,1116000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lazy, no-good lepers... Making me clean everything myself..."
57794,236,299,1122000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Hey, uh, is Homer there?"
57795,236,300,1123000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, he isn't. I don't know where he is."
57796,236,301,1126000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,I'm a little worried. He usually stops in for an eye-opener on the way to work.
57797,236,302,1129000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,He told us he'd been going to the gym.
57798,236,303,1132000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Wow. Anyway, you don't think he could be at another bar, do you? Because I couldn't take that! I... uh... I-I just couldn't! I..."
57799,236,304,1140000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Don't-hang-up-on-me!
57800,236,305,1142000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm home, everybody! Gee, the house looks great!"
57801,236,306,1147000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I lost Dad and Bart."
57802,236,307,1149000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Lost them? What do you mean?
57803,236,308,1151000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I tricked them into thinking they had leprosy.
57804,236,309,1154000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hansen's Disease. You know, like that horrible cream soda?"
57805,236,310,1158000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Dad and Bart ran away and no one seems to know where they went."
57806,236,311,1162000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, okay calm down. They couldn't have gone too far."
57807,236,312,1165000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Molokai?!
57808,236,313,1167000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean Hawaii?
57809,236,314,1168000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Mm-hm. That's the one! They've got a top-notch leper colony there, so we shipped 'em right off. Ooh, cost us a bundle, too. I guess we'll have an ""Imagination Christmas"" this year."
57810,236,315,1178000,Todd Flanders,Simpson Home,Yayyy! Imagination Christmas!
57811,236,316,1180000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,I got a pogo stick!
57812,236,317,1182000,Todd Flanders,Simpson Home,I got a Hula-Hoop!
57814,236,319,1194000,Bart Simpson,LEPER COLONY,Whoa! This is a hospital?
57815,236,320,1197000,Homer Simpson,LEPER COLONY,"That it is. We'll take the cure, bag a few lobsters, then watch some gay guys get married."
57816,236,321,1206000,Orderly,LEPER COLONY,"Ah, you must be the Simpsons."
57817,236,322,1208000,Homer Simpson,LEPER COLONY,Howdy. And thanks for not recoiling in horror.
57818,236,323,1211000,Orderly,LEPER COLONY,"Thank you for the friendly ""howdy."""
57819,236,324,1213000,Bart Simpson,LEPER COLONY,Can we get a room with a view?
57820,236,325,1214000,Orderly,LEPER COLONY,"Oh, you'll have a great view of the whole beach... from the electric needle room."
57821,236,326,1218000,Homer Simpson,LEPER COLONY,Really? The whole beach?
57822,236,327,1221000,Orderly,LEPER COLONY,"Yes, from the electric needle room."
57823,236,328,1222000,Homer Simpson,LEPER COLONY,Electric needle room?!
57827,236,332,1236000,Bart Simpson,ELECTRIC NEEDLE ROOM,Glad that's not me.
57829,236,334,1244000,Bart Simpson,Island,Time to turn over.
57830,236,335,1248000,Marge Simpson,Island,"Oh, thank God you're all right!"
57831,236,336,1251000,Lisa Simpson,Island,"Dad, Bart, I played a horrible trick on you and I'm really sorry. You don't have leprosy. It's just oatmeal."
57832,236,337,1258000,Bart Simpson,Island,"Yeah, we know."
57833,236,338,1259000,Homer Simpson,Island,I figured it out after I ate one of my chest sores.
57834,236,339,1261000,Marge Simpson,Island,"Well, then let's get out of here."
57835,236,340,1263000,Bart Simpson,Island,No way. We scored a free Hawaiian vacation.
57836,236,341,1266000,Homer Simpson,Island,"This place is a blast. All we have to do is endure two hours of blinding pain, then it's nothin' but shopping and surfing."
57837,236,342,1273000,Bart Simpson,Island,"Tonight we're gonna put our fake sores back on, then jump the fence at Club Med, and scare the normals."
57838,236,343,1277000,Marge Simpson,Island,"Well, it all sounds lovely, but..."
57839,236,344,1280000,Homer Simpson,Island,"Come on, loosen up. This is paradise."
57840,236,345,1286000,Orderly,Island,"Number one, report to the Dermabrasion Hut."
57841,236,346,1288000,Homer Simpson,Island,That's me!
