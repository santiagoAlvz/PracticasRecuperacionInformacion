103003,397,8,159000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maggie, I'm sorry you miss your pacifier. But when a mother makes a decision, she has to stick by it."

103007,397,12,187000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe you listened to this magazine. It's a Larry Flynt publication!

103024,397,29,288000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"That help is here. Meet ""Nappien."""
103025,397,30,296000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"Nappien activates your brain's napping centers, and attacks your body's awake-agens. And unlike Sleepia, it won't cause foot fattening or elbow stink."

103028,397,33,314000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's not working! You lousy, worthless piece of--"

103001,397,36,339000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe it was the same person who tied each of the dog's feet to a toy car.
103032,397,38,347000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And someone used our videotapes as dominoes!
103033,397,39,360000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I think you dominoed this."
103034,397,40,363000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's ridiculous. If I had set up those dominoes, I'd be wearing my special domino-setting up kneepads."
103036,397,42,373000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It was you.
103037,397,43,374000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How is that possible?
103038,397,44,376000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I've read that people do strange things in their sleep when they've taken Ambien -- I mean Nappien.
103039,397,45,382000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"See? ""May cause dry mouth, mood swings, and nighttime kookiness."""

103045,397,51,421000,Security Guard,Simpson Home,So you're the one behind all these hi-jinx at the Rock 'N' Roll Wax Museum.
103047,397,53,434000,Todd Flanders,Simpson Home,"Mr. Simpson, why did you hurt the dollies?"
103048,397,54,437000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well son, your Uncle Homer is, like eighty percent of America, whacked-out on prescription drugs."
103049,397,55,444000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,But users are losers.
103050,397,56,447000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're confusing drugs with druuuuugs.
103052,397,58,453000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, here's the solution -- I want you kids to lock the bedroom from the outside, so I can't get out and perpetrate my nocturnal mischief."
103053,397,59,460000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why don't you just quit taking the pills, you hophead?"
103054,397,60,463000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because I'm filled with stress!
103055,397,61,465000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I have three kids and no money! Why can't I have no kids and three money?
103056,397,62,486000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why am I sleeping when right next door is every boy's dream: a fat, suggestible zombie dad."
103057,397,63,499000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey zombie -- wanna come out and play?
103058,397,64,503000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Zombie kill.

103063,397,68,511000,Milhouse Van Houten,Street,"Whoa, your dad's a zombie? Let's make him give us haircuts."
103065,397,70,519000,Milhouse Van Houten,Street,How does it look?
103067,397,72,523000,Bart Simpson,Street,And that's only one of the cool things we're gonna do with him...
103068,397,73,526000,Homer Simpson,Street,Zombie montage:
103070,397,75,558000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Car,My stomach is groaning with walnut meat.
103071,397,76,562000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"C'mon, just one more."

103080,397,85,607000,Homer Simpson,DALMATIAN KENNEL,"What are you, a travel agent? 'Cause you're sending me on a guilt trip."
103081,397,86,611000,Fireman,DALMATIAN KENNEL,Sorry.
103082,397,87,616000,Kent Brockman,DALMATIAN KENNEL,While our brave firemen recuperate...
103083,397,88,616000,Kent Brockman,DALMATIAN KENNEL,Springfield is a town without a fire department. Which is bad news for people like this man.
103084,397,89,622000,Kent Brockman,DALMATIAN KENNEL,"Sir, how does it feel knowing that no one is coming to save you?"
103085,397,90,626000,Man,DALMATIAN KENNEL,"Not as bad as knowing that somewhere, gays are marrying each other. That's the real emergency, Kent."
103086,397,91,631000,Kent Brockman,DALMATIAN KENNEL,"Once again, crisis has brought out the best in us."
103088,397,93,634000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I feel kinda responsible. Maybe I should volunteer to be a fireman.
103090,397,95,638000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Volunteer fireman? Count me in.
103092,397,97,640000,Seymour Skinner,Groundskeeper Willie's Shack,Just call me Fireman Skinner.
103094,397,99,643000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ya know, I think I'll volunteer, too."
103095,397,100,645000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Why did you say ""too?"""
103096,397,101,646000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I assume I'm not the first one."
103098,397,103,649000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Fire Department,It is with great pride that I turn over the safety of this city to the first four people who showed up.
103062,397,104,649000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Fire Department,Mm-hm.
103099,397,105,655000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Fire Department,"Your sense of civic duty, and this pamphlet that came with the fire extinguisher, are all the training you need or shall receive."
103100,397,106,665000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Fire Department,We're here to join the volunteer fire department.
103101,397,107,667000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Fire Department,You're too late -- beat it!
103102,397,108,669000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Fire Department,Lousy civilians -- I wish I could burn 'em all.
103103,397,109,672000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Fire Department,"Easy there, Fire Chief Moe."
103105,397,111,675000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I can't wait for my first fire. Is that one?"
103106,397,112,679000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's just someone barbecuing.
103107,397,113,682000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Is that one?
103108,397,114,683000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That's a guy with red hair.
103110,397,116,685000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetheart, come to dinner."
103111,397,117,687000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't! That fire siren could sound at any moment.
103113,397,119,691000,Homer Simpson,Beach,Any moment...
103115,397,121,693000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Any moment...
103116,397,122,698000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Did I say any moment?
103117,397,123,700000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Any moment...
103118,397,124,703000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What the hell is that?
103119,397,125,705000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's the fire siren!
103120,397,126,708000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo!
103121,397,127,708000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, when you see me next I'll be a soggy, smoky hero. Mmm, soggy, smoky hero."
103122,397,128,718000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just come back alive, okay?"
103123,397,129,721000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't tell me how to do my job!
103125,397,131,726000,Luigi,Luigi's,You save-a Luigi's place! Luigi give you all-a the food you want! On the house!
103126,397,132,736000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"Hey, this is sweet, huh? Almost makes up for not gettin' paid."
103127,397,133,740000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's,We don't get what?
103129,397,135,745000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Springfield Street,"Oh, thank you. Your jaws of life are superior to my movie ""Jaws Of Life."" You guys are the real deal -- as opposed to my movie ""The Real Deal,"" which was not the real deal."
103130,397,136,756000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Street,"Well, uh, your thanks makes it all worth it."
103134,397,137,759000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Springfield Street,"No, I must thank you properly, with crew jackets from my less successful films. ""Total Explosion,"" ""Father of the Presi-bot,"" ""I Shoot Your Face,"" ""I Shoot Your Face Again,"" ""Frankenberry the Movie Two: The Frankenberry Wears Prada..."""
103136,397,139,772000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Fire Department,"Oooh, leather arms! People just give you this stuff?"
103137,397,140,777000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Fire Department,"Hey, it's the least they can do after we saved them from being melty-faced weirdoes."
103138,397,141,782000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Springfield Fire Department,"We are entitled to some sort of compensation. After all, we're volunteers."
103139,397,142,786000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Fire Department,"That's right, Pu. People owe us because we're heroes. It's even on my business card."
103140,397,143,791000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Fire Department,I printed them on the back of my old business cards. See? It's different.
103142,397,145,799000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Burns Manor,"Mr. Burns, jump into this net!"
103143,397,146,801000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,What's in it for me?!
103144,397,147,803000,Moe Szyslak,Burns Manor,Just jump!

103148,397,151,825000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"Well done, gentlemen. Too bad Smithers didn't make it."
103149,397,152,829000,Waylon Smithers,Mansion,"I'm right here, sir."
103150,397,153,830000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"Excellent. But since I thought you were dead, you won't get paid this week. Make a note of it."
103151,397,154,835000,Waylon Smithers,Mansion,Doesn't seem quite fair...
103152,397,155,838000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,But you four... you're the real heroes.
103153,397,156,841000,Seymour Skinner,Mansion,"/ It's weren't nothin', really. / Just doin' our job. /"
103154,397,157,844000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Mansion,What do you think he will give us?
103155,397,158,846000,Seymour Skinner,Mansion,"Fine art, I bet!"
103156,397,159,847000,Moe Szyslak,Mansion,"No, no, no, the complete ""Munsters"" on DVD!"
103157,397,160,849000,Homer Simpson,Mansion,I hope it's spaghetti!
103158,397,161,858000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"Thank you, and goodbye."
103160,397,163,862000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"Ta-ta, toodle-loo."
103161,397,164,863000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"Go back to your tenements, where the O'Briens live next to the Goldbergs, who rub elbows with Antonellis, and the only thing you have in common is the squalor of your chamber pot. Oh how I hate you! Bye-bye."
103131,397,165,874000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Mansion,Of all the nerve.
103132,397,166,876000,Homer Simpson,Mansion,Burns stiffed us!
103162,397,167,878000,Moe Szyslak,Mansion,I can't believe he acted completely in character.
103163,397,168,881000,Homer Simpson,Mansion,"Lousy burns so ungrateful, I hate him so much..."
103164,397,169,885000,Moe Szyslak,Mansion,"Hold on a second, fellas -- I don't like the looks of that flamin' ember."
103165,397,170,889000,Moe Szyslak,Mansion,"I'd better blow it out. Ha, ha, ha."
103167,397,172,909000,Moe Szyslak,Burns Manor,"Oh, the fire has spread to this room full of valuables. And it's our duty to follow it."
103169,397,174,919000,Moe Szyslak,JEWEL-ENCRUSTED DOODADS ROOM,"Well, the fire's out... but uh, I think some of these valuables are smoke damaged. He's not gonna want 'em."
103170,397,175,925000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,JEWEL-ENCRUSTED DOODADS ROOM,"Moe, are you suggesting that we should steal?"
103171,397,176,929000,Moe Szyslak,JEWEL-ENCRUSTED DOODADS ROOM,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. It ain't stealin' if you take it fast."
103174,397,179,940000,Mr. Costington,Costington's,"Gentlemen, I'd like to thank you. You've saved my store."
103175,397,180,943000,Homer Simpson,Costington's,Well... most of it.
103176,397,181,945000,Mr. Costington,Costington's,What do you mean?
103177,397,182,946000,Moe Szyslak,Costington's,"Uh, well, your building will be fine, but unfortunately a lot of your merchandise was completely vaporized: high-end stereo equipment, size ten men's shoes..."
103178,397,183,955000,Homer Simpson,Costington's,And some stuff I wanted.
103179,397,184,957000,Mr. Costington,Costington's,"Oh my, I didn't think the damage was that bad. But you must be telling the truth -- you're firemen, after all."
103180,397,185,963000,Homer Simpson,Costington's,"Yeah, we're awesome. This'll make a great toilet seat!"
103182,397,187,968000,Seymour Skinner,Costington's,"Uh, gentlemen... I'm uh... I'm starting to wonder if we've crossed a line here."
103183,397,188,983000,Homer Simpson,Costington's,Just what are you getting at?
103184,397,189,986000,Moe Szyslak,Costington's,"Yeah, Hall Pass -- you better not be thinkin' of rattin' us out!"
103185,397,190,989000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Costington's,It would be a shame if the next fire you fought... was in Hell!
103186,397,191,993000,Seymour Skinner,Costington's,"Okay, okay. I'll just look the other way."
103187,397,192,1002000,Seymour Skinner,Costington's,You guys sure aren't making this easy.
103189,397,194,1012000,Homer Simpson,FIRE STATION,"Oh, thank God there's a fire. Marge's birthday's comin' up."
103190,397,195,1015000,Seymour Skinner,FIRE STATION,I think what she would treasure most is a gift bought through honest effort. Because...
103191,397,196,1015000,Seymour Skinner,FIRE STATION,...integrity... trust... exploitation... the golden rule... role models... serious crime... zero tolerance... the Ten Commandments...
103193,397,198,1040000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Public Pool,"Next time Maggie does that in a pool, tell me quietly, don't announce it."
103194,397,199,1046000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Public Pool,"But Mom, the lifeguards have to know."
103195,397,200,1048000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Public Pool,Just let the chemicals deal with it.
103196,397,201,1051000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Public Pool,Look at me! I'm a fireman!
103197,397,202,1054000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Public Pool,"Hey, Mom, can we go see Dad put out the fire?"
103198,397,203,1056000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Public Pool,"Well, I guess every boy should see his father as a hero."
103200,397,205,1061000,Homer Simpson,The Sharper Mark-Up,"Hey guys, check out the radical-free air generated by my stolen Ionic Breeze."
103201,397,206,1066000,Homer Simpson,The Sharper Mark-Up,"Oh, bogus gizmo, grant me eternal life."
103202,397,207,1070000,Lisa Simpson,The Sharper Mark-Up,"Mom, is Dad stealing from people he's supposed to help?"
103203,397,208,1075000,Moe Szyslak,The Sharper Mark-Up,King of thieves. We worship you.
103204,397,209,1078000,Lisa Simpson,The Sharper Mark-Up,He is stealing!
103205,397,210,1081000,Marge Simpson,The Sharper Mark-Up,"Well, uh..."
103206,397,211,1083000,Homer Simpson,The Sharper Mark-Up,"Look at me, guys!"
103207,397,212,1084000,Homer Simpson,The Sharper Mark-Up,"I'm stealing five Segways at once! And speaking of segues, I'm off to my next morally questionable activity!"
