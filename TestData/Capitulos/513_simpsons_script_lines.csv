133173,513,6,88000,Otto Mann,Barney's Bowlarama,Is this the Bridge to Terabithia?

133184,513,16,127000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,You know when your dog's havin' a bad dream? That's who I pray to.
133186,513,18,140000,Fat Tony,Luigi's,"Boys, I'm afraid the government has finally caught up with me, and my appeals are exhausted. Tomorrow I begin serving jury duty."

133189,513,21,154000,Fat Tony,Luigi's,"I felt bad for the guy... sittin' there at his little card table... anyway, I must name a temporary replacement."
133190,513,22,165000,Fat Tony,Luigi's,"Your temporary Don is... our accountant, Dan!"

133192,513,24,174000,Fat Tony,Luigi's,"How about ""meringue?"""
133193,513,25,174000,Dan Gillick,Luigi's,"That's a great word, but I'm just a numbers guy. And the only reason I say ""numbers guy"" instead of ""Wharton M.B.A."" is 'cause I wanna blend in."
133194,513,26,183000,Fat Tony,Luigi's,"I know what I'm doing. We are bleeding red ink, which is the only thing we should not be bleeding!"

133211,513,42,265000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Here I am! Budget cuts.
133213,513,44,274000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Lisa, I suspect you fainted because you thought Justin Bieber was in the audience."
133214,513,45,274000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Well, once again, laughter is the worst medicine. Young lady, you're not getting enough iron."
133215,513,46,285000,Marge Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Please say it's the vegetarianism!
133216,513,47,287000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,It's not the vegetarianism!
133217,513,48,289000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"It's a little bit the vegetarianism. Lisa, if you must forego meat, I advise you to take these iron supplements."
133218,513,49,297000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,It's like swallowing dollhouse furniture!

133226,513,57,316000,Dan Gillick,Luigi's,"This is fun. But you know what -- there is a cost-cutting measure I'd like to propose: if you put a horse's head in someone's bed, don't let the rest of the animal go to waste. For the next guy, use the horse's leg. Or a couple of hooves. Believe me, there's no part of a dead horse that's not gonna scare someone..."
133227,513,58,337000,Dan Gillick,Luigi's,"Okay, good stopping point."
133229,513,60,340000,Dan Gillick,Luigi's,Was that real?
133231,513,62,351000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,A kid's never lonely when he has baloney! Except me.
133233,513,64,362000,Lunchlady Dora,Springfield Elementary School,"You're that Simpson kid. Bart, right?"
133234,513,65,362000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Lisa.
133235,513,66,365000,Lunchlady Dora,Springfield Elementary School,I just see mouths. Can't handle the iron pills?
133236,513,67,369000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,All day I have vitamin burps.
133237,513,68,371000,Lunchlady Dora,Springfield Elementary School,Try this -- it's what keeps me young.
133238,513,69,376000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Mmm! Tasty! Love the texture. What is it?

133240,513,71,381000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,But I'm a vegetarian!
133241,513,72,384000,Lunchlady Dora,Springfield Elementary School,So am I. Lots of committed vegetarians eat insects.
133242,513,73,387000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Really?
133243,513,74,387000,Lunchlady Dora,Springfield Elementary School,"Get real. There's bug parts in peanut butter. And every year, the average American eats eight spiders in his sleep. It's all here in this book."
133244,513,75,398000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,This is such a big step!
133245,513,76,401000,Lunchlady Dora,Springfield Elementary School,"Better decide soon, kid. The Union said I can't talk to a student this long."
133247,513,78,406000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Mm, that is good grub."
133248,513,79,409000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,But I promised Paul McCartney I wouldn't eat meat.
133249,513,80,412000,Lunchlady Dora,Springfield Elementary School,And I promised Paul McCartney I wouldn't sleep with John.
133251,513,82,421000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,So you're saying you'd rather do the prettiest dude in the world rather than the ugliest broad?
133252,513,83,424000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Absolutely. But how did we get here from discussing Aristotle's Poetics?
133253,513,84,429000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, well, if it isn't Mr. ""Work Comes Before Bowling."""
133254,513,85,433000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I am turning my back, because I can't stand to look you in the face."

133261,513,92,444000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"So, now you think you can just waltz in here and buy everybody a beer?"
133262,513,93,448000,Dan Gillick,Moe's Tavern,I didn't say that I would...
133263,513,94,449000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Too late, already poured."
133264,513,95,450000,Dan Gillick,Moe's Tavern,Sorry guys -- I got the kind of job that you just can't play hooky from.
133265,513,96,454000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I have no idea what you do or who you work with, but I am sure if you put your foot down on their throats and grind until you hear a crunch, they'll sit up straight."
133266,513,97,463000,Dan Gillick,Moe's Tavern,Really? You're sure about this?
133267,513,98,465000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, hey, listen, I've learned a lot about human nature by watching things through secret cameras."
133268,513,99,470000,Dan Gillick,Moe's Tavern,"Uh-huh. All right, then. Okay, we'll see about that bread dipping. Thank you. Thank you for giving me an attitude. Thank you for giving me an edge."
133269,513,100,486000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Or maybe it's groveling that works. Eh, six of one."
133271,513,102,492000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Elementary School,Attention Gourmands of All Things Creepy and Crawly!
133273,513,104,497000,Professor Jonathan Frink,CAFETERIA,"...please welcome long-time squisher, first-time eater, Lisa Simpson. Delighted."

133275,513,106,514000,Cletus Spuckler,CAFETERIA,Sorry.
133276,513,107,516000,Old Jewish Man,CAFETERIA,Little more... little more... perfect.
133277,513,108,521000,Luigi,CAFETERIA,"Just once, why can't they go to Applebee's?"
133279,513,110,524000,Dan Gillick,Luigi's,"Okay fellas, this time why don't I do the cutting?"
133280,513,111,530000,Legs,Luigi's,What are you doin'? I talk with that hand!
133281,513,112,532000,Dan Gillick,Luigi's,"Well, you're gonna lose it, if you keep charging your manicures to us! If you don't like it, tough tortellini! And while we're at it, no more tortellini!"
133282,513,113,541000,Dan Gillick,Luigi's,I'm dominating you! Anyone got a problem? Hanh? Kenny the Problem?
133283,513,114,546000,Kenny the Problem,Luigi's,I'm good.
133284,513,115,548000,Luigi,Luigi's,What's this I hear about no more tortellini?
133285,513,116,550000,Dan Gillick,Luigi's,Only for Christmas and funerals!
133286,513,117,552000,Luigi,Luigi's,"No, please, please! I need-a the money. She's-a pay for my, how-a you say, ""English lessons."""
133287,513,118,558000,Luigi,Luigi's,"My name Luigi. I live at a-one, a-two, a-three, Main-a Street."
133289,513,120,571000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So if I'm growing grasshoppers to eat, am I a farmer or a rancher? There are gonna be a lot of heated blogs on this topic."
133290,513,121,578000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, dinnertime!"
133291,513,122,590000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,LISA EATS BU-UGS...
133292,513,123,593000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! This is America. Anyone can eat what they want as long as they eat too much.
133293,513,124,598000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa... would you like some shrimp?
133295,513,125,609000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, shrimp aren't all that removed from grasshoppers. They're both arthropods..."
133296,513,126,623000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You did that to help me out!
133297,513,127,628000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Not sure what your motivation for that is.
133300,513,130,632000,Bailiff,Courthouse,Lunch break!
133301,513,131,637000,Fat Tony,Courthouse,"Make this quick, I finally got a chair by the window. I'm afraid the little Bulgarian lady will take it."
133302,513,132,644000,Dan Gillick,Courthouse,"Bottom line, Tone, I cut expenses twelve percent."
133303,513,133,647000,Fat Tony,Courthouse,As my more ruthless cousin on Wall Street would say: cut another twelve!
133304,513,134,652000,Dan Gillick,Courthouse,But the only other cuts left are personnel! There are redundancies.
133305,513,135,656000,Dan Gillick,Courthouse,"Like Shotgun Pete, Shotgun Mike, Ronnie the Rifle, Shotgun the Rifle..."
133306,513,136,661000,Fat Tony,Courthouse,"All good men, but some must go."
133307,513,137,664000,Dan Gillick,Courthouse,"I agree. I will announce the layoff. Welcome to the dole, boys."
133308,513,138,671000,Fat Tony,Courthouse,"You jedrool, in our business, you don't lay them off, you lay them out!"
133309,513,139,677000,Dan Gillick,Courthouse,"Right. What? Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. You mean, ""kill them?"" I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout."

133311,513,141,688000,Bulgarian Woman,Courthouse,"Nice breeze, huh?"
133312,513,142,693000,Bulgarian Woman,Courthouse,"You have breasts like woman, but cannot give suck."
133313,513,143,697000,Fat Tony,Courthouse,Quit saying that!
133315,513,145,704000,Lisa Simpson,MONUMENT VALLEY,"Get along, little buggies!"
133316,513,146,706000,Giant Grasshopper,MONUMENT VALLEY,"If I may, just one question: why are you eating us???"
133317,513,147,710000,Lisa Simpson,MONUMENT VALLEY,You don't feel any pain.
133318,513,148,711000,Giant Grasshopper,MONUMENT VALLEY,Who told you that?
133319,513,149,713000,Lisa Simpson,MONUMENT VALLEY,Um... I just assumed?
133320,513,150,715000,Ant,MONUMENT VALLEY,This is what you've been dipping in chocolate!
133321,513,151,719000,Lisa Simpson,MONUMENT VALLEY,Nooo!
133322,513,152,721000,Ant,MONUMENT VALLEY,I'm afraid sooo!
133323,513,153,723000,Lisa Simpson,MONUMENT VALLEY,Nooo!
133324,513,154,724000,Ant,MONUMENT VALLEY,Sooo!
133325,513,155,727000,Lisa Simpson,MONUMENT VALLEY,"Oh, thank God! Just a dream!"
133327,513,157,731000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I've been meat-walking!
133329,513,158,732000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart! I can't eat bugs anymore. Please, please, take my grasshoppers as far away as you can and release them into the wild."
133330,513,159,740000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, but when I grow up and I'm living on your couch, and I drink all your booze, and sell your jewelry, you gotta be cool."
133331,513,160,747000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll be cool.
133332,513,161,748000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But I will not be sharing my mini-fridge with Homer.
133333,513,162,751000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,He's there too?!
133336,513,165,756000,Bart Simpson,BASEMENT,"Eh, free is free."
133338,513,167,765000,Dan Gillick,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,He wants me to kill them!
133340,513,169,766000,Dan Gillick,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sorry, sorry. First of all, hi."
133341,513,170,767000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hi... Dan.
133342,513,171,769000,Dan Gillick,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Secondly, remember when you asked who I worked for, and I wouldn't say? I'm a mob boss! I'm running Fat Tony's gang while he's on jury duty!"
133343,513,172,778000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Doodie.
133344,513,173,780000,Dan Gillick,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Homer, that's not the shocking part."
133345,513,174,780000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh?
133346,513,175,781000,Dan Gillick,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,He wants me to kill a bunch of guys! I've got a gun! Look!
133347,513,176,785000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh my God! You want me to help you escape?
133348,513,177,787000,Dan Gillick,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No! I want you to stop me from doing it!
133349,513,178,791000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You wha?
133350,513,179,791000,Dan Gillick,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I want to do it, Homer. It's the ultimate business model!"
133351,513,180,795000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,In my business I try not be seen. I'm scary good at it.
133352,513,181,800000,Dan Gillick,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Homer!
133353,513,182,801000,Dan Gillick,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Everything's led to this. I remember the first time I fired someone face to face. I cried. I cried! Saved the tear.
133354,513,183,809000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Please stop. I just wanted my Frisbee back from your yard.
133355,513,184,812000,Dan Gillick,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"They fired me for not being tough! I had learned that in order to succeed, you must disregard the dangerous distraction of being human. And it brought me here. You scratch a businessman and you get a coldblooded killer. Well I've been scratched!"
133356,513,185,832000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,This is how I get out of doing the dishes.
133294,513,188,840000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Come on buddy, why would you want to be a murderer?"
133328,513,189,842000,Dan Gillick,Homer's Car,"I don't know. My training, this opportunity... it's like..."
133205,513,190,846000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,A perfect storm?
133358,513,191,847000,Dan Gillick,Homer's Car,I hate that expression! So overused!
133359,513,192,851000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Okay, I don't, I don't know why I said it... I was scared... I needed a response... it was a perfect storm!"
133360,513,193,855000,Dan Gillick,Homer's Car,Say something original!
133363,513,196,872000,Lou,Homer's Car,"Looks like a kidnapping in progress, Chief."
133364,513,197,874000,Chief Wiggum,Homer's Car,You always frame everything in the worst possible light.
133365,513,198,878000,Lou,Homer's Car,"Chief, can I ask: why do you want to be a policeman?"
133366,513,199,881000,Chief Wiggum,Homer's Car,Adrenaline junkie.
133368,513,201,883000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,My Dad used to tie me up when the ice cream truck went by. And now there's no amount of ice cream that'll make me feel full. So this should work!
133369,513,202,890000,Dan Gillick,Simpson Home,"Yeah! That's right! Tie 'em tighter! Mmm! Oh, that's good! Oh, that burns!"
133370,513,203,895000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Could you please not sound like you like it so much?
133371,513,204,898000,Dan Gillick,Simpson Home,"Sorry, I'm into a lot of weird stuff."
133372,513,205,901000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now stay down here and I'll be back every hour with food, and every six hours with food for you."

133450,513,281,1150000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Finally, a place where you can spread your wings and hop."
133451,513,282,1163000,Relieved Mom,Simpson Car,We're free!
133452,513,283,1165000,Crazed Dad,Simpson Car,"No, no, I'm still gonna figure this out. There was a corner here..."

133461,513,292,1190000,Fat Tony,Luigi's,"I don't know. But once your finger has felt the itch of a trigger, there is no relief till said trigger has been squeezed."
133462,513,293,1198000,Dan Gillick,Luigi's,"Sometimes late in life you find your calling. The heft of the gun, the trigger in your hand..."
133463,513,294,1204000,Girl's Mom,Luigi's,"Can you hurry this up, please?"
133464,513,295,1205000,Girl's Mom,Luigi's,My daughter's got cheerleading practice.
133465,513,296,1207000,Dan Gillick,Luigi's,"Oh, I can go fast."
