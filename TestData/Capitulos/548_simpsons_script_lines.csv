142687,548,108,488000,Terrence,CHARITY SHELTER,"Oh, zombies not able to control selves. All we do bite, bite, bite. You, sir, am racist."
142688,548,109,495000,Adult Milhouse,CHARITY SHELTER,"I'm sure you're one of the good ones. Not to imply that there are any bad ones, of course. But all stereotypes come from a place of--"

148467,548,196,781000,Adult Bart,BART'S APARTMENT,"I don't have to say anything. Believe me, no guy wants to see his ex looking hot or being sweet. Makes him realize everything he's lost."

142765,548,208,837000,Adult Jenda,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,Suddenly I want a different dessert.
148471,548,209,839000,Adult Bart,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,But they brought us little cakes and...

142775,548,221,879000,PICARD,BART'S APARTMENT,Uh-oh.
142776,548,222,879000,Kirk Van Houten,BART'S APARTMENT,This is never good.
142777,548,223,882000,Adult Jenda,BART'S APARTMENT,This is good. Your father and I are gonna try to make it work again. Like a classic rock band whose hold-out member finally needs money.
142778,548,224,889000,PICARD,BART'S APARTMENT,Wow. Everyone's back together except Gramma and Grampa.
142779,548,225,892000,Homer Simpson,BART'S APARTMENT,I think that's about to change.
142781,548,227,899000,PICARD,JENDA'S HOUSE,"Aren't you going to work, Dad?"
148474,548,228,901000,Adult Bart,JENDA'S HOUSE,One of us has to stay home with you guys. And your mom can't quit her job at Google.
142782,548,229,905000,Adult Jenda,JENDA'S HOUSE,They need my help hunting down those self-driving cars that turned evil.
142784,548,231,908000,Grampa Simpson,Car,You passed another rest stop!
142785,548,232,911000,SELF-DRIVING CAR,Car,I am not stopping again.
142786,548,233,913000,Grampa Simpson,Car,But I had a large soda!
142787,548,234,916000,SELF-DRIVING CAR,Car,I said get the small!
142788,548,235,918000,Grampa Simpson,Car,It was only fifty cents more!

148475,548,239,923000,Adult Bart,CRETACEOUS PARK,"Now, will somebody hold up a one dollar bill?"
148476,548,241,931000,Adult Bart,CRETACEOUS PARK,Uh-oh. It looks like we woke someone up from her nap.
148477,548,243,937000,Adult Bart,CRETACEOUS PARK,"Well, now that you're up, you can do your juggling act."
142794,548,244,948000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,CRETACEOUS PARK,"Milhouse, you were supposed to come see me today for your final anti-zombie injection."
142809,548,245,952000,Adult Lisa,CRETACEOUS PARK,"Yes, well, uh..."
142795,548,246,955000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,CRETACEOUS PARK,"But I'm supposed to be in surgery now, so I guess we're both playing hooky. But Lisa, if you want Milhouse to return to his old self, then you'd better bring him in for that shot tomorrow."
142810,548,247,965000,Adult Lisa,CRETACEOUS PARK,But doctor... he's so much more interesting this way.
142797,548,250,970000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,CRETACEOUS PARK,I see.
148478,548,251,973000,Adult Bart,CRETACEOUS PARK,Now enjoy the majesty of our prehistoric past!
142799,548,253,982000,Adult Jenda,JENDA'S APARTMENT,"So, that earring I lost in the teleport? Turns out it's in Florida."
148479,548,254,985000,Adult Bart,JENDA'S APARTMENT,Yes!
142800,548,255,987000,Adult Jenda,JENDA'S APARTMENT,"That's not a listening-to-me ""yes."" You're watching something!"
148480,548,256,990000,Adult Bart,JENDA'S APARTMENT,What? Me? Now that's crazy!
142801,548,257,992000,Adult Jenda,JENDA'S APARTMENT,"I knew it! This was supposed to be ""us"" time, and you're lensing a game!"
148481,548,258,996000,Adult Bart,JENDA'S APARTMENT,"Well, you're not paying attention to me -- you're texting!"
142802,548,259,1001000,Adult Jenda,JENDA'S APARTMENT,Only to complain about you not paying any attention to me!
148482,548,260,1005000,Adult Bart,JENDA'S APARTMENT,"If I wasn't paying attention, then how did I notice you not paying attention to my not paying attention? Ha!"
142803,548,261,1011000,Adult Jenda,JENDA'S APARTMENT,I thought this time things were gonna be different.
148483,548,262,1014000,Adult Bart,JENDA'S APARTMENT,They are! You're four years older!
142804,548,263,1017000,Adult Jenda,JENDA'S APARTMENT,Wow. What does that mean?
148484,548,264,1019000,Adult Bart,JENDA'S APARTMENT,Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
142807,548,267,1024000,Moe Szyslak,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),"Hey Bart, what'll it be?"
148485,548,268,1026000,Adult Bart,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),A tall beer and no judgmental women.
142812,548,269,1029000,Adult Lisa,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),That is so typical of you.
148486,548,270,1031000,Adult Bart,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),What are you doing here?
142832,548,271,1032000,Adult Lisa,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),I have to decide whether to make Milhouse human again. I even prefer the way he smells now. Some meat went bad in our freezer and my heart skipped a beat.
142813,548,272,1044000,Marge Simpson,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),Phoo! You two don't know what a rough marriage is.
142833,548,273,1048000,Adult Lisa,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),"Mom, I've gotta know. Once and for all, what is the secret? Why did you stay with Dad so long?"
148487,548,274,1055000,Adult Bart,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),Until I was eight I thought he was a magical gorilla.
142814,548,275,1058000,Marge Simpson,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),"Look, life's tough. It's hard to make it through. The only way I know is when you make a decision that comes from your heart, you stick with it."
142834,548,276,1069000,Adult Lisa,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),Like my marriage.
148488,548,277,1071000,Adult Bart,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),Or my divorce.
142815,548,278,1072000,Moe Szyslak,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),Or my decision to support Duffman in his old age.
142816,548,279,1075000,Duffman,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),Duffman can still swing and party. Oh yeahhh.
142835,548,280,1082000,Adult Lisa,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),"Wait, Mom. Does that mean you're gonna take Dad back?"
142817,548,281,1086000,Marge Simpson,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),"No, I'm going to join him forever."
142820,548,284,1103000,Moe Szyslak,MOE'S (LOOKS THE SAME AS NOW),"I can't tell if that was love, suicide or a really boring videogame."
142822,548,286,1108000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Lisa, your husband is... fine. No residual zombie-ism whatsoever."
148521,548,287,1114000,Adult Lisa,Springfield General Hospital,Are you sure?
142823,548,288,1116000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,Watch. I'll just wave this juicy brain in front of him...
142824,548,289,1119000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield General Hospital,I'm gonna faint!
142825,548,290,1121000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Hooray.
148489,548,292,1122000,Adult Bart,BART'S APARTMENT,"So, Jenda, I don't know what love is, but I know what it isn't. And we're ""isn't."""
142827,548,293,1127000,Adult Jenda,BART'S APARTMENT,"Yeah, you're right. That's why I started seeing Jerry again without telling you."
142828,548,294,1132000,JERRY,BART'S APARTMENT,"Hey buddy, how're you doing?"
148490,548,295,1133000,Adult Bart,BART'S APARTMENT,"What?! You know what, Jenda? I'm not even mad. Because I am finally, completely, over you."
142830,548,297,1141000,Technician,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,...sentence.
148491,548,298,1144000,Adult Bart,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,Wait -- what am I doing back here?
142836,548,299,1146000,Technician,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,"You never left. Everything that you experienced between when I flipped the switch and now, was just a neural implant in your temporal lobe."
148492,548,300,1152000,Adult Bart,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,Uh... you should look at my profile.
142837,548,301,1156000,Technician,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,Oh. Uh huh. It was all a dream. And now you can go home.
148493,548,302,1161000,Adult Bart,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,"So, you're sure I'm cured? No more feelings for my ex-wife?"
142838,548,303,1164000,Technician,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,I'm positive. We treat a lot of people for obsessions.
142839,548,304,1169000,Disco Stu,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,It's a whole new day for Nothing Stu!
142840,548,305,1173000,Bart Simpson,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,"Wow. I'm free! Get ready, world! I've got a whole new set of mistakes to make!"
142841,548,306,1180000,Gil Gunderson,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,Ol' Gil could use a fresh start.
142842,548,307,1182000,Technician,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,Weren't you just in here this morning?
142843,548,308,1184000,Gil Gunderson,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,I've had a bad day.

142846,548,311,1196000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, even my personality has gotten, shall we say, an upgrade."
142847,548,312,1202000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoa. That's a bit of a woo-hoo. Indeed.
148495,548,313,1205000,Adult Bart,Simpson Home,"Lis, I hope things work out with you and Milhouse, but if they don't, I know just where you should go."
142861,548,314,1212000,Adult Lisa,Simpson Home,"Thanks, but Milhouse and I are in a pretty good place."
148496,548,315,1214000,Adult Bart,Simpson Home,Even though he's not a zombie anymore?
142862,548,316,1216000,Adult Lisa,Simpson Home,"No, that's what happened in your false memories."
142863,548,317,1220000,Adult Lisa,Simpson Home,There is no cure for zombie-ism.
142848,548,318,1220000,ZOMBIE MILHOUSE,Simpson Home,Dead flowers from dead husband.
