34893,158,14,99000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Simpson Home,This isn't about publicity. This is about cleaning off gunk.
34894,158,15,103000,Starlet,Simpson Home,"As a Golden Globe nominee, I just think it's our duty to make the real globe a little more golden."

34921,158,43,227000,Official,OIL SPILL BEACH,"Oh, I'm sorry, but all the animals have already been reserved for celebrities."
34922,158,44,233000,Rainier Wolfcastle,OIL SPILL BEACH,There. That's 104 pounds of sandpipers.
34923,158,45,238000,Lisa Simpson,OIL SPILL BEACH,You mean there's nothing left to clean?

34930,158,52,268000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I think I need some fresh air. Can I go to the park?"
34931,158,53,272000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Do I have to sit up?
34932,158,54,273000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
34933,158,55,274000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Knock yourself out.
34935,158,57,285000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Park,"Milhouse, this is boring. Make it crash or something!"
34936,158,58,288000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Park,Perfectly level flying is the supreme challenge of the scale-model pilot.

34946,158,68,328000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPOOKY VICTORIAN HOUSE,Thanks a lot! Now it's stuck on that haunted house!
34947,158,69,332000,Nelson Muntz,SPOOKY VICTORIAN HOUSE,I heard a witch lives there.
34948,158,70,333000,Ralph Wiggum,SPOOKY VICTORIAN HOUSE,I heard a Frankenstein lives there.
34949,158,71,335000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPOOKY VICTORIAN HOUSE,You guys are way off. It's a secret lab where they take the brains out of zombies and put them in the heads of other zombies to create a race of Super-Zombies!
34950,158,72,344000,Nelson Muntz,SPOOKY VICTORIAN HOUSE,That's the house?!

34964,158,86,425000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I have misplaced my pants.
34965,158,87,427000,Woman,Simpson Home,"I'm not going to press charges, but I assume you'll want to punish him."
34966,158,88,431000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"'Preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. And I gotta live with him."
34967,158,89,437000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're the man, Homer."
34968,158,90,438000,Woman,Simpson Home,"Well, if you won't discipline him, I'll come back and speak with his mother."
34969,158,91,443000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No! Wait! Wait! Madam, I run a house of discipline. The boy will be disciplined, and disciplined severely. Good day."
34970,158,92,451000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I don't know how to punish you! What does Marge usually do?"
34971,158,93,454000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,She makes me taste beer.
34972,158,94,456000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, boy. Give your old man a little credit."
34973,158,95,461000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, well, I still get to punish you."
34975,158,97,466000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Now, you're gonna do chores for that lady until you work off the damage you did. It's called responsibility."
34977,158,99,483000,Woman,Simpson Car,"Come on in, Bart."
34978,158,100,486000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Oh, I can't believe I gotta spend all my free time dustin' doilies in a smelly, run-down dump for a creepy old witch..."
34979,158,101,501000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Lady, I gotta tell ya -- I have been grossly misinformed about witches."
34981,158,103,511000,Bart Simpson,WOMAN'S HOUSE,"Wow, man! What is this place?"
34982,158,104,513000,Woman,WOMAN'S HOUSE,"I prefer not to be called ""man."" My name is Belle, and this is the Maison Derriere. That means the, uh, ""back house."""
34983,158,105,520000,Bart Simpson,WOMAN'S HOUSE,Are you having a party or something?
34984,158,106,524000,Woman,WOMAN'S HOUSE,"Non-stop. We're a burlesque house, a private club where gentlemen can play some cards and see a show..."
34985,158,107,531000,Dancer #1,WOMAN'S HOUSE,"Miss Belle, we're about to do our Around the World number, but Monte Carlo can't find her dice."
34986,158,108,537000,Belle,WOMAN'S HOUSE,"Here you go, darlin'."
34987,158,109,538000,Belle,WOMAN'S HOUSE,"Normally, we don't allow children in here, but your father was so insistent..."
34988,158,110,543000,Bart Simpson,WOMAN'S HOUSE,He's tough but fair. I'll start sorting these bras.
34989,158,111,546000,Belle,WOMAN'S HOUSE,That's a bit advanced for you. But I know a stopped-up sink that needs some attention.
34990,158,112,551000,Bart Simpson,WOMAN'S HOUSE,Just glad to be on the team!
34992,158,114,554000,Belle,Burlesque House,"When you work the door, the main things are to greet the visitors and toss out the troublemakers."
34993,158,115,559000,Bart Simpson,Burlesque House,"Oh, the ol' greet 'n' toss. No problemo."
34994,158,116,562000,Belle,Burlesque House,How did I ever get along without you?
34995,158,117,575000,Grampa Simpson,Burlesque House,Is your name Bart?
34996,158,118,578000,Grampa Simpson,Burlesque House,What the ?! Does your father know you're working here?
34997,158,119,582000,Bart Simpson,Burlesque House,It was his idea.
34998,158,120,583000,Grampa Simpson,Burlesque House,"In that case, I'll have a whiskey sour."
35000,158,122,588000,Lisa Simpson,OIL SPILL BEACH,"Oh, there's something unsatisfying about scrubbing these rocks. And I think I know what it is..."
35001,158,123,594000,Marge Simpson,OIL SPILL BEACH,"Oh, Lisa, I know it's frustrating. But we made a commitment and we have to see it through, no matter how unpleasant."
35002,158,124,602000,Official,OIL SPILL BEACH,"Quitting time! Okay. Scrub up and head for the communal tarp. We're having kelp-burgers and we're going to watch a tape of Johnny Arvik, he's the Eskimo comedian!"
35004,158,126,615000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Faster, Mom, faster!"
35006,158,128,620000,Belle,Burlesque House,"Oh, that was our emcee, Mel Zetz. He got out of bed too fast and broke his hip."
35007,158,129,625000,Bart Simpson,Burlesque House,So who's gonna warm up the crowd tonight?
35008,158,130,628000,Belle,Burlesque House,"Well, whoever fits Mel's tuxedo."
35009,158,131,630000,Bart Simpson,Burlesque House,Eep.
35011,158,132,631000,Belle,Burlesque House,"The jokes are in the breast pocket. If you get in trouble, there's a switch that makes the bow-tie spin."
35012,158,133,638000,Bart Simpson,Burlesque House,"Heh. Nudist colonies are everywhere these days. I'd love to go, but I... I can't get the wrinkles out of my birthday suit!"
35014,158,135,643000,Bart Simpson,Burlesque House,"But I gotta tell ya, Adam and Eve must have been the first bookkeepers. They invented the loose leaf system."
35016,158,137,653000,Bart Simpson,Burlesque House,"If there's a bad bookkeeping joke, I haven't heard it."
35018,158,139,662000,TV Announcer,Simpson Home,It's eleven o'clock. Do you know where your children are?
35019,158,140,665000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I told you last night, no! Where is Bart, anyway? His dinner's getting all cold and eaten."
35021,158,142,678000,Homer Simpson,Burlesque House,"Bart, where are you?! Come on! I have to be up at six a.m. to swipe Flanders' newspaper!"
35022,158,143,684000,Homer Simpson,Burlesque House,"What the... ""President Eisenhower celebrates 40th wedding anniversary... Not pictured: Mrs. Eisenhower."""
35023,158,144,690000,Belle,Burlesque House,I'm sorry. This is all my fault. Bart was filling in for --
35024,158,145,697000,Homer Simpson,Burlesque House,I don't care if he was filling in for Mel Zetz! He's my son and I don't want him --
35025,158,146,700000,Homer Simpson,Burlesque House,working... so... late... that...
35026,158,147,705000,Belle,Burlesque House,"Oh, I agree. Kids need rules and boundaries."
35027,158,148,708000,Homer Simpson,Burlesque House,"Yes, everyone loves rules..."
35028,158,149,711000,Belle,Burlesque House,"It's so tough to be a parent these days, what with all the gangs and the drugs..."
35029,158,150,715000,Homer Simpson,Burlesque House,"Oh, yeah, drugs. Ya gotta have drugs."
35030,158,151,718000,Bart Simpson,Burlesque House,"Hey, he didn't pay the cover!"
35031,158,152,720000,Belle,Burlesque House,"Oh, Bart, he's your father. We'll comp him tonight. Start a tab tomorrow."
35032,158,153,728000,Seymour Skinner,Burlesque House,"Oh, I hope I didn't miss the floor show..."
35033,158,154,730000,Bart Simpson,Burlesque House,Nope.
35034,158,155,730000,Seymour Skinner,Burlesque House,Is Roxanne back?
35035,158,156,731000,Bart Simpson,Burlesque House,Yup.
35036,158,157,732000,Seymour Skinner,Burlesque House,"Did she, uh, get my flowers?"
35037,158,158,734000,Bart Simpson,Burlesque House,She did.
35038,158,159,736000,Seymour Skinner,Burlesque House,"I... Hello, Bart."
35039,158,160,737000,Bart Simpson,Burlesque House,"Hello, Principal Skinner."
35040,158,161,739000,Seymour Skinner,Burlesque House,"This is the National Air and Space Museum, isn't it?"
35041,158,163,746000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, this isn't gonna be about Jesus, is it?"
35042,158,164,749000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"All things are about Jesus, Homer... except this. Your son has been working in a burlesque house."
35043,158,165,756000,Helen Lovejoy,Simpson Home,Principal Skinner saw him with his own eyes.
35044,158,166,759000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,"That's true, but I was only in there to get directions on how to get away from there."
35045,158,167,762000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Helen, as a responsible parent, I was already well aware of that."
35046,158,168,766000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Homer, I'm as permissive as the next parent. I mean, just yesterday, I let Todd buy some Red Hots with a cartoon devil on the box. But you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!"
35047,158,169,779000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, no?! Well, if Homer Simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house, then Homer Simpson's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house! That's..."
35048,158,170,791000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hi! Now, Marge, you're going to hear a lot of crazy talk about Bart working in a burlesque house..."
35049,158,171,801000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Maison Derriere""?! I can't believe there's a place like that in our wholesome little town. Homer, did you know it was a burlesque house when you sent Bart to work there?"
35050,158,172,812000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No! I only learned that four days ago.
35051,158,173,814000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"What were you thinking, sending Bart to such an awful place?"
35052,158,174,818000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I was trying to punish him exactly like you would. So, in a way, you really dropped the ball on this one. This is your mess and I'll be damned if I'm gonna clean it up!"
35054,158,176,832000,Belle,Burlesque House,"Please come in, Mrs. Simpson. How can I be of service?"
35055,158,177,837000,Marge Simpson,Burlesque House,I have a favor to ask: please shut this place down and move away from Springfield.
35056,158,178,842000,Belle,Burlesque House,"Oh, honey, you can't be serious..."
35057,158,179,844000,Marge Simpson,Burlesque House,Springfield doesn't want places like this!
35058,158,180,846000,Belle,Burlesque House,"I think I know what Springfield wants, sugar."
35059,158,181,849000,Marge Simpson,Burlesque House,Oh? I've lived in this town for 37 years.
35060,158,182,853000,Belle,Burlesque House,I've lived here 52 years.
35061,158,183,855000,Marge Simpson,Burlesque House,I'm third generation.
35062,158,184,856000,Belle,Burlesque House,Sixth.
35063,158,185,857000,Marge Simpson,Burlesque House,Get out of my town!
35065,158,186,859000,Belle,Burlesque House,"Listen, darlin', we're just as much a part of Springfield as the church, the library, or the crazy house. So I think I'll stay right here... neighbor."
35066,158,187,869000,Marge Simpson,Burlesque House,"Is that so? Well, sleazy entertainment and raunchy jokes will never be as popular as sobriety and self-denial!"
35067,158,188,878000,Marge Simpson,Burlesque House,You're about to learn the two most dangerous words in the English language are Marge Simpson!
35068,158,189,878000,Marge Simpson,Burlesque House,It's the light pink '87 wagon.
35070,158,191,890000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"...and after visiting the area for the past two months, I have determined it is not feasible to construct a Supertrain between Springfield and Aruba."
35071,158,192,900000,Townspeople,Springfield Town Hall,Awww...
35072,158,193,900000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Next on the agenda is, uh... the Citizens' Committee On Moral Hygiene."
35073,158,194,909000,Townspeople,Springfield Town Hall,Awww...
35074,158,195,909000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"I'm here to share my moral outrage, but this time it's not about that giant, inflatable Dos Equis bottle. It's about a certain house in our town..."
35075,158,196,919000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"Yeah, well, what's wrong with this house? Is it the plumbing?"
35076,158,197,921000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,No. It's a House of Ill Fame... a House of Loose Ethics...
35077,158,198,927000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Town Hall,Is there a building code violation? A drainage issue? A surveying error?
35078,158,199,931000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,The house is perfectly fine!
35079,158,200,933000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Hall,"Well, then quit badmouthing the house!"
35080,158,201,935000,Otto Mann,Springfield Town Hall,"Yeah, leave the house alone!"
35081,158,202,937000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Oh, geez -- It's what's inside the house that's disgraceful -- drinking, gambling, and debauchery! It's right under our noses -- a secret house of burlesque!"
35083,158,204,952000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"People, this is an issue that we, as a town, are strong enough to ignore. Let us give no more scrutiny to this bawdy house and its small clientele of loyal perverts."
35084,158,205,962000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Town Hall,"Oh, I'm afraid this problem goes far beyond Eugene and Rusty."
35086,158,207,969000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Town Hall,"Marge, if you please..."
