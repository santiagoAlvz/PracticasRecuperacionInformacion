10072,66,192,864000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder."
10073,66,193,867000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese Beaver.
10074,66,194,870000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh really? I came to see you three times today. Twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around.
10075,66,195,877000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I'm lazy. I'm gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... Eh, goodnight."
