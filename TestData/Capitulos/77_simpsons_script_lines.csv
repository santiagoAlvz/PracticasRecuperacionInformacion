13215,77,85,440000,Marge Simpson,Street,I have no idea. Unless it was that time he kept falling down the cliff.
13217,77,87,445000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Gorge,"I won't jump anymore, I promise."
13218,77,88,447000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,"Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God."

13230,77,100,543000,Specialist,Animal Hospital,That's right. And for an extra twenty dollars I'll give Homer a tick bath and then spay him.
13231,77,101,547000,Bart Simpson,Animal Hospital,"Here ya go, Doc."
13232,77,102,548000,Marge Simpson,Animal Hospital,Bart!

13235,77,105,551000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,You guys must have been pretty worried about me.
13236,77,106,554000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,"Hey, we know you're tough, Dad. Remember that time you got lost in the forest?"
13238,77,108,562000,Homer Simpson,SOMEWHERE IN WOODS,"This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy."

13242,77,112,581000,Homer Simpson,Forest,"Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him."
13243,77,113,591000,Bart Simpson,Forest,"Right, Dad."
13244,77,114,594000,Homer Simpson,Forest,Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!

13248,77,118,628000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,And there's one Itchy and Scratchy cartoon I don't think we'll ever forget.
13249,77,119,666000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Why'd you bring that up?
13250,77,120,668000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,It was an amusing episode... of our lives.

13257,77,127,703000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Oh, Marge, what if I wind up as some vegetable, watching TV on the couch? My important work will never be completed."
13258,77,128,712000,Marge Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Society's loss, I suppose. But our marriage has been through hard times and we always pull through."

13268,77,137,783000,Intern,Springfield General Hospital,"You can do it, Homer. Stand up."
13269,77,138,785000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,I can't.
13270,77,139,786000,Intern,Springfield General Hospital,He just won't budge. I've tried everything. Nothing can reach him.

13284,77,153,906000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Is a coma painful?
13285,77,154,908000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Oh, heck, no! You relive long lost-summers, kiss girls from high school -- it's like one of those TV shows where they show a buncha clips from old episodes."
13286,77,155,918000,Bart Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Yeah, well, anyway, I wonder what he's thinking now."
13288,77,157,966000,C. Montgomery Burns,Homer's Car,This man is costing my health plan five thousand dollars a day. I demand that he die with dignity.

13296,77,164,989000,C. Montgomery Burns,Homer's Car,Yoink.
13297,77,165,990000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,"Mr. Burns, how can you be so cold- hearted?"
13298,77,166,994000,C. Montgomery Burns,Homer's Car,"You have no idea, woman, what that man's put me through."

13301,77,169,1002000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Please, do go on..."

13306,77,174,1018000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Burns's Office,"I have an unorthodox solution: a ""fantastic voyage"", if you will. Three scientists... One a beautiful woman... will be shrunk to microscopic size. They will then rendezvous in Mr. Simpson's lower colon --"
13307,77,175,1034000,Lisa Simpson,Burns's Office,Eww.
13308,77,176,1035000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Burns's Office,"Well, we have had a little trouble finding volunteers..."
13310,77,178,1040000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"I wish I'd gotten to know you better, Dad. But there were times when we really connected."
13312,77,180,1049000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Hi, Dad. Want me to cut out this infernal racket?"
13313,77,181,1052000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,No. Let me hear you play.
13314,77,182,1053000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Why?
13315,77,183,1054000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?"
13316,77,184,1071000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Yeah, that's more like it! ""OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE..."

13324,77,192,1148000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What the...
13327,77,195,1174000,Bart Simpson,Street,I know that I got you mad once in a while...
13294,77,196,1193000,Bart Simpson,Street,And sometimes I got into trouble...
13329,77,198,1201000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, you can't go on like this."
13330,77,199,1203000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I know.
13331,77,200,1205000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,...but you always looked out for me.
13332,77,201,1209000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?"
13333,77,202,1216000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,They're fine.
13334,77,203,1218000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"And no matter what happens, I'll never forget the advice you gave me."
13336,77,205,1223000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave."
13338,77,207,1225000,Homer Simpson,Bathroom,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave."
13339,77,208,1247000,Homer Simpson,Bathroom,Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.
13340,77,209,1257000,Bart Simpson,Bathroom,"Dad, it's all my fault! I shook up that can of beer!"
13341,77,210,1262000,Bart Simpson,Bathroom,It was just an April Fool's joke.
13342,77,211,1278000,Homer Simpson,Bathroom,"Why, you little --"
13343,77,212,1280000,Marge Simpson,Bathroom,Homie! You're all right!
13344,77,213,1282000,Lisa Simpson,Bathroom,We're a family again!
13346,77,215,1290000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,This calls for a celebration. We're all going to Hawaii!
13348,77,217,1296000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,Gotcha! It's April Fool's for two more minutes!
13349,77,218,1300000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,"Dad, it's May 16th."
13350,77,219,1302000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,You were in that coma for seven weeks.
13351,77,220,1306000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,Uh-huh.
13353,77,222,1314000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,You lost five percent of your brain.
13354,77,223,1317000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,Me lose brain? Uh-oh.
13355,77,224,1326000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,Why'd I laugh?
