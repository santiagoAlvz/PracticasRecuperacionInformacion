69528,275,8,130000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"From the looks of it, a male dog."

69538,275,17,174000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just a second, son. I've gotta put on my contacts."
69539,275,18,185000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I didn't know your dad was so interested in science.
69540,275,19,188000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Science!?
69541,275,20,189000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, he didn't say science... he said ""pie pants."""
69542,275,21,189000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mmmm, pie pants."
69543,275,22,201000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is Launch Master Homer, counting down. Five, four, three..."

69548,275,27,229000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, that shows you what could potentially happen."
69549,275,28,235000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What was that?
69550,275,29,236000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Greetings from Nedily Space Center on Cape Flandaveral. We noticed your sky-ro-technics and thought we'd join in. Ooh, looks like a perfect landing!"

69552,275,31,253000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I have eyes, don't I?"
69553,275,32,260000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I would really like to thank you nerds for helping me out.
69554,275,33,263000,Benjamin,Simpson Home,"Well, then, could you stop calling us nerds?"
69555,275,34,266000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dweeb, wonk, spaz... it's all good."
69556,275,35,269000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Who wants some Astro-lemonade?
69557,275,36,271000,Gary,Simpson Home,What precisely makes it Astro?

69567,275,47,325000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of God."

69571,275,51,365000,Wino,Springfield,"Wow, that's it. I'm off the hooch."

69575,275,55,380000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay Nibbles, you can guide her down. Step one: Right in front of you is a blue handle. Pull for a controlled burn of two point four seconds..."
69579,275,59,400000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Now it's headed for the church.
69580,275,60,402000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, I planned for this."
69583,275,63,419000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This is the worst thing you've ever done.
69584,275,64,423000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You say that so much it's lost all meaning.
69586,275,66,432000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,I have convened the Church Council to see what we should do now.
69587,275,67,436000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Fixing all that damage is gonna be very expensive.
69588,275,68,446000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Yes, barring some sort of miracle..."
69589,275,69,451000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"All right, we'll help ourselves, yet again. People, we need some fund-raising ideas."
69590,275,70,457000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Let's just write to David Bowie again.
69591,275,71,459000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, he's done enough for this church. Anyone else?"
69593,275,73,465000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,I've got the answer. Just let me run this church like a business.
69594,275,74,470000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"It's kind of you to offer, Mr. Burns, but buzz around town is that you're, well, evil."
69596,275,75,474000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, that's just a skip-rope rhyme. Believe me, the Lord's gonna go for this in a big way. Now, who's with me?"
69597,275,76,482000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, I guess we have no choice."
69598,275,77,485000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,Excellent.
69599,275,78,488000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, you'll get yours."
69601,275,80,491000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,This is Lindsay Naegle. And don't let the skirt fool you -- she'll have this place making money in no time.
69602,275,81,498000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Isn't that skirt a little north of the knee.
69603,275,82,500000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,You're telling me!
69604,275,83,502000,Lindsay Naegle,First Church of Springfield,"I guarantee I can find some new revenue streams. Step one: let's sell some ad space. Reverend, how would you feel about wearing this robe?"
69605,275,84,511000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Hmmm. Conflicted.
69606,275,85,513000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,Too bad. You've already signed the deal!
69607,275,86,517000,Lindsay Naegle,First Church of Springfield,"Actually, he hasn't."
69608,275,87,518000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,"Oh. Well, we highly value your input. Until you sign the deal!"
69609,275,88,524000,Lindsay Naegle,First Church of Springfield,"Let me handle this, Monty."
69610,275,89,526000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,Good idea. I'll be hiding behind that tree.
69612,275,91,537000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,What are they doing to the church?
69613,275,92,539000,Lindsay Naegle,First Church of Springfield,We're re-branding it. The old church was skewing pious. We prefer a faith-based emporium teeming with impulse-buy items.
69614,275,93,547000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I feel like I want to throw up.
69615,275,94,548000,Lindsay Naegle,First Church of Springfield,Then my work is done.
69617,275,96,552000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Why does Jesus have a lasso?
69618,275,97,554000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,'Cause he's all man.
69619,275,98,566000,Money Changer,First Church of Springfield,"Money changed! Get your money changed, right here in the temple!"
69620,275,99,571000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,That could not be more blasphemous.
69621,275,100,574000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Where's Bart?
69622,275,101,583000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Do a nice one for Grandma.
69623,275,102,585000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Fine.
69624,275,103,589000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,These new pews are so comfy.
69625,275,104,592000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I am not gonna be taken in by all of this.
69507,275,105,596000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Lisa, don't sulk. You're on the Jumbotron."
69532,275,106,603000,Crowd,First Church of Springfield,/ Adorable.
69627,275,107,605000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"And Lord, please remember our infirm parishioners, especially Mrs. Glick, who's recovering from hip surgery. And now let us rise and, um, um..."
69629,275,109,619000,Lindsay Naegle,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,He's not gonna say it.
69630,275,110,620000,C. Montgomery Burns,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,"Trust me, he'll say it, or I'll bust him down to Thursday night vespers."
69631,275,111,624000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,"...and thank Crazy Larry, whose Big-Screen TV prices are insane-ane-ane! And now to deliver a special sermon on the sanctity of deliciousness... the Noid!"
69632,275,112,642000,Lisa Simpson,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,That's it!
69633,275,113,644000,Homer Simpson,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,"Quiet, Lisa. Everyone in the store is looking at you!"
69634,275,114,649000,Lisa Simpson,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,"They should take a good look at themselves, and what their church has become!"
69636,275,116,654000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,"Lisa, it's still the same basic message. We've just dressed it up a little."
69637,275,117,658000,Lisa Simpson,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,Like the whore of Babylon?
69638,275,118,660000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,That is a false analogy.
69639,275,119,662000,Lisa Simpson,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,"No it's not, it's apt! Apt!"
69641,275,121,666000,Lisa Simpson,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,Don't you see what Mr. Burns has done to this church?
69642,275,122,669000,Sideshow Mel,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,He restored it from nave to narthex.
69643,275,123,672000,Comic Book Guy,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,He super-sized the pews for the zaftig believers.
69644,275,124,675000,Patty Bouvier,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,He put ice in the urinals.
69645,275,125,677000,Lisa Simpson,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,"Those are all wonderful things. But they've cost the church its soul. And I, for one, will not be a part of it!"
69646,275,126,687000,Usher,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,Do you want your hand stamped so you can come back in?
69647,275,127,690000,Lisa Simpson,TV-STYLE CONTROL ROOM,No! I'm leaving this church forever!
69649,275,129,696000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Oh no...
69650,275,130,698000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I don't know how to feel.
69651,275,131,700000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,You should be very upset.
69652,275,132,702000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Got it.
69653,275,133,705000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,How was that?
69654,275,134,706000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,A little much.
69659,275,138,715000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Lord, I'm not turning my back on You. I just need to find a temple that's free of corruption."
69660,275,139,721000,Ghostly Voice,Lisa's Bedroom,Why do you have to be so different? Always making a big deal out of everything.
69661,275,140,733000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Mom, I know it's you."
69662,275,141,735000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,I can't believe you're eavesdropping on my prayers!
69663,275,142,738000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Oh honey, I'm worried about your soul. I want at least one person from this family to go to Heaven."
69664,275,143,746000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"I still believe in God. I just think there's another path to Him, or Her."
69665,275,144,751000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Her?! She's just kidding, Mr. Lord."
69668,275,147,759000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Still lookin' for a new faith?
69669,275,148,760000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Yep.
69670,275,149,762000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Hey, how 'bout one of those religions where you eat a human heart?"
69671,275,150,765000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,No.
69672,275,151,766000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,How 'bout Methodist?
69673,275,152,767000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"No! Look, I'm not just gonna pick a religion that seems cool. I'm gonna pick one that's right for me."
69674,275,153,774000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"How 'bout Judaism? When you turn thirteen, cha-ching."
69675,275,154,777000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,I'm going out for a walk.
69678,275,157,801000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Buddhist Temple,Lenny and Carl?
69679,275,158,802000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Buddhist Temple,You guys are Buddhists?
69680,275,159,803000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Buddhist Temple,"Oh yeah, if I didn't have inner peace, I'd completely go psycho on all you guys all the time."
69681,275,160,808000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Buddhist Temple,"Well, I'm looking for a new faith. One that isn't so materialistic."
69682,275,161,812000,Richard Gere,Springfield Buddhist Temple,"Well, you've come to the right place."
69683,275,162,815000,Richard Gere,Springfield Buddhist Temple,Buddhism teaches that suffering is caused by desire.
69684,275,163,820000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Buddhist Temple,Richard Gere?
69685,275,164,822000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Buddhist Temple,"Ooh, the world's most famous Buddhist."
69686,275,165,824000,Richard Gere,Springfield Buddhist Temple,What about the Dalai Lama?
69687,275,166,826000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Buddhist Temple,Who?
69688,275,167,827000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Buddhist Temple,"You know, the fourteenth reincarnation of the Buddha Avalokitesvara."
69689,275,168,830000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Buddhist Temple,Who's Buddha?
69691,275,169,831000,Richard Gere,Springfield Buddhist Temple,It's a good thing Buddhism teaches freedom from desire. 'Cause I've got the desire to kick your ass.
69692,275,170,836000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Buddhist Temple,"Mr. Gere, I was hoping Buddhism could bring me inner peace. Or is that just a pipe dream?"
69693,275,171,840000,Richard Gere,Springfield Buddhist Temple,We all have dreams. Mine is of a free Tibet.
69694,275,172,844000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Buddhist Temple,That would be so great.
69695,275,173,845000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Buddhist Temple,I dream about meatball sandwiches. All you can eat for two bucks.
69696,275,174,849000,Richard Gere,Springfield Buddhist Temple,Good luck. This pamphlet contains the teachings of the Buddha -- all things are impermanent and are empty of inherent existence.
69697,275,175,852000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Buddhist Temple,"Hey Richard, in ""An Officer and A Gentleman"" did you really do all those sit-ups?"
69698,275,176,861000,Richard Gere,Springfield Buddhist Temple,"I wish. I did one, then they just showed it a thousand times."
69700,275,178,863000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"""Nirvana is achieved through right views and right speech... Positive actions lead to happiness and negative actions lead to unhappiness... No creator gods, just the pursuit of enlightenment..."""

69706,275,184,889000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Maybe never.
69707,275,185,891000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,Yayyy!
69709,275,187,897000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, you think you know better than this family, huh. Well, as long as you're in my house, you'll do what I do and believe what I believe. So butter your bacon!"
69710,275,188,908000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, father."
69711,275,189,912000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, Dad, my spiritual quest is over..."

69715,275,193,928000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wha?! That's it. No more chat rooms for you.
69716,275,194,932000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, Lisa, around here, Buddhists don't get any desserts in their lunches."
69717,275,195,937000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,A Buddhist wouldn't want any.
69690,275,198,944000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey Simpson, I hear your sister dumped Christianity."
69480,275,199,947000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Who cares?
69721,275,200,948000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,"I'll tell you someone who cares. He's got long hair, works as a carpenter, has a lot of ""crazy"" ideas about love and brotherhood."
69722,275,201,957000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,His name's Gunnar and he's datin' my Mom. Sometimes he buys us beer.
69723,275,202,962000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I thought Kearney was dating your Mom.
69724,275,203,964000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, she came on to me."

69728,275,207,976000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm planting my own Bodhi tree. If I meditate under it, perhaps I can find inner peace."
69729,275,208,982000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, is this about some boy at school who doesn't like you?"
69730,275,209,987000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
69731,275,210,988000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Good. I'm just saying that any boy who doesn't like you is not worth your time.
69732,275,211,994000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Om Mani Padme Hung. Om Mani Padme Hung. Om Mani Padme Hung.
69733,275,212,999000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're gonna get a bath tonight.
69735,275,214,1005000,C. Montgomery Burns,First Church of Springfield,"So the good news is, church revenues are up one thousand and seventy-three percent."

69740,275,219,1027000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Well, next on our agenda, Marge Simpson's devil daughter."
69741,275,220,1031000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,She's not a devil. I just don't know what to do.
69742,275,221,1035000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Well, Christmas is coming, huh?"
69743,275,222,1038000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Yeah, and Santa doesn't leave presents under the Bodhi tree."
69744,275,223,1041000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,You think we can bribe her back with Christmas?
69745,275,224,1044000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Marge, you can save more souls with roller skates and Easy Bake Ovens than with this two thousand page sleeping pill."
69747,275,226,1053000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Time to begin Operation Xmas-Remind of-How good is.
69748,275,227,1055000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Just do it. Do it. Do it now!
69749,275,228,1063000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I think this tree could use an angel.
69595,275,229,1066000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, at least it's tasteful."
69751,275,232,1076000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I was just making Christmas cookies. But since you don't believe in Christmas anymore, I guess you don't want any."
69752,275,233,1083000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, they do smell good..."
69753,275,234,1085000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hm. It's a pity.
69754,275,235,1088000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,All right! Trash cookies!
69755,275,236,1093000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh. I think I ate a dog food lid.
69756,275,237,1102000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Here she comes! And-a one and-a two and-a...
69757,275,238,1106000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS / WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS / WE WISH...
69758,275,239,1112000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh. Hello, Lisa."
69759,275,240,1114000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I just came down for a glass of water.
69760,275,241,1116000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah. Well, you do have a present under the tree. I guess no one told Santa you were a Buddhist."
69761,275,242,1123000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Santa can take it back because I'm not ruled by material desi-- Is that a pony?"
69762,275,243,1132000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know what Santa left you. I just know his name is Clip-Clop and he loves sugar.
69763,275,244,1138000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, we love you and we're not trying to put any pressure on you."
69764,275,245,1149000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Awww...
69765,275,246,1153000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,Lick it... Lick it...
69766,275,247,1156000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
69767,275,248,1160000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh no! Our daughter's run away on Christmas Eve.
69768,275,249,1166000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,"More sugar, please."
69769,275,250,1167000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bag's in the kitchen.
69770,275,251,1169000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,All right!
69773,275,254,1177000,Lisa Simpson,Temple,My family tried to trick me into celebrating Christmas!
69774,275,255,1179000,Richard Gere,Temple,"You know, we are meditating."
69775,275,256,1184000,Lisa Simpson,Temple,"Oh, sorry."
69776,275,257,1185000,Richard Gere,Temple,That's all right. I was only about to achieve enlightenment. But who'd want that?
69777,275,258,1189000,Lenny Leonard,Temple,Who likes short shorts?
69778,275,259,1191000,Carl Carlson,Temple,I like short shorts.
69779,275,260,1194000,Richard Gere,Temple,"Those guys are way off. Anyway, your family didn't have to trick you. Buddhists respect the diversity of other religions as long as they're based on love and compassion."
69780,275,261,1203000,Lisa Simpson,Temple,Whaa?
69781,275,262,1205000,Richard Gere,Temple,It's true. So why don't you go home. I'm sure your family really misses you.
69782,275,263,1208000,Lisa Simpson,Temple,I can really celebrate Christmas?
69783,275,264,1211000,Richard Gere,Temple,"You can celebrate any holiday. And you know, my birthday is August thirty-first."
69784,275,265,1215000,Lisa Simpson,Temple,"Oh, I'll send you an email greeting card."
69785,275,266,1217000,Richard Gere,Temple,Sweet.
69786,275,267,1218000,Lisa Simpson,Temple,Now I really should be getting back to my family.
69787,275,268,1221000,Richard Gere,Temple,"Yeah, I'm spending tonight with my stepdaughter Hannah. I do her hair, then she does mine."
69788,275,269,1225000,Lenny Leonard,Temple,"We're gonna go spend Christmas with Moe. You know, so he don't have one of his Christmas ""accidents."""
69789,275,270,1225000,Carl Carlson,Temple,"Hey, he can't do much without this."
69791,275,272,1233000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,I did it. I found our dog. Now our Christmas is complete.
69792,275,273,1239000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,We were looking for Lisa!
69793,275,274,1240000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,I thought we were caroling.
69794,275,275,1242000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,We'd better call the police.
69796,275,277,1248000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Lisa?
69798,275,279,1250000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,You came back!
69799,275,280,1253000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Yeah, I wanted to spend Christmas with you guys."
69800,275,281,1257000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,So you're back on the winning team?
69801,275,282,1259000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"No, I'm still Buddhist, but I can worship with my family too."
69802,275,283,1263000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,So you're just going to pay lip service to our church?
69803,275,284,1266000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Uh huh.
69804,275,285,1267000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,That's all I ever asked.
69805,275,286,1270000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Well, I'm just glad you're back."
69806,275,287,1273000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"And don't worry, honey, I'll pray double hard for both of us. Now let's get you some Christmas cookies."
69807,275,288,1281000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Thanks, Mom. Hey, where's my pony?"
69808,275,289,1285000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Yes! Merry Christmas to us all.
69809,275,290,1290000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"I'm serious, make with the pony."
69810,275,291,1292000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,And a happy and healthy New Year.
69811,275,292,1295000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Here, Clip-Clop. Here pony, pony."
69812,275,293,1298000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Happy, happy New Year!"
