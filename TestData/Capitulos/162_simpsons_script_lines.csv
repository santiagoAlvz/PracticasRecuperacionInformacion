35988,162,1,11000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, why do they have to put all this crud in my newspaper? ""World""... ""The Arts""... ""Religion"" Aha! Here it is: ""Kickin' Back!"""
35989,162,2,39000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, who cut something out of my paper?"
35990,162,3,44000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Not me.
35991,162,4,45000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Not me. I'm more of a mail-tamperer.
35994,162,5,47000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, don't look at me... just because I'm holding a pair of scissors. Scissors which I need... to uh... to gussy-up these curtains."
35995,162,6,61000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello? Oh, hi, Lenny... No. Why would I need a ride this afternoon?"
35996,162,7,68000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Where? To the big annual what?
35997,162,8,74000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lenny? Aw, well. If it was big and annual I'm sure they'd have mentioned it in the newspaper."
35998,162,9,81000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, it's a lazy dog-dangling afternoon. But something's a little off..."
35999,162,10,89000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Marge, you don't smoke!"
36000,162,11,91000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I just felt like filling the house with the rich, satisfying smell of tobacco."
36001,162,12,100000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're nuts. I gotta get some fresh air.
36002,162,13,104000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Homie, wait!"
36003,162,14,105000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What's wrong with you? What are you trying to hide from m-- What's that smell? Onions... Chili powder... Cumin... Juicy ground chuck... It's chili! Oh my God, I'm missing the Chili Cook-Off!"
36004,162,15,118000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm missing the Cook-Off! It's going on right now and I'm missin' it!
36005,162,16,122000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, I was trying to keep it from you, but I had a good reason. Every time you go to that cook-off, you get drunk as a poet on payday. Remember last year?"
36007,162,18,132000,Homer Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,Look at me! I'm a puffy pink cloud!
36008,162,19,142000,Homer Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,"Oh, well, of course... everything looks bad if you remember it. Now where are my chili boots? Ah!"
36009,162,20,152000,Marge Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,"Okay, we'll go to the Chili Cook-Off. But I want you to promise me you won't have any beer."
36010,162,21,158000,Homer Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,"Okay, quit naggin' me. I won't have any beer. Geez, why don't you have a cigarette or something?"
36011,162,22,162000,Marge Simpson,FAIRGROUNDS,"Mmm, I suppose I could..."
36013,162,24,171000,Lisa Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,I'm gonna go get some vegetarian chili before they get desperate and add meat.
36014,162,25,175000,Bart Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,I'm gonna go claim some valuables at the Lost and Found.
36015,162,26,178000,Marge Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Ooh, look at that adorable spice rack!"
36016,162,27,181000,Marge Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Eight spices! Oh, some must be doubles. ""Or-uh-GAHN-o?"" What the hell...?"
36017,162,28,187000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Marge, we're missing the chili! Less artsy, more fartsy!"
35992,162,29,192000,Marge Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Homer, I happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my face."
36018,162,30,196000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,Fine. I'll come find you when I'm ready to stop having fun.
36019,162,31,200000,Marge Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,Remember your promise: no drinking.
36020,162,32,204000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,Stupor Pooper.
36021,162,33,211000,HELEN,Chili Cook-Off,"Howdy howdy, Marge and Hom-- oh, my mistake, Homer's not even with you! Probably just knocking back a few ""refreshments."""
36022,162,34,216000,Marge Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Thank you for your concern, Helen. Homer isn't drinking today."
36023,162,35,223000,HELEN,Chili Cook-Off,Oh. I think it's lovely that he said that... and that you believed him!
36024,162,36,228000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Chili Cook-Off,"Now, Helen, let us not glory in Homer's binge-drinking. There but for the grace of God goes Marge herself."
36025,162,37,248000,Otto Mann,Chili Cook-Off,"Oh, man, he's here! The dude with the fireproof stomach!"
36026,162,38,255000,Various Onlookers,Chili Cook-Off,The spoon!
36027,162,39,257000,Lenny Leonard,Chili Cook-Off,"They say he carved it himself, from a bigger spoon."
36028,162,40,264000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Five-alarm chili, eh?"
36029,162,41,266000,Ned Flanders,Chili Cook-Off,Um-hm.
36030,162,42,267000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"One... two... Hey, what's the big idea?"
36031,162,43,274000,Ned Flanders,Chili Cook-Off,"Oh, I admit it! It's only two-alarm -- two-and-a-half tops! I just wanted to be a big man in front of the kids."
36032,162,44,281000,Todd Flanders,Chili Cook-Off,"Daddy, are you going to jail?"
36033,162,45,284000,Ned Flanders,Chili Cook-Off,"We'll see, son. We'll see."
36034,162,46,291000,Waylon Smithers,Chili Cook-Off,"Evenin', little lady. Do you reckon a square could get a dance?"
36035,162,47,296000,Marge Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,It looks so complicated... Do you know how?
36036,162,48,301000,Waylon Smithers,Chili Cook-Off,"Ma'am, I wouldn't honk the honk if I couldn't tonk the tonk."
36037,162,49,308000,Marge Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,Woo-woo!
36038,162,50,312000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Hmmm. A bland, timid entry -- suitable, perhaps, for patients recovering from surgery. Heh, heh, heh."
36039,162,51,320000,Chief Wiggum,Chili Cook-Off,"That Simpson, he thinks he's the Pope of Chilitown. Well, this year I am ready for him!"
36040,162,52,331000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Hello, Chief."
36041,162,53,336000,Chief Wiggum,Chili Cook-Off,"Afternoon, Homer. Care for some chili? I've added an extra ingredient just for you. The merciless peppers of Quetzlzacatenango!"
36042,162,54,349000,Chief Wiggum,Chili Cook-Off,Grown deep in the jungle primeval by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum.
36043,162,55,359000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Uh, Wiggy...? My chili's gettin' cold."
36045,162,57,373000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,Hot! Hot!
35936,162,60,383000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,Beer! Gimme some beer!

36047,162,63,388000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,But I need it!
36048,162,64,393000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Aw, lousy Wiggum. Now the whole town thinks I'm a chili wuss..."
36049,162,65,398000,Ralph Wiggum,Chili Cook-Off,"Wait, mister! You're drinking a candle!"
36050,162,66,401000,Ralph Wiggum,Chili Cook-Off,"You don't wanna get wax in your mouth, do you?"
36051,162,67,405000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Maybe I do, son. Maybe I do."
36052,162,68,413000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,Outstanding.
36053,162,69,418000,Chief Wiggum,Chili Cook-Off,"Hey, everybody, look who's back! It's the biiig baby! Oh, this porridge is too hot! Oh, waah waah waah!"

36058,162,74,447000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Chili Cook-Off,Good Lord! This can't be happening!
36059,162,75,449000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Chili Cook-Off,"By all medical logic, steam should be shootin' out of his ears!"
36060,162,76,452000,Krusty the Clown,Chili Cook-Off,His ears if we're lucky!
36061,162,77,456000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Well, Chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is."
36062,162,78,467000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"Heh, heh! My finest hour! And Marge wasn't even here to see it."
36063,162,79,476000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,Ooh. I don't feel so good.
36064,162,80,484000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,Flanders! You gotta help me!

36071,162,87,518000,Ralph Wiggum,Chili Cook-Off,"Hey, mister, do you need some hel--"
36072,162,88,520000,Otto Mann,Chili Cook-Off,"Let him go, Ralph. He knows what he's doing."
36074,162,90,537000,Homer Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"What's happening to me? Okay, retrace your steps... woke up, fought with Marge, ate Guatemalan insanity peppers. Then I -- Ohhhh."
36076,162,92,549000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATORY DESERT,Where am I? Shelbyville?
36078,162,93,555000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATORY DESERT,"Man, this is crazy. I hope I didn't brain my damage. I'd better check my pupils..."
36079,162,94,572000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATORY DESERT,Oh... kay. I think I'm gonna be leaving now.
36080,162,95,584000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATORY DESERT,"Huh? Sunrise, sunset... Sunrise, sunset... SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET..."
36082,162,97,600000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATORY DESERT,Note to self: stop doing anything.
36084,162,99,605000,Marge Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,Has anyone seen Homer?
36085,162,100,608000,HELEN,Chili Cook-Off,"Marge, better you hear it from me than some gossipy neighbor -- Homer made a total jackass of himself."
36086,162,101,613000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Chili Cook-Off,"Oh, Helen, that's enough. Call off your dogs."
36087,162,102,616000,HELEN,Chili Cook-Off,"Oh, but someone had to tell her. And I got here first!"
36088,162,103,619000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Chili Cook-Off,"Helen, zip it! Zip!"
36089,162,104,619000,Helen Lovejoy,Chili Cook-Off,"Oh, please... Tim!..."

36091,162,106,624000,Marge Simpson,Chili Cook-Off,"No beer, huh? I guess I know what a promise from Homer J. Simpson is worth."
36093,162,108,637000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATORY DESERT,Hey buddy! Get back there with the other rocks!
36094,162,109,641000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATORY DESERT,Huh? A tortoise?
36095,162,110,644000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATORY DESERT,Follow... the... This must be why I'm here! Follow the what? Follow the what? Hurry up!
36097,162,112,656000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATORY DESERT,"Get moving, you stupid... When I'm kicking you, that means ""hurry up"". Come on!"
36098,162,113,676000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATORY DESERT,"Oh. You want me to climb that, huh? No problemo."
36099,162,114,686000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATORY DESERT,"This is 'cause I kicked you, isn't it?"
36101,162,116,693000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Lis, check it out. Time for chili."
36102,162,117,696000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"I saw it, Bart."
36103,162,118,698000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,You're just mad cause there's no clock in your hat.
36104,162,119,700000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,What hat?
36105,162,120,702000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Aw, this baby's wasted on an idiot like you. Where's Homer?"
36106,162,121,706000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Your father decided he'd rather come home in a taxi. Or a police car.
36108,162,123,716000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,Marge! Thank God you're here! Where's the car?
36109,162,124,719000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,"Marge? Marge? Oh, now what? If you're still mad at me, I'm gonna be really mad."
36077,162,125,728000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,"Come on, Marge! Will you... Fight fair! I never do this to you!"
35812,162,126,732000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,Talk to me!!
36110,162,128,742000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,"Aw, I hate this place! Why am I here?!"
36111,162,129,747000,Voice,HALLUCINATION,You are on a quest for knowledge.
36112,162,130,749000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,Who said that?
36113,162,131,760000,Coyote,HALLUCINATION,"Fear not, Homer. I am your spirit guide."
36114,162,132,763000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,Hiya.
36115,162,133,764000,Coyote,HALLUCINATION,There is a lesson you must learn.
36116,162,134,766000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,"If it's about laying off the insanity peppers, I'm way ahead of you."
36117,162,135,770000,Coyote,HALLUCINATION,"No, I speak of a deeper wisdom. The problem, Homer, is that the mind is always chattering away, with a thousand thoughts at once."
36118,162,136,779000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,"Yeah, that's me all right."
36119,162,137,784000,Coyote,HALLUCINATION,Clarity is the path to inner peace.
36120,162,138,787000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,But what should I do? Should I meditate? Should I get rid of all my possessions?
36121,162,139,792000,Coyote,HALLUCINATION,"Are you kidding? If anything, you should get more possessions. You don't even have a computer!"
36122,162,140,798000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,"You know, I have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and I would -- Hey!!"
36124,162,142,805000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,Knock it off!
36125,162,143,807000,Coyote,HALLUCINATION,Sorry. I am a coyote...
36126,162,144,810000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,"Look, just gimme some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with ya."
36127,162,145,814000,Coyote,HALLUCINATION,"Good. Your mind is in a state of readiness. So listen well: To make yourself complete, you must find your soul mate."
36128,162,146,823000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,Soul mate?
36129,162,147,824000,Coyote,HALLUCINATION,"Your kindred spirit. The one with whom you share an unspoken bond... a profound, mystical understanding."
36130,162,148,832000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,"That's it? Well, that's Marge. Big deal. Great spiritual quest, wolfie. My soul mate is Marge."
36131,162,149,840000,Coyote,HALLUCINATION,Is it?
36132,162,150,848000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,"Hey, wait! Come back!..."
36133,162,151,854000,Homer Simpson,HALLUCINATION,A ghost train! And so little time to get out of the way!... Now less!... Now none!
36137,162,155,863000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Hey, get off the course, you bum! Security!"
36138,162,156,869000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Wha? Golf course? Did I dream that whole thing? Maybe the desert was just this sand trap... Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid was just the Pro Shop!"
36140,162,157,882000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,And that talking coyote was really just a talking dog.
36141,162,158,885000,Dog,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Hi, Homer. Find your soul mate."
36142,162,159,887000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Hey, wait a minute. There's no such thing as a talking dog."
36144,162,161,892000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Damn straight.
36146,162,163,893000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So then I says to Mabel, I says..."
36147,162,164,895000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hi, kids."
36148,162,165,896000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll finish this later. Hi, Dad."
36149,162,166,897000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Where's your mother?
36150,162,167,899000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Out back.
36151,162,168,900000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So anyway, I says to Mabel, I says..."
36152,162,169,902000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hi, honey."
36153,162,170,905000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh. I guess you're cranky because I didn't come home last night...
36154,162,171,911000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm ""cranky"" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town. You broke your promise, Homer."
36155,162,172,919000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk. I just went to a strange fantasy world. C'mon, you gotta believe me. You're my soul mate."
36156,162,173,928000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't ""soul mate"" me!"
36157,162,174,929000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay.
36158,162,175,933000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That coyote said my soul mate would understand me, but Marge doesn't understand me at all. Maybe we're not kindred spirits. We don't have anything in common..."
36159,162,176,945000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look at these records! Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, the Doodletown Pipers! Now look at her records... They stink! Maybe I had that crazy dream for a reason..."
36160,162,177,961000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wherever my soul mate is, it's not here."
36161,162,178,974000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"...I always just figured my wife was my soul mate. But if it's not Marge, then who is it? Where do I begin looking?"
36163,162,180,981000,Furniture Salesman,Bob's All-Night Furniture Store,"This really goes beyond my training as a furniture salesman, sir. Now if you don't want the sofa, I'll have to ask you to leave."
36165,162,182,990000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, Barney! Soul mate! Let me buy you a beer."
36166,162,183,993000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, but I'm not your soul mate. I'm really more of a chum."
36167,162,184,998000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well what about you, Lenny?"
36168,162,185,998000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,I'm a crony.
36139,162,186,999000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Carl?
36169,162,187,999000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,I'd say acquaintance.

36176,162,194,1012000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Hello? Is this G-B-M? Uh, yeah. I read in the personals you were seeking a soul mate and, well, I also like rainy days and movies. Uh huh... uh, no, I don't like that. Or that. No, it's not that I'm afraid. I'm gonna hang up now. Bye-bye. Oh, I give up."
36177,162,195,1038000,Coyote,Street,"Find your soul mate, Homer. Find your soul mate."
36178,162,196,1042000,Homer Simpson,Street,Where? Where?!
36179,162,197,1043000,Coyote,Street,This is just your memory. I can't give you any new information.
36181,162,199,1055000,Homer Simpson,WATERFRONT DISTRICT,Huh. What's that blinking light?
36182,162,200,1093000,Homer Simpson,WATERFRONT DISTRICT,The lighthouse keeper!
36184,162,202,1094000,Homer Simpson,STORMY SEACOAST,The loneliest man in the world! He'll understand me!
36185,162,203,1108000,Homer Simpson,STORMY SEACOAST,Earl. My new friend's name is Earl!
36186,162,204,1111000,Homer Simpson,STORMY SEACOAST,"Here I come, buddy! No more loneliness for Homer and Earl...."
36188,162,206,1119000,Homer Simpson,Lighthouse Control Room,"A machine? Earl's a machine. Oh, that's just perfect! Homer's desperate search for a soul mate has yielded a lighthouse-keeping robot! Oh, wow!"
36190,162,208,1136000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, look! Is that Dad?"
36191,162,209,1138000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Either that or Batman has really let himself go.
36192,162,210,1141000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Alone! I'm alone! I'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!"
36193,162,211,1151000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A ship! A ship with people! I know... I'll bring them to me! And then they'll have to be my friends!
36194,162,212,1161000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come here, people!"
36196,162,214,1167000,Captain Horatio McCallister,FREIGHTER,"Arr, Matey, nary a warning light to be seen. 'Tis clear sailing ahead for our precious cargo."
36197,162,215,1173000,First Mate,FREIGHTER,"Uh... would that be the hotpants, sir?"
36198,162,216,1176000,Captain Horatio McCallister,FREIGHTER,Aye... the hotpants.
36199,162,217,1179000,Homer Simpson,FREIGHTER,"Well, I won't be lonely for long...."
36202,162,220,1190000,Marge Simpson,FREIGHTER,"Oh, Homer, thank goodness you're safe!"
36203,162,221,1194000,Homer Simpson,FREIGHTER,Marge?
36204,162,222,1195000,Marge Simpson,FREIGHTER,"I woke up and you weren't there, and I was so worried..."
36205,162,223,1198000,Homer Simpson,FREIGHTER,Really? You were? But how did you find me?
36206,162,224,1202000,Marge Simpson,FREIGHTER,"Well, I was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public transportation is for losers. And I was sure you'd head west, because Springfield slopes down that way. And then I saw the lighthouse, and I remembered how you love blinking lights... like the one on the waffle iron..."
36207,162,225,1220000,Homer Simpson,FREIGHTER,"Or that little guy on the ""Don't Walk"" sign."
36208,162,226,1223000,Marge Simpson,FREIGHTER,Yeah.
36209,162,227,1224000,Homer Simpson,FREIGHTER,"Wow, Marge, you really do understand me. See, I thought we weren't soul mates because..."
36210,162,228,1229000,Marge Simpson,FREIGHTER,...we had a fight?
36211,162,229,1230000,Homer Simpson,FREIGHTER,"Right, and we don't like the same things. It's like you're from Venus..."
36212,162,230,1232000,Marge Simpson,FREIGHTER,...and you're from Mars.
36213,162,231,1235000,Homer Simpson,FREIGHTER,"Oh, sure. Give me the one with all the monsters."
36214,162,232,1237000,Marge Simpson,FREIGHTER,"Homer, don't you see? Our differences are only skin-deep..."
36215,162,233,1242000,Homer Simpson,FREIGHTER,...But our sames go right down to the bone. Maybe we do have a...
36216,162,234,1247000,Marge Simpson,FREIGHTER,...a profound mystical understanding?
36217,162,235,1250000,Homer Simpson,FREIGHTER,"Hey... we do! Oh, Marge!"
36218,162,236,1254000,Homer Simpson,FREIGHTER,"We're number one! We're number one! In your face, space coyote!"
36219,162,237,1259000,Marge Simpson,FREIGHTER,Space coyote?
36220,162,238,1262000,Homer Simpson,FREIGHTER,Omigod! The ship!
36221,162,239,1264000,Marge Simpson,FREIGHTER,We'll all be killed!
36222,162,240,1265000,Homer Simpson,FREIGHTER,The light! We gotta get the light back on!
36223,162,241,1274000,Captain Horatio McCallister,FREIGHTER,Jonathan Livingston Seagull! We're on a collision course! Hard a-starboard!
36224,162,242,1280000,First Mate,FREIGHTER,"Um, port."
36225,162,243,1281000,Captain Horatio McCallister,FREIGHTER,"Aye, port."
36227,162,245,1283000,Homer Simpson,Lighthouse,They see us! They're starting to turn!
36228,162,246,1287000,Marge Simpson,Lighthouse,We did it!
36229,162,247,1289000,Homer Simpson,Lighthouse,We sure did... soul mate.
36230,162,248,1304000,Chief Wiggum,Lighthouse,Look at all them hot pants!
36231,162,249,1306000,Lenny Leonard,Lighthouse,Hey! Who likes short shorts?
36232,162,250,1307000,Crowd,Lighthouse,We like short shorts!
