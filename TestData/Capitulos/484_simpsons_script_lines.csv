125471,484,15,197000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, I'm afraid we need the help of someone older and wiser."
125472,484,16,204000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I get to enjoy this, but I'm not responsible."
125473,484,17,209000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, Dad, as the supervising parent today, you'll get your share of the blame, too."
125475,484,19,215000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What do I do? Patty's gonna kill me! Unless... I kill her first! I put the body in the car, I dump the car in the lake, I put a James Taylor CD in the stereo so they think it's a suicide..."
125476,484,20,227000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair?
125477,484,21,229000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fine, whatever."
125478,484,22,232000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll just keep cutting till I hit something solid.
125481,484,25,240000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And now, to break the news as gently as I know how."
125482,484,26,244000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wake-up-and-look-at-your-hair!
125484,484,28,249000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What happened to you?

125488,484,32,263000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's just what I was going for! I was going for Scary.
125489,484,33,267000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You did this?! With your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball?!
125490,484,34,277000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And stay out!
125491,484,35,279000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"I can't believe I'm saying this... Homer Simpson, do me."
125492,484,36,285000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,I meant my hair!
125494,484,38,289000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,Idiot.
125496,484,40,293000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Milhouse, check it out! I put a roadblock on the curly slide!"
125498,484,41,300000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Isn't this the greatest day ever?!
125499,484,42,302000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"There are no more great days, Bart. Just days."
125500,484,43,307000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"What's wrong, man?"
125501,484,44,308000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Something happened last night. Something that really changed me.
125503,484,46,314000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"My mom put in the ""Finding Nemo"" DVD, but then she got a phone call..."
125504,484,47,320000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,So I started it myself.
125505,484,48,322000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Did you know it has a chapter before chapter two? A chapter where we meet Nemo's mother...
125507,484,50,331000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Nemo doesn't have a mother.
125508,484,51,333000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Not after Chapter One he doesn't.
125510,484,53,345000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"If death can happen to a fish, it can happen to anyone. So you've gotta live life while you can. So I'm gonna finally proclaim my love for Lisa."
125511,484,54,356000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,That's your take-away from Nemo? I think you've already made your feelings for Lisa clear.
125512,484,55,360000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I can make them more clear. You see, in the past, I've been too subtle. It's my curse -- SUBTLETY!!!"
125514,484,57,370000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, thanks to your unlicensed barbery, Patty and Selma have been getting compliments all day at the DMV."
125515,484,58,376000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,You two look good. Open-casket good!
125517,484,60,380000,Lindsay Naegle,Simpson Home,"I hear this is the home of Springfield's hottest hairdresser. I need a haircut -- and I need it in three, two, one, now!"
125518,484,61,389000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lady, I'm not a hairdresser -- I just put a new lid on a couple of trashcans."
125519,484,62,397000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"A hundred dollars?! Marge, how much is that in smackaroos?"
125520,484,63,401000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,One hundred.
125521,484,64,401000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo!

125527,484,70,430000,Lindsay Naegle,Simpson Home,Are you sure you don't have a salon?
125528,484,71,432000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I open a lot of crazy things when I'm drunk, but I don't think so."
125529,484,72,437000,Lindsay Naegle,Simpson Home,Too bad.
125530,484,73,439000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just call me ""Homer Fingerhands."""
125531,484,74,439000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'd rather call you by your normal name, if that's okay. But I never knew you were so good with hair."
125532,484,75,447000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, when someone loses their hair, they miss it the most. It's like a beloved dog that died on your head."
125534,484,78,457000,1970s Grampa,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOUSE,You better not be brushing your hair again!
148295,484,79,459000,Teenage Homer,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOUSE,"Uh, uh, no, I'm, uh... just exploring my body!"
125535,484,80,463000,1970s Grampa,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOUSE,You better be!
148296,484,81,464000,Teenage Homer,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOUSE,"Oh, hair. I'll love you when you're old and gray."
148297,484,82,468000,Teenage Homer,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOUSE,"Huh... well, two can play at that game!"
125536,484,83,475000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOUSE,"Now that my soft, chestnut mane is gone, I dream of cutting hair, styling hair, making hair shorter in exchange for money... maybe I should open a hair salon."
125537,484,84,488000,Marge Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOUSE,"Well... Newsweek magazine did say it's good to change careers, right after they laid off all their editors."
125538,484,85,493000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOUSE,Yeah. But what if I can't find any commercial rental property?
125540,484,87,508000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Springfield,"I really thought people would like to harvest their own honey. Oh, how they hated it."
125542,484,89,521000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Attention lovers of love!
125543,484,90,524000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Let it be known by all: Lisa Simpson is the smartest, sweetest, most perfectest girl in the whole world, and I shall not rest until I am her boyfriend!"
125545,484,92,538000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"I know you like music, Lisa, so I'm gonna perform a love song I wrote... for you."
125546,484,93,547000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh yeah, it's a Theremin."
125547,484,94,553000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"TEACHER SAID DON'T EAT THE PASTE / 'TIS APT TO MAKE YOU SPEW / I ATE THE PASTE, AND LIKED THE TASTE / PASSED OUT AND DREAMED OF YOU."
125548,484,95,568000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay. First of all, it's never wise to use the word ""spew"" in a love song."
125550,484,96,572000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,LISA LISA...MAID SO FAIR / WITH CRIMSON DRESS AND POINTY HAIR / DO YOU MIND IF I STOP AND STARE / LOOK IN YOUR MIND AND I'M THERE.
125551,484,97,590000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"So, Lisa... I love you. Is that love ""requited"" or ""un""?"
125552,484,98,596000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm sorry, but I don't love you, Milhouse, and I never will."
125553,484,99,607000,Taffy,Springfield Elementary School,I thought that was beautiful.
125554,484,100,610000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,You did?
125555,484,101,612000,Taffy,Springfield Elementary School,Yeah! It was romantic and it rhymed.
125556,484,102,615000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I used a rhyming dictionary, but it only gives you options. The job of the poet is to say, ""This one, I guess."""
125557,484,103,621000,Taffy,Springfield Elementary School,I'm Taffy.
125558,484,104,626000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Would you like to help me roll the Theremin back to the A.V. closet?
125559,484,105,631000,Taffy,Springfield Elementary School,It's a date.
125560,484,106,634000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,That Theremin has paid for itself again and again.
125562,484,108,639000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Homer's Salon,"All day long, Apu goes on about Lady Gaga, who is doing nothing that Rava Khatan was not doing twenty years ago, while she was a member of Parliament!"
125563,484,109,649000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,"Oh now, how could someone as young as you know about twenty years ago?"
125565,484,111,653000,Helen Lovejoy,Homer's Salon,Funny how my Timothy always uses the short-form baptism when there's a basketball game he wants to watch...
125566,484,112,662000,Assorted Women,Homer's Salon,The worst know-it-all! I-/ Wears the same pants for a month! / I could just talk on and on! /
125567,484,113,672000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Salon,"Homie, are you even listening to me?"
125569,484,115,674000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Because I have so much to tell you: the mailman did the other side of the street before our side. Turns out it was a substitute.
125570,484,116,683000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, honey. All day long I have to listen to women talk."
125571,484,117,688000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Not a good time.
125573,484,119,695000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey Lis, those books aren't gonna pick themselves up."
125574,484,120,698000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh. Usually, Milhouse does it."
125575,484,121,699000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, guys. Uh Lisa, you dropped your books. When you pick 'em up, make sure you bend your knees."
125549,484,122,706000,Taffy,Springfield Elementary School,You know so much about body mechanics!
125576,484,123,709000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I've worn a lot of different braces in my time."
125577,484,124,714000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,This dame is really into you!
125578,484,125,715000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,She sure is. This morning I got to second base... on our walk around the softball diamond.
125579,484,126,724000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Why would a popular fifth-grader like Taffy be interested in a Milhouse like Milhouse?
125580,484,127,729000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I dunno. It's one of those mysteries, like how do my clothes get clean and put back in my drawers?"
125581,484,128,734000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I'm gonna find out why, because this..."
125582,484,129,738000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Knees, Lisa. Knees."
125584,484,131,746000,Luann Van Houten,Homer's Salon,"I know Kirk resents that the dog likes me more, but Rex is just establishing dominance over the weaker male. That's what miniature dachshunds do."
125585,484,132,755000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,"Oh yeah. Men are such dogs, and vice versa."
125586,484,133,759000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,Is there anyone in here that just wants a haircut with no chitchat?
125588,484,135,765000,Range-rover Mom,Homer's Salon,"Hey, I don't want a conversation."
125589,484,136,767000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,Oh?!
125590,484,137,767000,Range-rover Mom,Homer's Salon,I just want you to listen while I talk about the loser I'm married to.
125593,484,140,784000,Homer Simpson,SALON,These are really good scissors.
125595,484,142,787000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"All day long they tell me stupid, pointless, boring stories, and I have to stand there listening with a phony grin plastered on my face."
125596,484,143,798000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Uh-huh.
125597,484,144,799000,Kirk Van Houten,Moe's Tavern,"Well, Homer, you're safe here. You can forget everything they said."
125599,484,146,816000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,When I look at you -- all I see are the foibles that drive your women crazy! Foibles! Foibles! FOIBLES!
125600,484,147,823000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Calm down there, Homer."
125602,484,149,826000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,What got into him?
125603,484,150,828000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Freaky ad campaign they're running.
125605,484,152,836000,Sarah Wiggum,Homer's Salon,"Homer, can you make me look fan-cy?"
125606,484,153,840000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,"Sorry Sarah, I'm retired."
125607,484,154,842000,Chief Wiggum,Homer's Salon,But tonight's the Policemen's Ball! And if you let my Sarah down I can make life very difficult for you.
125608,484,155,848000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,I'd like to see you try.
125609,484,156,850000,Chief Wiggum,Homer's Salon,"Huh, where you goin'?"
125610,484,157,850000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,Excuse me.
125611,484,158,853000,Chief Wiggum,Homer's Salon,Uh-uh-uh!
125612,484,159,854000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,Come on! Would you--
125613,484,160,854000,Chief Wiggum,Homer's Salon,Nuh-uh!
125615,484,162,856000,Chief Wiggum,Homer's Salon,"I, uh, I can also make very annoying noises."
125616,484,163,868000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,"C'mon, bro, don't hassle me!"
125618,484,165,870000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,"Stop that. Okay, okay. You win. I'll teach you how to make love to your wife!"
125619,484,166,876000,Chief Wiggum,Homer's Salon,What? No! Just cut her hair!
125620,484,167,878000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,Right.
125621,484,168,881000,Lenny Leonard,Homer's Salon,Homer? I thought you were gonna quit.
125622,484,169,884000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,"I can't. They won't let me. Lenny, be a pal and saw off my hands."
125623,484,170,889000,Lenny Leonard,Homer's Salon,"Why don't you do here what you do at the nuclear plant -- namely, suck."
125624,484,171,893000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,Suck! Of course!
125625,484,172,896000,Helen Lovejoy,Homer's Salon,"So, I told Timothy, you cannot keep basing sermons on old Seinfelds..."
125626,484,173,904000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,"Oh my God. Like Mozart and Johnny Knoxville, my genius cannot be stopped!"
125627,484,174,913000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,There's only one way out -- I'm committing Barbicide!
125628,484,175,921000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Salon,Why doesn't anything kill me?
125630,484,177,929000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmm...
125631,484,178,930000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, that's Taffy's page. Ooh, I see that she's in a relationship."
125632,484,179,935000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Shut up! I just want to know what she's up to with Milhouse. A girl like her could get a fifth grader -- maybe even Kyle LoBianco!
125633,484,180,944000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I hear he goes to California on his vacations.
125634,484,181,947000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's the first thing everyone knows about Kyle LoBianco!
125635,484,182,950000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Taffy's up to something. And I won't find out what it is sitting at a computer. It's time to get boots on the ground.
125636,484,183,958000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You like my boots?
125637,484,184,961000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Once you get past the sister ick, they're fine."
125404,484,186,966000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my poor Homie."
125639,484,187,972000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, do you hear it? Listen! It's the hair -- growing! Always growing! Blonde, brunette... auburn!"
125640,484,188,981000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This ends now!
125641,484,189,982000,Lindsay Naegle,Simpson Home,I need some highlights for a bridal shower!
125642,484,190,985000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You can start with the rinse!
125643,484,191,987000,Lindsay Naegle,Simpson Home,Please... I'll even buy... product!
125645,484,193,997000,Taffy,Mt. Springfield,"Here, my love."
125646,484,194,999000,Milhouse Van Houten,Mt. Springfield,Thank you.
125647,484,195,1001000,Taffy,Mt. Springfield,Anything for my silly Milly.
125648,484,196,1009000,Lisa Simpson,Mt. Springfield,Who'd follow Milhouse around like that? Sneaking around after them all day has taught me a lot about this sicko.
125649,484,197,1016000,Moe Szyslak,Mt. Springfield,Evening.
125650,484,198,1024000,Lisa Simpson,Mt. Springfield,I am never gonna get my homework done tonight.
125651,484,199,1036000,Lisa Simpson,Mt. Springfield,"All right, sister. What's your game?"
125652,484,200,1041000,Hans Moleman,Mt. Springfield,We're just trying to put our relationship back together.
125653,484,201,1044000,Lunchlady Dora,Mt. Springfield,"In the sack he's Salisbury steak, everywhere else creamed corn."
125654,484,202,1049000,Lisa Simpson,Mt. Springfield,I am so sorry.
125655,484,203,1054000,Milhouse Van Houten,Mt. Springfield,Lisa?
125656,484,204,1058000,Taffy,Mt. Springfield,Not her again.
125657,484,205,1060000,Milhouse Van Houten,Mt. Springfield,"Yeah, Lisa. Can't you leave me alone? We're over."
125658,484,206,1064000,Taffy,Mt. Springfield,"You're not over, you never were! Milhouse, you're a great guy. But we're not gonna work out for one reason."
125659,484,207,1069000,Milhouse Van Houten,Mt. Springfield,Is it 'cause when I wore cuffed pants they filled up with leaves?
