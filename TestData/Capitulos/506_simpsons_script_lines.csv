131234,506,1,21000,Homer Simpson,Sky,Now that's what I call going for a spin!
131235,506,2,52000,Homer Simpson,Sky,Now that's what I call a snappy retort!
131236,506,3,56000,Marge Simpson,Sky,Stop saying what you call things! I'm trying to watch the movie!
131237,506,4,60000,Russian Businessman,Sky,"Welcome to annual conclave of International Brotherhood of Evil. This year's theme: ""Evil in the Age of Social Media."" We have prepared three breakout rooms for small group discussion."
131239,506,6,73000,German Criminal,Sky,These small rooms are an excellent way for villains to mingle with super-villains. But are you sure we will not be bothered by the American master-spy Stradivarius Cain?
131241,506,8,78000,Russian Businessman,Sky,"Do not worry about Doctor Cain. The last I saw him, my beautiful mistress was about to finish him off."
131242,506,9,92000,Mistress,Sky,"Yes, that's what I did."
131243,506,10,94000,Russian Businessman,Sky,"You killed him, right?"
131244,506,11,96000,Mistress,Sky,Yes -- he was the perfect lover-- of being killed!
131245,506,12,101000,Russian Businessman,Sky,"It's a weird sentence, but let's move on. My baker has prepared an edible monument to Cain's demise."
131247,506,14,109000,CAIN,Sky,"Party's over, General!"
131248,506,15,111000,Russian Businessman,Sky,Stradivarius Cain?! Nooo!
131250,506,17,114000,Homer Simpson,Movie Theater,He turned that Russian guy into Swiss cheese!
131252,506,18,118000,Marge Simpson,Movie Theater,"Homer! People are here to see the movie, not listen to you!"
131253,506,19,123000,Carl Carlson,Movie Theater,"Hey Homer, great yell-outs tonight!"
131254,506,20,125000,Lenny Leonard,Movie Theater,"Lucky you, Marge! You get to hear 'em the loudest!"
131256,506,22,127000,Mistress,Castle,You've ruined me for other men!
131257,506,23,129000,CAIN,Castle,That's my hobby. This is my job.
131258,506,24,134000,Homer Simpson,Castle,Looks like that guy's got turret's syndrome!
131260,506,26,139000,Lenny Leonard,Castle,I couldn't have thought of that in ten thousand lifetimes!
131263,506,29,157000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Swiss cheese. Marge, how come you're not saying anything?"
131264,506,30,162000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,"There was enough talking during the movie! This date night was even worse than the date night we saw ""Date Night."""
131265,506,31,164000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Oh man, Marge is pissed. Look at her... flaring her nostrils... drumming her fingers... making small noises like she's yelling at me inside her head..."
131267,506,33,180000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,Just take me home.
131268,506,34,182000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,That's what she said!
131269,506,35,185000,Lenny Leonard,Homer's Car,Another good one!
131270,506,36,185000,Carl Carlson,Homer's Car,You're on fire!
131272,506,38,193000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Attention, students. In order to cut down on the rash of embarrassing YouTube videos of our teachers, we will be scanning you and taking away your smartphones."
131274,506,40,209000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"A new low. I should've taken that superintendent job in Honduras. My own donkey, all the sugarcane I could suck... if only I could stomach the upside-down question marks."
131275,506,41,222000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Hey Simpson. Let me save you the trouble of putting that money back in your pocket.
131276,506,42,231000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw haw.
131277,506,43,234000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Stupid Nelson! I hate that guy.
131278,506,44,237000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,My Mom says bullies only bully 'cause they're scared.
131279,506,45,241000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Your mom's next!
131281,506,47,242000,Nelson Muntz,HAIR SALON,"You make dumb kids, lady!"
131284,506,50,253000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Boy Homer, I gotta say, Marge looked pretty easy on the eyes last night. And I know eye-ease!"
131285,506,51,259000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yeah.
131286,506,52,259000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Uh-oh. Trouble in paradise?
131287,506,53,262000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, just my marriage."
131289,506,55,266000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Honey, it's me again. I can't work knowing that you're mad at me. I just wanna hear your voice. And I'm counting the minutes till the whistle blows, then I go to Moe's, then I rush home to you."
131290,506,56,280000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Explain this infernal wheel to me again!
131291,506,57,284000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Left for left, right for right!"
131292,506,58,286000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Enough of your double-talk!
131294,506,60,296000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Excellent. He's alive. Smithers, give this man one ibuprofen, uncoated, and send him back to his workstation."
131295,506,61,304000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, Simpson has sustained a serious concussion. Recent research says you must give him time off to recover."
131296,506,62,310000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, pish. When I was in Africa, I had my skull cracked open by cannibals, and I'm still kicking!"
131297,506,63,316000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, that was your partner. You betrayed him to the cannibals."
131298,506,64,319000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, that's right. I have his memories because I ate his brain."
131299,506,65,324000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Mr. Burns, you have to give this man something."
131300,506,66,325000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,He could sue us for all we've got.
131301,506,67,329000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Fine. Eight weeks off... with pay.
131303,506,69,332000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That's a good thing!
131304,506,70,334000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,But you said it so mean!
131306,506,72,339000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Eight weeks paid vacation, and all because of a little bump on the noggin."
131307,506,73,347000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Marge, here's something that'll make you happy!"
131308,506,74,350000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Not in the mood.
131309,506,75,351000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, this is really good. I..."
131310,506,76,352000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Nelson took my lunch money again!
131311,506,77,355000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, listen, Lisa--"
131313,506,78,355000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hold that thought. I'm tuning my saxophone. Sharp. Flat. Sharp.
131314,506,79,361000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,No one will tell me if I'm a ghost or not!
131315,506,80,361000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I just got..."
131316,506,81,375000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Got what, Homer?"
131317,506,82,376000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... I got... Shelbyville radio in my car for a few minutes.
131318,506,83,382000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I'm a single mother trying to raise a family here."
131319,506,84,386000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But you're not...
131320,506,85,386000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Just zip it!
131321,506,86,393000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I have eight weeks paid vacation, and my family doesn't know."
131322,506,87,396000,Homer's Reflection,Simpson Home,Woo hoo!
131323,506,88,402000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, I'm off to work!"
131325,506,90,405000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You know... maybe I should call in sick. We could visit all our old romantic haunts that have closed and turned into temporary Halloween stores.
131326,506,91,414000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I have to take Maggie for her checkup. And a guy's coming to see what the smell is under the house.
131327,506,92,419000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I get it. You need your Marge time. Well, I'm off to work."
131329,506,94,432000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"My feet hurt, and my neck is cold."
131331,506,96,436000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Children, I didn't get much sleep last night, because I was up late again, lamenting the choices I've made."
131332,506,97,443000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw haw. You can't change the past.
131333,506,98,446000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Just for that, you can go to the principal's office, while the rest of the class enjoys a... movie day!"
131335,506,100,455000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,"Krustyburger: Every day thousands of people wolf down his ""kwazy cuisine"" thinking they're getting the nutrients a human being needs to live. But for thirty days, this reporter ate nothing but this joker's deck of carbs."
131336,506,101,472000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,And I say:
131337,506,102,472000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,Do You Want Lies With That?
131338,506,103,484000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Elementary School,Oh great. Another documentary making me look like a scuzzbag. What is it this time? That the town I sponsor in Africa doesn't exist? Prove it! Film all of Africa!
131340,506,106,496000,Declan Desmond,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Day twelve: I've gained twenty pounds. As for my cholesterol...
131341,506,107,501000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,It's bad! You can just scrape it right off.
131342,506,108,506000,Declan Desmond,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"But still I soldier on with my ""Laffy Meal."""
131343,506,109,506000,Krusty the Clown,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Hey! This is all above-board!
131346,506,112,522000,Declan Desmond,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"One month of eating Krustyburger and nothing else has transformed me into a morbidly obese, toilet-busting American. If I don't have some kind of nugget every five minutes I'll die."
131347,506,113,540000,Declan Desmond,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,So weak... I can't even fill out this application for documentary film Oscar.
131348,506,114,542000,Declan Desmond,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,But it'll be worth it if my suffering teaches Krusty the value of proper nutrition.
131349,506,115,557000,Krusty the Clown,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,You're gonna be my breakfast English sausage.
131350,506,116,571000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Hmmm.
131353,506,119,577000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Man, when you're not at work, you see so many beautiful things."
131357,506,123,599000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"...and now because it's afternoon, I can go to Moe's without having a ""drinking problem."""
131359,506,125,599000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, Homer. I could hear your pathetic rationalizing through the door."
131360,506,126,613000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, why can't I hang out at the bar all day? My wife doesn't wanna be with me."
131361,506,127,617000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Look, I'd love to discuss your problems but a pack of raccoons took over my back room and today's the day I make my stand."
131363,506,129,625000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,There's more than I thought!
131365,506,131,636000,Homer Simpson,Caribbean Beach,I wish I could pull down my zipper and that guy would come out.
131366,506,132,640000,CAIN,Caribbean Beach,"Stranger things have happened, Homer."
131367,506,133,643000,Homer Simpson,Caribbean Beach,Stradivarius Cain!
131368,506,134,645000,Homer Simpson,Caribbean Beach,What the? Am I losing my marbles?
131369,506,135,649000,CAIN,Caribbean Beach,"No, I'm just an illusion caused by the concussion you suffered at the plant."
131166,506,136,652000,Homer Simpson,Caribbean Beach,Can I put my hand through you?
131283,506,137,655000,CAIN,Caribbean Beach,If you want.
131370,506,138,656000,CAIN,Caribbean Beach,C'mon! Really? Show a little class.
131371,506,139,660000,Homer Simpson,Caribbean Beach,Sorry.
131372,506,140,661000,CAIN,Caribbean Beach,Now I'm about to undertake my toughest mission ever: to make you into a man your wife can't resist.
131373,506,141,672000,Homer Simpson,Caribbean Beach,What the? No one can see you.
131374,506,142,673000,CAIN,Caribbean Beach,Other people's imaginary friends can see me.
131375,506,143,678000,Hufnpuffalus,Caribbean Beach,"Hel-lo, Doctor Cain."
131376,506,144,680000,CAIN,Caribbean Beach,"Hello, Hufnpuffalus."
131377,506,145,682000,Hufnpuffalus,Caribbean Beach,Sorry I slept with your girlfriend.
131378,506,146,686000,CAIN,Caribbean Beach,"You did me a favor, man."
131380,506,148,690000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Lunch money, lunch money, lunch money... hey, Lis."
131381,506,149,694000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Nelson, don't you want my lunch money?"
131382,506,150,696000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Nah. Chicks wind up gettin' all your money anyway.
131383,506,151,699000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"That's sexist, but thank you."
131384,506,152,701000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Now I gotta go liberate some cash from your brother.
131385,506,153,704000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, if you must... see if you can find out where my dolls are."
131386,506,154,708000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,You might not like the answer.
131387,506,155,709000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I just want closure.
131388,506,156,712000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Simpson, you know why I'm here."
131389,506,157,714000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Nelson, I could give you my lunch money... or, I could give you..."
131390,506,158,720000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Lunch? Actual lunch?! Look at all them burgers and fries. I didn't know they served these things warm. They feel like a baby's head.
131391,506,159,731000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I just thank God you didn't take my coupons. Got enough for a month.
131392,506,160,736000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Free hamburger?!
131393,506,161,739000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No, you give them the coupon and they give you the hamburger."
131394,506,162,742000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I knew that.
131398,506,166,752000,CAIN,Car,"I must say, whoever installed your car's secret weapons did a great job hiding them."
131399,506,167,758000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Yeah, Dr. Cain, the thing about that is... there aren't any weapons."
131400,506,168,764000,CAIN,Car,"What?! Well, does your car at least turn into something else?"
131401,506,169,767000,Homer Simpson,Car,Sometimes Marge says I turn it into a trashcan.
131402,506,170,773000,CAIN,Car,"Homer, you are going to clean up this car, put on cologne, and become a sparkling conversationalist."
131403,506,171,778000,Homer Simpson,Car,Sounds like you're turning into wife number two.
131404,506,172,780000,CAIN,Car,I can do that.
131405,506,173,782000,CAIN,Car,"So, stick with Marge!"
131407,506,175,786000,Chief Wiggum,Car,"Whoa, what's goin' on there, Lou?"
131408,506,176,788000,Lou,Car,"Well, if you ask me, Chief..."
131409,506,177,791000,Chief Wiggum,Car,"Alright, what does this mean?"
131411,506,179,794000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,Childhood obesity! It's not funny anymore! Breakfast cereals where the surprise inside is diabetes...and soda cups the size of hot tubs...have made every state Mississippi fat.
131412,506,180,809000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's Nelson!
131413,506,181,811000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, you're imagining things."
131414,506,182,814000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,What else you got?
131415,506,183,816000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Simpson Home,Just bubbling oil.
131416,506,184,818000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Stand back and give me a straw!
131418,506,186,822000,CAIN,Bar,"Now, the ultimate test: I want you to convince that woman to give herself to you body and soul."
131419,506,187,832000,Homer Simpson,Bar,But I'm a married man.
131420,506,188,834000,CAIN,Bar,"Yeah. I know a married man is never attracted to a beautiful woman he doesn't even know, but this will give you the confidence you need with Marge."
131421,506,189,842000,Homer Simpson,Bar,"Okay, I'll make a stranger love me forever."
131422,506,190,846000,CAIN,Bar,"And Homer, remember: it doesn't matter what you say, as long as you say it with confidence."
131423,506,191,852000,Homer Simpson,Bar,My dear... did you just fall from heaven? 'Cause your hair looks really messed up.
131424,506,192,860000,CAIN,Bar,"Okay, it matters a little what you say. Moving on..."
131425,506,193,863000,Homer Simpson,Bar,You know what wood makes the best ventriloquist dummy: maple. How many hardboiled eggs do you think I can eat?
131426,506,194,873000,CAIN,Bar,"Look, just say this"
131427,506,195,879000,Homer Simpson,Bar,"When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky. But that blue was nothing compared to the blue of your eyes."
131428,506,196,891000,Beautiful Woman,Bar,I am a sucker for articulate fatsos.
131429,506,197,897000,Drug Lord,Bar,What is this? I leave for two seconds to get chocolate martinis and my wife is expertly seduced by this pork empanada!
130303,506,198,905000,Homer Simpson,Bar,What do I do?
131430,506,199,907000,CAIN,Bar,Squirt that lemon in his eye.
131431,506,200,909000,Drug Lord,Bar,You think a lemon will stop me?!
131432,506,201,913000,Drug Lord,Bar,A lime! Noooo!
131434,506,203,924000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Marge, what brings you to the S.N.P.P.?"
131435,506,204,926000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Homie's been working so hard I thought I'd bring him a special lunch.
131436,506,205,930000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Marge, you're a blue angel. And I'm not talkin' about those pilots that hot dog in an air show while the real men are in combat. But I gotta ask: where's Homer working?"
131437,506,206,938000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Here, right?"
131438,506,207,940000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Not since Burns gave him that time off. What is this? Week six?
131439,506,208,942000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What?! I knew there was a reason he was leaving on time!
131440,506,209,952000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What'd you say to her?
131441,506,210,954000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I don't know. I thought I was making small talk. But it turned out to be big talk.
131450,506,219,968000,Lisa Simpson,Krusty's Mansion,Krusty! This once-vibrant young bully won't even live to pick on kids in junior high! Because he's been eating nothing but your food!
131451,506,220,976000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,Atta boy!
131452,506,221,979000,Nelson Muntz,Krusty's Mansion,"Got any fries, man? I just need a couple."
131453,506,222,982000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,Not my responsibility. He didn't have to order that crap. We've got yogurt and salad on the menu!
131454,506,223,988000,Lisa Simpson,Krusty's Mansion,Do you actually serve those items?
131455,506,224,991000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,No.
