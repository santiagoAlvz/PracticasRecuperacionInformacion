8855,62,51,304000,Marty,Simpson Home,"Of course, Johnny's next record was a spoken-word album of his right-wing political views, that kinda killed his career. If you can tell me the name of that album, call our contest line - now!"

8880,62,76,383000,Boring Guy,Simpson Living Room,"Let's define our terms, gentleman. Are we talking about redistricting, or are we talking about reapportionment? Because the two are by no means the same."
8881,62,77,387000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, well... can't win 'em all."
8882,62,78,389000,Announcer,Simpson Living Room,We interrupt this public affairs program to bring you a football game.

8891,62,87,412000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Nothing.
8893,62,89,414000,Commentator,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, doctor. A 98-yard triple reverse ties the score at 63-63! We have seen nothing but razzle-dazzle here today. Three visits from Morganna The Kissing Bandit... and the astonishing return of Jim Brown..."
8894,62,90,426000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Woo-hoo!
8895,62,91,428000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Is that what I think it is?

8900,62,96,454000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Ah, my beloved family. How was church?"
8902,62,98,461000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"I, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life. And I owe it all to skipping church!"
8903,62,99,466000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"That's a terrible thing to say. Kids, your father doesn't really mean that."
8904,62,100,470000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Like fun I don't. Marge, I'm never going to church again."
8905,62,101,474000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Homer! Are you actually giving up your faith?

8909,62,105,491000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isn't God everywhere?"
8910,62,106,496000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Amen, brother."
8911,62,107,497000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And don't you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?
8912,62,108,504000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tell it, daddy!"
8913,62,109,504000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And what if we picked the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder.
8914,62,110,509000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Testify!
8916,62,112,514000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he's a kind, decent man. Please show him the error of his ways."
8917,62,113,521000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, come to bed."
8918,62,114,523000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Homer. He doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, Lord. He just likes to sleep in on Sundays..."
8919,62,115,531000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Maarge... come to bed Marge...
8920,62,116,539000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's good for what ails ya...
8921,62,117,544000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I can wait all --
8922,62,118,569000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,God?
8923,62,119,570000,God,Simpson Home,THOU HAST FORSAKEN MY CHURCH!
8924,62,120,573000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... kind of... but...
8925,62,121,576000,God,Simpson Home,BUT WHAT?
8927,62,122,577000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm not a bad guy. I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?
8928,62,123,585000,God,Simpson Home,"Hmm, you've got a point there."
8929,62,124,589000,God,Simpson Home,"You know, sometimes even I'd rather be watching football. Does St. Louis still have a team?"
8930,62,125,596000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No. They moved to Phoenix.
8931,62,126,597000,God,Simpson Home,Oh yeah.
8932,62,127,598000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons.
8933,62,128,604000,God,Simpson Home,I couldn't agree more. That Reverend Lovejoy really displeases me. I think I'll give him a canker sore.
8934,62,129,611000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Give him one for me.
8935,62,130,612000,God,Simpson Home,I will.
8936,62,131,613000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So I figure I should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way."
8937,62,132,619000,God,Simpson Home,"Homer, it's a deal. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to appear on a tortilla in Mexico."
8938,62,133,634000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, can I ask you a question?"
8939,62,134,636000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure, honey."
8940,62,135,637000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?
8941,62,136,640000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Sweetheart. If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed."
8942,62,137,644000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, my animal friends. Peace be with you."
8943,62,138,651000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Guys, please, could you give me five minutes?"
8944,62,139,653000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Reverend Lovejoy, I had a bit of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner."
8945,62,140,658000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,What?!
8946,62,141,659000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, it's nothing bad. I'm just concerned, because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately."
8947,62,142,665000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing. But then God Himself told me I should seek a new path."
8948,62,143,671000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"Oh, really?"
8949,62,144,672000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and I knew that was special 'cause I usually dream about naked... Marge."
8951,62,146,679000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, Homer, you saw the Big Cheese? What'd he look like?"
8952,62,147,683000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Perfect teeth - nice smell - a class act all the way.
8953,62,148,686000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you're crazy. Tell him this is all crazy."
8954,62,149,690000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"Homer, I'd like you to remember Matthew 7:26 -- ""The foolish man, who built his house on sand."""
8926,62,150,697000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And YOU remember... Matthew... 21:17.
8955,62,151,703000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"""And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there""?"
8956,62,152,708000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah... think about it.
8958,62,154,712000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hello, work? This is Homer Simpson. I won't be coming in tomorrow -- Religious holiday... The uh, Feast of... Maximum Occupancy."
8959,62,155,721000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Pretty slick.
8960,62,156,723000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, you should join my religion, Moe. It's great. No Hell... no kneeling...."
8961,62,157,727000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Sorry, Homer. I was born a Snake-Handler and I'll die a Snake-Handler."
8963,62,159,734000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Neighbor, I heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock."
8964,62,160,740000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No sale.
8965,62,161,741000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Homer, Christian life isn't all praying and sacrifice. Hey, dig this."
8966,62,162,746000,Flanders Family,Simpson Home,"GOD SAID TO NOAH THERE'S GONNA BE A FLOODY, FLOODY --"

8975,62,171,803000,Sailor,Street,Garbage Island.
8977,62,173,845000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Let's go, kids."
8978,62,174,846000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,How come we have to go to church and Dad gets to stay home and watch cartoons?
8979,62,175,852000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change, I'll have to tell them their father is... well, wicked."
8980,62,176,860000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, let me tell you about another so-called wicked guy. He had long hair and some ""wild"" ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right. And that man's name was... I forget. But the point is... uh, I forget that too. Marge, you know who I'm talking about -- he used to drive that blue car --"
8981,62,177,883000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, could you wait outside for us?"
8982,62,178,886000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, please. Don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win."
8983,62,179,892000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,There you go again. Always taking someone else's side. Flanders... the water department... God...
8984,62,180,899000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm only going to ask you one last time. Are you sure you won't come with us to church?

8990,62,186,919000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"No, don't look for the pitchfork and pointy tail. Today's devil has assumed a more seductive form, pleasing to the eye."
8992,62,188,927000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh! An interview with Lorne Michaels... wait, that's no good. Hey, now we're talkin'. ""Our Unabashed Dictionary defines IUD as 'Love Springs Internal'."" I don't get it."

9004,62,200,987000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Please do not offer my god a peanut.
