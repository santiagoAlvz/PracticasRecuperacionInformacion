22256,110,1,42000,Lisa Simpson,NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYGROUND,"Remember Bart, I mean, ""Dances in Underwear,"" we take the white man alive."
22257,110,2,48000,Bart Simpson,NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYGROUND,"All right, ""Thinks Too Much,"" it shall be so."
22258,110,3,53000,Milhouse Van Houten,NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYGROUND,Keep your eyes peeled for Injuns... I mean Native Americans. They're after us because we gave them those blankets infected with cooties.
22259,110,4,60000,Ralph Wiggum,NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYGROUND,I ate all my caps.
22261,110,6,63000,Bart Simpson,NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYGROUND,"Throw down your weapons and kiss the prairie, cowdorks."
22262,110,7,67000,Milhouse Van Houten,NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYGROUND,Why do we have to play this corny old game anyway? I brought my jacks.
22263,110,8,74000,Milhouse Van Houten,NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYGROUND,I got twosies!
22264,110,9,80000,Bart Simpson,NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYGROUND,"That's not fair, Nelson. They didn't have the Killmatic 3,000 back then."
22265,110,10,85000,Nelson Muntz,NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYGROUND,"Hey, records from that era are spotty at best."
22267,110,12,93000,Marge Simpson,NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYGROUND,Bart! Lisa! Time for church.
22269,110,13,96000,Luann Van Houten,NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYGROUND,"Milhouse, time for church."
22270,110,14,99000,Jewish Man,NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYGROUND,"Shlomo, time for your violin lesson."
22272,110,16,117000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Why the crap do we have to go to church, anyway?"
22273,110,17,121000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"You just answered your own question with that commode mouth. Besides, you kids need to learn morals and decency, and how to love your fellow man."
22275,110,19,129000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,And with flaming swords the Aramites did pierce the eyes of their fellow men and did feast on what flowed forth. Among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lust of or flesh...
22276,110,20,142000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I'M A TROLL MAN / DA DA DA DA DA DA DA/ I'M A TROLL MAN...
22277,110,21,147000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"I don't want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair. Awful, awful hair."
22279,110,23,161000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"And now my daughter Jessica, who has just returned from boarding school, will read the same passage I just read. I noticed a few of you weren't paying attention."
22281,110,25,178000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Wow, there is a God."
22283,110,27,184000,Engineer,SEASHORE,"I'm tellin' you, the light would work better if it pointed out to sea."
22284,110,28,189000,Captain Horatio McCallister,SEASHORE,"Arrr! Shut up, I know what I'm doin'."
22285,110,29,193000,Captain Horatio McCallister,SEASHORE,I hate the sea and everything in it!
22287,110,31,198000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Bye, b-bye, b-bye... Thank you for choosing our church... B-Bye..."
22288,110,32,202000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I've never felt this way about a girl before. My long search is finally over.
22289,110,33,214000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Hi. I'm Bart Simpson. I was incredibly moved by your reading. I don't think God's words have ever sounded so plausible.
22290,110,34,222000,Jessica,First Church of Springfield,"Thanks, Art. Um, I have to go over here now."
22293,110,37,231000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Don't be so hard on yourself, Bart. It's not your fault Jessica doesn't like you."
22294,110,38,236000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Is it my hair? My overbite? The fact that I've worn the same clothes, day in, day out, for the last four years?"
22296,110,39,242000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"No, Bart. I just think you and Jessica are too different from each other to get along. She's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter and you're the devil's cabana boy."
22298,110,41,255000,Teacher,Sunday School,"Good... very good... Ralph, Jesus did not have wheels."
22299,110,42,263000,Teacher,Sunday School,Bart Simpson?
22300,110,43,264000,Bart Simpson,Sunday School,"Yes Ma'am. I'd like to return to your wonderful Sunday school, please."
22301,110,44,268000,Teacher,Sunday School,"But Bart, we banned you from Sunday school. You were happy, we were happy, everybody was happy, particularly the hamster."
22302,110,45,279000,Bart Simpson,Sunday School,"I've changed my ways. Please give me another chance, ma'am."
22303,110,46,284000,Teacher,Sunday School,"All right, Bart, the Bible does teach forgiveness... Class, I want you to welcome back our prodigal son."
22304,110,47,292000,Class,Sunday School,Prodigal wha? / Who? / Huh? / What's prodigal mean?
22305,110,48,294000,Teacher,Sunday School,Oh dear.
22306,110,49,295000,Bart Simpson,Sunday School,"You know, the great thing about Sunday school is we're finally learning something we can use."
22307,110,50,301000,Jessica,Sunday School,"Yeah, so true. I have to turn my chair this way now."
22308,110,51,307000,Bart Simpson,Sunday School,"Somehow I gotta convince her I'm a good person. All right, I have to sit here and behave no matter what."
22309,110,52,315000,Teacher,Sunday School,"Okay, class. We have a special treat today for pass-around -- a replica of the slingshot David used to slay Goliath... While you kids are looking at that, I'll just busy myself in this file cabinet."
22310,110,53,332000,Bart Simpson,Sunday School,Must... fight... Satan. Make it... up to him... later.
22311,110,54,343000,Bart Simpson,Sunday School,You know I was considering staying after school and helping teacher clean up.
22312,110,55,349000,Jessica,Sunday School,Do you ever think anything you don't say?
22313,110,56,355000,Bart Simpson,Sunday School,There is just no pleasing a girl like that. All that unnecessary behaving... I'm all tensed through the chestal area. I need relief.
22314,110,57,373000,Groundskeeper Willie,Sunday School,Now that kilt was only for day-to-day wear. In battle we donned a full length ball gown covered in sequins. The idea was to blind your opponent with luxury.
22315,110,58,387000,Groundskeeper Willie,Sunday School,"Ah, 'tis no more than what God gave me, you Puritan pukes!"
22316,110,59,393000,Bart Simpson,Sunday School,That'll hold me. At least 'til I get my hands on some kind of explosives.
22319,110,61,405000,Seymour Skinner,Sunday School,"Congratulations, Simpson. You just fell for our sting and won yourself three months detention. There's no such thing as Scotchtoberfest."
22320,110,62,415000,Groundskeeper Willie,Sunday School,There's not? You used me Skinner! You used me!
22321,110,63,419000,Bart Simpson,Sunday School,Three months .
22322,110,64,423000,Jessica,Sunday School,"Hi, Bart. I saw the way they set you up. That was really unfair."
22324,110,66,430000,Jessica,Sunday School,Wanna have dinner at my house tonight?
22325,110,67,433000,Bart Simpson,Sunday School,"Really? Uh, sure."
22326,110,68,437000,Jessica,Sunday School,Great. We eat at seven.
22327,110,69,441000,Bart Simpson,Sunday School,There's only one thing to do at a moment like this... strut.
22329,110,71,460000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I can't believe my little boy is already going on his first date. SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET / CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON / YES, WE HAVE NO BANANAS!"
22330,110,72,478000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh that's sweet, Homer. Our son is growing up, isn't he?"
22331,110,73,482000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, it's not that. Didn't you hear? They have no bananas. They have no bananas today."
22333,110,75,494000,Helen Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"So Bart, how's school going? Jessica always gets straight A's."
22334,110,76,498000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Well, in my family, grades aren't that important. It's what you learn that counts."
22335,110,77,503000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Six times five, what is it?"
22336,110,78,505000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Um, actually, numbers don't have much use in my future career. Olympic gold medal rocket sled champ."
22337,110,79,511000,Helen Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Hm, I didn't know the rocket sled was an Olympic event."
22338,110,80,513000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Well no offense, lady, but what you don't know could fill a warehouse."
22339,110,81,517000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Young man, explain yourself."
22340,110,82,519000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Sorry, I have kind of a short fuse, which some find charming. Speaking of charming, watching Fox last night, I heard a rather amusing story... This character named Martin was feeling rather randy and he was heard to remark..."
22341,110,83,534000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"And don't you ever come near my daughter again! Never have I heard such gratuitous use of the word ""butt""."
22342,110,84,541000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but..."
22343,110,85,544000,Helen Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,Make him stop! Make him stop!
22295,110,86,552000,Jessica,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"You're bad, Bart Simpson."
22318,110,87,555000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,No I'm not. I'm really...
22345,110,88,557000,Jessica,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Yes you are. You're bad, and I like it."
22346,110,89,560000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"I'm bad to the bone, honey."
22347,110,90,562000,Jessica,LOVEJOY HOUSE,Let's go find some fun.
22348,110,91,563000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,But your father said...
22349,110,92,564000,Jessica,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Oh, I told the ""Rev"" I was going to my room to say my prayers."
22350,110,93,568000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Smart, beautiful, and a liar! So much better than that Sarah, plain and tall."
22352,110,95,593000,Bart Simpson,Street,"Right there, put it right there. Oh, excellent. You're incredible, Jessica. Your throws, your catches, your spirals, your loops, it's like the toilet paper is an extension of your body."
22354,110,97,607000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Yard,No way would a minister's daughter go out with you.
22355,110,98,612000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,Oh yeah? I'll prove it.
22356,110,99,614000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"Hey, Jessica."
22357,110,100,616000,Jessica,Springfield Elementary School Yard,Yes? Am I supposed to know you?
22358,110,101,618000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,Jessica we just...
22359,110,102,620000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School Yard,That's for besmirching an innocent girl's name!
22360,110,103,625000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,Why?
22361,110,104,627000,Jessica,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"I'm sorry, Bart -- you know my parents can't find out about us. And besides, if it's secret, it's even more exciting."
22362,110,105,637000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,I guess.
22363,110,106,638000,Jessica,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"Hey, you want to go skateboarding?"
22364,110,107,640000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"Um, actually, I was hoping I could sit down for just a second."
22365,110,108,644000,Jessica,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"Come on, it'll be fun."
22366,110,109,649000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,Wow. Now I have the energy to do anything!
22367,110,110,654000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,Just give me two minutes.
22370,110,113,660000,Bart Simpson,WINDY HILLTOP,"Jessica, I think this is too steep."
22371,110,114,662000,Jessica,WINDY HILLTOP,"Bart, you can't trust your perception at this altitude."
22372,110,115,671000,Bart Simpson,WINDY HILLTOP,"Actually, if the road surface maintains its integrity, I just might be able to hold on."
22375,110,118,693000,Bart Simpson,WINDY HILLTOP,"Oh, the glue will slow me down."
22376,110,119,696000,Trucker #1,WINDY HILLTOP,Any glue leaking?
22377,110,120,697000,Trucker #2,WINDY HILLTOP,No. That glue ain't goin' nowhere.
22378,110,121,699000,Bart Simpson,WINDY HILLTOP,Nothin's ever gonna stop me.
22379,110,122,710000,Trucker #1,WINDY HILLTOP,"Ah, no. There goes the glue, after all!"
22380,110,123,715000,Bart Simpson,WINDY HILLTOP,Nooooo!
22381,110,124,721000,Jessica,WINDY HILLTOP,"Fun, huh?"
22384,110,127,731000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Have you noticed any change in Bart?
22385,110,128,734000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,New glasses?
22386,110,129,735000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No. He looks like something might be disturbing him.
22387,110,130,738000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Probably misses his old glasses.
22388,110,131,740000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess we could get more involved in Bart's activities. But then I'd be afraid of smothering him.
22389,110,132,746000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, and then we'd get the chair."
22390,110,133,748000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's not what I meant.
22391,110,134,749000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It was, Marge. Admit it."
22393,110,136,754000,Jessica,Springfield Elementary School,Hi.
22394,110,137,755000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, we should get to class."
22395,110,138,757000,Jessica,Springfield Elementary School,What's the hurry?
22396,110,139,758000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,We could get in trouble for being late.
22397,110,140,760000,Jessica,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, you worry too much. Now come on, if you stay here awhile, I'll let you hold my hand."
22398,110,141,772000,Jessica,Springfield Elementary School,Team work! C'mon Bart!
22399,110,142,780000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"If I don't sae the wee turtles, who will?!"
22400,110,143,786000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Agh! Save me from the wee turtles! They were too quick for me! Aah!
22402,110,145,791000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I can't believe it, Bart. I'd always thought Jessica was so sweet."
22403,110,146,795000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"She's like a Milk Dud, Lis. Sweet on the outside, poison on the inside."
22404,110,147,800000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You gotta give her up.
22405,110,148,802000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no, wait. Hear my plan. I put up with her for seven more years. Then, we'll get married. Once the first baby comes along, she's bound to settle down and start treatin' me right. After all, I deserve it."
22406,110,149,813000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, it's naive to think you can change a person. Except maybe that boy who works in the library."
22407,110,150,820000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,Do you have Go Dog Go?
22408,110,151,823000,Library Boy,Simpson Home,That's in juvenile. This is young adult.
22409,110,152,826000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Well read and just a little wild. If only someone could tame him.
22410,110,153,833000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're right, Lisa -- love isn't about fixing someone. I'm just going to give her up cold turkey. I'm not gonna talk to her or see her. It's over. Thanks for the advice, sis."
22412,110,155,855000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"There. If I can just get through this many days without seeing her, she should be completely out of my system. Okay, day one."
22413,110,156,868000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Time for church, Bart. I bet your little friend Jessica will be there."
22416,110,159,878000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Jessica...
22417,110,160,880000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Bart, be strong. You don't need that little hell cat."
22418,110,161,885000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Oh Lis, she's already drawing me to her with her beautiful siren song."
22419,110,162,898000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,That's very disturbing.
22420,110,163,902000,Jessica,First Church of Springfield,"Hey, Bart. What? What's wrong?"
22421,110,164,905000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Well, Jessica, I don't think we should hang out together anymore. You're turning me into a criminal when all I want to be is a petty thug."
22422,110,165,915000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Oh good, here comes the collection plate."
22423,110,166,928000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Thirty cents off Shake 'n Bake. Homer!
22424,110,167,929000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"We can spare it, Marge. We've been blessed."
22425,110,168,932000,Jessica,First Church of Springfield,"You're right about everything, Bart. I have been too reckless. From now on I am going to settle down."
22426,110,169,945000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Jessica, what are you doing!"
22427,110,170,947000,Jessica,First Church of Springfield,It takes money to start a new life.
22428,110,171,950000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,But stealing from the collection basket is really wrong. Even I know that.
22429,110,172,954000,Jessica,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, fine. You just lost your cut."
22430,110,173,958000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"I'll just take that . Everyone, turn around and look at this!"
22431,110,174,965000,Grampa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"What is it, a Unitarian?"
22432,110,175,970000,Various Congregation Members,First Church of Springfield,The collection money is gone! / That awful boy must have stolen it!
148672,110,176,970000,Bart's Thoughts,First Church of Springfield,Now just relax. For once you didn't do anything wrong. Just explain yourself and everyone will understand.
22433,110,177,975000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I...
22434,110,178,977000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Took the money. Yes, we know."
22435,110,179,978000,Moe Szyslak,First Church of Springfield,He confessed!
22344,110,180,979000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,O-kay.
22436,110,181,983000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Stop him! He's headed for the window!
22438,110,183,989000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didn't take the collection money, that's all I need."
22439,110,184,995000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't take it.
22440,110,185,996000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little... How can you look me in the eye and lie like that?!
22441,110,186,1000000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, stop that. I believe him."
22442,110,187,1002000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?"
22443,110,188,1007000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's what he wore to church.
22444,110,189,1009000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, how convenient."
22445,110,190,1010000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart honey, do you know who did take the money?"
22446,110,191,1016000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
22447,110,192,1017000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"See, son? Telling the truth isn't so bad."
22449,110,194,1027000,Car,Springfield,Crook!
22450,110,195,1027000,Car,Springfield,Thief!
22451,110,196,1028000,Car #3,Springfield,Stealer of money from the church collection plate!
22453,110,198,1034000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,We've gotta talk.
22454,110,199,1035000,Jessica,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Listen, thanks for not turning me in. That was sweet."
22455,110,200,1039000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Well, it seems like if you really care for me, you should come forward."
22456,110,201,1042000,Jessica,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Oh, don't you see? It's because I care for you that I can't come forward."
22457,110,202,1047000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,That doesn't make any sense.
22458,110,203,1049000,Jessica,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"All right, then I just don't feel like it, okay?"
22459,110,204,1051000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Jessica, you're really beautiful, but you are not very nice."
22460,110,205,1055000,Jessica,LOVEJOY HOUSE,Duh.
22461,110,206,1056000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"You know, with the way you're treating me, why should I protect you?"
22462,110,207,1059000,Jessica,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Because if you tell, no one will believe you. Remember, I'm the sweet, perfect minister's daughter and you're just yellow trash."
22463,110,208,1068000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,Huh?
22465,110,210,1073000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,So here's where you're hiding.
22466,110,211,1075000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Yeah. This is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of the townspeople.
22467,110,212,1080000,Jasper Beardly,Bart's Treehouse,Thief.
22468,110,213,1082000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Bart, we can't just let her get away with this."
22470,110,214,1085000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Give it up, Lis. She's a criminal mastermind. She's got a 108 IQ, she reads at a fifth grade level, and her hair smells like red Fruit Loops."
22471,110,215,1096000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Yeah, well I eat Fruit Loops for breakfast."
22473,110,217,1100000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Because of last week's problems, we'll be taking certain precautions with this week's collection."
22474,110,218,1106000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,We really shouldn't have let them do this. It can't be helping his self esteem.
22475,110,219,1110000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Now, for our offertory reading, Lisa Simpson, who we'll all be keeping an eye on."
22476,110,220,1116000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"I know most of you have already judged my brother guilty without any proof. But doesn't the Bible teach us ""Judge not lest ye be judged,"" Reverend?"
22477,110,221,1126000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,I think it might be somewhere towards the back.
22478,110,222,1130000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"There is someone among us with a guilty conscience. After much soul searching I decided it would be wrong of me to name names, but I urge that guilty person here, under the eyes of God, to come forward to confess and save yourself from the torment of your own personal hell."
22479,110,223,1149000,Seymour Skinner,First Church of Springfield,I smelled some marijuana smoke in Vietnam.
22480,110,224,1151000,Grampa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"I was the one that canceled ""Star Trek""."
22481,110,225,1154000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,First Church of Springfield,I left my Porsche keys inside Mrs. Glick.
22482,110,226,1157000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,I am talking to the collection money thief. Only you can come forward and end this injustice.
22483,110,227,1167000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, what the heck, it was Jessica Lovejoy."
22485,110,229,1172000,Lisa Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"If you search her room, I am certain you will find the money."
22486,110,230,1177000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,To the little girl's room!
22488,110,232,1181000,Seymour Skinner,LOVEJOY HOUSE,That's the collection money!
22489,110,233,1183000,Moe Szyslak,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Ah, yeah, it smells like church."
22490,110,234,1185000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,I guess it's obvious what's happened here. Bart Simpson has somehow managed to sneak his bedroom into my house.
22491,110,235,1195000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,Well come on! Use your imaginations.
22492,110,236,1197000,Jessica,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"No, Dad, I did it. It's your classic cry for attention."
22494,110,237,1205000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Well, young lady, I suppose we brought you home from boarding school a little prematurely."
22495,110,238,1210000,Jessica,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"I was expelled, Dad. Remember the pipe bomb? The glee club brawl? Remember the school chapel collection plate? The exploding toilets ring a bell? Come on dad, pay attention to me. Hello in there... hello?"
22496,110,239,1221000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,LOVEJOY HOUSE,BRINGING IN THE SHEAVES... BRINGING IN THE SHEAVES
22497,110,240,1224000,Marge Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,"Uh, I think you all owe my son an apology."
22498,110,241,1228000,Bart Simpson,LOVEJOY HOUSE,That's okay. 'Preciate it... Mm Hmm.
22500,110,243,1236000,Bart Simpson,Street,"Hi, Jessica."
22501,110,244,1237000,Jessica,Street,"Hi Bart, come to watch me suffer?"
22502,110,245,1240000,Bart Simpson,Street,"I just wanted to let you know that even though this was a difficult experience, I really learned a lot... I'm a little wiser and a little less naïve."
22503,110,246,1250000,Jessica,Street,"Well, I learned that I can make men do whatever I want."
22504,110,247,1255000,Bart Simpson,Street,"Well, don't you see, Jessica, then you really haven't learned --"
22505,110,248,1260000,Jessica,Street,"Um, would you finish scrubbing these steps for me?"
22506,110,249,1262000,Bart Simpson,Street,Will I!
22507,110,250,1266000,Library Boy,Street,"Hey, Jessica."
22508,110,251,1267000,Jessica,Street,Coming.
22509,110,252,1270000,Bart Simpson,Street,Poor sucker. It's amazing what some guys will do for a pretty face. Not me though. Wait'll she sees the second rate job I do on these stairs. .
