117156,453,1,28000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay kids, time to apply the final ""date night"" touch. Lisa, spray just a hint of perfume on my neck, Bart, you tell me this dress doesn't make me look fat. And... now!"
117157,453,2,40000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't look fat.
117158,453,3,41000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Thank you.
117161,453,6,43000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Homer, you don't look fat."
117162,453,7,46000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Carl, you're a liar, but I love it."
117163,453,8,50000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Date night: it's the embalming fluid that keeps the mummy of a marriage fresh after the heart and brain have been pulled out through the nose.
117164,453,9,57000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I never shoulda given you that Egyptology book.
117165,453,10,61000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Gentlemen, I'm afraid we've detected a small leak somewhere in the heavy water piping facility."
117166,453,11,66000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Don't leave until you find that leak!
117167,453,12,69000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, Mr. Burns, couldn't we patch the leak tomorrow? It's date night."
117168,453,13,73000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, indeed it is. Tonight I will be continuing my courtship of Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia."
117169,453,14,80000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Tonight's the night I pop the question: where's the Kaiser's gold? Now get to work on that leak!
117172,453,17,93000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"We now return to ""The Real Housewives of Shelbyville."""
117173,453,18,93000,Brassy Housewife,Simpson Home,"Angelo stood me up on date night, so I showed him: I had one of my boobs reduced."
117174,453,19,103000,2nd Brassy Housewife,Simpson Home,"You're one smart cookie, Rosemary. That left boob was too good for him."
117175,453,20,109000,2nd Brassy Housewife,Simpson Home,We're appalling!
117176,453,21,111000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry I missed dinner, honey. We still have time to catch a movie. That can be romantic."
117177,453,22,114000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Really? How romantic?
117178,453,23,118000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It'll make a walk on the beach seem like a punch in the face.
117181,453,26,127000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Aztec Theater,Did you call the furnace man?
117182,453,27,128000,Bernice Hibbert,Aztec Theater,You said you were gonna call him.
117183,453,28,128000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Aztec Theater,He's your cousin!
117185,453,30,131000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Aztec Theater,Well maybe we can just get through the winter without heat!
117186,453,31,131000,Bernice Hibbert,Aztec Theater,Guess I'll have to take care of this like I took care of your speeding tickets.
117187,453,32,131000,Marge Simpson,Aztec Theater,It's so noisy in here! I can't hear the ad telling everyone to be quiet!
117188,453,33,144000,Homer Simpson,Aztec Theater,"Hey, we came here to enjoy the movie and we're going to enjoy the movie."
117189,453,34,148000,Homer Simpson,Aztec Theater,We're outta here.
117192,453,37,150000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,This isn't fair! I want romance!
117193,453,38,152000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,How about bromance?
117194,453,39,154000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,It's not the same.
117195,453,40,155000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Dude...
117104,453,41,156000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,"I'm not a dude, I'm a hottie!"
117197,453,42,158000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,This bromance just got interesting.
117198,453,43,163000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,"Ooh, ice skating."
117199,453,44,165000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,A sport that encourages hand-holding.
117200,453,45,168000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Would you like to wear mittens or go commando?
117204,453,49,175000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,"Sorry, no skating tonight."
117205,453,50,181000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,"What, they come here on Saturday night to clean the ice? Losers."
117206,453,51,185000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,Actually...
117207,453,52,185000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,"...It's called ""curling."" Players slide the heavy stones toward the circle, or ""house..."""
117208,453,53,185000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,...as teammates control the direction and speed of the stone by sweeping in front of it with a special broom.
117209,453,54,194000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,"Marge, this is perfect for both of us! It's got bowling for me and sweeping for you!"
117210,453,55,199000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,Maybe you'd like to give it a try?
117211,453,56,205000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,"Let us curl, M'lady. Let us throw and sweep a'twain until the Heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! And afterwards there'll be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. And if, from now till the end of time, someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the seventeenth of November, we shall proclaim that WE WERE CURLING!"
117212,453,57,230000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,This is what you're like when you don't drink!
117213,453,58,258000,Agnes Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,Young woman! Where'd you learn to sweep like that?
117214,453,59,262000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,I've been training all my life. I once swept red wine off a white carpet.
117215,453,60,267000,Agnes Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,"I like your style, Blue. Wanna join our team?"
117216,453,61,270000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,If Homer can join with me.
117217,453,62,272000,Agnes Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,Fine. You two are off the team.
117218,453,63,274000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,"I see. Well, I guess we can return these bodysuits to the store."
117220,453,65,281000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So we'd just thrown a biter, and Homer said to kick harder off the hack. So I did... and I almost fouled the hog line!"
117222,453,67,290000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Exciting, exciting. I just have one question: is curling a real thing?"
117224,453,68,294000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah. Or is it just a cover story for a grownup thing we're not allowed to know about?
117225,453,69,298000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, like the time you said Dad was taking a weekend leadership seminar, when he was really stuck in a barrel at the junkyard?"
117226,453,70,304000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Curling is real.
117227,453,71,306000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The realest thing I've ever done.
117229,453,73,313000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Principal Skinner?! This is bogus, man. You know the rules: two letters and a conference before I get a home visit."
117230,453,74,320000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Living Room,"Bart, my cargo pants indicate that I'm not here on school business. I'm here on ""cool"" business, i.e. curling."
117231,453,75,325000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Hey, look who ""slid"" into our ""house."""
117232,453,76,329000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Great curling reference.
117233,453,77,331000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"What's up, Seymour?"
117234,453,78,332000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Living Room,"Astonishing news out of Eau Claire, Wisconsin: the Olympic Committee has announced that Mixed Curling will be a Demonstration Event at the Winter Olympics!"
117235,453,79,339000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,There's a Winter Olympics?
117237,453,81,351000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Homer, while you were imagining what the Winter Olympics were, Seymour said we were all going to the Olympic trials!"
117238,453,82,358000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Olympic trials, eh?"
117239,453,83,361000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,He usually stays out like this for about thirty seconds. Want some coffee?
117240,453,84,366000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Living Room,"Mmm, that'd be great."
117242,453,86,371000,Agnes Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,"Terrible, Seymour! You're a disgrace to frozen water!"
117243,453,87,376000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,You love your son. How can you be so hard on him?
117244,453,88,379000,Agnes Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ICE RINK,"Marge, love has nothing to do with winning. Believe me, I know..."
117246,453,90,385000,Agnes Skinner,Train Station,"I was in love with a soldier boy, on leave from Korea. It was a fifties-style romance, three minutes of sex and a lifetime of regret."
117247,453,91,398000,Agnes Skinner,Train Station,He went back to his war and I went back to my dream: pole vaulting in the Helsinki Olympics.
117248,453,92,404000,Agnes Skinner,Train Station,"But, there was a bump in the road..."
117249,453,93,407000,Agnes Skinner,Train Station,A bump named Seymour!
117251,453,94,410000,Agnes Skinner,Train Station,"The whole nine months, Seymour had just laid there like a lump. Then this pre-natal nitwit decides to do his Rockettes impression."
117254,453,97,422000,Agnes Skinner,Mrs. Skinner's Womb,"Before he was even born, he ruined my life."
117255,453,98,426000,Seymour Skinner,Mrs. Skinner's Womb,"Yes, that involuntary pre-conscious reflex I made in utero was unforgivable."
117256,453,99,432000,Agnes Skinner,Mrs. Skinner's Womb,"The point is, don't let your feelings get in the way of winning. They don't give out medals for being a loving wife."
117257,453,100,439000,Marge Simpson,Mrs. Skinner's Womb,"Well, they should."
117258,453,101,440000,Agnes Skinner,Mrs. Skinner's Womb,"Well, they don't!"
117263,453,106,456000,Moe Szyslak,Denver,"Oh, wise guys, eh?"
117265,453,108,461000,Homer Simpson,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,"Sweep! Sweep! Left, right! Left, right! Back-and-forth!"
117266,453,109,467000,Lisa Simpson,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,Excuse me? I think this fell off your hat.
117267,453,110,471000,Girl,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,"Oh, thanks. That's ""Chilbert."" One of the four Winter Games mascots."
117268,453,111,475000,Girl,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,Would you like it? I've got doubles.
117269,453,112,477000,Lisa Simpson,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,Thank you!
117270,453,113,479000,Girl,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,Just beware. Collecting Olympic pins can be kind of... addictive.
117271,453,114,483000,Lisa Simpson,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,Come on. They're just pins.
117272,453,115,489000,Lisa Simpson,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,But he does look lonely all by himself...
117273,453,116,494000,Olympic Pins,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,Buy us! Buy us with money!
117274,453,117,499000,Lisa Simpson,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,"One Labatty, please."
117275,453,118,504000,Pin Dealer,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,Looks like we hooked another one.
117276,453,119,507000,BALD MIDGET,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,Please let me go back to the cruise ship. I was Chief Purser.
117277,453,120,511000,Pin Dealer,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,"Never! Now get back in character, Monsieur Wee Wee."
117278,453,121,514000,BALD MIDGET,BROOMFIELD EVENT CENTER,Some day I'll be the tall guy.
117280,453,123,529000,Lisa Simpson,BROOMFIELD ICE ARENA,All Dad needs to do is put his stone inside that circle and they win.
117281,453,124,536000,Lisa Simpson,BROOMFIELD ICE ARENA,Oh my God! Dad threw too hard!
117282,453,125,544000,Seymour Skinner,BROOMFIELD ICE ARENA,"That stone is coming in like a rocket! It's gotta be going four, maybe five miles an hour!"
117250,453,126,550000,Seymour Skinner,BROOMFIELD ICE ARENA,Someone has to convert that kinetic energy back into potential!
117283,453,127,550000,Lisa Simpson,BROOMFIELD ICE ARENA,Yay!
117284,453,128,571000,Marge Simpson,BROOMFIELD ICE ARENA,Homie! We're going to Vancouver!
117285,453,129,574000,Homer Simpson,BROOMFIELD ICE ARENA,Pack your winter coat! We're going to Canada's warmest city!
117289,453,133,592000,Marge Simpson,Vancouver Street,"Homer, who's that?"
117290,453,134,593000,Homer Simpson,Vancouver Street,She used to be my therapist.
117292,453,136,609000,Homer Simpson,Vancouver Street,How can I ever thank you?
117293,453,137,611000,Medicine Woman,Vancouver Street,Pay your bill!
117294,453,138,612000,Homer Simpson,Vancouver Street,I couldn't hear the last thing you said! Goodbye forever!
117296,453,140,614000,Bob Costas,Vancouver,"Bob Costas at the two thousand ten Vancouver Games! For the Beijing games, China picked famed director Zhang Yimou to stage its Opening Ceremony. Tonight, Canada turns to its most famous director: Ivan Reitman -- the man who brought us ""Ghostbusters""!"
117297,453,141,629000,P.A. Announcer,Vancouver,Who you gonna call? Albania!
117298,453,142,634000,P.A. Announcer,Vancouver,Who you gonna call? Algeria! Who you gonna call? Argentina!
117300,453,144,641000,P.A. Announcer,Vancouver Olympic Stadium,"Who you gonna call? Zimbabwe. And now, not competing but observing: Who you gonna call? Angola..."
117302,453,146,654000,P.A. Announcer,Vancouver Olympic Stadium,"And now, in the Olympic spirit of peace and goodwill, we release the Canadian dove -- the beaver."
117303,453,147,670000,Lumberjack,Vancouver Olympic Stadium,This was all preventable!
117306,453,150,675000,Bart Simpson,Olympic Village,"Hey Lis, wanna come with? I'm snowboarding with my new Canadian friend, Milhoose."
117307,453,151,680000,Milhoose,Olympic Village,"Hey, Bort. Your sister's hotter than a Calgary brush-fire. Mind if I ask her oot?"
117308,453,152,684000,Lisa Simpson,Olympic Village,"Sorry, but I was planning to stop by the Olympic Pin Center to fill in a few small gaps in my collection. Y'know, just to get me through the day."
117309,453,153,692000,Milhoose,Olympic Village,She's as loony as a one dollar coin.
117310,453,154,695000,Canadian Nelson,Olympic Village,"Hey, hoser. Want some Canadian Club?"
117311,453,155,698000,Milhoose,Olympic Village,Do I!
117312,453,156,699000,Canadian Nelson,Olympic Village,Hoo-hoo!
117313,453,157,701000,Homer Simpson,Olympic Village,"OH, A PORK BAO, A SHRIMP BAO, EVERYWHERE A BAO BAO / HOMER SIMPSON WINS A GOLD / SLIDING ROCKS ON ICE... BAO BAO!"
117314,453,158,710000,Agnes Skinner,Olympic Village,"Marge, we need to talk about your husband."
117315,453,159,713000,Marge Simpson,Olympic Village,My favorite subject. I'll go first. Isn't he cute?
117316,453,160,716000,Agnes Skinner,Olympic Village,"A little. But as an Olympic curler, he's dragging us down like an anchor on a bag of toasters."
117317,453,161,723000,Marge Simpson,Olympic Village,But Homer tries his best.
117318,453,162,725000,Agnes Skinner,Olympic Village,"We know. That's why we're positive he'll never get any better. I had one Olympics ruined by a bald, drooling idiot but it's not gonna happen again."
117319,453,163,734000,Seymour Skinner,Olympic Village,I was not bald! My fontanel was covered by lanugo!
117320,453,164,737000,Agnes Skinner,Olympic Village,Whatever. We want Homer off the team.
117321,453,165,740000,Marge Simpson,Olympic Village,Well who made you the coach?
117322,453,166,742000,Agnes Skinner,Olympic Village,The hat makes me the coach.
117323,453,167,744000,Marge Simpson,Olympic Village,"Well, Homer's my soul mate! And you don't dump a soul mate!"
117324,453,168,748000,Homer Simpson,Olympic Village,"Oh my God, I'm holding back the team. But our marriage is based on curling. What am I gonna do?"
117327,453,171,754000,Homer Simpson,Olympic Village,Hm...
117330,453,174,780000,Lisa Simpson,Vancouver Street,Oh my gosh. It's the mascot from the 1924 games in Chamonix!
117331,453,175,784000,Pin Dealer,Vancouver Street,"That's right, it's Ennui, himself."
117332,453,176,788000,Lisa Simpson,Vancouver Street,I must have him!
117333,453,177,790000,Lisa Simpson,Vancouver Street,"Um... Can I have it on account? On account of I want it? You've heard that one, huh?"
117334,453,178,796000,Pin Dealer,Vancouver Street,"No, it's just not funny the first time. But if you want to trade, I could take uh, oh I dunno, those pearls you're wearing."
117335,453,179,803000,Lisa Simpson,Vancouver Street,"My pearls? These were a gift from my Mom, when I could first read at a twelfth grade level."
117336,453,180,808000,Pin Dealer,Vancouver Street,You wanna yak or you wanna trade?
117337,453,181,810000,Lisa Simpson,Vancouver Street,Just take 'em.
117340,453,184,828000,Lisa Simpson,Vancouver,I saw you grooving to the beat! You gotta pay for that!
117341,453,185,832000,Bart Simpson,Vancouver,"Lis, what's going on? You're not normally this interesting."
117342,453,186,835000,Lisa Simpson,Vancouver,Nothing's going on. Just sharing my music with the good people of Vancouver.
117343,453,187,840000,Lisa Simpson,Vancouver,A dime? What do you think I am -- a pay phone from nineteen eighty?!
117223,453,188,844000,Bart Simpson,Vancouver,Are you sure you're okay?
117344,453,189,846000,Lisa Simpson,Vancouver,"I'm fine! Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine..."
117345,453,190,850000,Bart Simpson,Vancouver,What's that noise?
117346,453,191,852000,Bart Simpson,Vancouver,Your dress is covered with pins.
117347,453,192,855000,Lisa Simpson,Vancouver,There is no dress. It's just pins! Help me!
117349,453,194,869000,Agnes Skinner,Vancouver Olympic Centre,What are you doing?
117350,453,195,869000,Marge Simpson,Vancouver Olympic Centre,I like to warm up by sweeping behind the snack bar.
117351,453,196,874000,Marge Simpson,Vancouver Olympic Centre,Boo yeah!
117352,453,197,875000,Agnes Skinner,Vancouver Olympic Centre,"Well, no matter what you do, it won't make up for Sir Slip-a-lot over there."
117353,453,198,882000,Homer Simpson,Vancouver Olympic Centre,Uh-oh.
117354,453,199,883000,Marge Simpson,Vancouver Olympic Centre,Yes it will. I'll just sweep harder than anyone's ever swept before. Because without Homer I'm a broom without a stone. No use for anything.
117355,453,200,893000,Agnes Skinner,Vancouver Olympic Centre,"Wow. That's love, Seymour. I'm glad you saw it once before you died."
117356,453,201,899000,Bob Costas,Vancouver Olympic Centre,"If Homer Simpson doesn't land this stone in center house, the only gold they'll be going home with is Lisa's pin collection."
117357,453,202,905000,Bob Costas,Vancouver Olympic Centre,"That tidbit courtesy of our highly-paid intern, Tom Brokaw."
117358,453,203,909000,Tom Brokaw,Vancouver Olympic Centre,I love to learn about Lisa.
117359,453,204,916000,Bob Costas,Vancouver Olympic Centre,"Oh my, that delivery has less juice than Sunny Delight!"
117361,453,206,922000,Bob Costas,Vancouver Olympic Centre,"Marge Simpson is sweeping fast and clean, but it won't be enough."
117362,453,207,926000,Bob Costas,Vancouver Olympic Centre,I've never seen this before -- Marge Simpson is trying to restart a stone!
117363,453,208,931000,Marge Simpson,Vancouver Olympic Centre,"C'mon, baby!"
117364,453,209,931000,Bob Costas,Vancouver Olympic Centre,She did it! She pulled off an impossible move... just like the time I shaved off Larry Bird's moustache while he was napping.
117366,453,211,947000,Bob Costas,Vancouver Olympic Centre,Team U.S.A. heads to the Gold medal match!
117367,453,212,949000,Bob Costas,Vancouver Olympic Centre,But wait a minute! Marge Simpson looks hurt!
117368,453,213,952000,Bob Costas,Vancouver Olympic Centre,This is the sort of bittersweet melodrama Olympic coverage feeds on! I admit it! We're vampires who suck on shattered dreams!
117369,453,214,960000,Homer Simpson,Vancouver Olympic Centre,That's my Marge! High-five!
