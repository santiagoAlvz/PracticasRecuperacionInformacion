118514,458,2,88000,Guard #1,Springfield Prison,"Burns, you're coming with us."
118515,458,3,90000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,No! No! Let me go!
118516,458,4,91000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,"Surprised? Me, C. Montgomery Burns, locked up like an animal."
118517,458,5,96000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,What caused this puzzling turn of events?
118518,458,6,99000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,"Well, I'll tell you my tale... by thinking about it to myself."
118520,458,8,106000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"...and so our Employee of the Month is the late Roger Ducette, who tragically died from complications due to union organizing. Moving on. The Power Plant's first annual Fourth of July picnic is this coming Saturday!"
118521,458,9,117000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Woo hoo!
118522,458,10,119000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ooh, I'm afraid you misunderstand. This picnic is for me. You will all be spending your Independence Day slaving away in the hot summer sun without pay, lotion or gratitude."
118524,458,12,130000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes, duh-ohhh, indeed."
118527,458,15,147000,Lenny Leonard,Burns Manor,"Sir, your spare ribs -- cooked just the way you like 'em."
118528,458,16,150000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Spare ribs, eh? I've played a round of tenpins or two in my life, and to me, the word ""spare"" reeks of second best. Give me ten full frames of strike ribs!"
118529,458,17,160000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"And you, find my doctor and ask him why I'd ask for something as insane as strike ribs!"
118530,458,18,160000,Carl Carlson,Burns Manor,"Yes, sir."
118531,458,19,165000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"You know, Sir... these people have been working since your six a.m. parade of the flags. Maybe you could give them the rest of the day off to spend with their families."
118532,458,20,173000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Yes. They should go. Just as soon as they perform this musical I've written in celebration of our nation's birth.
118533,458,21,178000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Grab your scripts, people! We open in twenty minutes! Break a leg!"
118534,458,22,183000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,I said break a leg!
118535,458,23,189000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"For God's sake, man, it's a figure of speech. You're fired!"
118536,458,24,192000,Employees,Burns Manor,WE LOVE A-MER-I-CAAA!
118537,458,25,218000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Meh. Smithers, take my hands and clap them sarcastically."
118538,458,26,225000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,More sarcastic!
118540,458,28,226000,Lenny Leonard,Burns Manor,Burns -- what an ungrateful jerk! We hoofed our hearts out for him -- with no rehearsal!
118541,458,29,232000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"I say Burns owes us a party. Let's have one, right now, with his wine!"
118542,458,30,242000,Lenny Leonard,Burns Manor,"I don't know... technically, this is trespassing."
118543,458,31,245000,Carl Carlson,Burns Manor,What's the worst thing he could do?
118545,458,33,251000,Carl Carlson,Burns's Wine Cellar,"Hey Lenny, ya care for some Chateau La Mondotte Saint-Emilion?"
118546,458,34,256000,Lenny Leonard,Burns's Wine Cellar,That's a regular-sized bottle. I'm drinkin' Jeroboams.
118547,458,35,259000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Wine Cellar,I'm pounding Melchizedeks!
118548,458,36,263000,Carl Carlson,Burns's Wine Cellar,"Homer, that's a sixty thousand dollar bottle!"
118549,458,37,265000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Wine Cellar,Woo hoo! I'm drinking my salary!
118550,458,38,267000,Lenny Leonard,Burns's Wine Cellar,"Yeah, but don't some of that go to income tax?"
118551,458,39,270000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Wine Cellar,"Yeah, you're right."
118552,458,40,271000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Wine Cellar,The government. Taking my hard-earned stolen wine and spending it on that no-good floor.
118553,458,41,275000,Lenny Leonard,Burns's Wine Cellar,I hear that.
118557,458,45,290000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Smithers, sound the alarum! Summon the shire reeve! Wake the beadle!"
118559,458,47,302000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Okay, left hand: Rembrandt!"
118560,458,48,307000,Chief Wiggum,Burns Manor,"All right, step away from the old masters and kick 'em over here. Come on."
118561,458,49,313000,Lou,Burns Manor,"Whoa, wait a minute, Chief. This is ""The Concert"" by Vermeer!"
118562,458,50,316000,Lou,Burns Manor,Which was stolen in 1990 from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum!
118563,458,51,321000,Chief Wiggum,Burns Manor,"So Burns, do you want to explain how this miracle of measure and harmony got into your collection?"
118564,458,52,328000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Well, I... you see... it's just is it a crime to want nice things? And then to steal them from a public museum where any gum-chewing monkey in a Tufts University jacket can gawk at them? I think not!"
118565,458,53,343000,Chief Wiggum,Burns Manor,"Cuff him, Lou."
118567,458,55,347000,C. Montgomery Burns,Courthouse,"The entire town turned out to jeer me. Me, whose velvet breeches their lizard lips had so often joylessly smooched."
118568,458,56,361000,Moe Szyslak,Courthouse,Throwin' stuff! Get yer throwin' stuff! Turn a protest into a riot!
118569,458,57,366000,Milhouse Van Houten,Courthouse,How much for a tomato?
118570,458,58,367000,Moe Szyslak,Courthouse,"Fresh is a dollar, rotten's two bucks."
118571,458,59,370000,Kirk Van Houten,Courthouse,"Son, do you really need the rotten? I mean, it's not like you're actually gonna hit him."
118572,458,60,375000,Kirk Van Houten,Courthouse,Awww... since it's your birthday...
118573,458,61,380000,Bart Simpson,Courthouse,Mom! I'm gonna go hurl rotten fruit!
118574,458,62,383000,Marge Simpson,Courthouse,No one in this family is hurling rotten anything at anyone!
118575,458,63,388000,Marge Simpson,Courthouse,And just what might that be?
118576,458,64,390000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,Uh... this is my lunch.
118577,458,65,392000,Marge Simpson,Courthouse,"Really? Okay, eat your lunch."
118578,458,66,395000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,But--
118579,458,67,396000,Marge Simpson,Courthouse,You said it's your lunch. Eat it.
118580,458,68,397000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,Eat my lunch?
118581,458,69,398000,Marge Simpson,Courthouse,Yes! Enjoy!
118582,458,70,399000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,"Okay, I will!"
118583,458,71,399000,Marge Simpson,Courthouse,Bon app√©tit!
118584,458,72,401000,C. Montgomery Burns,Courthouse,"They continued for some time in this vein, until..."
118585,458,73,405000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,You don't think I'm going to?
118586,458,74,406000,Marge Simpson,Courthouse,I don't see any chewing!
118587,458,75,407000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,Okay.
118588,458,76,407000,Marge Simpson,Courthouse,"Not air bites, real bites."
118590,458,78,416000,Bart Simpson,Courthouse,Where are you going?
118591,458,79,416000,Marge Simpson,Courthouse,"Shopping. Every time this town riots, the malls are deserted. You stay here."
118592,458,80,422000,Bart Simpson,Courthouse,I hate being stuck at home!
118593,458,81,425000,Marge Simpson,Courthouse,Play with Lisa.
118594,458,82,426000,Bart Simpson,Courthouse,"Mom, you don't play with Lisa. You play despite her."
118595,458,83,429000,Bart Simpson,Courthouse,"Bart, I'm not thrilled either. But one day we might need each other for organ transplants, so we'd better keep the lines of communication open. Want to help me with my ant farm?"
118596,458,84,439000,Bart Simpson,Courthouse,You plant the ants and then they grow?
118597,458,85,441000,Lisa Simpson,Courthouse,"No, the ants are the farmers."
118598,458,86,443000,Bart Simpson,Courthouse,Really? What are they growing?
118599,458,87,445000,Lisa Simpson,Courthouse,"Nothing! Look, do you want to do it or not?"
118600,458,88,447000,Bart Simpson,Courthouse,No!
118601,458,89,447000,Lisa Simpson,Courthouse,Fine.
118603,458,91,449000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Penitentiary,"So ironic. After all my years of stock jobbing, gun running, attempted murder, successful murder, and tom peepery, they get me on a petty multi-million dollar art theft."
118604,458,92,460000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Penitentiary,It's so unfair!
118605,458,93,462000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Penitentiary,"Smithers, until I am released, you shall be running the nuclear plant."
118606,458,94,466000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Penitentiary,Me?
118607,458,95,467000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Penitentiary,"Be strong, Smithers. Be strong for the plant. She needs you."
118608,458,96,474000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Penitentiary,This would've been a perfect time for it to start raining. Oh what the hell -- I'm telling this story!
118609,458,97,482000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Penitentiary,Not dramatic enough.
118610,458,98,486000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Penitentiary,Frostbite took his nose!
118612,458,100,488000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Penitentiary,Excellent.
118613,458,101,493000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Penitentiary,"That prison was like a prison to me. Not a prison of bricks and iron, but one of steel and cement. They took everything from me."
118614,458,102,501000,Prison Guard,Springfield Penitentiary,"One movie stub from ""Tillie's Punctured Romance""... envelope marked ""bribe""..."
118615,458,103,501000,Prison Guard,Springfield Penitentiary,...empty... social security card...
118616,458,104,514000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Penitentiary,"That's just an S.S. card, you Dummkopf!"
118617,458,105,516000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Penitentiary,My only hope lay in befriending the warden.
118619,458,107,520000,Warden,Springfield Prison,"Now you looky here, Burns. All your money and influence don't mean nothin' on the inside."
118620,458,108,525000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,"Yes... but a wealthy man can buy information, information that can be highly damaging to a certain warden."
118621,458,109,532000,Warden,Springfield Prison,"Well, uh, what information we talkin' 'bout?"
118622,458,110,535000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,Well I'm sure the boys at the city desk would be interested to learn that you're addicted to... to...
118623,458,111,543000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,"Can't read my own writing. But I'll tell you this, warden, it starts with an ""H""..."
118624,458,112,545000,Guard,Springfield Prison,Ham?
118625,458,113,550000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,It's clearly more than three letters!
118626,458,114,551000,Warden,Springfield Prison,Get him out of my sight.
118627,458,115,560000,Warden,Springfield Prison,"Ain't nobody gonna take my ""H"" from me."
118628,458,116,565000,Warden,Springfield Prison,"Damn, that gas is noble."
118629,458,117,587000,Prison Guard,Springfield Prison,Time for a cavity search.
118630,458,118,590000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,I haven't had a cavity in over forty years.
118631,458,119,593000,Prison Guard,Springfield Prison,I wasn't talking about your teeth.
118632,458,120,595000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,Nor was I.
118633,458,121,598000,Prison Guard,Springfield Prison,Meet your roommate.
118634,458,122,602000,Pleasant Cellmate,Springfield Prison,"Hiya, pal! They put two harmless white collar criminals in the same cell. What luck, huh?"
118635,458,123,609000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,I was afraid you'd be some tattooed bruiser.
118636,458,124,611000,Pleasant Cellmate,Springfield Prison,"Well, they don't turn out too many of those at Dartmouth."
118637,458,125,613000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,Dartmouth?! Get me away from this hideous brute at once!
118638,458,126,617000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,At once! Do you hear me?!
118639,458,127,618000,Pleasant Cellmate,Springfield Prison,Got my Masters from the University of Virginia -- the public Ivy!
118640,458,128,622000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,Guard!
118642,458,130,625000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Such an intricate formicarium! I'm the proudest myrmecologist on the block.
118643,458,131,630000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, they're not eating."
118644,458,132,632000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry. I gave 'em a Pop Tart. The healthy kind, strawberry-frosted."
118645,458,133,636000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! That Pop Tart wasn't locally farmed or sourced!
118647,458,134,639000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Lisa, you take the fun out of everything! I am so glad I am not your kid."
118648,458,135,644000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm so glad I'm not your mom."
118649,458,136,647000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You should be. If I was in your tummy, I'd poo in your throat."
118650,458,137,651000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ew! Ew! Ew! I'll never get that image out of my head!
118651,458,138,654000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh no. You are not taking the children.
118652,458,139,657000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,If they're anybody's children they're mine!
118654,458,141,662000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Quick, we've got to get them back!"
118655,458,142,671000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,There's only one ant left!
118656,458,143,673000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I will never forgive you.
118657,458,144,677000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Aw...
118658,458,145,678000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I will never forgive you, Bart."
118659,458,146,681000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That only angers me more.
118660,458,147,683000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I know.
118664,458,151,695000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Okay Waylon, you never wanted this job, but you got it."
118665,458,152,701000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,Dammit.
118667,458,154,705000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"You know, this is my chance. A chance to be the kind of boss I want to be. A little more ""employee friendly."""
118668,458,155,714000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,That was a wild Christmas party.
118670,458,157,719000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"In the next few weeks we'll be introducing a medical plan that covers illness, and a suggestion box that is no longer a guillotine for the hand."
118671,458,158,726000,Worker,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yeah!
118672,458,159,728000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, I agree things are a lot nicer around here. But I think I speak for many of us when I say what's the catch?"
118673,458,160,735000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well the catch is, happy workers are productive workers."
118674,458,161,738000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,There's always a catch.
118676,458,163,742000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Can I come in?
118677,458,164,744000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You're not going anywhere near Annie.
118678,458,165,746000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Annie?
118679,458,166,748000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"As in ""Little Orphan."""
118680,458,167,749000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill our ants.
118681,458,168,752000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Patty and Selma are dead? Woo hoo! A double funeral!
118682,458,169,760000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, before you jump to conclusions..."
118683,458,170,762000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Please tell me they suffered.
118684,458,171,765000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,G-g-g-g-hags!
118687,458,174,772000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Yard,"Hm, looks like it's pledge day. Which jailhouse fraternity shall I join?"
118688,458,175,777000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Yard,The Shriners?
118689,458,176,779000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Yard,The R.O.T.C.?
118690,458,177,781000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Yard,The Sunday funnies?
118691,458,178,782000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Yard,"Or one of these other dining clubs? Look at them circling me like I'm Cinderella, belle of the ball!"
118692,458,179,789000,Booming Voice,Prison Yard,Back off!
118693,458,180,790000,Delroy,Prison Yard,He's mine.
118694,458,181,794000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Yard,Warden! Help me!
118695,458,182,796000,Warden,Prison Yard,"No can do, baby. I'm not comin' down for days."
118697,458,184,801000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Mr. Smithers, our lives are awesome, thanks to you. And because I know you ""like your loafers light,"" I want to give something back."
118698,458,185,812000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Use that image any way you want.
118699,458,186,814000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Three cheers for Mr. Smithers!
118700,458,187,816000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,To Mr. Smithers! / Hooray!
118701,458,188,821000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Uh listen... can I leave a little early tomorrow? My kid has a thing.
118702,458,189,826000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Ooo yeah, can I leave early too? I wanna take a nap so I'm awake for the meteor shower."
118703,458,190,832000,Waylon Smithers,Moe's Tavern,Well... I'm flexible. Go ahead.
118704,458,191,834000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Y'know, I used to think you was just as bad as Mr. Burns, now I think you're just as good as me."
118705,458,192,839000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, that is a huge compliment."
118706,458,193,843000,Waylon Smithers,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, excuse me."
118707,458,194,847000,Waylon Smithers,Moe's Tavern,"Yes, the service on my car was excellent. Five out of five. Four out of five. Five out of five. Um, excuse me, can I go back and change that four out of five to five out of five? I'm wasting your time?"
118708,458,195,861000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Smithers. What a marshmallow.
118709,458,196,861000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I don't have a thing with my kid tomorrow!
118710,458,197,866000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,You told me you did.
118711,458,198,867000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I do, but I'm not going to it."
118712,458,199,869000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"To Smithers, the world's dumbest loser!"
118713,458,200,872000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,There's nothing sweeter than being nice to a guy's face and then stabbin' him in the back the minute he walks away!
118714,458,201,877000,Waylon Smithers,Moe's Tavern,"All right, that's it."
118716,458,203,879000,Waylon Smithers,Moe's Tavern,"You know, I used to wonder why Mr. Burns hated humanity. Now I know. You open your heart and they mock your very decency!"
118717,458,204,889000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Ooh! We mock your very decency.
118719,458,206,899000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Man, Smithers is workin' us like dogs!"
118720,458,207,903000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, at least we've got the best brand ceiling insulation."
118722,458,209,909000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, at least we've got the best asbestos."
118726,458,213,916000,Delroy,Prison Cell,"I told you, you're mine. And you can't escape... the word of Jesus Christ."
118727,458,214,922000,Delroy,Prison Cell,"Burns, you shall reject Satan!"
118728,458,215,924000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Cell,Why can't you reject your guy?
118729,458,216,926000,Delroy,Prison Cell,"Because when I was at my lowest, facing fifty years to life..."
118730,458,217,926000,Delroy,Prison Cell,Someone handed me a book...
118731,458,218,933000,Delroy,Prison Cell,"I couldn't read a lick, but that picture of Jesus gave me a comfort I'd never known."
118732,458,219,941000,Delroy,Prison Cell,So I promised the Lord I'd put that fifty years to use reclaiming lost souls like you!
118733,458,220,948000,Delroy,Prison Cell,Come to Jesus!
118734,458,221,950000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Cell,Shan't.
118735,458,222,950000,Delroy,Prison Cell,Feel his power!
118736,458,223,953000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Cell,I've died and come back. It's overrated.
118737,458,224,954000,Delroy,Prison Cell,Open your heart!
118738,458,225,954000,Delroy,Prison Cell,I will suck out your evil!
118739,458,226,966000,Delroy,Prison Cell,And now your evil is gone!
118740,458,227,968000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Cell,I'm afraid that was just my pre-evil.
118741,458,228,982000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Cell,I feel it! I feel the love coursing through my vein!
118742,458,229,988000,Delroy,Prison Cell,"Welcome to the Lord, brother."
118743,458,230,989000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Cell,So that hellhole became my Heavenhole. I joined the prison choir...and the Prison Beatles Tribute Band.
118744,458,231,996000,C. Montgomery Burns,Prison Cell,I raked a Zen garden in the courtyard...and found a peace and serenity I'd never known.
118746,458,233,1012000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Who's carrying fifty times her weight? Ooo, you are!"
118747,458,234,1015000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, she's only carrying thirty times her weight. Our girl is slowing down."
118748,458,235,1022000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my God, that is so sad."
118749,458,236,1025000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's the natural order of things. I'm afraid she's got another two, maybe three days, tops."
118750,458,237,1031000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Do we let her spend the rest of her life in the wild? Or let her die in captivity, like Grampa?"
118751,458,238,1036000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, in my mind I'm free!"
118752,458,239,1038000,Thought Bubble Grampa,Simpson Home,"No you're not, ya idjit!"
118755,458,242,1041000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,It's official. Smithers is now worse than Mr. Burns.
118756,458,243,1047000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Instead of releasing hounds, he releases wolverines!"
118757,458,244,1057000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I never thought I'd say this, but I wish Mr. Burns was back."
118758,458,245,1061000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, if wishes were horses I'd be eatin' wish-meat every night."
118759,458,246,1061000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,What does that mean?
118760,458,247,1065000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,It means it's not like you're gonna break into the prison and bust him out or anything.
118761,458,248,1070000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Aw hey, c'mon. You can't really be serious about breaking him out."
118762,458,249,1075000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"It's too late to turn back, Moe. We've exchanged meaningful looks."
118763,458,250,1079000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"No, you can still turn back! The point of no return is the whispered huddle."
118764,458,251,1084000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh God, oh God!"
118766,458,253,1095000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Burns, you're coming with us."
118767,458,254,1095000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,No! No! Let me go! Let me go!
118768,458,255,1098000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,Why would I want to leave the place where my soul was saved?
118769,458,256,1103000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,"And that's where we came in. Now, without further ado, here's what happened next:"
118770,458,257,1109000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,"But first, I'll daydream about a sport utility vehicle, a crispy chicken sandwich, and a wonderful blue pill."
118771,458,258,1120000,Delroy,Springfield Prison,Hold it right there. You're not leaving with that man. He's born again. Been baptized in a toilet sink.
118772,458,259,1128000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,Everyone doesn't have to know that part.
118773,458,260,1131000,Delroy,Springfield Prison,It's the specific detail that shows the humbling you've undergone.
118646,458,261,1135000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,"You don't have a ""whisper"" voice, do you?"
118774,458,262,1135000,Delroy,Springfield Prison,What?
118776,458,264,1139000,Bart Simpson,GRASSY FIELD,"Goodbye, Annie, my eight-legged friend."
118777,458,265,1142000,Lisa Simpson,GRASSY FIELD,"Ants have six legs, Bart."
118778,458,266,1144000,Bart Simpson,GRASSY FIELD,"Oh, thank God. I thought I broke two off."
118779,458,267,1146000,Lisa Simpson,GRASSY FIELD,"You're just a tiny ant, but you were strong enough to pull my brother and me together. Now go and be free."
118781,458,269,1163000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,"Look, if I leave with you, they're just going to throw me back in."
118782,458,270,1166000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Prison,The world has changed since you went in. Men of wealth can beat the system now.
118783,458,271,1170000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Prison,Yeah. And they've replaced parking meters with this thing you stick your credit card into.
118784,458,272,1174000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,"The war is over and the future won. The past never had a chance, man!"
118785,458,273,1179000,Delroy,Springfield Prison,Do you really want to leave with these idiots?
118786,458,274,1185000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,I'm afraid so.
118787,458,275,1186000,Delroy,Springfield Prison,But I cleansed you of your evil!
118788,458,276,1188000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,"I had a little left between my toes. It quickly multiplied, and now I'm a bigger bastard than ever. But I must know -- what was it about me that made you try?"
118789,458,277,1197000,Delroy,Springfield Prison,"Because I've killed so many rich white men, I thought I'd do right by at least one."
118790,458,278,1203000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,"We're not so different, you and I."
118792,458,280,1208000,Delroy,Springfield Prison,Get your skinny ass out of here.
118794,458,282,1209000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Lollygags... slackabouts... Captain Happys... you're all fired!
118795,458,283,1214000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'll do the firing around here.
118796,458,284,1216000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Mr. Burns! You're even more beautiful than I remembered!
118797,458,285,1222000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"All of you, out of my office!"
118798,458,286,1234000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Farewell, friend. Maybe you'll find another lost lamb for your flock."
118800,458,288,1239000,Delroy,Springfield Prison,"Tell me, brother - have you heard the story of Jesus Christ?"
118801,458,289,1243000,Fat Tony,Springfield Prison,"Well I am Italian, but no."
118802,458,290,1249000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,I LIVE ME IN A MANSION / FULL OF THOSE GRECIAN URNS / BUT I'M LONELY ALL THE LIVE-LONG DAY / THAT'S THE BLUES OF MONTY BURNS
118804,458,291,1260000,Female Chorus,Springfield Prison,HE'S GOT THE BLUES /
118805,458,292,1264000,Female Chorus,Springfield Prison,THE I GOT NO PROBLEMS BLUES!
118806,458,293,1271000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Prison,"OH, MY TAPESTRY'S MEDIEVAL, / MY HEART, IT'S EVIL TOO / BUT THAT DON'T MEAN I DON'T NEED LOVE / FROM LESSER TYPES LIKE YOU!"
118807,458,294,1282000,Female Chorus,Springfield Prison,HE'S GOT THE BLUES / THE OLD AND PRIVILEGED WHITE MAN BLUES!
