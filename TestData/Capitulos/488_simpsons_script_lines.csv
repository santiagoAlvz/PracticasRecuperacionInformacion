126565,488,1,97000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,They always come up with such catchy ways to make us pay for things we don't need for kids we didn't want.
126566,488,2,111000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Wow -- the gym ropes are seaweed, the basketball nets are fishing nets..."
126567,488,3,119000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Springfield Elementary School,"Y'arr, just plastic. Which is healthier than what you find in the ocean."
126568,488,4,124000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Buy a Springfield Elementary t-shirt?
126569,488,5,127000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I don't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school.
126570,488,6,130000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,We also have t-shirts from... other schools.
126571,488,7,133000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Ooh! We can wear those to the nice mall!
126572,488,8,142000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"And now it's time for lights, camera, auction! No cameras!"
126573,488,9,148000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Ooh, first item up for bid is... always a favorite, lunch with Principal Skinner!"
126574,488,10,153000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I'll just leave the food on your doorstep and ring the bell.
126575,488,11,157000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Moving on. Next up for auction is this wonderful bench hand-crafted by our second-grade class.
126577,488,12,163000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Don't buy it! I bought one last year and it was crap construction!
126578,488,13,168000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Do I hear fifty dollars?
126579,488,14,172000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Paddles down! It's the only way to change the system!
126580,488,15,178000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Hello? Calling from England? Certainly I can put you on speakerphone.
126581,488,16,184000,ELDERLY ENGLISHWOMAN,Springfield Elementary School,"I am Edith Knickertwist, an eccentric widow."
126582,488,17,187000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,For this masterpiece I bid...one thousand dollars!

126587,488,22,203000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, it looks like our model solar-system will finally get an Earth!"
126590,488,25,213000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"...annnd that concludes tonight's auction, which has raised a school record one hundred and sixteen thousand dollars!"
126592,488,27,221000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,And our windfall is all thanks to our dear new friend on the phone.
126593,488,28,226000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"'Allo, luvs!"
126594,488,29,228000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,I've got a bad feeling about this.
126595,488,30,231000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,I'm Mrs. Knickertwist! And I've had a proper hardy-har at your expense!
126596,488,31,237000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,Why do I believe everything I hear in a British accent?
126597,488,32,241000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,He has thrust upon us the motley of the tomfool.
126598,488,33,246000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,I wore this all night for nothing?!
126599,488,34,253000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"Mr. Simpson, I know you're not one of our wealthier parents, but surely you'll honor your son's enormous debt."
126600,488,35,259000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"Why of course! Even if I don't have a legal obligation to pay, it's clearly the right thing to do."
126601,488,36,266000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,"Here's one thousand dollars... two thousand dollars... three thousand dollars... Ooh, I need more cash. Better go to my invisible ATM."
126603,488,37,279000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Auditorium,What? Two dollar charge for non-network bank?!
126606,488,40,284000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,SKIN-NER!
126607,488,41,286000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Yes sir?
126608,488,42,287000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,I was very pleased with your work last night.
126609,488,43,290000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Really?
126610,488,44,291000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Nope! Fooled again!
126611,488,45,292000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"I'd say you're dumb as a post. But at least you can put a sign on a post that says ""fresh strawberries -- one mile."" You are a nitwit in an ill-fitting suit."
126612,488,46,301000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I'll have you know I'm lop-shouldered.
126613,488,47,303000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
126614,488,48,304000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I said, I'm lop-shouldered! And I have been since I was hung by my armpits in a North Vietnamese prison!"
126615,488,49,310000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,I... I didn't know that.
126616,488,50,312000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh the list of things you don't know could fill a week's worth of morning announcements, with enough left over for a send-home flyer!"
126617,488,51,318000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"There's no need for hyperbole, Seymour."
126618,488,52,321000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"If you think it's so easy to handle Bart Simpson, why don't you do it yourself?!"
126620,488,54,326000,Dewey Largo,Springfield Elementary School,"You tell him, Seymour!"
126621,488,55,328000,Laid-back Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,"As some guy said to some dude with a beard, ""death to tyrants""!"
126622,488,56,328000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,You mean Booth and Lincoln?
126623,488,57,334000,Laid-back Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,I'm not the history teacher! Any more.
126624,488,58,338000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Fine! I will personally take over Bart Simpson's education -- and for once, that boy's going to learn something! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm, expecting an important call and cell phone coverage in here is uh, spotty."
126625,488,59,353000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh nicely done, Seymour! I guess there're some stones in your leaf bag after all."
126626,488,60,358000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"While I'm on a roll I'm gonna call that carpet cleaning service and tell them our hallway doesn't count as a room! Hello, is Andr√© there? Oh yes, I'll hold!"
126628,488,61,374000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"I know I can superintend -- superintend like the wind! But teach? It's been years. And we both know how that went, don't we Gary?"
126629,488,62,385000,Young Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"So, you are the so-called Breakfast Club..."
126630,488,63,388000,Jock,Springfield Elementary School,Wrong room. We're The Fight Club.
126631,488,64,402000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Thank God they never went on to do anything since.
126633,488,66,407000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Public Library,"So, Simpson, you'll be studying with me now."
126634,488,67,410000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Public Library,"Same garbage, different dumpster."
126635,488,68,412000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Public Library,We'll start with American history.
126636,488,69,416000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Public Library,Now I'm sure you know who these gentlemen are.
126637,488,70,418000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Public Library,"Dollar bill guy, five dollar bill guy, sex guy, Will Ferrell, black guy."
126638,488,71,429000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Public Library,"Bart, what if I told you there was a president who was an actual cowboy?"
126639,488,72,434000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Public Library,"I'd act like I'm interested, but inside I'd be bored."
126640,488,73,436000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Public Library,That's as good a place to start as any.
126641,488,74,457000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Public Library,"Hey, this Roosevelt guy was sorta interesting. Did you know he was a colonel in the army?"
126642,488,75,463000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Public Library,You don't say...
126643,488,76,465000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Public Library,"And one time, during a speech, he was shot by a saloon-keeper -- but Teddy finished his speech before heading to the hospital!!"
126644,488,77,472000,Saloonkeeper,Springfield Public Library,I'm mad at you for some reason!
126646,488,79,487000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Public Library,"I've never said this before, but I'd like to learn more!"
126648,488,81,499000,Bart Simpson,Public Library,"Man, Teddy Roosevelt killed more Spaniards in one day than most people do in their whole lives!"
126649,488,82,504000,Gary Chalmers,Public Library,"Y'know, I hate to say it, Bart, but the library is about to close."
126650,488,83,508000,Bart Simpson,Public Library,"Really? I wanted to learn more about trust busting. Take that, Standard Oil!"
126651,488,84,513000,Gary Chalmers,Public Library,"Tomorrow, son. Tomorrow."
126652,488,85,515000,Bart Simpson,Public Library,"Well, I've learned a lot today. Now to go home and let TV slowly rot it all away."
126653,488,86,521000,Gary Chalmers,Public Library,Eh-eh-eh-eh. Not so fast. Teddy Roosevelt believed you could learn from books. But he also believed you could learn just as much from the out-of-doors.
126654,488,87,529000,Bart Simpson,Public Library,I thought teachers only went outdoors to smoke and cry.
126655,488,88,532000,Gary Chalmers,Public Library,"Yes... Son, have you ever seen a horse your father wasn't betting on?"
126656,488,89,538000,Bart Simpson,Public Library,No sir.
126657,488,90,539000,Gary Chalmers,Public Library,Come with me.
126659,488,92,545000,Gary Chalmers,Mt. Springfield,"So Bart, what have you learned so far?"
126660,488,93,548000,Bart Simpson,Mt. Springfield,"Well, when horses poop, they don't stop. They just keep walking."
126661,488,94,550000,Gary Chalmers,Mt. Springfield,"Uh, yes. Well here's another fun fact for you. All around you is a national park... created by Teddy Roosevelt."
126662,488,95,561000,Bart Simpson,Mt. Springfield,Wow. And here I thought God created all this. Thanks for setting me straight.
126663,488,96,566000,Gary Chalmers,Mt. Springfield,"Well, wait, I didn't mean that..."
126664,488,97,568000,Bart Simpson,Mt. Springfield,You've filled my head with horse poop and atheism! And all these years I thought I was unteachable.
126665,488,98,573000,Gary Chalmers,Mt. Springfield,Let's stop talking now.
126667,488,100,576000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,A man who is good enough to shed his blood for the country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards.
126668,488,101,576000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just quoting our twenty-sixth president, Lis. You could use a little T.R. in your life."
126669,488,102,587000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Please! I went through my T.R. phase in first grade. Now I realize that the greatest Roosevelt is Franklin.
126670,488,103,595000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Balderdash! Teddy Roosevelt protected America's wildlife!
126671,488,104,598000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, so he could shoot it himself. Franklin Roosevelt led this country through the depression and World War Two!"
126672,488,105,604000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Face on a dime!
126673,488,106,605000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Face on a mountain!
126674,488,107,607000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I hated the Roosie-velts and all them family dynasties. The Kennedys, the Bushes, Jon Voigt and Angelina Jolie, Mayor Daley and his smart ass son, the Daily Show."
126675,488,108,618000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's a lot of anger, Grampa."
126676,488,109,620000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I like Stephen Colbert, but that's because I don't get the joke."
126678,488,111,626000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"And on July first, 1898, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt and his band of Rough Riders charged up San Juan Hill and liberated Cuba."
126679,488,112,633000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Cuba si! Castro no!
126681,488,113,636000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,I love Teddy Roosevelt because he had asthma as a boy!
126682,488,114,639000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"I love him because he said, ""Bully!"""
126683,488,115,639000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,The dude really knew how to rock some jodhpurs!
126684,488,116,645000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, maybe Chalmers would let you guys sit in on our lessons. After me, men!"
126685,488,117,650000,Boys,Springfield Elementary School,Bully-bully-bully-bully-bully!
126688,488,120,653000,Gary Chalmers,Chalmers' House,"I'd be glad to have you boys join our experiment in manly education. The fact is, today's modern schools have completely failed you."
126689,488,121,665000,Jimbo Jones,Chalmers' House,School failed me? Does school have to go to summer Jimbo?
126690,488,122,671000,Gary Chalmers,Chalmers' House,"Look at him, boys. He is the canary in the coal mine of a dying empire."
126691,488,123,675000,Jimbo Jones,Chalmers' House,"You're in my coal mine now, bitches!"
126692,488,124,679000,Gary Chalmers,Chalmers' House,"Yeah. Boys are falling behind in every subject -- because our classrooms are entirely geared towards girls! It's all about feelings, and celebrating differences..."
126693,488,125,690000,Milhouse Van Houten,Chalmers' House,"But I loved reading ""It's Cool to Cry!"""
126694,488,126,693000,Gary Chalmers,Chalmers' House,"Well, it's not cool to cry!"
126696,488,128,696000,Gary Chalmers,Chalmers' House,Boys need to explore! Build things! Wreck those things! And then build them again! Our first lesson begins this Saturday -- with an overnight trip to Springfield Forest.
126697,488,129,708000,Gary Chalmers,Chalmers' House,Legend has it that Teddy Roosevelt visited the forest and lost a pair of his trademark spectacles. This weekend we set forth in search of those spectacles!
126699,488,131,719000,Jimbo Jones,Chalmers' House,"This is all well and good, but I must know: what are spectacles?"
126700,488,132,724000,Gary Chalmers,Chalmers' House,Glasses.
126702,488,134,726000,DOLPH,Springfield Forest,One time I found an old washing machine over there that still had clothes in it.
126704,488,136,732000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Forest,This place is as beautiful as the side of a Coors beer can. The kind my Dad used to leave in the bathtub.
126705,488,137,739000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Forest,"There are no bad fathers in the wilderness, boy."
126709,488,139,759000,Gary Chalmers,Campsite,"Y'know, Bart, morning's when I miss my Rosemary the most. She sure looked good in a pair of jammies."
126710,488,140,770000,Nelson Muntz,Campsite,Dinguses! DINGUSES!
126711,488,141,777000,Nelson Muntz,Campsite,I found 'em! Teddy Roosevelt's spectacles!
126712,488,142,780000,Gary Chalmers,Campsite,"Nicely done, Muntz!"
126713,488,143,783000,Nelson Muntz,Campsite,Could this be the moment my life starts to turn around? The moment I... huh?
126714,488,144,786000,Nelson Muntz,Campsite,Gravity blows!
126716,488,146,795000,State Comptroller Atkins,Springfield Elementary School,"Gary, you took these boys on an unauthorized field trip, and look what happened!"
126717,488,147,800000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,He got some bumps and bruises and a thistle in his britches. What is the big deal?
126718,488,148,804000,Mrs. Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"The big deal is I'm gonna sue you! Got me one of them ""abogados"" from the bus ads. He says he'll only take veinte por ciento, whatever that is."
126719,488,149,814000,Lawyer,Springfield Elementary School,You have seen my picture on the side of a bus. And I am not smiling because I lost the case.
126720,488,150,821000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw haw!
126721,488,151,822000,Mrs. Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I'm gonna take you for every peso you've got.
126722,488,152,825000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,How did she know we get paid in pesos?
126723,488,153,830000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"They took my job away, boys."
126724,488,154,839000,Otto Mann,Springfield Elementary School,"Where to, boss?"
126725,488,155,841000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Just drive.
126726,488,156,847000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Maybe it is cool to cry.
126727,488,157,859000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Who can name the three types of rocks?
126728,488,158,861000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Bart Simpson?
126729,488,159,863000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Chalmers would actually take us out to see the rocks.
126730,488,160,867000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,You can see the rocks on page thirty-two of your science book.
126731,488,161,870000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,My book is missing page thirty-two.
126732,488,162,872000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Put your head on the desk and shut your eyes.
126733,488,163,874000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,My desktop is sticky with soda from the kid that had it before me.
126734,488,164,878000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Do as I say!
126737,488,167,894000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Street,Stupid fish! Don't you want to be my din-ner?!
126738,488,168,898000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"Hey, Gary."
126740,488,169,898000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Street,"Simpson, you are looking at a man who was not good enough for the worst public school in America."
126741,488,170,906000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"Well, what would Teddy Roosevelt do?"
126742,488,171,908000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Street,"Son, I'm no Teddy Roosevelt. I'm not even Kermit Roosevelt."
126746,488,175,916000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I call this meeting of the Brotherhood of the Spectacles to order. Our mission: to get Chalmers back his job.
126747,488,176,923000,Other Boys,Bart's Treehouse,Hear hear! Hear hear!
126748,488,177,925000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Bart, I wanna ask you about something I read in a magazine. Are you boys cyberbullying each other?"
126749,488,178,932000,Jimbo Jones,Bart's Treehouse,How could we be? We're all in the same place and we don't have computers.
126750,488,179,938000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Marge, I parented!"
126751,488,180,939000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"That's great, Homie! Come have some ice cream on a brownie!"
126752,488,181,943000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Later, losers."
126753,488,182,945000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I'm thinking of something big. So big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till Chalmers gets his job back!
126754,488,183,955000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse."
126755,488,184,959000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Well, Dad, since you are taking an interest in us, maybe I should tell you..."
126756,488,185,964000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Marge, my ice cream's melting and I haven't finished my brownie!"
126757,488,186,968000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Come in and get some more!
126758,488,187,970000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,You guys need to get a woman.
126760,488,189,974000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"So, I'm considering taking drugs. Would the school advise for or against that?"
126761,488,190,981000,Receptionist,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, strongly against! Would you like to read this pamphlet?"
126762,488,191,986000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh well, would you read it with me?"
126764,488,193,992000,Receptionist,Springfield Elementary School,You see? This boy took drugs and his scores suffered.
126765,488,194,995000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,Yeah.
126766,488,195,1006000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,There's a car with its lights on in the teacher's lot.
126767,488,196,1013000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Late-'90s model...coffee stains on front seat...
126627,488,198,1013000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,...stacks of resumes in back seat...
126707,488,200,1032000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, what are you doing?"
