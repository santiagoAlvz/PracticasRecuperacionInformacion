145145,559,2,34000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"I'd like to welcome all of the principals from the Springfield School District, including Skin-ner! Wein-berg! Sack-ett! And Gwendo-lyn Hertz-feld-Mastroantoni-o!"
145146,559,3,48000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"We are here for the annual ""Dance of the Lemons"" where each of you gets to trade your worst teacher to another school. The union's happy, the parents are placated and only the children suffer."
145147,559,4,60000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Chalmskinn.
145148,559,5,62000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Behold your lemons -- sociopathic child haters who are only teachers because they got tenure after short two years.
145149,559,6,70000,TEACHER IN BACK,Springfield Elementary School,That's mean!
145150,559,7,72000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,You know what you are!
145151,559,8,75000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, first lemon: from Springfield Elementary, going to West Springfield, third grade teacher... Sticky-Fingers Stella."
145152,559,9,89000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, going to Springfield Elementary..."
145153,559,10,92000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Dear God have mercy... Seymour... your new teacher is... everybody pray!
145154,559,11,98000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,This is a public school!
145155,559,12,100000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,I said pray!!!
145157,559,14,105000,Myra,Springfield Elementary School,Mr. Lassen is here.
145158,559,15,109000,Myra,Springfield Elementary School,No smoking.
145159,559,16,112000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"So, Mr. Lassen, you began your career at Shelbyville Prep."
145160,559,17,117000,MR. LASSEN,Springfield Elementary School,It seems that certain wealthy parents didn't like seeing their precious darlings duct taped to the wall.
145161,559,18,122000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Mmm-hmmm. And then you entered the public system...
145162,559,19,125000,MR. LASSEN,Springfield Elementary School,That's where I got this scar.
145163,559,20,127000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,What scar?
145165,559,22,132000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, I see you're left-handed... so that concludes my evaluation. Enjoy fourth grade."
145167,559,24,139000,Milhouse Van Houten,BART'S CLASSROOM,"So, any dirt on the new teacher?"
145168,559,25,141000,Martin Prince,BART'S CLASSROOM,Is he stingy with the pumpkin stickers?
145169,559,26,144000,Database,BART'S CLASSROOM,Does he have O.C.D.? O.C.D.? O.C.D.?
145170,559,27,146000,Bart Simpson,BART'S CLASSROOM,"I dunno. But in ten minutes I'm gonna have him kneeling before Zod. In this example, I'm Zod."
145171,559,28,157000,Bart Simpson,BART'S CLASSROOM,When he opens the door...
145172,559,29,163000,Milhouse Van Houten,BART'S CLASSROOM,That's kinda scary... but it doesn't make me pee my pants.
145173,559,30,167000,MR. LASSEN,BART'S CLASSROOM,Hello.
145175,559,32,171000,MR. LASSEN,BART'S CLASSROOM,I'm Mr. Lassen.
145176,559,33,173000,Nelson Muntz,BART'S CLASSROOM,You mean Mr. Less-than?
145178,559,35,177000,MR. LASSEN,BART'S CLASSROOM,"So, a comedian, are you?"
145179,559,36,179000,Nelson Muntz,BART'S CLASSROOM,I've got a pretty solid ten minutes.
145180,559,37,181000,MR. LASSEN,BART'S CLASSROOM,"Well, I could do five minutes on your pathetic ""vest"" and five minutes on your ugly buck teeth. And I've got a whole HBO special's worth on your fat mamma."
145181,559,38,191000,Nelson Muntz,BART'S CLASSROOM,My mom can't afford to be fat -- she's an exotic dancer!
145182,559,39,196000,MR. LASSEN,BART'S CLASSROOM,"And in what exotic location does she ""dance?"""
145183,559,40,199000,Nelson Muntz,BART'S CLASSROOM,"""A Touch of Class."" But the ""cl"" fell off."
145184,559,41,202000,MR. LASSEN,BART'S CLASSROOM,"Son... there was never a ""cl."""
145185,559,42,202000,Nelson Muntz,BART'S CLASSROOM,I-I think I always knew that.
145186,559,43,207000,Milhouse Van Houten,BART'S CLASSROOM,"Bart, this guy served two tours in middle school! Abort prank!"
145187,559,44,212000,Bart Simpson,BART'S CLASSROOM,I will not. Anything to delay a spelling test!
145189,559,46,221000,MR. LASSEN,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Looks like I've got a prankster on my hands.
145190,559,47,225000,MR. LASSEN,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"You know, son, school code says a student's hair should be of uniform length."
145191,559,48,232000,Nelson Muntz,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,What're you gonna do to him?
145192,559,49,233000,MR. LASSEN,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Quiet. ""Smellson."""
145193,559,50,236000,Nelson Muntz,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Smellson? I prayed no one would ever think of that.
145194,559,51,242000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Ay carumba!
145196,559,53,244000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"How was your first day at school, Bart?"
145197,559,54,247000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Terrible.
145198,559,55,248000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You wanna talk about it?
145199,559,56,248000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
145200,559,57,250000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, thank you."
145201,559,58,251000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why are you wearing your hat at dinner?
145202,559,59,253000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,This new teacher I got gave me a haircut.
145204,559,61,255000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A haircut? Let me see!
145205,559,62,257000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
145206,559,63,259000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, you'll laugh at me."
145207,559,64,261000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I won't laugh at you. Let's see--
145209,559,66,267000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Look at me! I'm Bart!
145210,559,67,269000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We're sorry.
145212,559,69,277000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Stop that, all of you. It's not Bart's fault that his haircut looks so stupid."
145214,559,71,282000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't know that a teacher could cut kids' hair.
145215,559,72,285000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Teachers union won the right in their last strike.
145216,559,73,288000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm going to go to that school and talk to that teacher.
145217,559,74,292000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, please don't say anything. It never makes a difference and then the teachers give us stink-eye during the school fairs."
145218,559,75,299000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if he's gonna get a haircut, Bart should at least have gotten a balloon with it."
145219,559,76,304000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, anyway Bart, you'll cheer up on our camping trip this weekend."
145220,559,77,309000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What camping trip?
145221,559,78,310000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The one you booked for us at Owl Haven. The one you have to reserve a year in advance.
145222,559,79,317000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, uh... you told me not to do it a year ago. Remember?"
145223,559,80,321000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't remember that!
145224,559,81,323000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're right. No one could be expected to remember something from a year ago. Certainly not me. Pass the gravy?
145225,559,82,329000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't tell me you didn't reserve a campsite! Labor day is next weekend, there'll be nothing left!"
145226,559,83,336000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, there's always room at Buzzard's Roost."
145227,559,84,338000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Excuse me, but Buzzard's Roost is a converted parking lot."
145228,559,85,342000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Excuse me, but grass is poking through."
145229,559,86,345000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why do I ever put you in charge of the littlest thing?
145230,559,87,347000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Parking lot.
145231,559,88,347000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Poking through.
145232,559,89,348000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Parking lot.
145233,559,90,349000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Poking through.
145234,559,91,350000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My biggest sin is that I dare to hope.
145235,559,92,354000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Marge, I can't stand it when you cry at dinner. The pork chops look traumatized. The mashed potatoes can't stand watch. Even the children seem upset. So trust me, I will come through for you, baby."
145236,559,93,368000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Not you.
145237,559,94,370000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, what do you say, Marge?"
145238,559,95,372000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I want so much to believe you.
145239,559,96,375000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And I want you to believe me too. Isn't it great how much we agree?
145242,559,99,383000,MR. LASSEN,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Looks like our blackboard has been defaced. Lucky for you I can take a joke.
145243,559,100,391000,Lisa Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Hello? Hello? Is everything okay?
145245,559,102,394000,Milhouse Van Houten,Miss Hoover's Classroom,Heeere's Millie!
145247,559,104,397000,Lisa Simpson,LASSEN'S CLASS,"Excuse me, you ruined my report."
145248,559,105,400000,MR. LASSEN,LASSEN'S CLASS,Fine. You got an A.
145249,559,106,400000,Lisa Simpson,LASSEN'S CLASS,Oh! Yippee! Fourth-grade A!
145250,559,107,404000,MR. LASSEN,LASSEN'S CLASS,"You might fool some people ""El Barto,"" but not me."
145252,559,109,408000,MR. LASSEN,Springfield Elementary School,Now we're gonna learn about electricity. Hey livewire! Come up here.
145253,559,110,413000,MR. LASSEN,Springfield Elementary School,Touch the generator.
145254,559,111,418000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Even I think this is too far!
145255,559,112,420000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Quiet, Smellson!"
145256,559,113,421000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,It's sticking!
145258,559,115,429000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,I just need to get to sixty percent.
145260,559,117,437000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Milhouse, I am gonna get back at Lassen. Now ""The Hobbit"" taught us that every dragon has a chink in its armor."
145263,559,118,443000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"It also taught us that New Zealand's beautiful landscapes and attractive tax credits add up to a filmmaker's paradise. For more information, visit www.nzfilmhere.nz."
145264,559,119,467000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,Ach! Wrong order.
145265,559,120,473000,MR. LASSEN,Simpson Home,You seem lonely and kind of weird.
145266,559,121,476000,Miss Hoover,Simpson Home,You left out single.
145267,559,122,476000,Dewey Largo,Simpson Home,Mind if I heat up some goulash?
145268,559,123,480000,MR. LASSEN,Simpson Home,Let's continue this online.
145269,559,124,485000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've created a fake Miss Hoover profile. When Lassen friends her, we'll know everything about him."
145270,559,125,490000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"I don't know, Bart. You're lying about your identity? That's against the terms and conditions."
145271,559,126,496000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"We've all read the terms and conditions, Milhouse."
145274,559,129,499000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Look, I really need a campsite. My wife is making sandwiches!"
145275,559,130,504000,Park Ranger,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sorry, reservations are a year in advance."
145276,559,131,506000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What about Mosquito Cove?
145277,559,132,506000,Park Ranger,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Booked.
145278,559,133,508000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Skunk Canyon?
145279,559,134,508000,Park Ranger,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Booked every year since two thousand three.
145280,559,135,511000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Ooh! How 'bout the campsite where the guy in the hockey mask kills all the campers?
145281,559,136,515000,Park Ranger,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, that is a movie."
145282,559,137,519000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hello? Hello? This is Homer Simpson! 742 Evergreen Terrace, looking for a place for my kids and me! And my pretty, pretty wife!"
145283,559,138,528000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You know, alarm code three six seven nine. Three six seven nine!"
145285,559,140,534000,Nelson Muntz,Park,So I hear you're getting back at Lassen.
145286,559,141,537000,Bart Simpson,Park,Maybe I am. So?
145287,559,142,539000,Nelson Muntz,Park,"You've gotta do it, man. He preys on the weak. Now give me your lunch money!"
145288,559,143,545000,MR. LASSEN,Park,I'll take that.
145289,559,144,545000,Bart Simpson,Park,Here's Lassen's profile:
145290,559,145,553000,Bart Simpson,Park,What the?
145291,559,146,555000,Bart Simpson,Park,Tagged as Lassen!
145292,559,147,559000,Milhouse Van Houten,Park,It says these were taken at Blazing Guy. What's Blazing Guy?
145261,559,148,564000,Milhouse Van Houten,Park,"Oh, that's convenient."
145294,559,149,566000,DESERT HIPSTER,Park,"Helloha! Do you want to make your home in a self-sustaining city that only exists a few days a year? One that combines nudity, dust storms, children and all-consuming fires? Then you, my bro or bra, are dreaming of Blazing Guy!"
145295,559,150,587000,DESERT HIPSTER,Park,"On the last day, the chosen one, or Ignis, sets fire to the giant wooden Guy in a ritual dating back to nineteen eighty-six."
145296,559,151,600000,DESERT HIPSTER,Park,"The Blazing Guy Council of Elders, in conjunction with Duraflame, is very pleased to announce that this year's Ignis is Jack Lassen."
145298,559,153,610000,Bart Simpson,Park,"So if we go there with a camera to film Lassen humiliating himself, I'll get revenge for him making me into this!"
145300,559,155,617000,Bart Simpson,Park,I was trying to even it out!
145301,559,156,619000,Milhouse Van Houten,Park,You're starting to look like your Dad.
145302,559,157,621000,Bart Simpson,Park,Nooo!
145303,559,158,622000,Milhouse Van Houten,Park,I'm lucky. I just look like my Mom.
145305,559,160,630000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Gosh... that was a hard sleeping bag to roll up.
145306,559,161,634000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Those were your father's sweatpants.
145307,559,162,636000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I have a confession to make about this trip."
145308,559,163,640000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, don't worry, I got you a place."
145310,559,165,643000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Once again, I've been saved from any consequences. It'll keep happening till one day I create a mess so enormous it can't be cleaned up. Thanks, boy."
145312,559,167,656000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,A CAMPING WE WILL GO...
145313,559,168,657000,Marge Simpson,Freeway,BUT WHERE? I STILL DON'T KNOW!
145314,559,169,659000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,A PLACE THAT'S FILLED WITH SUN AND SAND / A DESERT STEAMPUNK DISNEYLAND / KEEP EXPECTATIONS LOWWW... / SWING LOW SWEET CHARIOT...
145316,559,171,674000,Homer Simpson,Desert,"Homer Simpson, I love you."
145318,559,173,690000,Lisa Simpson,Desert,A world of anarchic free expression!
145319,559,174,694000,Homer Simpson,Desert,Cars shaped like cupcakes!
145320,559,175,696000,Lisa Simpson,Desert,I'm home!
145321,559,176,699000,CUPCAKE MAN,Desert,"No, no, no. Don't blow me out, wise guy. Not in the mood."
145323,559,178,717000,Marge Simpson,Tent,I'm not sure this campground is family-friendly.
145324,559,179,720000,Homer Simpson,Tent,All camping is pointless. You drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds. I guess what I'm trying to say is: where's Maggie?
145326,559,181,732000,Marge Simpson,Tent,We brought Cheerios for you!
145327,559,182,737000,BLAZING GUY VETERAN,Tent,Now you know the wind does kick up here. Hope you went three feet down with your tent stakes.
145328,559,183,743000,Homer Simpson,Tent,"Uh, listen here, Desert Arnaz. Homer Simpson knows how to pitch a tent."
145329,559,184,752000,Homer Simpson,Tent,"Hey man, can I bum a tent?"
145331,559,186,755000,HIPSTER WOMAN,Tent,You seem stressed. Have some calming tea.
145332,559,187,758000,Marge Simpson,Tent,"Finally. A normal person. Thank you, Miss... um..."
145333,559,188,764000,HIPSTER WOMAN,Tent,Calypso Self-Knowledge.
145334,559,189,767000,Marge Simpson,Tent,Is that tea... adulterated?
145335,559,190,770000,HIPSTER WOMAN,Tent,Does that look like something I'd do?
145336,559,191,774000,Homer Simpson,Tent,Hey Marge!
145337,559,192,776000,Homer Simpson,Tent,We got a new tent from a guy who O.D.'d!
145338,559,193,781000,Homer Simpson,Tent,"Aw, let me get a picture of that."
145340,559,195,787000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Awww.
145341,559,196,788000,Worker,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I think Smitty's still inside!
145342,559,197,791000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Too bad he's missin' this!
145343,559,198,792000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,So many musical choices!
145344,559,199,795000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"A brass band... barbershop quintet?... the human kazoo... ooh, a drum circle!"
145345,559,200,818000,Drummer,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh... can I help you, freak?"
145346,559,201,821000,TUBA PLAYER,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No.
145347,559,202,827000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,There he is.
145348,559,203,829000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,His nipples are asymmetrical. This could ruin him!
145349,559,204,834000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Milhouse, everyone here is a total freak. We have to find a way to completely humiliate Lassen."
145350,559,205,839000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Get a picture of a restaurant check with no tip, put it online, say it was him. Kaboom, he's finished!"
145352,559,207,856000,Marge Simpson,NEW SIMPSON TENT,Suddenly this place doesn't seem so bad.
145353,559,208,861000,Homer Simpson,NEW SIMPSON TENT,This place is great. Just have to avoid these inseam-high cactuses!
145355,559,210,867000,Marge Simpson,NEW SIMPSON TENT,Ooh. Are you Mr. Clean?
145262,559,211,872000,Homer Simpson,NEW SIMPSON TENT,"Compared to the rest of these people, yeah."
145356,559,212,875000,Milhouse Van Houten,NEW SIMPSON TENT,So give the Tooth Fairy my forwarding address 'cause it's pretty loose!
145357,559,213,880000,Angry Man,NEW SIMPSON TENT,About time! It's the only phone.
