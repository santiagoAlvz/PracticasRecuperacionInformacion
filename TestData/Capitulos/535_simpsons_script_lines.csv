139239,535,105,488000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,"Wow, I'd love to help, but I did kind of have plans for tonight..."
139240,535,106,492000,Moe Szyslak,Apartment Building,You can't leave! I'm dealin' you in!
139241,535,107,496000,Moe Szyslak,Apartment Building,Full house?! You win again.

148611,535,119,581000,Homer's Brain,Swapper Jack's,"This simulation has been brought to you by your brain, a subsidiary of your penis."
139253,535,120,586000,Homer Simpson,Swapper Jack's,"Oh, yes, I am shopping for Maggie, our baby together, so this looks perfectly innocent."
139254,535,121,591000,Marge Simpson,Swapper Jack's,Why are you saying that?
139255,535,122,593000,Homer Simpson,Swapper Jack's,"Oh, you know how the first few weeks are: sleep deprived, walking around in a fog..."
139256,535,123,598000,Marge Simpson,Swapper Jack's,First few weeks of what?
139257,535,124,600000,Homer Simpson,Swapper Jack's,"Um, November."

139260,535,127,608000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Atoms Stadium,"Lisa. Guys, do you realize you're being exploited by this team?"
139261,535,128,612000,Cheerleaders,Springfield Atoms Stadium,Wha?!
139262,535,129,614000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Atoms Stadium,They sell your posters...workout DVDs...and all of your practices are broadcast on a webcam.
139263,535,130,625000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Atoms Stadium,"And some of the angles are loooooow. But don't worry, collective bargaining will enable us to secure concessions."
139266,535,131,635000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Atoms Stadium,"We're gonna push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em way, way back! All the way to a new con-tract! 'Cause union power is a fact! And we're..."

139270,535,135,656000,The Rich Texan,Springfield Atoms Stadium,"What? Why, that's Samuel Gompers talk! Now, little Missy, the only thing you should be organizin' is your dollies."
139271,535,136,665000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Atoms Stadium,"How? By size, brand, value? And don't even suggest race, 'cause I don't see that. I just see little people I own. What do you say, ladies?"
139272,535,137,675000,Cheerleaders,Springfield Atoms Stadium,Not right! Not fair! Let's say it with our hair!
139273,535,138,684000,The Rich Texan,Springfield Atoms Stadium,"Okay, fine. I'm gonna give it some thought, then say no in the nicest way possible."
139274,535,139,690000,The Rich Texan,Springfield Atoms Stadium,No.
139277,535,142,697000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Ooh, Good... nice... ""Beat Dallas."" Can never argue with that."

139279,535,144,705000,Nelson Muntz,Bart's Treehouse,My vest isn't the only thing that's ripped.
139280,535,145,709000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Bart's Treehouse,I am in the market for a backup mistress. Possibly two.
139281,535,146,713000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Have you kids seen your father? Surprised he's not here ogling these girls.
139282,535,147,718000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,He said he was going to work.
139283,535,148,720000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,On a Friday afternoon?! I bet he's playing poker again!
139284,535,149,725000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Coming through! Wife on a mission!
139285,535,150,727000,Cheerleaders,Bart's Treehouse,"Go, fight, win... Marge!"
139286,535,151,732000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Wow, I've never burst through a banner before, but it really does the trick!"
139288,535,153,738000,Marge Simpson,CARL'S APARTMENT BUILDING,"Homer! I know you're here, your car's outside!"
139290,535,155,742000,Marge Simpson,Carl's Apartment,Where is he?
139291,535,156,744000,Carl Carlson,Carl's Apartment,I honestly don't know. I'm just teaching myself massage here with online videos and a store mannequin.
139292,535,157,749000,Marge Simpson,Carl's Apartment,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
139293,535,158,752000,Carl Carlson,Carl's Apartment,"So, do you have any injuries I should know about?"
139294,535,160,756000,Marge Simpson,Apartment Building,"If he's not in there, where is he?"
139295,535,161,758000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,Oh baby!
139296,535,162,760000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,"Oh baby, shake it! Homer like!"
139299,535,165,765000,Homer Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,"Shake it! Now, roll over on your tummy, just like I taught you."
139301,535,167,769000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Hallway,Tell me what a cow says!
139304,535,170,773000,Homer Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,My other baby mama!
139305,535,171,775000,Marge Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,So this is where you've been going -- another woman's apartment.
139306,535,172,779000,Homer Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,"Marge, it's not what you think!"
139307,535,173,781000,GRETCHEN,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,Quiet! You're upsetting Homer Junior!
139308,535,174,783000,Marge Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,You have a baby together?
139309,535,175,786000,Homer Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,"Oh, it's cool. We did it in an elevator."
139310,535,176,789000,Marge Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,I'm a Schwarzenegger wife.
139311,535,177,791000,Homer Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,"But you're also the housekeeper, so it's all good."
139312,535,178,794000,Marge Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,It's not good! None of it's good!
139313,535,179,797000,Homer Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,I haven't had a drink for a week.
139314,535,180,799000,Marge Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,That is pretty good.
139317,535,183,804000,Marge Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,...so then you delivered her baby right there in the elevator.
139318,535,184,804000,Homer Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,It's true. Even the other guy in the elevator. He's right here.
139319,535,185,811000,Man In Suit,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,"Yeah, and the really funny thing is I'm a doctor."
139320,535,186,815000,Marge Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,"Well I'm glad you did a good deed, but you shouldn't come here again. I thought that was strange poop on your collar."
139321,535,187,823000,Homer Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,"Goodbye, Homer Junior. I guess you're the man of the house now. And never forget, even though the mortgage is due on the first you can usually wait till the seventeenth."
139322,535,188,835000,Marge Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,You know what? I think it's fine if Homer spends a few hours now and then with... Homer Junior.
139323,535,189,844000,Homer Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,Exactly. You always said charity begins at home -- but not which home.
139324,535,190,849000,Marge Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,"It's true, I never specified the home."
139326,535,193,852000,Homer Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,And now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me:
139327,535,194,890000,Homer Simpson,GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT,"SLEEP, SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP / SLEEP SLEEP / SLEEP, SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP!"
139329,535,196,899000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh man, I really overdid it tonight."
139330,535,197,903000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Late night at Moe's eh?
139331,535,198,904000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No. I'm exhausted from ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes. Knees and toes."" It's the ""toes"" that get ya, Marge. It's the toes..."
139332,535,199,912000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What about your own children?
139333,535,200,914000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Way ahead of you, Marge. I am taking all four of my kids to the zoo tomorrow."
139334,535,201,918000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Three.
139335,535,202,920000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes. We'll be back by three. Homer has a very tight nap schedule.
139336,535,203,923000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Quit talking about that baby!
139337,535,204,925000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I was talking about myself in the third person.
139340,535,207,930000,JOY,Simpson Home,"We can't take much more of this, Lisa. The girls are getting so antsy they'll cheer anything."
