42359,185,193,857000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oh, my God!"
42360,185,194,862000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Marge, how could you?!"
42361,185,195,865000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Apu, give it up."
42362,185,196,870000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Mother, I am so sorry. I lied to you about being married."
42363,185,197,873000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lied to his mother.
42364,185,198,876000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,But the fact that I would stage this ridiculous farce surely proves to you how much I do not want to go through with this arranged marriage.
42365,185,199,885000,Apu's Mother,Simpson Home,"I had no idea how strongly you felt, Apu."
42366,185,200,887000,Apu's Mother,Simpson Home,Now wipe that smile off your face. We have a wedding to plan.
42368,185,202,893000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know what you could do, Apu..."
42369,185,203,894000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Yeah, shut up."
42370,185,204,895000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You could fake your own death...
42371,185,205,897000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oh, would you shut up."
42372,185,206,898000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All you need is a car bomb and...
42373,185,207,900000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,I can't believe you don't shut up.
42374,185,208,906000,Apu's Mother,Simpson Home,"Yes, yes, Manjula, I will take care of all the wedding plans. You just get on the plane and come to America..."
42375,185,209,914000,Apu's Mother,Simpson Home,"I have to go. Believe me, I'd like to."
42376,185,210,922000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've been looking over this list of things for the ceremony. I've got the extra wine glasses, but I'm still short a tandoori oven, an elephant, and four castrati."
42377,185,211,933000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What's a castrati?
42378,185,212,935000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't know, but I'm sure it's spicy."
42379,185,213,937000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why is that woman still living here?
42380,185,214,939000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I unno.
42382,185,216,941000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, you seen Apu lately? He looks terrible."
42383,185,217,944000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, rumor has it Marge threw him out."
42384,185,218,947000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Aw, tough break. She's a beautiful lady."
42385,185,219,949000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"You got that straight, Barn."
42386,185,220,951000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,To Marge!
42387,185,221,953000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, what do you recommend for severe depression?"
42388,185,222,957000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Booze, booze and more booze."
42389,185,223,960000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Ha! Nothin' like a depressant to chase the blues away.
42390,185,224,963000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, you got that... / Oh yeah. / Uh-huh."
42391,185,225,965000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,"Oof, Manjula and I have not seen each other in twenty years. Two people cannot fall in love sight-unseen."
42392,185,226,973000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, hold on there! I'm countin' on that."
42393,185,227,975000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,"Well, just twenty-four hours of freedom left..."
42394,185,228,979000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Actually, it's more like twelve. No, I'm so stupid, seven. It's seven hours. You have seven hours. See? Seven."
42395,185,229,987000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Moe's Tavern,"""WELL, I'M HOT BLOODED / CHECK IT AND SEE / I'VE GOT A FEVER OF A HUNDRED AND THREE..."""
42396,185,230,999000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,C'mon. You shouldn't be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this.
42397,185,231,1005000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,You should be livin' like there's no tomorrow. And I know just the place.
42398,185,232,1009000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Ahh. Is this the life, or what?"
42399,185,233,1014000,Jasper Beardly,Moe's Tavern,You want me to turn on the bubbles?
42402,185,236,1020000,Lisa Simpson,Air India Terminal,"Which Bombay to Springfield flight is she on? The 10 o'clock, the 10:15, or the 10:30?"
42403,185,237,1025000,Clerk,Air India Terminal,"Oh, I am so terribly sorry, sir. It appears that your tiger has been sent to St. Louis."
42404,185,238,1030000,Siegfried,Air India Terminal,"Uh-huh, I should send you to St. Louis!"
42405,185,239,1033000,Roy,Air India Terminal,No! No! He's not worth it!
42406,185,240,1035000,Clerk,Air India Terminal,Can you please indicate your tiger-type on this chart?
42407,185,241,1041000,Roy,Air India Terminal,Number 6.
42409,185,243,1045000,Apu's Mother,Simpson Home,How's that fire ring coming? Is it sacred yet?
42410,185,244,1048000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Almost...
42411,185,245,1052000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Can you believe it? Tradition forbids me even to speak to the woman I am about to spend my life with. Hmf, has the whole world gone crazy?"
42412,185,246,1060000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nah, just your screwy country."
42413,185,247,1062000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Your old friend Apu is a lamb being led to the slaughter.
42414,185,248,1066000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Apu. Some day you'll meet someone you really love."
42415,185,249,1070000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oof, I am really doomed. Only the gods could stop this wedding now."

42417,185,251,1082000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"No, no, no, no, no. No pansies for me."
42418,185,252,1086000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's the tradition in India.
42419,185,253,1088000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Yeah, all right. It'll cover the gravy stains."
42420,185,254,1091000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Hey!
42421,185,255,1092000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Tradition.
42422,185,256,1093000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks for helping us out, Reverend. I know you've never performed a Hindu ceremony..."
42424,185,257,1098000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"Well, Christ is Christ. Plus, I consulted a Hindu web site."
42425,185,258,1111000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Hello, everyone... What a happy, happy day."
42426,185,259,1115000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Wow! I wish I had an elephant.
42427,185,260,1117000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You did. His name was Stampy. You loved him.

42434,185,267,1146000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Ooobviously not.
42435,185,268,1150000,Ganesh,Simpson Home,"I am the god, Ganesh! This wedding angers me. All will die unless it is stopped."
42436,185,269,1159000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oh, God."

42439,185,272,1168000,Ganesh,Simpson Home,Stop chasing Ganesh! You're just gonna get more wrath!
42440,185,273,1173000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm afraid this is all my fault, Manjula. To be perfectly honest with you, I have not exactly been looking forward to this arranged marriage."
42441,185,274,1182000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Nor have I. Marrying a complete stranger? It is crazy.
42442,185,275,1188000,Apu's Mother,Simpson Home,"All right, Ganesh has been subdued."
42443,185,276,1190000,Ganesh,Simpson Home,All will die...

42447,185,280,1206000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oo, that... that is good."

42449,185,282,1209000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oh, I am so torn. You are clearly so quick-witted and beautiful."
42450,185,283,1215000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"And when I look in your eyes, I see that sweet little boy who sold me my very first kiss... and I liked it."
42451,185,284,1223000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oh, do you think this marriage could really work?"
42452,185,285,1227000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Who knows? We can always get divorced.
42453,185,286,1231000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Of course! God bless America!
42457,185,288,1242000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Backyard,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, let me be the first to present to you, Mr. and Mrs. Apu Nahasapeemapetilan."
42458,185,289,1257000,Moe Szyslak,Backyard,"Aw geez, I am no good at weddings. I am no good at weddings."
42459,185,290,1276000,Indian Singers,Backyard,WHY DO BIRDS SUDDENLY APPEAR / EVERY TIME YOU ARE NEAR? / JUST LIKE ME / THEY LONG TO BE / CLOSE TO YOU...
42460,185,291,1276000,Lisa Simpson,Backyard,"Dad, those peanuts aren't for you, they're for the elephant."
42461,185,292,1280000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,Screw him.
42462,185,293,1282000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,Put me down! Ganesh commands you! Oh-ho-ho-ho!
42463,185,294,1286000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Backyard,"Well, so far, so good. Don't you think? I cannot wait to show you our apartment."
42464,185,295,1291000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Backyard,"Apartment? Oh no, no, no. You must buy me a house. And you're getting a haircut."
42465,185,296,1297000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Backyard,Oh!
42466,185,297,1298000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Backyard,Got you.
