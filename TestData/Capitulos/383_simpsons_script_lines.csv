99444,383,95,509000,Drill Sergeant,BASE,"Unfortunately, the demand for troops has never been higher, so we've gotta speed things up. While you've been standing here, your hair's been cut...and your clothes have been replaced with army fatigues."
99446,383,97,529000,Drill Sergeant,ARMY BASE,"Here's your nicknames: Brooklyn, Hollywood, Kissimmee-St. Cloud Florida, Maverick, Blanket Hog, Newman's Own, Master of Suspense, England's Rose, Nickname Pending, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Snowflake..."

99448,383,99,545000,Drill Sergeant,ARMY BASE,"A troublemaker, huh? You're gonna sit here and eat donuts, while the rest of the unit does push-ups."
99449,383,100,557000,Homer Simpson,ARMY BASE,I don't understand. How does punishing them teach me a lesson?
99450,383,101,561000,Drill Sergeant,ARMY BASE,"Just for that, they'll do the push-ups one-handed. While you eat Alaskan King salmon and I give you a foot rub."

99466,383,118,619000,Homer Simpson,MEETING HALL,I wonder what makes us so special.
99467,383,119,626000,Colonel,MEETING HALL,"Gentlemen, I'll be frank. Never before has the army accepted recruits with test scores as low as yours."
99468,383,120,635000,Homer Simpson,MEETING HALL,That's an odd way to start handing out medals.
99469,383,121,637000,Colonel,MEETING HALL,I'm not handing out medals. But I am gonna give you a special assignment. The Army is conducting war games and we want you to play the enemy.
148586,383,122,647000,Homer's Brain,MEETING HALL,Don't you get it? They're using us as patsies to make the Army look good.
99470,383,123,652000,Homer Simpson,MEETING HALL,Are we that stupid?
99471,383,124,656000,Cletus Spuckler,MEETING HALL,"Um, this avocado just gave me a wedding ring."
99474,383,127,667000,Marge Simpson,VISITING AREA,So they're not shipping you overseas?
99475,383,128,669000,Homer Simpson,VISITING AREA,Nope. I'm gonna stay here and let them test their laser-guided super weapons on me -- like that one!

99479,383,132,682000,Homer Simpson,Countryside,"Okay, these are war games and I'm head of my team. I have to think like a great military leader."
99480,383,133,689000,Cereal Captain,Countryside,Stay crunchy in milk!
99481,383,134,693000,Homer Simpson,Countryside,I will!
99482,383,135,694000,Homer Simpson,Countryside,"Stay crunchy, men! Stay crunchy!"
99483,383,136,699000,Colonel,Countryside,This'll be like shootin' cats offa gramma's sofa.
99485,383,138,705000,Homer Simpson,RIDGE,"Oh my God, I just remembered. It's Chinese New Year!"
99486,383,139,711000,Homer Simpson,RIDGE,Gung hay fat choi! Gung hay fat choi!
99487,383,140,716000,Homer Simpson,RIDGE,Americans!

99489,383,142,729000,Aide,RIDGE,"Sir, you can't just invade an American city without authorization."
99491,383,143,732000,Colonel,RIDGE,I sure as Hell can! Congress slipped it into the National Broccoli Day Proclamation.
99492,383,144,738000,Aide,RIDGE,I was wondering why you were carrying that thing around. I thought we were gonna have a day off or something.
99493,383,145,743000,Colonel,RIDGE,Think again! Now move out!
99495,383,147,757000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield,Is this war?
99496,383,148,759000,Southern Soldier,Springfield,No sir. Just a simulation.
99497,383,149,764000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield,This pain feels so real.
99498,383,150,766000,Southern Soldier,Springfield,"Uh, it is real."
99499,383,151,768000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield,Oh. Guess I'd better do my part.

99503,383,155,790000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Whatcha doin', Moe? Drawin' a wang on Marmaduke?"
99504,383,156,793000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Heck no -- I'm challengin' myself with one of these ""Sudoku"" games."
99505,383,157,797000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"What, that Japanese puzzle in which no numeral can be repeated in a row, column, or box?"
99506,383,158,802000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,That's how it works? I was just drawin' wangs on the numbers.
99507,383,159,807000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, Moe, you gotta hide us from the Army!"
99508,383,160,810000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,The Salvation Army? You got it.
99509,383,161,812000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Not that Army, the one from ""Stripes!"""
99510,383,162,815000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Okay.
99511,383,163,819000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Thanks, Moe. How can I ever repay you?"
99512,383,164,821000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, some things mean more to me than money..."
99514,383,166,825000,Moe Szyslak,COLONEL'S TENT,...like a whole lotta money!
99515,383,167,827000,Colonel,COLONEL'S TENT,Why'd you just say that sentence fragment?
99516,383,168,829000,Moe Szyslak,COLONEL'S TENT,"Eh, long story."
99518,383,170,837000,Colonel,Moe's Tavern,"War game's over, losers!"
99520,383,172,843000,Cletus Spuckler,BASEMENT,Hey! They's usin' live ammo!
99521,383,173,845000,Homer Simpson,BASEMENT,"Well, what have we got?"
99522,383,174,848000,Homer Simpson,BASEMENT,Rise my pretties! Find our enemies and capture their image in your filmy fortress!
99523,383,175,855000,Cletus Spuckler,BASEMENT,I think we ought to just go up there and surrender.
99526,383,176,859000,Homer Simpson,BASEMENT,I'm not gonna surrender. You've seen what the U.S. Army does to prisoners. How would you like to be stacked naked in a pile with a hillbilly girl pointing at you and laughing?
99527,383,177,867000,Cletus Spuckler,BASEMENT,That was our last Christmas card.
99528,383,178,872000,Homer Simpson,BASEMENT,"Yeah, Marge always loves your cards. Well, you may not be the smartest guys in the Army..."
99530,383,180,883000,Colonel,Evergreen Terrace,Homer Simpson! We've captured your unit! We're telling off-color jokes and laughing as a group. Come and join the fun bunch!
99532,383,182,892000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'd give anything to hear Homer's voice.
99533,383,183,897000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""H"" means ""hot""?!"
99535,383,185,903000,Homer Simpson,Bedroom,"Stupid Army, searching for me with that giant helicopter in the distance."
99536,383,186,908000,Marge Simpson,Bedroom,It's not giant and it's not in the distance! It's small and it's in our room!
99537,383,187,913000,Homer Simpson,Bedroom,Predator drone!
99540,383,190,991000,Colonel,ARMY COMMAND CENTER,This means war!
99541,383,191,992000,Aide,ARMY COMMAND CENTER,I thought it was already war.
99542,383,192,994000,Colonel,ARMY COMMAND CENTER,I hate you.
99544,383,194,996000,Colonel,Springfield Street,"Attention, Springfield! We are rounding up and detaining all men who are fat or bald, or have ever been amused by the antics of Homer Simpson."
99546,383,196,1008000,Gary Chalmers,Internment Camp,"Excuse me, I don't belong here -- I am not bald! I am balding! Why will no one honor the ding?"
99547,383,197,1016000,Seymour Skinner,Internment Camp,"I honor the ding, sir."
99548,383,198,1017000,Gary Chalmers,Internment Camp,What the hell are you talkin' about?!
99550,383,200,1022000,Aide,Springfield,"Sir, maybe we should just quit. This operation has cost over fifty million dollars since lunch."
99551,383,201,1027000,Colonel,Springfield,U.S. Government policy is very clear: Never back down. Never admit a mistake. That's why we've won over half the wars we've fought.
99552,383,202,1039000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"Mom, we've got to stop them from pacifying our town!"
99553,383,203,1044000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,Don't worry. I have a secret weapon -- one more powerful than any gun.
99554,383,204,1048000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,Lisa's face?
99555,383,205,1048000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,A phone tree.
99524,383,206,1052000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"Well, you'd better hurry. I don't think Dad can last much longer where he's hiding."
99556,383,208,1057000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Dorothy's daughter comes every Sunday and brings all kinds of wonderful soups.
99558,383,210,1063000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,And Melvin's son brings a banjo. And he works our names into his songs!
99561,383,213,1072000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, Helen? I'm calling about the recent destruction of our town. Well, I have a little plan to fix their wagon."
99563,383,215,1083000,Assorted Townspeople,Springfield,Hello? / Hello? / Etc.
99565,383,217,1089000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Yes Nelson, of course I'll help... And a haw-haw to you!"
99567,383,219,1092000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,So that's the plan: we're meeting at the reservoir at eight p.m.
99568,383,220,1097000,Ralph Wiggum,Krusty's Mansion,I flushed a potato down the toilet. Now we have to live in a hotel.
99569,383,221,1101000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Mansion,Terrific. Now call Lindsay Naegle.
99571,383,223,1109000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Reservoir,"Marge, why did you have us bring our liquor to the reservoir?"
