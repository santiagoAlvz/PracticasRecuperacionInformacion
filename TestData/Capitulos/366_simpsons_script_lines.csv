94920,366,69,414000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Grampa, we got a letter for Gramma."

94922,366,71,421000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""My dearest Mona. You've just left my arms to return to your husband, Abe, and already I ache for you."""
94923,366,72,423000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mona cheated on me?! I don't know how she found the time with her late-night pottery classes and supermarket trips that took all weekend.
94924,366,73,438000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, I'm not sure that letter is ""age appropriate"" reading. Why can't the government edit our mail like other countries?"
94925,366,74,446000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh-oh. ""I know I'm just a lifeguard, but I want you to run away with me. If you don't reply to this letter, I'll know that you've chosen to stay with Abe. But I know in my heart that the baby you're carrying is mine."

94928,366,77,452000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's ridiculous! That was my baby in her belly! Look how happy we were!

94932,366,80,479000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't care what that letter said. This man raised me single-handedly. When I think of all the things he's done for me... the many times he...
94933,366,81,490000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lifeguard, huh?"
94935,366,83,490000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So this guy might be my real father, and his name starts with ""M"". Moleman? Mr. Burns? M. Night Shyamalan? That would be a twist worthy of his increasingly lousy films!"
94936,366,84,507000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of course I'm your father -- here, mush up your face and you look just like me."
94937,366,85,512000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,See.
94938,366,86,514000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but that also works for the dog's butt."
94939,366,87,519000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, hello handsome!"
94940,366,88,520000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, this whole fatherhood issue could be resolved with a simple DNA test."
94941,366,89,525000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, nertz to that! Homer I fed you and clothed you till you were thirteen! If that's not a father, I don't know what is! I'll be waiting for your apology on the ""old man"" bench at the mall!"
94942,366,90,538000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I sit by the trash so people have to come up to me.
94944,366,92,543000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Finished your soda, eh?"
94945,366,93,545000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Ooh, your hair's lookin' sharp from the back!"
94947,366,95,550000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, what's wrong? Did those pork chops give you a tummy ache?"
94948,366,96,555000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The only tummy ache is in my head. I can't stop wondering who my real father might be.
94950,366,98,584000,Homer Simpson,Library,"There's only one lifeguard whose name begins with ""M""!"
94951,366,99,586000,Homer Simpson,Library,Mason Fairbanks...
94952,366,100,588000,Homer Simpson,Library,His hobbies are philandering... writing letters... and making up for lost time!
94954,366,102,598000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,"Okay, until you're sure this guy's cool, stick to your cover story. Oh, that sounds hard. Just do it!"
94955,366,103,607000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,Can I help you?
94956,366,104,609000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,"Uh yes, I'm a reporter with the local paper. I'm doing a story on people who... wear sweaters. Do you mind if I ask you some questions?"
94957,366,105,617000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,"I'd be delighted. But I must warn you, I don't wear a sweater every day."
94958,366,106,622000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,Interesting. Interesting.
94960,366,107,630000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,"So, I infer from all the knickknacks you're some sort of fruitcake."
94961,366,108,633000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,"No, actually I salvage valuables from sunken ships. Some call me a treasure hunter."
94962,366,109,640000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,"Oh, that is so cool! Ooh, a dish of shrunken heads!"
94963,366,110,644000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,Those are raisins.
94964,366,111,646000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,"So, you don't have any shrunken heads?"
94965,366,112,648000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,"Well, my hat size is a number six."
94967,366,114,652000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,"That is small, right?"
94968,366,115,654000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,It's smaller than average.
94970,366,117,658000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,And this is the lady in my life.
94971,366,118,661000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,"Uh... you know it's a boat, right?"
94972,366,119,664000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,Indeed I do. I loved a real woman a long time ago but uh... it didn't work out.
94973,366,120,671000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,I'm sure my listeners would love to know the story behind that name.
94974,366,121,675000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,Listeners? I thought you worked for a newspaper.
94975,366,122,678000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,No... I said I work for a radio station. Nine-eighty on the AM dial but number one with our viewers!
94976,366,123,684000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,Viewers? Wouldn't that be for a TV station?
94977,366,124,688000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,Uh... well I... I think you're my pappy!
94978,366,125,692000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,Wha...?
94979,366,126,694000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,"I found this letter you wrote to my Mom, Mona Simpson."
94980,366,127,698000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,"Dear God. I always dreamed this day would come. And now that it's here, there are so many feelings... I -- I..."
94981,366,128,706000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,Possible Daddy!
94982,366,129,710000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S HOUSE,I'm sorry... I got a little carried away there.
94983,366,130,713000,MASON,MASON'S HOUSE,Perfectly all right. Here's your gum back.
94985,366,132,718000,Local Announcer,Simpson Home,"Springfield Public Access Television presents ""The Bully Corner"" with Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney."
94986,366,133,723000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,"Good evening, dumbasses. Tonight our guest is Oscar nominee, William H. Macy. Welcome."
94987,366,134,731000,William H. Macy,Simpson Home,"Thanks for having me on, guys. You know, these public access shows remind me of independent film. Special people... not special effects. Big hearts... not big budgets."
94988,366,135,741000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Simpson Home,Very well put.
94989,366,136,741000,DOLPH,Simpson Home,Now get him!
94931,366,137,745000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,"So tell us, what's next for William H. Macy?"

94993,366,142,752000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Marge, I found my real father! His name is Mason Fairbanks, he has a knife just for cheese, and he talks like this ""Homer, please do that in the loo."""
94994,366,143,768000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Homie, you just met this British man. It's too soon to get so emotionally invested."
94995,366,144,775000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Hm, honey, you've given me a lot to think about... tomorrow, when we're on Daddy's boat!"
94997,366,146,782000,Bart Simpson,MASON'S BOAT,"Mr. Fairbanks, lookin' at your boat I gotta say, Gramma bet on the wrong horse."
94998,366,147,788000,MASON,MASON'S BOAT,"Now Bart, over the years, I've come to learn that the most valuable treasure is right here."
94999,366,148,795000,MASON,MASON'S BOAT,On this map.
95000,366,149,797000,MASON,MASON'S BOAT,These waters are home to a treasure lost hundreds of years ago -- the famed Emeralds of Piso Mojado.
95001,366,150,805000,Marge Simpson,MASON'S BOAT,"You know, if I was born three months later, emerald would be my birthstone."
95002,366,151,810000,MASON,MASON'S BOAT,"Yes, fate has a strange sense of humor. The emeralds were nestled in the bosom of a Spanish Galleon, returning home from the Caribbean..."
95004,366,153,823000,Spanish Captain,SPANISH GALLEON,We must pray to Santa Maria to save us!
95005,366,154,825000,Spanish Captain,SPANISH GALLEON,"Santa María de Guadalupe, Mística Rosa, intercede por la Iglesia..."
95006,366,155,832000,Spanish Captain,SPANISH GALLEON,One of you was not praying!
95007,366,156,834000,Spanish Sailor,SPANISH GALLEON,It was me! I was thinking of a joke I heard!
95008,366,157,837000,Spanish Captain,SPANISH GALLEON,Why you little...!
95010,366,159,846000,MASON,MASON'S BOAT,And now that treasure is somewhere down there.
95011,366,160,850000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S BOAT,"Wow, that story had everything: action, treasure, water, a guy... would you like to come to our house for dinner?"
95012,366,161,857000,MASON,MASON'S BOAT,"I'd be delighted. I've dined with the Prince of Wales, and with killer whales. But only the latter knew how to chew without humming."
95020,366,171,883000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen, old-timer, I'd like you to meet Mason Fairbanks."
95021,366,172,888000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,You! First you stole my wife... and now you're tryin' to steal my family!
95022,366,173,894000,MASON,Simpson Home,"Perhaps I couldn't have stolen anyone, had you given them what they needed."
95023,366,174,899000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I was busy telling young people to get a haircut.
95024,366,175,903000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mason, come see my room!"
95025,366,176,904000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, look what this is doing to Grampa. We have to settle this question once and for all with a paternity test."
95026,366,177,912000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll take any test you want! Eye test, PAP test, memory test, memory test, Vinnie Testaverde, Ferrari Testarossa..."
95027,366,178,919000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Grampa, stop."
95028,366,179,920000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Never! President's Physical Fitness Test, Sealtest Ice Cream, Testor's Airplane Glue..."
95030,366,181,927000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Now, Homer, I'll compare your sample to the ones from Grampa and Mr. Fairbanks... then, bingo: Who's Your Daddy! will become abundantly clear. I've prepared a t-shirt for you that covers either eventuality."
95032,366,183,945000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,I have the results.
95033,366,184,947000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Oh God.
95034,366,185,948000,MASON,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Whatever happens, Abe, I hope we can be civil about this."
95035,366,186,951000,Grampa Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Aw, poop in your fist!"
95036,366,187,952000,MASON,Dr. Hibbert's Office,At least I can make both.
95038,366,189,956000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Homer's biological father is... Mason Fairbanks.
95040,366,191,962000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Who's Mason Fairbanks?
95041,366,192,964000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,This guy.
95042,366,193,964000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Woo hoo!
95044,366,195,974000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"See, Abe, we're still visiting you, even though we have no biological obligation."
95045,366,196,981000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,You've said that three times already!
95046,366,197,984000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well, then you think of something!"
95047,366,198,990000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"I guess Homer couldn't make it, huh?"
95048,366,199,993000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"No, but he told us to say hi. Hi!"
95049,366,200,999000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,So... what setting is that fan on?
94609,366,201,1004000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Medium.
95050,366,202,1008000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,I would have guessed low.
95051,366,203,1012000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,You would've guessed wrong.
95053,366,205,1016000,MASON,MASON'S BOAT,Today I'm filled with joy: searching for treasure with my long-lost son. My dream for each of you is that you find the happiness I feel today.
95054,366,206,1028000,Homer Simpson,MASON'S BOAT,And my dream is to someday wear a real wetsuit instead of one that is just painted on.
95055,366,207,1032000,Painter,MASON'S BOAT,Missed a spot.
95056,366,208,1035000,Painter,MASON'S BOAT,There we go.
95058,366,210,1041000,MASON,Ocean,These waters contain some of Mother Nature's most stunning creatures.
95059,366,211,1051000,Homer Simpson,Ocean,"Ha-ha! That's what you get for being luminous, jerks!"
