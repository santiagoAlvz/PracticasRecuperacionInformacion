15409,85,26,170000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's wrong?
15410,85,27,170000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job.

15419,85,36,205000,C. Montgomery Burns,PLANT,I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party. I must harness his fractured take on modern life.

15427,85,43,228000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday.
15428,85,44,235000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr. Burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn Dad a special place in the old man's heart."
15429,85,45,242000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. I paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants."
15433,85,49,252000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent...

15439,85,55,274000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer! You've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss."
15440,85,56,278000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. Hey Flanders, you smell like Manure!"
15441,85,57,288000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Uh-oh. Better cancel that dinner party tonight. Thanks for the nose-news, neighbor."

15462,85,79,388000,Waylon Smithers,NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BALLROOM,"I have some sad news to report. A small puppy, not unlike Lassie was just run over in the parking lot."
15463,85,80,394000,Waylon Smithers,NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BALLROOM,And now it's time for the comedy stylings of Homer Simpson!

15480,85,97,450000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again."
15481,85,98,461000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'd like to believe that this time. I really would.
15482,85,99,465000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, run down to the store and get a big bag of ice for your father."
15483,85,100,467000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes'm. Dad, I know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can."

15485,85,102,477000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I knew it.
15488,85,104,477000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Warehouse,"Look at all the wonderful things you have, Mr. Burns. King Arthur's Excalibur. The only existing nude photo of Mark Twain, and that rare first draft of the constitution with the word ""suckers"" in it."
15489,85,105,488000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Warehouse,"Yes, yes, yes. So what?"
15490,85,106,488000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Warehouse,"You want your bear, Bobo, don't you?"
15491,85,107,492000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Warehouse,"Liar! I'll give you the thrashing of a lifetime! Resistance is futile. Oh God, how I only want my bear. But he's gone. Gone forever. I'd give anything to know what happened to him."

15494,85,110,531000,Explorer,Burns's Warehouse,You've got to start selling this for more than a dollar a bag. We lost four more men on this expedition.
15495,85,111,558000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Burns's Warehouse,"If you can think of a better way to get ice, I'd like to hear it."

15504,85,120,601000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,It's me sir. Bobo. Hug me. Squeeze me. Tug at my fur.
15505,85,121,605000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Enough. Stop this grotesque charade. Now find my Teddy.
15506,85,122,609000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Oh, and uh... leave the costume."
15509,85,125,619000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"The Burns Bear, perhaps the most valuable widdle bear in the world, could be anywhere. It could be in your house. You could be looking at it right now."
15510,85,126,629000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"It could be right in front of your face as I'm saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps being held up by a loved one."
15511,85,127,629000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down."
15512,85,128,640000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Moldy!?! Old!?!... I'm gonna get something to eat!
15516,85,130,645000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Burns Manor,"Well, it's not your original bear, of course. But it Is programmed to be just as cuddly. Oh dog gone it..."
15517,85,131,649000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Burns Manor,It's supposed to be doing a little dance.
15518,85,132,656000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Get this bear off...
15519,85,133,659000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Burns Manor,I'm trying to turn it off.
15520,85,134,661000,Bear,Burns Manor,"No, bear want to live."
15523,85,137,686000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How long have we had these fish? Wait! The bear! Burns' bear!
15524,85,138,696000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Bobo"". It's Mr. Burns' bear all right."
15525,85,139,700000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, I'll tell you that. He's going to have to give me... my own recording studio."

15527,85,141,713000,Voice,Simpson Home,"Homer, you're drooling on the mic again."
15528,85,142,717000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I think we should just give him the bear that he cherishes so much.
15529,85,143,722000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmm, better sew that eye back on."
15530,85,144,729000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No. Let's send Burns the eye in the mail. He'll pay more money if he thinks the bear is in danger.
15531,85,145,732000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes. We'll send the eye.
15532,85,146,736000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward. And then we'll make him double it.
15533,85,147,743000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well why can't I be greedy once in awhile?
15535,85,149,745000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Bobo! My beautiful Bobo! I promise I'll never leave you behind again.
15536,85,150,750000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Ah, yes. Naturally I can't pay you much of a reward because... I'm strapped for cash."
15537,85,151,760000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"As you can see, this old place is falling apart. But I'm sure we can come to an understanding."
15538,85,152,768000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Yes sir. Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer.
15539,85,153,774000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,May I offer you a drink?
15540,85,154,774000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Sorry, Burns. No deal."
15541,85,155,774000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Don't worry, Smithers, he's playing hard ball now. But it won't take him long to crack."
15543,85,157,786000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I gotta call Burns! I gotta call Burns. Maybe I can still get that drink!
15487,85,158,794000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, the longer he has to wait, the more he'll pay."
15514,85,159,796000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Right. That makes sense.
15515,85,160,799000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No! Lemme go!
15545,85,161,799000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I knew you'd come crawling back.

15559,85,175,850000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, big deal. Who needs his money? We're gettin' by okay."
15560,85,176,857000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son! You've gotta help me! I hit three people on the way over here, and I don't have any insurance. So, hows 'bout you?"
