147795,44,18,165000,TROY,Simpson Home,"I'm afraid you're gonna have to do better, Doctor."
3592,44,19,169000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, give us a break, Doctor."
3593,44,20,171000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Simpson Home,"But Troy, how can I make it lower than thirty-nine ninety-five."

3616,44,44,252000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we're going to the beauty parlor. Maybe you should do something with the kids while I'm gone."
3617,44,45,256000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh sure, great idea. I'd love to -- Did you hear that?"

3640,44,73,375000,Patty Bouvier,Fabrizio's Salon,"Look at this. ""Test your F.Q. -- Fatherhood Quotient"". Maybe you should try it on Homer. He'll fail it."
3641,44,74,383000,Selma Bouvier,Fabrizio's Salon,Uh-huh. In a second.
3642,44,75,385000,Marge Simpson,Fabrizio's Salon,I don't know.
3643,44,76,386000,Selma Bouvier,Fabrizio's Salon,"Now Henry Winkler, there's a father. Listen to what he told a close friend. ""I don't always keep my cool like `The Fonz', but my love for my kids has given me plenty of 'Happy Days'."""
3645,44,78,401000,Football Announcer,Simpson Home,"... They called him ""The Galloping Gazelle."" His habitat: the frozen tundra of Soldier Field.

3646,44,79,420000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, we're back."
3647,44,80,424000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Don't mind that clod, Patty. You could turn the world on with your smile."

3654,44,87,456000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"They want a name, Homer, not a vague description."
3655,44,88,458000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay. Hank.
3656,44,89,460000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hank?! Hank who?
3657,44,90,462000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hank... Jones.
3658,44,91,463000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you made that up. Question two: ""Who is your son's hero?"""
3659,44,92,465000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Steve McQueen.
3660,44,93,469000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's your hero. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
3661,44,94,470000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Next.

3663,44,96,474000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord."
3664,44,97,477000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He hasn't done that since he was two.
3665,44,98,479000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Then he has no hobbies.
3666,44,99,480000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh really? Well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see."
3667,44,100,486000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart!... BART!!!
3668,44,101,488000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What?
3669,44,102,489000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You don't have any hobbies, do you boy?"
3670,44,103,490000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, not really."
3671,44,104,491000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing?"
3672,44,105,494000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Building a Soap Box Derby racer.
3673,44,106,496000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that's a hobby!"

3680,44,113,529000,Dave,Simpson Home,National Fatherhood Institute. Dave speaking.
3681,44,114,532000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero.
3683,44,115,535000,Dave,Simpson Home,"Good Lord, a zero! Lona, cancel my one o'clock. Mr. Simpson, we'll send a wood paneled station wagon over for you immediately."
3684,44,116,541000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Hey Bart, where'd you get the lumber?"
3685,44,117,544000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, as three-time soapbox derby champ Ronnie Beck says, ""Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine."""
3686,44,118,544000,Martin Prince,Simpson Home,A conventional design.
3687,44,119,551000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin?"
3688,44,120,554000,Martin Prince,Simpson Home,"In between some other projects. Well, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I've booked some time at the wind tunnel."
3689,44,121,565000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Goodbye, son."
3690,44,122,566000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Hey Bart, I think they're finally hauling your dad away."
3691,44,123,569000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe it's for the best.
3693,44,125,580000,Dave,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,"For starters, Mr. Simpson, won't you take this complimentary copy of ""Fatherhood"" by Bill Cosby."
3694,44,126,586000,Homer Simpson,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,"Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold."
3695,44,127,588000,Dave,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,"Mr. Simpson, if you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son."
3696,44,128,593000,Homer Simpson,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,"Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son?"
3697,44,129,599000,Dave,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,Why don't you ask him yourself?
3698,44,130,600000,Dave,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,"Homer, meet Dave Jr."
3699,44,131,602000,Homer Simpson,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,Huh?
3700,44,132,603000,Dave,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,"How's your research coming, son?"
3701,44,133,604000,DAVE JR.,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,I think we're near a breakthrough.
3702,44,134,606000,Dave,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,Good work.
3703,44,135,606000,DAVE JR.,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,"Thanks, Dad."
3704,44,136,608000,Homer Simpson,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,"Oh, how I envy you!"
3705,44,137,609000,Dave,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,"Homer, that easy back and forth that you just witnessed didn't happen over night. It took years of effort."
3706,44,138,614000,Homer Simpson,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,I've never been afraid of a little hard work.
3707,44,139,616000,Dave,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,"Aw, that's the spirit, Mr. Simpson. Now step one is to find an activity the two of you can share. Does the boy have any interests?"
3708,44,140,622000,Homer Simpson,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,What boy?
3709,44,141,623000,Dave,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,Your son. Find something he likes to do and share in it.
3710,44,142,627000,Homer Simpson,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,"Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer."
3711,44,143,630000,Dave,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,"Aw, that would be perfect."
3712,44,144,633000,Dave,NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE,Dear God! Not again.
3714,44,146,636000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer.
3715,44,147,639000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, but I'm almost done. Why don't you get back on the couch and watch TV?"
3716,44,148,643000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay. No, I'm gonna do it."
3717,44,149,646000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad's help."
3718,44,150,650000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree.
3719,44,151,665000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you."
3720,44,152,668000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on Dad, it'd be weird."
3721,44,153,670000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second.
3722,44,154,677000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmm... ""Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" Huh?"
148524,44,155,687000,Homer's Brain,Simpson Home,Don't you get it? You gotta use a reverse psychology.
3723,44,156,690000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that sounds too complicated."
148525,44,157,692000,Homer's Brain,Simpson Home,Okay. Don't use reverse psychology.
3724,44,158,694000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, I will! Son, I don't think you should let me help you."
3725,44,159,699000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes."
3726,44,160,702000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!"
3727,44,161,733000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit."
3730,44,164,756000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"I like our chances, son."
3731,44,165,758000,Official,Springfield,"Ugh. Your father is not supposed to help build your racer, but you should at least consult him about it."
3733,44,167,763000,Official,Springfield,"You're in heat four. Whoa, where's your helmet, son?"
3734,44,168,766000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Helmets are for wusses, Sir."
3735,44,169,767000,Official,Springfield,I don't think I can let you go without a safety helmet.
3737,44,170,770000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,This is my son and if he doesn't want to wear one you can't make him!
3738,44,171,774000,Official,Springfield,"Okay, fine. I want to get out of here sometime today."
3739,44,172,777000,Martin Prince,Springfield,"Attention, everyone. I say to those who question the value of the space program... Behold!"
3740,44,173,786000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,Aye carumba!
3741,44,174,789000,Official,Springfield,"Hey, you're not supposed to smoke in the pit area."
3742,44,175,791000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,Fine.
3743,44,176,794000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,"Hey, Simpson, where's your loser-mobile?"
3744,44,177,796000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!"
3745,44,178,799000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"It's over there, Nelson."
3746,44,179,803000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,"Whoa, talk about your pieces of crap."
3747,44,180,805000,Martin Prince,Springfield,"You know, Bart, I don't care who wins, as long as one of us beats that guy."
3748,44,181,810000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,"Careful, boys. It took me months to steal that bumper."
3749,44,182,814000,Voice From Trunk,Springfield,Help! Help!
3750,44,183,815000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,What was that?
3751,44,184,816000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,You didn't hear nothin'.
3752,44,185,818000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Are you nervous son?
3753,44,186,820000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Don't worry, Dad, as three time Soap Box derby champion Ronnie Beck says, ""Gravity is my co-pilot."""
3754,44,187,820000,Weasel #1,Springfield,"Hey boss, just in case you need it."
3755,44,188,828000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,Thanks guys.
3756,44,189,832000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,Now get out of here.
3757,44,190,833000,Martin Prince,Springfield,Oh my. I didn't realize this hill was so high. Could I have another minute -- Aaah!
3758,44,191,837000,Martin Prince,Springfield,Aieee!
3759,44,192,862000,Martin Prince,Springfield,"Deploy, damn you, deploy!"
3761,44,194,873000,Martin Prince,Hospital,It hurts! It hurts! Owee-owee-owee-ow!
3762,44,195,879000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Young man, I'm afraid this stress fracture will require you to be in a cast for six weeks."
3763,44,196,884000,Martin Prince,Hospital,But that means I can't possibly race!
3764,44,197,886000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Son, you're lucky to be alive."
3765,44,198,887000,Martin Prince,Hospital,"Save your palliative cliches for the next poor sap, Doctor."
3766,44,199,891000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,Is it okay to visit?
3767,44,200,893000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,Of course.
3768,44,201,894000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,"Hey man, cool crash. Way to cheat death."
3769,44,202,896000,Martin Prince,Hospital,"Thanks, Bart."
3770,44,203,899000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,"You had the best stick out there, man. I wish I could build 'em like you."
3771,44,204,903000,Martin Prince,Hospital,That racer transformed me into the twisted creature you see before you. I'll never race again.
3772,44,205,910000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,"If you don't race, then Nelson'll win!"
3773,44,206,912000,Martin Prince,Hospital,"Even if I wanted to, I'm in no shape to do it. Unless... Bart, will you drive my car?"
3774,44,207,920000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,"Oh, I don't know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone else's it'd kill him. On the other hand... I'll do it."
3776,44,209,928000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay Bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks..."
3777,44,210,934000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad... I don't know how to say this, but I don't want to drive your car. It's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart..."
3778,44,211,942000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we're Team Simpson."
3779,44,212,946000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win."
3780,44,213,949000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,When did I ever teach you that?
3781,44,214,950000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martin's car I can win. I'm sorry, but..."
3782,44,215,955000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad."
3783,44,216,961000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll just sit here in ""Li'l Lightnin'"" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son."
3784,44,217,975000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow.
3785,44,218,983000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, can you take me to Dr. Hibbert's office?"
3786,44,219,985000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why? What's wrong?
3787,44,220,986000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there."
3788,44,221,994000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa?"
3792,44,225,1009000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Waiting Room,"Martin, your bone is healing nicely."
3793,44,226,1011000,Martin Prince,Dr. Hibbert's Waiting Room,Tell me something I don't know.
3794,44,227,1014000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Waiting Room,"Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker!"
3796,44,228,1018000,Martin Prince,Dr. Hibbert's Waiting Room,"Mr. Simpson, you have every right to be angry. But rest assured, your son loves you..."
3797,44,229,1027000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Waiting Room,You certainly gave that boy the heebie-jeebies.
3800,44,232,1037000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, aren't you coming?"
3801,44,233,1038000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
3802,44,234,1039000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, don't pout."
3803,44,235,1040000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm not pouting, you are."
3804,44,236,1042000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you gotta come. I just got your hat out of the fridge."
3805,44,237,1045000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sorry.
3806,44,238,1046000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't you at least have something to say to Bart?
3807,44,239,1049000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No. Can't think of a thing.
3808,44,240,1051000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer! I've always said you were a good father. I've always defended you when people put you down.
3809,44,241,1057000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,That's for sure.
3810,44,242,1057000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,She ain't lyin'.
3811,44,243,1060000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But I guess I was wrong. You are a bad father.
3812,44,244,1063000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Leave me alone.
3813,44,245,1070000,British Commentator,Simpson Home,"Good morning, everybody, and welcome to an event that harkens back to the carefree days of the Great Depression -- The Soapbox Derby."

3819,44,251,1113000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Shut up Flanders. Flanders!
3820,44,252,1116000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating?"
3821,44,253,1121000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well sir, there are two schools of thought..."
3822,44,254,1123000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Great, thanks."
3823,44,255,1124000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I talked to Flanders about parenting. I'm a perfect father. Hold on, son, I'm-a coming!"
3825,44,257,1134000,Barney Gumble,SOAPBOX DERBY TRACK,My friend and I have a bet -- Are you Mary Tyler Moore?
3682,44,258,1142000,Barney Gumble,SOAPBOX DERBY TRACK,"Wow, it really is you."
3826,44,259,1145000,Martin Prince,SOAPBOX DERBY TRACK,"Bart, if she breaks up on you, steer away from the grandstands, or else you might kill hundreds of innocent spectators. Bart what did I just tell you?"
3827,44,260,1153000,Bart Simpson,SOAPBOX DERBY TRACK,Kill spectators.
3828,44,261,1155000,Martin Prince,SOAPBOX DERBY TRACK,What is the matter with you?
3829,44,262,1157000,Bart Simpson,SOAPBOX DERBY TRACK,"It's my dad. Lying there on the couch drinking a beer, staring at the TV. I've never seen him like that."
3830,44,263,1163000,Martin Prince,SOAPBOX DERBY TRACK,Forget about your father. You're driving for me now!

3842,44,275,1260000,Martin Prince,SOAPBOX DERBY TRACK,"I might remind you both, I did design that racer. The driver is essentially ballast."
