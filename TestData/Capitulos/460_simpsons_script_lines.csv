119090,460,10,154000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Look at this electric bill! I'm not made of money! I'm made of man-meat and a skeleton!
119091,460,11,161000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's time to unplug these vampire appliances that plunge their prongs into our creamy white outlets to quench their unholy thirst for electrons. Lamp, computer, Jacob's Ladder..."
119092,460,12,176000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How long has this been running?
119094,460,14,178000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, while I agree reducing consumption is great, it's hard to make permanent changes in your lifestyle."
119095,460,15,184000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you calling me fat?
119096,460,16,186000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No... I am suggesting you consider cheaper, alternate sources of energy."

119121,460,41,286000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yup, I Al-Gored it pretty good. Where's my Grammy for audio book narration?"
119122,460,42,296000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's making our meter run backwards!
119123,460,43,298000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh my goodness! It means we're traveling back in time! I can warn President Lincoln to dump his wife before she goes crazy!
119124,460,44,304000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, all it means is we're providing power to the electric company."
119125,460,45,308000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that's just great. I discover electricity and they want to take it from me!"
119126,460,46,314000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, local utility? You greedy bastards have gouged Homer Simpson for the last time."
119127,460,47,319000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"We will cancel your account, sir."
119128,460,48,321000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The Simpsons are off the grid! And so far it's going great!
119129,460,49,330000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Gentlemen, tonight's game is brought to us by something special. The kite's best friend, the flag's partner in patriotism, you've seen cherubs blow it from map corners -- the wind!"
119130,460,50,342000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,All right! / Blow me some sports!
119131,460,51,344000,Gulliver Dark,Simpson Home,"...PERILOUS FIGHT, O'ER THE RAMPARTS WE--"

119134,460,54,356000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What the? Who turned off the wind?
119135,460,55,358000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, if we're really off the grid, then we won't get power when the air is still."
119136,460,56,363000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh. Well I'm not crawling back to big electricity! From now on, the Simpsons are living intermittently."
119139,460,59,419000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My smoothie is a lumpy!
119140,460,60,421000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The wind may have stopped working, but my brain nev...er does. Check it out, gang."
119141,460,61,432000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"But Dad, it defeats the purpose if you're powering our windmill with the electricity from Flanders."
119142,460,62,437000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Homer, this meeting of your ""fan club"" is adjourned!"
119143,460,63,441000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But we haven't read the minutes of last week's meeting!
119144,460,64,446000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You used to be nicer!
119145,460,65,455000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,When is my turn over?
119146,460,66,457000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, please! I'm trying to hear Dr. House's third incorrect diagnosis before his final correct diagnosis!"
119147,460,67,466000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dear Lord, you've got the wind I need, I've got the prayers you crave. Let's make a deal."
119148,460,68,477000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,Kent's Weather Worriers are reporting gusts up to seventy-five...
119149,460,69,482000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now we're cookin' with wind!
119150,460,70,484000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, maybe this is too much electricity."
119151,460,71,487000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Nothing is ever right for you.
119152,460,72,489000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oh, why can't our house ever be that bright?"
119153,460,73,493000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,Nothing is ever right for you.

119160,460,80,507000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We're gonna go check out the wind damage!
119161,460,81,510000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Be careful! If you see a downed power line, do whatever it is people are supposed to do in that situation."
119163,460,83,520000,Store Owner,Springfield,Make it stop! Make it stop!
119165,460,85,526000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Look at the cool stuff that washed up!
119166,460,86,528000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Scuba goggles!

119171,460,91,550000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"Bart, can you believe that something so mighty has been rendered so powerless?"
119172,460,92,556000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,I'm gonna have my next birthday party on this thing.
119174,460,94,561000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Ay carumba.
119176,460,95,570000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"She's such a beautiful shade of blue... I'm going to call you Bluella the Whale."""
119178,460,97,576000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Check it out! World's biggest armpit fart!
119179,460,98,581000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,You just made a powerful enemy!
119181,460,100,586000,Lisa Simpson,Beach,"C'mon, everybody! A whale needs help!"
119182,460,101,589000,DOLPH,Beach,Why should we?
119183,460,102,590000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Beach,"Yeah, where was that whale when my Mom moved out?"
119184,460,103,592000,Lisa Simpson,Beach,Whales are mammals like us! They're sensitive and deeply intelligent!
119185,460,104,598000,Jimbo Jones,Beach,Nerd!
119186,460,105,601000,Lisa Simpson,Beach,I'm gonna get real help. Just try to keep her wet.
119187,460,106,607000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Beach,"Hey, Milhouse! Wanna learn more about whaling?"
119188,460,107,611000,Milhouse Van Houten,Beach,Sure!
119189,460,108,614000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Beach,"Hey, Milhouse! Want me to ""knock it off?"""
119190,460,109,615000,Milhouse Van Houten,Beach,I'm afraid to answer that.
119191,460,110,620000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Beach,Never tell a bully you're afraid!
119193,460,112,626000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Our wedding china's ruined.
119194,460,113,628000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We'll have to eat Thanksgiving dinner off regular plates like animals!
119195,460,114,633000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Mom... Dad... there's a whale on the beach... You've gotta help me get her back in the ocean!"
119196,460,115,640000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right -- let me get my tool belt.
119197,460,116,646000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Man, who are these belts made for, French supermodels?"
119199,460,118,653000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hurry, Dad, hurry!"
119200,460,119,656000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, can I talk to you for a second?"
119201,460,120,658000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure. Lisa, bring the car around."
119202,460,121,660000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But I don't know how to drive.
119203,460,122,662000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Haven't you learned anything from watching Bart drive?
119204,460,123,664000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,A little.
119205,460,124,665000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I happened to read about beached whales in Springfield Geographic. It usually does not end well."
119206,460,125,675000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We can't let Lisa get her hopes up.
119207,460,126,675000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, how hard can it be? We're just rolling it into the ocean from the beach. It's not like it's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a Mexican prison."
119209,460,127,687000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But that would make a great movie.
119210,460,128,692000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa is very sensitive. If something she loves dies in front of her--
119211,460,129,697000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That whale's not gonna die! We're busting him out of prison, no matter what you say, Escobar! God, this thing writes itself."
119212,460,130,706000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Coming!
119214,460,132,710000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"Okay, we'll need the town's strongest men to roll the whale back in the water."
119215,460,133,720000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Hm. We need a better idea. We'll have to find the town's smartest men.
119216,460,134,734000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,It's hard to believe anyone in that contest can be considered smart.
119217,460,135,740000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"One, two, three, tug!"
119219,460,137,752000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"Lisa, sweetheart -- it's almost dinnertime. Why don't you come home?"
119220,460,138,758000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,I'll catch up with you guys in a little bit.
119221,460,139,762000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"You know, when I'm sad, I read something beautiful and true: poetry."
119223,460,141,768000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"No, no, you'll like it. It's about the ocean."
119224,460,142,772000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"""The world below the brine / Forests at the bottom of the sea / the Branches and leaves... / Sea-lettuce, vast lichens..."
119225,460,143,776000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"Wake up, Lis!"
119226,460,144,785000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,They're doing it!
119227,460,145,788000,National Guardsman #1,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Dorsal straps secured!
119228,460,146,790000,National Guardsman #2,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Tail clamps in position!
119229,460,147,791000,National Guardsman #3,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Congratulatory T-shirts silkscreened and distributed!
119231,460,149,795000,Pilot,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Operation Desert Ocean is a go! Let's get this lady fish into the blue zone!
119232,460,150,800000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,It was my idea to put the whale in the water.
119233,460,151,804000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"Girl, you're going home! You're going home!"
119234,460,152,814000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"Goodbye, Bluella! Send me a post card from Tierra Del Fuego!"
119235,460,153,819000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Bye! Goodbye!
119237,460,155,832000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Bluella?
119238,460,156,836000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Oh no.
119240,460,158,836000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, honey. Right now she's lying on God's beach."
119241,460,159,854000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,She doesn't like lying on the beach! She likes being in the ocean!
119242,460,160,858000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Lisa, I'm sorry. I tried my best. I know it's really hard when you discover your dad isn't perfect."
119243,460,161,865000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Not perfect?! You can say that again.
119244,460,162,868000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm trying to be a sensitive father, you unwanted moron! Lisa, where were we?"
119245,460,163,874000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe I should just be alone a little bit.
119246,460,164,877000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Of course.
119247,460,165,880000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It kills me to see her like that. And if there's one thing I can't stand it's being killed.
119249,460,167,892000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"Milhouse, this'll be the biggest dead animal we ever poked with a stick!"
119250,460,168,895000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,If that flattened squirrel we poked last week could only see us now.
119251,460,169,906000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"All right, back up, everybody. Oh, but not too much. You are definitely gonna want to see this!"
119252,460,170,915000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"So clean, how part of it just disappears like that."
119254,460,172,931000,Mayor Joe Quimby,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"Citizens, today we honor Bluella the whale, along with the victims of the Great Whale Explosion."
119255,460,173,939000,Mayor Joe Quimby,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Could you please stop dynamiting?!
119256,460,174,942000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Sorry. I sat on the plunger.
119257,460,175,944000,Mayor Joe Quimby,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"But Bluella will live on among us as we make use of every part of her body, from blowhole to fluke."
119258,460,176,960000,Comic Book Guy,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"Behold, I am Captain Kirk from Star Trek One!"

119264,460,182,970000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, Lisa, I know you miss your whale. So I got you a pet that will never die. An invisible dog."
119265,460,183,977000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, look. He's doing his business."
119266,460,184,979000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey! Not on the rug! You bad dog! Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop biting my leg! Ow! Alright, that's it! You're going outside!"
119267,460,185,990000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bad dog! Stop!
119269,460,187,994000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,Bluella?
119271,460,188,996000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Street,"Oh hey there, Liser. Just oiling the old door here. Finally silenced that mournful wail."
119274,460,191,1027000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,No. I'm not gonna be disappointed again.
119275,460,192,1032000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
119277,460,194,1041000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"They must be Bluella's children! Hello, whale calves! Your mother lives on through you!"
119278,460,195,1047000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Huh?
119279,460,196,1052000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"Run! I mean, swim! I mean ."
119280,460,197,1063000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,"Those baby whales are doomed, just like their mom. I guess it's just nature's way."
119281,460,198,1071000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Nature is a toothless dying hag! We are gonna save those whale babies!
119282,460,199,1076000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,Dad? Where did you get that boat?
119283,460,200,1079000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BEACH,I'm taking it on a test drive from the boat store! Get in!
119285,460,202,1085000,Homer Simpson,OPEN WATER,Shark week just got cancelled.
119286,460,203,1088000,Male Activist,OPEN WATER,Drop the 'poon!
119287,460,204,1091000,Homer Simpson,OPEN WATER,Oh come on! Leave me alone! I'm trying to save your precious whales!
119288,460,205,1095000,Male Activist,OPEN WATER,We're not here to protect the whales -- we're here to protect the sharks!
119289,460,206,1098000,Female Activist,OPEN WATER,Did you know that over forty million sharks are slaughtered every year to make shark-fin soup?
119290,460,207,1103000,Homer Simpson,OPEN WATER,You like sharks?
119291,460,208,1105000,Male Activist,OPEN WATER,Being a true eco-activist means supporting every animal's struggle for life.
119292,460,209,1110000,Female Activist,OPEN WATER,Except for cockroaches... yuck!
119293,460,210,1111000,Male Activist,OPEN WATER,"Linda, please."
119294,460,211,1113000,Homer Simpson,OPEN WATER,Typical eco-jerks -- using words to talk!

119296,460,213,1122000,Lisa Simpson,OPEN WATER,"They're right. If the only way to save the whales is to kill another innocent creature, I can't let you do it."
