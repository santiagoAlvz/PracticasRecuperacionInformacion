126821,489,2,26000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,He opened his eyes! Mommm!
126822,489,3,61000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay... I'm on the floor... I can't move... so far a normal Sunday morning.
126823,489,4,183000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie... you're paralyzed. But we love you and will never give up hope.
126825,489,5,189000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Can his funeral be on a school day?
126827,489,7,192000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This is so horrible -- I can't speak...
126828,489,8,197000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"How did this happen? Last thing I remember, I was decorating the house for Halloween."
126829,489,9,206000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, Halloween. The one time of year when the squalor of our home works to our advantage."
126831,489,11,220000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Where's that spider?
126833,489,13,224000,Homer Simpson,BOX,"Squeeze, squeeze... squeeze, squeeze. A real spider would get so mad if I did this! I wonder if this thing has batteries."
126834,489,14,235000,Homer Simpson,BOX,It's alive?!
126835,489,15,237000,Homer Simpson,BOX,Ow!
126836,489,16,244000,Homer Simpson,BOX,Ow!
126838,489,18,244000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, at least I still look good."
126839,489,19,247000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay handsome, that's enough primping!"
126840,489,20,250000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Just because you've had a little setback doesn't mean you can't look your best.
126841,489,21,254000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Marge. This is the purest love there is: patient, supportive... ooh, cleavage!"
126842,489,22,264000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I'm going to entertain you with the help of ""The Brothers Karamazov."" ""Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov... a landowner well known in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper place."""
126843,489,23,282000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh my God! She's still on the first sentence! Must make her stop... how to express my...
126845,489,25,289000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Da-ad! Anyway, continuing: ""For the present I will only say that this 'landowner' -- for so..."""
126847,489,27,293000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ew, Dad! Wait a minute... Can you pass gas at will? Fart once for no, twice for yes."
126849,489,29,308000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh my God! Do you realize what this means?
126851,489,31,315000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it means that you can communicate!"
126853,489,33,319000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Exactly!
126854,489,34,322000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll recite the alphabet, and you tell me when to stop. A-B-C-D..."
126856,489,36,328000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, first letter ""D."" Next letter: A-B-C-D-E-"
126858,489,38,333000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""D, E""... Amazing! Oh, but before we continue..."
126859,489,39,340000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay: A--
126861,489,41,342000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""D, E, A..."""
126863,489,43,342000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Dearest Marge, though my body cannot move, my heart still beats and my brain still brains."""
126864,489,44,351000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I miss holding you in my arms more than my butt can say.
126865,489,45,356000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Perhaps someday there will be a cure. Although if it requires months of difficult physical therapy, I'll pass."""
126866,489,46,363000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""You are the shining light that gets me through my darkest hours. For further communication I will require more beans. I love you, baby."""
126867,489,47,370000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie..."
126869,489,49,374000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Shhh. Don't say a word.
126870,489,50,379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I guess my life isn't so bad. With the help of my loving family, I even published my first book...and I've finally reached a state of serenity and-- another spider!"
126872,489,52,397000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh man, what's this bite gonna do? My wrists are tingling... I feel new powers surging within me..."
126874,489,54,413000,Bank Robber #1,Downtown Springfield,He's got the proportionate strength of a paralyzed spider!
126875,489,55,418000,Bank Robber #2,Downtown Springfield,Forget paying for my kid's operation -- I'm outta here!
126876,489,56,424000,Chief Wiggum,Downtown Springfield,"They say no two ass-webs are the same. Beautiful, in its way."
126877,489,57,430000,Marge Simpson,Downtown Springfield,Wanna go home and celebrate?
126880,489,60,442000,Injured Cast Member,Downtown Springfield,I wish I could move like him.
126881,489,61,452000,Ned Flanders,Downtown Springfield,"Springfield. My home town. Pretty little place. Although, even the Garden of Eden could use a nice cleansing rain now and then."
126882,489,62,468000,Mrs. Muntz,Downtown Springfield,"Hey, whiskers. Wanna party?"
126883,489,63,470000,Ned Flanders,Downtown Springfield,Spend less time on your back and more time on your knees.
126884,489,64,473000,Mrs. Muntz,Downtown Springfield,"Have I lost my back-alley beauty? Well, those who can't do, teach."
126885,489,65,486000,Ned Flanders,Downtown Springfield,No more distractions. I have work to do.
126887,489,67,533000,Ned Flanders,SPRINGFIELD LAKE,"All these years I thought murder was a sin. Then, I got new instructions from the good Lord Himself, through my bible: in his favorite language -- English."
126888,489,68,540000,Voice Of God,SPRINGFIELD LAKE,Slay Montgomery Burns and pee in his ashes!
126889,489,69,544000,Ned Flanders,SPRINGFIELD LAKE,"Are you sure, Lord?"
126890,489,70,546000,Voice Of God,SPRINGFIELD LAKE,"If you're having trouble with the second part, drink a lot of water. Now I've gotta go. A hip hop star is thanking me at the V.M.A.'s."
126893,489,73,566000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,And so white-bread Ned became the avenging sword of the Lord.
126896,489,76,582000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Peter, Andrew, James the Greater, James the Lesser, John, Philip, Thaddeus!"
126897,489,77,587000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Heavenly Father, I..."
126898,489,78,589000,Voice Of God,Flanders Home,"Quiet, you! Your next divine whack job is a twofer: I command you to kill Patty and Selma Bouvier."
126899,489,79,597000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Patty and Selma?! Sure they smoke, and they don't shave much of anything, but... do they deserve to die?"
126900,489,80,603000,Voice Of God,Flanders Home,"Do not question me, the star of the Bible! Now, on a non-murder-related note..."
126902,489,82,607000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"...I want you to find out what's making that funny noise in Homer Simpson's car. It's, uhhh, you know, it's like a chigga-chigga-chigga-chigga. But you only hear it when you're driving over thirty. And you never hear it when you take it to the shop."
126903,489,83,625000,Voice Of God,Simpson Home,Then it sounds perfect!
126904,489,84,627000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Yes, Lord."
126905,489,85,629000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, have you noticed how many of your enemies have died lately? Mr. Burns, Sideshow Bob..."
126906,489,86,635000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You forgot Patty and Selma. Oh, wait. That hasn't happened yet."
126907,489,87,638000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Patty and Selma?! Who's next, Ned Flanders?"
126908,489,88,642000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, how would that work?"
126913,489,92,660000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, Stupid Flanders, first I want you to kill that guy at the ice cream parlor who gave Homer Simpson a cone that had a little air in it."
126914,489,93,668000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Really?
126915,489,94,670000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Come on! God does crazy things! Check your Old Testament.
126916,489,95,672000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Dad."
126917,489,96,673000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Bart... I mean, Jesus. Hey son, you want Flanders to kill anybody? He's totally in my power."
126918,489,97,680000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... there's a tall boy in front of me in class so I can't see the board.
126919,489,98,683000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And I sayeth unto you... slay every tall boy in town!
126920,489,99,688000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah!
126921,489,100,689000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Homer Simpson!
126923,489,102,689000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,You made a killer out of me!
126924,489,103,693000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, and what are you gonna do about it?"
126925,489,104,695000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,I'm gonna kill you!
126927,489,106,695000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Because of you I'm going to Hell!
126928,489,107,695000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Language.
126929,489,108,701000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Hell! Damn! Backside! Nothing matters anymore! I'm goin' down and my hand-basket seats two!
126930,489,109,707000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Wake up, Flanders! There is no Hell, and there is no God. If there were, would He let me do this?"
126931,489,110,720000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little!... /
126932,489,111,727000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What happened?!
126933,489,112,728000,God,Simpson Home,Uh... Flanders killed Homer.
126934,489,113,731000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"But, but..."
126935,489,114,732000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But you're God. Couldn't you make everything the way it was?
126936,489,115,736000,God,Simpson Home,"Well, I could. But the big man downstairs wouldn't like it."
126938,489,117,744000,SATAN,Simpson Home,Get me a coffee!
126939,489,118,746000,God,Simpson Home,"Yes, sir."
126940,489,119,752000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Could this get any worse?
126941,489,120,755000,Maude Flanders,Simpson Home,"Honey, come back to bed."
126942,489,121,757000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oh, for cryin' out loud!"
126945,489,124,771000,Gary Chalmers,MILITARY BRIEFING ROOM,"People, you are on the most inhospitable planet in the galaxy. Extreme temperatures... vicious indigenous life forms... Are there any questions? Yes?"
126946,489,125,781000,Cletus Spuckler,MILITARY BRIEFING ROOM,Are we in Kansas anymore?
126739,489,126,781000,Gary Chalmers,MILITARY BRIEFING ROOM,No.
126912,489,127,784000,Brandine Del Roy,MILITARY BRIEFING ROOM,"Well, are we in Nebraska?"
126947,489,128,785000,Gary Chalmers,MILITARY BRIEFING ROOM,No! We're not in any state!
126948,489,129,788000,Cletus Spuckler,MILITARY BRIEFING ROOM,"Oh, oh, is it Michigan?"
126949,489,130,790000,Gary Chalmers,MILITARY BRIEFING ROOM,"Nobody talk anymore! You will now direct your attention to our C.E.O., Mr. Krusty the clown."
126950,489,131,796000,Krusty the Clown,MILITARY BRIEFING ROOM,We are here on this fakakta planet for one reason:
126951,489,132,796000,Krusty the Clown,MILITARY BRIEFING ROOM,"""Hilarium."" Spray this in an audience and they'll laugh at anything. And I need some now. Gotta play a Nazi party rally. Oh yeah, they're back."
126952,489,133,810000,Gary Chalmers,MILITARY BRIEFING ROOM,"Our spies will go planet-side, locate said Hilarium and contact us so that we may begin extraction. This is a delicate mission that requires utter loyalty. I can think of no better candidate than the resentful guy in the wheelchair who has just arrived."
126953,489,134,828000,Gary Chalmers,MILITARY BRIEFING ROOM,"Yes, I think this is gonna work out just fine."
126955,489,136,834000,Lisa Simpson,AVATAR LINKING STATION,All strapped in?
126956,489,137,836000,Bart Simpson,AVATAR LINKING STATION,Yep.
126957,489,138,839000,Lisa Simpson,AVATAR LINKING STATION,Now prepare to take an incredible journey across the room!
126958,489,139,846000,Otto Mann,AVATAR LINKING STATION,Yo.
126959,489,140,855000,Avatar Bart,AVATAR LINKING STATION,"Whoa! Check out this bitchin' bod! Oh man, if I could just have five minutes alone with my old bullies..."
126960,489,141,863000,Avatar Jimbo,AVATAR LINKING STATION,"Hey, avatard."
126961,489,142,864000,Avatar Bart,AVATAR LINKING STATION,Are you guys gonna beat me up?
126962,489,143,866000,Avatar Dolph,AVATAR LINKING STATION,"Naw, we can't."
126963,489,144,867000,Avatar Kearney,AVATAR LINKING STATION,These avatars cost eighty billion dollars each.
126964,489,145,869000,Avatar Jimbo,AVATAR LINKING STATION,But your human body costs nothin'.
126970,489,151,887000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,"C'mon, let's bond, you stupid jerk."
126971,489,152,891000,Avatar Milhouse,ALIEN PLANET,"That's a Japanese outlet, Bart. You need an adapter."
126972,489,153,898000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,Maybe I'll just take a taxi.
126973,489,154,900000,Taxi Dragon,ALIEN PLANET,"Where you go? Where you go? No meter, is cheaper, yeah?"
126974,489,155,903000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,No thanks.
126975,489,156,904000,Taxi Dragon,ALIEN PLANET,"Suit yourself, you one-eyed bastard."
126976,489,157,908000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,The only thing that looks good on this stupid planet are the bananas.
126977,489,158,914000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,Ay carumba!
124844,489,160,928000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,"Thanks, dude."
126325,489,161,930000,Female Alien,ALIEN PLANET,I am a female!
126576,489,162,931000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,You don't have to yell!
126979,489,163,933000,Female Alien,ALIEN PLANET,I am not yelling -- this is my seductive voice. I am called Kamala.
126980,489,164,939000,Avatar Milhouse,ALIEN PLANET,"Even when we're monsters, he gets the girl."
126981,489,165,939000,KAMALA,ALIEN PLANET,Fool! Every part of this world is alive! Apologize to sister rock!
126982,489,166,949000,Avatar Milhouse,ALIEN PLANET,"Sorry, sister rock."
126983,489,167,952000,KAMALA,ALIEN PLANET,"Now you've murdered our brothers, the flowers!"
126984,489,168,955000,Avatar Milhouse,ALIEN PLANET,Stupid! Stupid!
126985,489,169,957000,KAMALA,ALIEN PLANET,Now you're having sex with Uncle Tree!
126987,489,171,961000,KAMALA,ALIEN PLANET,Thank the Almighty Fungus you are wiser... and cuter than your friend.
126988,489,172,965000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,"Hey, what gives, man?"
126989,489,173,968000,KAMALA,ALIEN PLANET,And now let us touch testicles and mate for life.
126990,489,174,971000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,Don't you mean tentacles?
126991,489,175,972000,KAMALA,ALIEN PLANET,I know what I said!
126992,489,176,974000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,Aye Carumba!
126993,489,177,980000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,ALIEN PLANET,Today you are a man. Mazel Tov!
126995,489,179,988000,Avatar Bart,RIGEL 7,So... was it okay?
126996,489,180,990000,KAMALA,RIGEL 7,It was serviceable.
126997,489,181,992000,Avatar Bart,RIGEL 7,"Man, back on earth we don't have so many moons."
126998,489,182,996000,KAMALA,RIGEL 7,"What do you mean, ""back on earth?"""
126999,489,183,999000,Avatar Bart,RIGEL 7,"Uh... it's a place on the other side of this planet that's... very rainy so you can only see one moon. You know, like Portland."
127000,489,184,1008000,KAMALA,RIGEL 7,"I never hear of this Port-land. But on Rigel Seven, lack of eye contact and too many details indicate the telling of truth. I love you, sugar-slime."
127001,489,185,1023000,Avatar Bart,RIGEL 7,"Man, you are full of surprises."
127002,489,186,1026000,Avatar Bart,RIGEL 7,I can't believe I'm getting combat pay for this.
127003,489,187,1030000,Kang,RIGEL 7,"Well done, young man! Our daughter is with child."
127004,489,188,1033000,Kodos,RIGEL 7,Here. Feel the wonder of one million fetuses!
127005,489,189,1038000,Avatar Bart,RIGEL 7,You said you were using birth control!
127006,489,190,1041000,KAMALA,RIGEL 7,That only keeps me from giving birth while we are having sex.
127008,489,192,1045000,Avatar Milhouse,ALIEN PLANET,How do those mountains float?
127009,489,193,1048000,Kodos,ALIEN PLANET,They don't. They are falling.
127010,489,194,1050000,Kang,ALIEN PLANET,"Now that Kamala has ""a slug in the oven,"" we must make sure she gets her daily dose of Hilarium."
127011,489,195,1058000,Kodos,ALIEN PLANET,"Without it, her crankiness will become unbearable."
127012,489,196,1062000,Kang,ALIEN PLANET,Unfortunately our environment is too hostile to grow pickles.
127013,489,197,1066000,Kodos,ALIEN PLANET,And the only flavor ice cream we have is butter brickle.
127014,489,198,1070000,Kang,ALIEN PLANET,"To repeat: no pickles, butter brickle."
127015,489,199,1073000,Kodos,ALIEN PLANET,It is the Rigelian way.
127016,489,200,1075000,Kang,ALIEN PLANET,Would that it were not.
127017,489,201,1075000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,"So, where can I load up on this ""Hilarium?"""
127018,489,202,1077000,Kang,ALIEN PLANET,Listen closely.
127019,489,203,1079000,Kang,ALIEN PLANET,The Hilarium is found in the sacred secretions of the queen!
127020,489,204,1092000,Avatar Milhouse,ALIEN PLANET,We have located the Hilarium. Lock in on my signal.
127021,489,205,1096000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,Traitor! How dare you betray the planet I got laid on?!
127022,489,206,1102000,Gary Chalmers,ALIEN PLANET,They're all in one place. Let's fry these calamari and dip 'em in a sauce made of their own blood!
127023,489,207,1108000,Seymour Skinner,ALIEN PLANET,And wine from their own grapes.
127024,489,208,1111000,Gary Chalmers,ALIEN PLANET,That's not so bad.
127025,489,209,1112000,Seymour Skinner,ALIEN PLANET,It's a little bad!
127026,489,210,1119000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,"So Kamala, where do we keep all our tanks and planes and stuff?"
127027,489,211,1123000,KAMALA,ALIEN PLANET,"We have no ""tanks."" Our planet will protect us."
127028,489,212,1126000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,"Oh man, you sound like my art teacher. Look a little like her too."
127030,489,214,1166000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,I guess this is a good time to tell you I've been a double agent all this time. But now I am totally on your side.
127031,489,215,1173000,KAMALA,ALIEN PLANET,And this is a good time to tell you I have space warts. And I got them from Mil-house.
127032,489,216,1184000,Gary Chalmers,ALIEN PLANET,Time for a good old-fashioned servo-suit/bulldozer-saurus fight!
127033,489,217,1199000,Gary Chalmers,ALIEN PLANET,Dammit!
127034,489,218,1201000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,"Yo, colonel!"
127035,489,219,1201000,Avatar Bart,ALIEN PLANET,"Uh, you've got some schmutz on your cheek."
127036,489,220,1203000,Gary Chalmers,ALIEN PLANET,Where?... Here?
