28947,134,230,1108000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,No.
28948,134,231,1109000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Yes. I mean no. No.
28949,134,232,1114000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, where's my dad?"
28950,134,233,1115000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,"Well, that should be obvious to even the most dimwitted individual -- who holds an advanced degree in hyperbolic topology -- that Homer Simpson has stumbled into... the Third Dimension."
28951,134,234,1130000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Sorry.
28952,134,235,1132000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,Here is an ordinary square...
28953,134,236,1135000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Egghead!"
28954,134,237,1137000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,"But suppose we extend the square beyond the two dimensions of our universe, along the hypothetical Z axis there."
28955,134,238,1146000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,"This forms a three-dimensional object known as a ""cube"" or a ""Frinkahedron"", in honor of its discoverer ."
28956,134,239,1154000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Help me! Are you helping me, or are you going on and on?"
28957,134,240,1157000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,"Oh, right, and of course, within we find the doomed individual."
28958,134,241,1161000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Enough of your borax, Poindexter! A man's life is at stake! We need action!"
28959,134,242,1168000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Take that, you lousy dimension!"
28960,134,243,1177000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, there's so much I don't know about astrophysics. I wish I'd read that book by that wheelchair guy."
28962,134,245,1196000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll save Homer. All I needs is four stout men to work the bellows.
28963,134,246,1201000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,"No, Pops, it's too risky. For all we know, there could be cubes in there the size of gorillas and other large..."
28964,134,247,1208000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Help! I don't have much time!
28966,134,248,1210000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That does it. I'm going in.
28967,134,249,1213000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, no!"
28968,134,250,1218000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Cool, man!"
28969,134,251,1226000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna be sucked into the black hole!... I'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!... I'm gonna be nothing and what's gonna become of me on the other side?! I don't know...
28970,134,252,1232000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll save you, Dad."
28971,134,253,1236000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I can't get any closer! You'll have to jump!"
28972,134,254,1242000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Piece of cake, son!"
28973,134,255,1246000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap!
28975,134,257,1258000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, what happened?!"
28976,134,258,1261000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we hit a little snag when the universe sorta collapsed on itself... but dad seemed cautiously optimistic."
28977,134,259,1267000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Craaaaaaaaaap!
28978,134,260,1270000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie..."
28979,134,261,1272000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"Be strong, Marge. I'm sure he's gone to a better place."
28982,134,264,1282000,Homer Simpson,VENTURA BOULEVARD,Eww. This is the worst place yet.
28983,134,265,1287000,Homer Simpson,VENTURA BOULEVARD,Omigod...
28984,134,266,1304000,Homer Simpson,VENTURA BOULEVARD,"Ooh, erotic cakes!"
