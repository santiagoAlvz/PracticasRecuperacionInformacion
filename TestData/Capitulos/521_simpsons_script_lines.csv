135324,521,11,180000,Marge Simpson,TV ROOM,"Maybe instead of watching TV with the kids, you could take them outside and... what are you doing?"
135325,521,12,187000,Marge Simpson,TV ROOM,This so-called educational DVD may have even stunted the development of the kids who watched it!

135430,521,134,683000,DOLPH,Kwik-E-Mart,We should start threatening more adults.
135431,521,135,685000,Jimbo Jones,Kwik-E-Mart,Wouldn't that make us criminals instead of bullies?
135432,521,136,688000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Kwik-E-Mart,Let's beat up a philosopher till he gives us the answer.
