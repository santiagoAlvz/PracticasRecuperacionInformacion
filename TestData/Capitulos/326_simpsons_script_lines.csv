83948,326,1,33000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wait 'til he puts his unsuspecting butt on that toilet seat.

83951,326,4,46000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You didn't sit on the toilet!
83952,326,5,48000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Didn't have to, I'm a dude."
83953,326,6,51000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Butt on bowl, little man!"
83954,326,7,54000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, my-my pants aren't down!"
83955,326,8,56000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It doesn't matter!
83956,326,9,59000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ee-yow!
83958,326,11,61000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little...!
83959,326,12,64000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Joke's on me, is it...?"
83961,326,14,64000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's all that racket?!
83962,326,15,80000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's old lady Simpson! Run!
83963,326,16,84000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What's going on?
83964,326,17,85000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uhh... I'll tell you what's goin' on...
83965,326,18,88000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,...I'm taking you all out for pancakes!
83966,326,19,88000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Yay!
83967,326,20,90000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah!
83969,326,22,93000,Bart Simpson,The Flapjack Stack,This place looks familiar.
83970,326,23,95000,Lisa Simpson,The Flapjack Stack,"It used to be the ""Leaning Tower of Pizza."""
83971,326,24,98000,Lisa Simpson,The Flapjack Stack,They just painted the tower brown.
83972,326,25,100000,Homer Simpson,The Flapjack Stack,"Either way, everyone who works in the kitchen speaks Spanish."
83973,326,26,104000,Homer Simpson,The Flapjack Stack,"Hey, Apu, what's with the line?"
83974,326,27,106000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,The Flapjack Stack,It's application day at Miss Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School.
83975,326,28,109000,Homer Simpson,The Flapjack Stack,Pre-nursery school?!
83976,326,29,111000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,The Flapjack Stack,The fast track begins at birth.
83979,326,30,113000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,The Flapjack Stack,"That's it, claw and bite for position -- only enough tuition money for two. The rest of you: better luck next life!"
83980,326,31,121000,Marge Simpson,The Flapjack Stack,That's a lot of pressure to put on a baby. All they should be worried about is the raspberry monster.
83982,326,33,134000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,The Flapjack Stack,"You know, Marge makes a good point -- competitive schools aren't for every baby."
83983,326,34,140000,Homer Simpson,The Flapjack Stack,Are you saying my daughter can't cut it? Just because I owe you fourteen thousand dollars? I'll show you!
83984,326,35,146000,Homer Simpson,The Flapjack Stack,"C'mon, Maggie. You're getting into that school!"
83985,326,36,147000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,The Flapjack Stack,I will hire a collection agency.
83986,326,37,152000,Homer Simpson,The Flapjack Stack,Which one? Tri-City? Omni-Pay? Insta-Threat? I've beaten 'em all!
83988,326,39,160000,Little Boy,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"The pig says ""oink."" The chicken--"
83989,326,40,160000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Look, stop right there -- I could go to any Chuck E. Cheese in America and hear what animals say. Do you know what I say? I say ""next."""
83990,326,41,171000,Little Boy,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,You're a poopy!
83991,326,42,176000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,You nurse with that mouth?
83992,326,43,179000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,Now what's your name?
83993,326,44,180000,Marge Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,Maggie!
83994,326,45,183000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"I'm sorry, but why are you answering for her?"
83995,326,46,185000,Marge Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,Maggie doesn't talk yet.
83996,326,47,186000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,Not a word?
83997,326,48,188000,Marge Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Oh no no, she says lots of words. Like when she wants something, she says"
83998,326,49,190000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Maggie, we're not a mime school, so we can't take a non-talker, but here's some good news: the Gap will always need sweater-folders."
83999,326,50,204000,Homer Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"I'm sorry we wasted your time, your Lordship."
84001,326,52,213000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My baby has no future!
84002,326,53,215000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Maggie will do just fine. She'll have plenty of money, 'cause she'll marry a grocer..."
84003,326,54,221000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Grocers don't make that much.
84004,326,55,223000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"...Who steals from the till, would ya let me finish? Geez."
84005,326,56,228000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maggie, you're as smart as any one of those kids. C'mon."
83977,326,57,233000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Did we ever turn off that shower nozzle?
84006,326,58,238000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm taking you all out for tacos!
84007,326,59,240000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Yay!
84008,326,60,242000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, for Malibu Stacy's beach party we've got pita, humus, tempeh, tofu... what other fun foods do we need?"
84009,326,61,252000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ice?
84010,326,62,254000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Did you do that?
84012,326,64,258000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, what's a good side dish?"
84013,326,65,264000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Rice? Why not caviar?
84014,326,66,268000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my God, you're not just smart... you're brilliant! Mom!"
84016,326,68,275000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Well look who's back, Pippi Non-talking."
84017,326,69,279000,Lisa Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,Just because Maggie can't talk doesn't mean she's dumb -- Einstein didn't speak 'til he was three.
84018,326,70,285000,Marge Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"And even then, he could only speak German!"
84019,326,71,287000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Fine, I'll give her an IQ test, if only to extinguish all hope."
84020,326,72,292000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"All right, my quiet American, how many eyes do you have?"
84021,326,73,296000,Lisa Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Go on, Maggie, you can do it."
84022,326,74,300000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Well, congratulations. You're now as intelligent as a pig. Let's see if you can move up to dolphin -- how many people in your family?"
84023,326,75,311000,Homer Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,Woo-hoo! I got that one right too!
84024,326,76,317000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Okay, last question. Arrange these four arrows to make five arrows. I remind you, you only have fifteen sec-- Oh."
84025,326,77,330000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,Yeah!
84026,326,78,332000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Philippa, I think you should come in here. Your baby is brilliant. Why, she could already teach at Florida State."
84027,326,79,342000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Go, Maggie!"
84028,326,80,343000,Homer Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Go, Seminoles!"
84029,326,81,344000,Miss Wickerbottom,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"This better be important, Henry. I was choking on something."
84030,326,82,347000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,Meet Maggie Simpson: IQ 167.
84031,326,83,352000,Miss Wickerbottom,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,167?! That's amazing for a Christian.
84032,326,84,357000,Lisa Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"But, but my IQ is only 159! Maggie's more intelligent than me?"
84033,326,85,363000,Interviewer,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"That's right, because 167 is a bigger number than 159. Do you see how that works?"
84034,326,86,370000,Lisa Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Yes, thank you."
84035,326,87,371000,Homer Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"So our kids keep getting smarter! If we have another one, it could build a time machine, which we could use to go back in time and not have any kids."
84036,326,88,381000,Marge Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,All our children are smart. Some are just smarter than the others.
84037,326,89,390000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School,"Welcome to ""The Others."""
84040,326,92,390000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maggie, I can't believe how much stuff your new school sent over!"
84041,326,93,400000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look at these courses you'll be taking. ""Advanced Peek-a-boo""."
84042,326,94,402000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""'Got Your Nose' And Other Lies""..."
84043,326,95,402000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""If you can read this you're almost as smart as my baby."" I'm slappin' this sucker right over ""Support Our Troops."""
84044,326,96,402000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look Lisa, there's something in here for you!"
84045,326,97,420000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Really?
84047,326,99,424000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"And Maggie gets a shirt, too!"
84049,326,101,432000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetie, you seem so blue. Did the last of something die?"
84050,326,102,437000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No Mom, it's just that I used to be ""the smart one"" -- now I don't know who I am."
84051,326,103,443000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I know who you are. And here's something to help you never forget!"
84052,326,104,451000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I already have one of those.
84053,326,105,455000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, then... find a new identity."
84054,326,106,460000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Your mother's right, honey. Katie Couric didn't just become the world's most famous dwarf, she escaped from the circus and went for it!"
84055,326,107,469000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, if I'm second rate as the smart kid, I'll find a new raison d'être."
84056,326,108,474000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That still sounds like the smart kid.
84057,326,109,476000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Right, right."
84060,326,112,481000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY CAFETERIA,Time to show them the new me. No one's happier and more well-adjusted than a standup comedian.
84061,326,113,487000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY CAFETERIA,How 'bout these entrées? Stuffed cabbage? Can you believe they found a way to make cabbage worse?
84063,326,115,497000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY CAFETERIA,"All right, so what else is goin' on? Let's see... Hey! Why do they call them field trips? We never go to a field!"
84064,326,116,507000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY CAFETERIA,"Oh, untrue. Last Thursday we visited a battlefield."
84065,326,117,511000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY CAFETERIA,"Uh, well I..."
84066,326,118,513000,Ralph Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY CAFETERIA,I'm bem-barrassed for you.
84067,326,119,515000,Nelson Muntz,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY CAFETERIA,"The following ""haw haw"" is not from amusement, but an expression of contempt. Haw haw!"
84069,326,121,522000,Lisa Simpson,Girls' Bathroom,"Okay, okay, don't get discouraged. Every me they reject gets me closer to the me they'll like."
84071,326,123,535000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"What are you now, Lisa? An Oakland Raiders' fan?"
84072,326,124,539000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"It's called Goth, eternally clueless one. My new name is Ravencrow Never-smiles."
84073,326,125,545000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Cool, we can be Goth together! We'll go to the cemetery and summon the dark lord by kissing and junk."
84074,326,126,554000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Okay. But first, you must apprentice by kissing the goddess Ironica, uh... who lives in this rock."
84075,326,127,562000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Do it for an hour, hour and a half."
84076,326,128,564000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Yes, my mistress."
84077,326,129,582000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Oh, none of these feel right. Oh wait, did I try ""soccer player?"""
84078,326,130,587000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Tried, and failed."
84081,326,133,594000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'm a mess. I can't believe I'm jealous of a baby.
84082,326,134,598000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, I'm jealous of her, too. When you're a baby, you spend all day just rollin' around on the floor. Boy, I miss that."
84083,326,135,604000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Fine. Roll around on the floor, baby."
84084,326,136,612000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Floor baby! Floor baby!
84085,326,137,614000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You're making fun of him for something you made him do.
84086,326,138,617000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, well, you're gay."
84087,326,139,620000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,People who accuse others of being gay are often covering up their own latent homosexuality.
84088,326,140,628000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Bullies rule!
84090,326,142,633000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The school sent this dealy over for Maggie. His name is Phonic Frog.
84091,326,143,637000,Phonic Frog,Simpson Home,Aw. Buh. Kkk.
84092,326,144,639000,Phonic Frog,Simpson Home,Huh. Oh. Muh. Eh. Er.
84093,326,145,642000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's me. Huh-oh-muh-eh-er!
84094,326,146,645000,Phonic Frog,Simpson Home,This-is-Huh-oh-muh-eh-er's-doc-tor. He's-too-sick-to-work-today.
84095,326,147,652000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll be right back.
84096,326,148,660000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fine, I'll help you with your stupid flash cards."
84097,326,149,667000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Aren't you smart. Let's try another one... A little harder this time.
84098,326,150,678000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No. That's wrong.
84099,326,151,685000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's right! This spells ""dog."""
84100,326,152,687000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa!
84101,326,153,691000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You were purposely teaching her the wrong word!
84102,326,154,694000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, I'm surprised. Your sister just wants to learn and be like you. Well, maybe she needs a better role model."
84103,326,155,702000,Phonic Frog,Simpson Home,I-agree-with-your-mother.
84104,326,156,705000,Phonic Frog,Simpson Home,You are a disappointment to Huh-oh-muh-eh-er.
84105,326,157,723000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I used to be the smart one.
84106,326,158,730000,Phonic Frog,Simpson Home,Where-is-my-dinner?
84107,326,159,732000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maggie, you're such a quick learner -- why don't you learn how to fly!"
84108,326,160,737000,Phonic Frog,Simpson Home,But-I-love-you.
84110,326,162,754000,Phonic Frog,Simpson Home,Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z... Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z...
84111,326,163,766000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Goodbye, Maggie. I'm smart enough to know you're better off without me."
84113,326,165,787000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Two cents...
84114,326,166,789000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, I'm sure a lot of great people have started with less."
84115,326,167,793000,Seymour Skinner,Kwik-E-Mart,Nope. Never under a dollar.
84117,326,169,796000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa's gone! You have to find her!
84118,326,170,799000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Why can't you just accept the fact that Lisa is old enough to take care of herself? Back off and let her live her life.
84119,326,171,806000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But she's only eight!
84120,326,172,808000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Oh, I thought you said ""eighty."" Well, we'll get right on it. Now this may not be the best time, but I'm supposed to give you this survey rating the effectiveness of the Springfield Police Department."
84122,326,173,820000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"""Somewhat satisfied?"" I see. Well, maybe I'll just ""somewhat"" find your daughter. Huh?"
84123,326,174,827000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fine. ""Extremely Satisfied."""
84124,326,175,827000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Lookin' good, boys. Now let's go get some smoothies."
84126,326,177,834000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,"Oh, I'm tired, I'm hungry, red plastic sandals are not great running-away shoes..."
84127,326,178,842000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,Air conditioning... water fountains... dioramas... and I'll never run into my family here! It's the perfect place to start a new life.
84130,326,181,862000,Usher,Museum,"No food allowed... you can't hide it in your clothes... would you please step out of the line, sir?"
84131,326,182,867000,Comic Book Guy,Museum,"Go ahead and search, you'll never find it all. I'm baking muffins as I speak!"
84132,326,183,874000,Movie Narrator,Museum,"Some trees are big, some trees are small, but all trees have bark -- except for poplar, ash and maple."
84137,326,188,926000,Lisa Simpson,VISIBLE MAN MOUTH,Lousy Maggie... thinks she's so great... thinks she knows...
84138,326,189,938000,Lisa Simpson,VISIBLE MAN MOUTH,I miss them all so much.
84140,326,191,952000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,I hope this typeface catches people's eye. It sure didn't move our old fondue set!
84141,326,192,957000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Why do you always take the children and not the fondue sets? Why, Santa, why?"
84142,326,193,966000,Chief Wiggum,Evergreen Terrace,"Good news, Simpsons -- we found your daughter's belongings."
84143,326,194,969000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Where'd you find these?
84144,326,195,971000,Chief Wiggum,Evergreen Terrace,Giant tongue.
84145,326,196,972000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Oh, I knew it!"
84146,326,197,973000,Chief Wiggum,Evergreen Terrace,We also discovered something very unusual at that museum.
84147,326,198,978000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Oh my God, what?"
84148,326,199,979000,Chief Wiggum,Evergreen Terrace,"Well, if you drop a feather and a bowling ball in a vacuum, they'll fall at the same rate. You think you've seen it all in this job, and then something like that comes along."
84150,326,201,993000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,"C'mon, c'mon..."
84151,326,202,999000,Chief Wiggum,Museum,That's where we found your daughter's things.
84153,326,203,1002000,Chief Wiggum,Museum,"You look around there while Eddie, Lou and I go ask a few questions. Like, how does a helicopter fly?"
84154,326,204,1008000,Lou,Museum,And what causes thunder?
84155,326,205,1010000,Chief Wiggum,Museum,I say it's angels bowling.
84157,326,207,1013000,Marge Simpson,MOUTH,Lisa... Lisa...
84160,326,210,1028000,Homer Simpson,MOUTH,"Oh no, the giant is waking up!"
84162,326,212,1033000,Marge Simpson,VISIBLE MAN,"Oh God, we're in a belly. Everyone take off your shoes."
84163,326,213,1047000,Marge Simpson,VISIBLE MAN,How do we get out?
84164,326,214,1050000,Chief Wiggum,VISIBLE MAN,Your baby has to press the red evacuate button.
84165,326,215,1053000,Lou,VISIBLE MAN,"Chief, we got a problem here."
84166,326,216,1055000,Lou,VISIBLE MAN,"I see a vase, but Eddie sees two people in profile."
84167,326,217,1059000,Chief Wiggum,VISIBLE MAN,This may shock you... but you're both right.
84168,326,218,1064000,Bart Simpson,VISIBLE MAN,Maggie! The red button... Hit the red button!
84169,326,219,1068000,Homer Simpson,VISIBLE MAN,Hit the red button!
84171,326,221,1075000,Bart Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,Maggie! Press the red button!
84172,326,222,1077000,Homer Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,"I know, we'll use reverse psychology. Maggie, don't press the red button!"
84173,326,223,1083000,Homer Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,Damn it!
84175,326,225,1088000,Homer Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,"Marge, I've always loved you. Bart, you were a worthy foe."
84177,326,227,1100000,Lisa Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,"Mom, Dad! I'm so sorry I got you into this!"
84178,326,228,1105000,Marge Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,Lisa! You're all right!
84179,326,229,1108000,Homer Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,"Oh good, she's here in time to see us die!"
84180,326,230,1111000,Lisa Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,"Maggie, I'm sorry I was jealous of your special gift. From now on I'm gonna nurture and cherish--"
84181,326,231,1118000,Marge Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,Just tell her which friggin' button to push!
84182,326,232,1120000,Lisa Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,"Maggie, push the red button!"
84183,326,233,1122000,Lisa Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,You can do it. Red!
84184,326,234,1132000,Homer Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,"Well, Marge, you can't say I never take you anywhere."
84185,326,235,1138000,Marge Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,Uh-hmm.
84186,326,236,1142000,Homer Simpson,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,"Well, I think we all learned a lesson today: don't try to be something you're not. Namely, food."
84187,326,237,1149000,Lou,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,"Chief, now I can't see either one."
84189,326,238,1151000,Chief Wiggum,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,"Well, we're all pretty tired. Let's try a different one."
84190,326,239,1154000,Chief Wiggum,VISIBLE MAN STOMACH,Which figure is bigger? The answer will knock your socks off.
84192,326,241,1158000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm sorry I ran off. Being second to Maggie's not so bad. But why didn't Maggie press the right button 'til I told her to?
84193,326,242,1166000,Miss Wickerbottom,Simpson Home,I believe I can answer that.
84194,326,243,1169000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How'd you get in here?
84195,326,244,1170000,Miss Wickerbottom,Simpson Home,Your butler let us in.
84196,326,245,1172000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Play along, I'll explain later."
84197,326,246,1175000,Interviewer,Simpson Home,I'm afraid your daughter is no longer welcome at our school. She's as common as an angry woman in an Ibsen play.
84198,326,247,1181000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Zing.
84199,326,248,1183000,Interviewer,Simpson Home,"Let's just watch the tape, monkey man."
84200,326,249,1187000,Miss Wickerbottom,Simpson Home,"Whenever Maggie is asked a question, she looks over at Lisa."
84201,326,250,1191000,Interviewer,Simpson Home,"Okay Maggie, how many eyes do you have?"
84202,326,251,1192000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Go on, Maggie, you can do it."
84203,326,252,1198000,Miss Wickerbottom,Simpson Home,Now rotate and magnify.
84204,326,253,1202000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't remember doing that. I would never cheat!
84205,326,254,1205000,Interviewer,Simpson Home,"Perhaps, but subconsciously, you wanted her to succeed. Watch."
84206,326,255,1210000,Miss Wickerbottom,Simpson Home,"Here, you're telling her the answer is ""no."""
84207,326,256,1212000,Miss Wickerbottom,Simpson Home,"Here, the solution is a square."
84208,326,257,1213000,Miss Wickerbottom,Simpson Home,"Here, you're telling her the answer is ""California condor."""
84209,326,258,1213000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,So Maggie's not a genius?
84210,326,259,1219000,Interviewer,Simpson Home,She could be... at sweeping up hair.
84211,326,260,1223000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's my baby, jerk."
84212,326,261,1225000,Interviewer,Simpson Home,"You call that a punch? I felt it, but it was like ""so what""?"
84213,326,262,1230000,Interviewer,Simpson Home,"Again with the nose. I have a chin, you know."
84214,326,263,1235000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, sir. The maid and I will take him out to the curb. C'mon, c'mon."
84215,326,264,1240000,Barney Gumble,Simpson Home,You promised me no one would get hurt!
84216,326,265,1243000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't care what they say, Maggie. To me you're brilliant."
84217,326,266,1255000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Not for babies.
84218,326,267,1261000,Simon,Simpson Home,Do we really need three of these people?
84219,326,268,1264000,Simon,Simpson Home,"Too ethnic, change it."
84220,326,269,1266000,Simon,Simpson Home,More like Cartwrong!
84121,326,270,1269000,Simon,Simpson Home,Worst voicing ever.
84152,326,271,1271000,Simon,Simpson Home,"Finally, a real celebrity."
84221,326,272,1274000,Simon,Simpson Home,"Oh good, more producers. Just what they need."
84222,326,273,1276000,Simon,Simpson Home,"Him, I like."
84223,326,274,1280000,Simon,Simpson Home,"Yes, but what's he done lately?"
84224,326,275,1283000,Simon,Simpson Home,Very original. Simon Cowell as Simon Cowell. Well done.
84225,326,276,1291000,Simon,Simpson Home,I really don't care anymore.
84226,326,277,1295000,Simon,Simpson Home,All useless.
84227,326,278,1299000,Simon,Simpson Home,Do credits really have to go this long?
84228,326,279,1307000,Simon,Simpson Home,"Oh, shoosh yourself."
