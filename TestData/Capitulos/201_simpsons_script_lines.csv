46734,201,11,93000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, a man just died."
46735,201,12,97000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Anyway, it's time for the church picnic."
46736,201,13,99000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What? They had a picnic last week.
46737,201,14,102000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No they didn't. You just brought a bucket of chicken to church.
46738,201,15,106000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If God didn't want us to eat in church, he would have made gluttony a sin."
46740,201,17,125000,Lou,Park,Hey!
46741,201,18,125000,Chief Wiggum,Park,"Ah, the joke's on you. We borrowed that jar from your table. So you just shot your own mustard!"

46745,201,22,140000,Homer Simpson,Park,"Yeah, out of the way, whoever you are. You're blocking the food."
46747,201,24,150000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Limo,"Ah, there's nothing like a good old-fashioned picnic. How's my kite doing, Smithers?"
46748,201,25,155000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Limo,"Oh-ho, it's, uh, soaring majestically, sir."
46749,201,26,158000,Ralph Wiggum,Burns's Limo,You're it!
46750,201,27,160000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Limo,"We'll see about that. After him, Smithers!"

46760,201,37,194000,Ned Flanders,Park,Heh. Sports on a Sunday? Hm. I'd better check with Reverend--
46761,201,38,198000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Park,"Oh, play the damn game, Ned."
46762,201,39,200000,Bart Simpson,Park,"Yeah, well, if you get a grown-up, then so do we. I pick my Dad."
46628,201,40,205000,Nelson Muntz,Park,Him?!
46763,201,41,206000,Bart Simpson,Park,"Oh, you'd be surprised. He gets pretty competitive when he's drinking. C'mon, Dad. We're playing Capture the Flag!"
46764,201,42,213000,Homer Simpson,Park,"Sorry, son, Daddy's down for the day. Why don't you go capture me some more potato salad?"
46765,201,43,217000,Bart Simpson,Park,But Rod picked his Dad. It's a matter of family honor.
46766,201,44,221000,Homer Simpson,Park,Flanders is playing? Why didn't you say so?
46767,201,45,229000,Comic Book Guy,Park,"Oh, it appears I will have to find a new Fortress of Solitude."
46768,201,46,238000,Bart Simpson,Park,"Okay, Dad, they've got our flag guarded pretty good..."
46769,201,47,240000,Homer Simpson,Park,I agree. Let's surrender.
46770,201,48,242000,Bart Simpson,Park,"No, wait. I have a plan. But I'll need your underpants."
46771,201,49,245000,Homer Simpson,Park,"Hmm... All right, but don't lose them. They're my only pair."
46773,201,51,249000,Bart Simpson,FLAG ZONE,I got it! I got the flag!
46774,201,52,252000,Other Team,FLAG ZONE,Get him!
46775,201,53,256000,Homer Simpson,FLAG ZONE,Stupid kids...
46776,201,54,262000,Milhouse Van Houten,FLAG ZONE,This isn't the flag! It looks more like... Ewww!
46777,201,55,269000,Bart Simpson,FLAG ZONE,Suckers! Go Dad!
46778,201,56,282000,Bart Simpson,FLAG ZONE,"Come on, Dad! Just a few more feet! Show 'em what you got!"

46783,201,61,309000,Milhouse Van Houten,FLAG ZONE,"Hey, h-he's trying to turn over."
46785,201,63,324000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've never seen Bart so ashamed of me.
46786,201,64,329000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Marge. How could you let me let myself go like this?"
46787,201,65,333000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Me? I'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee.
46788,201,66,336000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, well, I've humiliated my son for the last time. I'm going to get into shape."
46789,201,67,341000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whatever you say, sweetie."
46790,201,68,343000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I mean it. I'm really serious this time."
46791,201,69,346000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, honey. Okay. I'll start taking in all your slacks."
46793,201,71,367000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, boy, I want you to keep this exercise thing under your hat. That way I won't be embarrassed if I fail."
46795,201,74,375000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, great. Now the cat knows."
46796,201,75,377000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, here we go..."
46798,201,77,394000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, son. Daddy got in shape. E--"
46799,201,78,400000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've got to keep trying! Or I could just move that picture. No! The picture looked good where it was. Boy, drag me back outside."
46805,201,84,424000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"So what will it be, Mr. Simpson? Your usual bucket of ice cream covered with miniature pies?"
46806,201,85,439000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Uhh... Don't you have anything healthy here?
46807,201,86,442000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, well, we have some low-salt candy bars and some reduced-fat soda. And our beef jerky is now nearly rectum-free."
46808,201,87,451000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey, these Power Sauce bars look pretty healthy."
46809,201,88,454000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh yes, that is a new item. No bar contains more applesauce."
46810,201,89,458000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hmm... A bushel of apples packed in each bar, plus a secret ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples. Wow."
46812,201,91,473000,Homer Simpson,Streets,"""Gym?"" What's a ""Gym?"""
46814,201,93,478000,Homer Simpson,Gym,Ohhh... a gym.
46815,201,94,486000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Boy, am I feeling this. Ow! Oh, my head's gonna be sore in the morning. Ow!"
46816,201,95,494000,Muscular Man,Gym,Excuse me. You're doing this station all backwards. Let me show you how to do it like a man.
46817,201,96,501000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"Ranier Wolfcastle! Oh, I love your movies and your Power Sauce bars and your taut, rippling--"
46818,201,97,506000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Gym,"Hey, hey, hey. That's enough. Now step over to the abdominator and I will shout slogans at you."
46819,201,98,515000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Gym,Push! Harder! Go past the max! Reach over the top! Master your ass!
46820,201,99,524000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"Wow, Wolfie. Two months ago I didn't know what the word ""dumbbell"" meant. This place is great."
46821,201,100,534000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Gym,Um-hm.
46823,201,102,534000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, handsome. Nice muscles. Care for a rubdown? Oh-ho, well, I'm flattered, but spoken for. Oh, what the heck, give me your number."
46824,201,103,546000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, what have you done to your stomach?"
46825,201,104,548000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And your chest!
46826,201,105,549000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And your shirt!
46827,201,106,551000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I have been working out secretly at night. And look at me now!
46828,201,107,556000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh my goodness gracious!
46829,201,108,559000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Heh, heh, heh. Go ahead. Try and grab some flab. Go on. Ju--"
46830,201,109,562000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, not there."
46831,201,110,564000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Not there either. Over here.
46832,201,111,565000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I've got some!
46833,201,112,567000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, here. Try my foot. No, not that foot. Just feel my biceps."
46835,201,114,572000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoaa...
46836,201,115,574000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, whaddaya think of your old man now, son?"
46838,201,117,579000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Damn right.
46839,201,118,585000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How can you put that filth into your bodies?
46840,201,119,588000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My casserole is not filth. Eat it.
46841,201,120,592000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look at you people. Bart's a tub, Lisa's weak as a little girl, and Maggie doesn't seem to be growing at all."
46842,201,121,599000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Now that's just non--
46843,201,122,600000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You too, Marge. If you toned up a little, you'd probably get a lot more action."
46844,201,123,605000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, stop insulting us and eat your filth. Food. I mean, food."
46845,201,124,609000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, I only eat food in bar form. When you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, I'm told. That's why I'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar."
46846,201,125,625000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hm.
46847,201,126,629000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hospital, please."
46849,201,128,633000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Gym,"Homer, please remember to wipe your sweat off that machine. I got a terrible rash yesterday."
46850,201,129,639000,Bart Simpson,Gym,You know Rainier Wolfcastle?
46851,201,130,641000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"Yeah, he helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone."
46852,201,131,646000,Brad,Gym,"Yo, yo, Rainier, my man! How ya doin'? I thought you'd be here, pumping those guns."
46853,201,132,651000,Neil,Gym,We've come up with a killer promotion for Power Sauce bars. Picture this: You...
46854,201,133,656000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Gym,I love it.
46855,201,134,657000,Neil,Gym,...climb the highest mountain in Springfield...
46856,201,135,660000,Brad,Gym,The Murderhorn.
46857,201,136,661000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Gym,Are you crazy? That's suicide.
46858,201,137,663000,Neil,Gym,"Oh, sure, for experienced mountain climbers. But you're a movie star. And you'll have the Power Sauce edge."
46859,201,138,670000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Gym,Not for all the applesauce in Glueckenschlaben.
46860,201,139,675000,Bart Simpson,Gym,My Dad could do it!
46861,201,140,677000,Bart Simpson,Gym,He eats fifty dollars' worth of Power Sauce bars a day.
46862,201,141,681000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"Overshoot the extreme, max the envelope, and so on."
46863,201,142,684000,Neil,Gym,"Wow, he's really been paying attention to our slogans. Uh, Brad -- a word."
46864,201,143,689000,Neil,Gym,New angle: Joe Schlub eats Power Sauce bar -- becomes World's Mightiest Man.
46865,201,144,694000,Brad,Gym,It's believable. That's what I like about it.
46866,201,145,698000,Neil,Gym,"Hm. Congratulations, sir."
46867,201,146,698000,Homer Simpson,Gym,Huh?
46868,201,147,700000,Brad,Gym,You're gonna be the first man to climb the Murderhorn.
46869,201,148,703000,Homer Simpson,Gym,I am?
46870,201,149,709000,Neil,Gym,"Uh, no, that's it over there."
46871,201,150,714000,Neil,Gym,"Yeah, that's it. Just to the right of the one you're looking at."
46874,201,153,729000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, mountain-climbing supplies: rope, ice axe, heart medicine..."
46875,201,154,734000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Son! Don't go up that mountain! You'll die up there! Just like I did!
46876,201,155,740000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You? Did?
46877,201,156,741000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure, it was the winter of '28..."
46878,201,157,746000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"The Butter Baby Flapjack company sponsored me and a fella named McAllister. We were almost to the top, when we ran low on supplies."
46879,201,158,757000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Heroically, I gave him the last short stack."
46880,201,159,765000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Then, that glory hog took all the supplies and headed for the top alone."
46881,201,160,773000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I fell 8,000 feet onto a pile of jagged rocks. 'Course folks were tougher in those days. I was jitterbuggin' that very night. But that skunk McAllister was never seen again."
46882,201,161,788000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you're trying to scare me, it won't work. I'm one hundred percent focused on my goal. Hey, my hat has ear flaps!"
46886,201,164,796000,Brad,BASE OF THE MURDERHORN,"And when he reaches the top, Mr. Simpson, here, will plant this Power Sauce flag as an eternal symbol of man's contempt for nature. Wait -- is ""contempt"" the word I want here?"
46887,201,165,806000,Brad,BASE OF THE MURDERHORN,"Homer, you're the world's greatest hero. Do you owe it all to Power Sauce?"
46888,201,166,812000,Homer Simpson,BASE OF THE MURDERHORN,"That's right, Brad and Neil. I only eat Power Sauce -- the bar with Apple-saucicity."
46889,201,167,817000,Marge Simpson,BASE OF THE MURDERHORN,Has anyone mentioned that Homer doesn't know anything about mountain climbing and that this is all crazy?
46890,201,168,824000,Neil,BASE OF THE MURDERHORN,"Well, yes, a number of people. But don't worry. We're sending two Sherpas along as guides."
46893,201,171,833000,Homer Simpson,BASE OF THE MURDERHORN,"Aww. Goodbye, everyone. Don't touch my stuff."
46894,201,172,837000,Bart Simpson,BASE OF THE MURDERHORN,"Dad, wait. You're not risking your life just to impress me, are you?"
46895,201,173,842000,Homer Simpson,BASE OF THE MURDERHORN,"Well, yeah..."
46896,201,174,844000,Bart Simpson,BASE OF THE MURDERHORN,"Oh, cool! Now get goin', chop-chop!"
46897,201,175,849000,Brad,BASE OF THE MURDERHORN,Remember our agreement. He can't fail.
46899,201,177,861000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,"Oh, man, this is hard."
46900,201,178,865000,Bart Simpson,Mountain,"Uh, Dad?"
46901,201,179,866000,Bart Simpson,Mountain,Shouldn't you save a couple bottles for when you're a little higher?
46902,201,180,871000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,"Bart, this climb is the most difficult ordeal I have ever faced."
46904,201,182,876000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't get discouraged, Dad. Only four vertical miles to go."
46907,201,185,902000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,Wow! Look how far I climbed! And I'm not even tired!
46908,201,186,907000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,"Wake up, you lazy Sherpas. We've got a mountain to climb!"
46911,201,189,919000,Brad,Mountain,This Power Sauce news break is brought to you by Power Sauce. Get sauced with Power Sauce. Neil?
46912,201,190,925000,Neil,Mountain,Our top story: Homer Simpson has just Power Sauced his way past the halfway point of the Murderhorn.
46913,201,191,933000,Neil,Mountain,"Brad, could Homer have made it this far without the engineered nutrition of six kinds of apples?"
46914,201,192,938000,Brad,Mountain,"No way, Neil. Oh, this just in: Power Sauce is amazing!"
46885,201,193,948000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,Huh?... Wha ya?... Hey! You guys are dragging me up the mountain.
46916,201,194,957000,Sherpa #1,Mountain,Brad and Neil were quite insistent you not die.
46917,201,195,960000,Sherpa #2,Mountain,Frankly we don't care.
46918,201,196,961000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,"So nobody believes I can do this, huh? Well, my son does. And I'm not gonna let him down. I'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own."
46919,201,197,970000,Sherpa #1,Mountain,"Then technically, shouldn't you go back down the mountain and start all over?"
46920,201,198,974000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,Shut up. You are so fired.
46921,201,199,977000,Sherpa #1,Mountain,Woo hoo!
46923,201,201,982000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,"Homer Simpson here. I've sent the Sherpas home and I'm heading for the top, solo."
46925,201,203,987000,Brad,POWER SAUCE CORP.,Are you crazy? You'll never make it.
46926,201,204,989000,Homer Simpson,POWER SAUCE CORP.,The hell I won't. You're forgetting I've got my Power Sauce bars.
46927,201,205,994000,Neil,POWER SAUCE CORP.,"Wake up, Homer! Those bars are just junk. They're made of apple cores and Chinese newspapers."
46929,201,207,999000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,"Hey, Deng Xiao-Ping died."
46930,201,208,1003000,Neil,Mountain,"Homer, listen to me! Turn back now!"
46931,201,209,1006000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,Forget it. I'll be at the top by noon. Over and out.
46932,201,210,1015000,Brad,Mountain,Homer Simpson -- defying all medical advice -- has switched to Power Sauce's arch-rival: the Vita-Peach Health Log. Doctors say he may not have the meganutrients needed to stave off death.
46934,201,212,1026000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Dad's gonna die and it's all my fault! I really need a good talkin' to."
46935,201,213,1031000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, kids. Your father'll be okay, as long as he's with those Sherpas."
46936,201,214,1036000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... Mom?
46939,201,217,1056000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,"Air's getting thin, but I'm gonna make it. Woo! Getting lightheaded... Good -- no heavy head to carry. Wait! I'll just take that escalator!"
46940,201,218,1089000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,La la la la la la la la...
46941,201,219,1098000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,La la la la la la la la la...
46943,201,221,1113000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,Just a few feet more...
