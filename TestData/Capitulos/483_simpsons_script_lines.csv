125186,483,31,117000,Lisa Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Dad, Aunt Selma's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer."
125187,483,32,122000,Homer Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,And we've got front row seats!
125188,483,33,125000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,"So, you here for an eye test? Read this."
125189,483,34,130000,Fat Tony,Department of Motor Vehicles,Process my form.
125190,483,35,132000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,I'm afraid this is the wrong form. The one you want is on that table.
125191,483,36,136000,Fat Tony,Department of Motor Vehicles,"And if I retrieve that form, will I be able to maintain my advantageous position in line?"
125192,483,37,145000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,Try it and see.
125193,483,38,147000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,Nope.

125201,483,46,174000,Lisa Simpson,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,My lick.
125202,483,47,175000,Bart Simpson,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,Hey -- you licked the back! That was my side!
125203,483,48,177000,Lisa Simpson,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,Brother germs!
125204,483,49,181000,Bart Simpson,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,Sister spit!

125206,483,51,195000,Bart Simpson,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,You're a truffle.
125207,483,52,196000,Lisa Simpson,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,A truffle is a fungus that grows in tree roots. It's one of the most prized gourmet foods in the world.
125208,483,53,203000,Bart Simpson,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,Only you can make tree poop boring.
125209,483,54,211000,Lisa Simpson,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,"Bart, you can find them by smell! That's amazing! Restaurateurs use highly-trained pigs to sniff these out."
125210,483,55,218000,Luigi,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,"Come on, numb nose. Sniff me a truffle! I don't know why I flew you in from Italy! First class, no less! Plus you forget to get miles!"

125212,483,57,231000,Luigi,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,Eh? Jody Maroni! But where is your truffle pig?
125213,483,58,236000,Bart Simpson,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,You're lookin' at him.
125214,483,59,238000,Luigi,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,"A human pig! Thank you, Lord, for this abomination."
125215,483,60,242000,Luigi,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,"Eh, eh, eh! You know-a the rule: no truffles for truffle pigs!"
125216,483,61,248000,Luigi,GRASSY AREA NEXT TO FOREST,And now that I have him... I find a new use for you in my kitchen.
125218,483,63,254000,Luigi,Luigi's,"Yeah, that one's-a good. Start on these."
125219,483,64,260000,Luigi,Luigi's,"Hey, don't run with the knife! Ah, stupid pig!"
125220,483,65,264000,Luigi,Luigi's,"And I'll-a pay you top dollar for any more truffles you find. And whenever you eat here, you get the best table. Not the one that goes a-tikit-a-tikit-a-tikit-a. Very nice."
125224,483,69,282000,Selma Bouvier,Warehouse,The view was better inside the sack.
125225,483,70,284000,Fat Tony,Warehouse,"You are one tough cookie. I tell you what, I'll let you pick which body part I cut off first."
125226,483,71,291000,Selma Bouvier,Warehouse,Fine. I choose my love handles.
125227,483,72,293000,Fat Tony,Warehouse,What?
125228,483,73,293000,Selma Bouvier,Warehouse,"Then my arm wattles, my cankles, and finish off with my excess back fat."
125229,483,74,298000,Fat Tony,Warehouse,"You do not register the level of fear, say, Louie here would."
125230,483,75,302000,Louie,Warehouse,Yeah -- show some respect for the process!
125231,483,76,304000,Selma Bouvier,Warehouse,"You asked what I wanted cut off, and I want lipo. Lots of lipo. Or are you not a man of your word?"
125232,483,77,315000,Fat Tony,Warehouse,I like you. I don't know whether to knock you on your kisser or kiss you on your knockers.
125233,483,78,320000,Selma Bouvier,Warehouse,"I don't know whether to peck you on the kisser, or kiss you on the--"
125234,483,79,325000,Fat Tony,Warehouse,You shall have your lipo. Call our doctor friend who owes us a favor.
125235,483,80,329000,Louie,Warehouse,"Actually, we owe him a favor."
125236,483,81,330000,Fat Tony,Warehouse,"Do him two favors, then remind him that he owes us a favor."
125238,483,83,336000,Doctor,Plastic Surgeon's Office,"Tony, the surgery was a complete success, so can I take your cousin, the ""anesthesiologist"" off the payroll?"
125239,483,84,344000,Fat Tony,Plastic Surgeon's Office,You certainly may. Now where is my Selma?
125240,483,85,348000,Selma Bouvier,Plastic Surgeon's Office,Here's the part that's not in the trash.
125241,483,86,351000,Fat Tony,Plastic Surgeon's Office,"Ooh... Boys, I'd like a little privacy with Selma. Why don't you take the doctor out back?"
125242,483,87,358000,Louie,Plastic Surgeon's Office,"Should we take care of him, or ""take care of him""?"
125243,483,88,361000,Fat Tony,Plastic Surgeon's Office,Take care of him.
125245,483,89,364000,Louie,Plastic Surgeon's Office,"I don't know what that meant. Was it the first one or the second one? I can't ask him, otherwise he's gonna ""take care of me."""
125246,483,90,367000,Fat Tony,Plastic Surgeon's Office,Now to take care of you.
125247,483,91,371000,Selma Bouvier,Plastic Surgeon's Office,"Take care of me or ""take care of me?"""
125248,483,92,376000,Fat Tony,Plastic Surgeon's Office,The one that's this one!
125251,483,95,383000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Selma, I just can't get over the new you."
125252,483,96,386000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,The world's a different place when you've got a waist. The clerk in the electronics store asked me if I needed help!
125254,483,98,393000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, well, well, if it isn't ""before"" and ""after."" Blob and Blob Lite. Tweedle Yuck and Tweedle Blecch."
125255,483,99,402000,Fat Tony,Simpson Home,I hope I'm not interrupting.
125256,483,100,405000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fat Tony! I was just complimenting your beautiful girlfriend... while insulting her hideous twin.
125257,483,101,411000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, Fat Tony. My husband doesn't realize what he's saying, then, five seconds later:"
125258,483,102,418000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh my God!
125259,483,103,419000,Fat Tony,Simpson Home,"All will be forgiven... If, you sketch a portrait of Patty showing her inner beauty."
125260,483,104,426000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You are cruel but fair.
125263,483,107,443000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I'm trying. I swear I'm trying.
125264,483,108,450000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Dammit!
125266,483,110,469000,Fat Tony,Springfield Harbor,I love it here. The way the sun goes down like a crooked boxer.
125267,483,111,474000,Fat Tony,Springfield Harbor,"Selma, in this matto, svitato world...you've got to hold on to the good things."
125268,483,112,480000,Frankie the Squealer,Springfield Harbor,Whoa! Sounds like someone's gonna propose here!
125269,483,113,484000,Johnny Tightlips,Springfield Harbor,Shut up! You're spoilin' the mood.
125270,483,114,485000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield Harbor,This is how I always pictured this moment.
125271,483,115,489000,Frankie the Squealer,Springfield Harbor,Awwww...
125272,483,116,491000,Fat Tony,Springfield Harbor,"Selma, will you share my life with me?"
125273,483,117,494000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield Harbor,"Oh Tony, if there were an Italian word for ""yes,"" I'd be saying it right now."
125274,483,118,500000,Fat Tony,Springfield Harbor,CON TE PARTIRO...
125244,483,120,507000,Fat Tony,FBI Surveillance Truck,PAESI CHE NON HO MAI / VEDUTO E VISSUTO CON TE
125277,483,122,519000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,How many truffles did you get?
125278,483,123,521000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,More than I can count.
125279,483,124,524000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Brown gold... Tuscan tea...
125280,483,125,526000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Just think of what we can do with that moolah.
125281,483,126,529000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Hm, I can't find my car."
125283,483,128,539000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Nooooo!
125285,483,130,544000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, I am putting this money safely in the bank where you will earn zero point zero zero one percent interest."
125286,483,131,553000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"That's a lot of zeros! You know, all this truffle hunting has made me a little thirsty. Can we go home now?"
125287,483,132,558000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Three more big ones and we'll talk.
125288,483,133,560000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,How big?
125289,483,134,560000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,As big as a baby's head.
125290,483,135,562000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Okay.
125291,483,136,562000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That baby's head.
125292,483,137,565000,Cletus Spuckler,Springfield Elementary School,"That tick sure done swelled you up, Normalhead Joe."
125293,483,138,570000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, man!"
125296,483,141,577000,Priest,Hotel,Vi dichiaro marito e presunta moglie. You may now kiss one another.
125297,483,142,586000,Homer Simpson,Hotel,"Yes! I'm so happy I lived to see this day! He did give her the kiss of death, right?"
125298,483,143,593000,Marge Simpson,Hotel,No!
125299,483,144,594000,Homer Simpson,Hotel,I decorated her car for nothing.
125302,483,147,604000,Marge Simpson,Hotel,Excuse me. We can't find our seats. Marge and Homer Simpson.
125303,483,148,609000,Wedding Planner,Hotel,"Ah yes, you're at table forty-six."
125304,483,149,612000,Wedding Planner,Hotel,Right this way.
125305,483,150,614000,Marge Simpson,Hotel,"Hm, there must be some mistake."
125306,483,151,617000,Wedding Planner,Hotel,"Oh, it's no mistake."
125307,483,152,620000,Wedding Planner,Hotel,"That table is Tony and his friends. This table is the DMV. This one, Legitimate Businessmen of Shelbyville. FBI... children's table... gifts... then you."
125308,483,153,629000,Comic Book Guy,Hotel,And how do you know the bride?
125309,483,154,632000,Marge Simpson,Hotel,I'm her sister. And you?
125310,483,155,634000,Comic Book Guy,Hotel,I bought her ping-pong table on Craig's List. Color yourself slighted.
125311,483,157,641000,Selma Bouvier,RECEPTION HALL,"So, how's your Tiramisu?"
125312,483,158,643000,Lisa Simpson,RECEPTION HALL,We haven't even gotten our salads yet.
125313,483,159,646000,Fat Tony,RECEPTION HALL,"So, who wants a picture with the happy couple?"
125314,483,160,650000,Marge Simpson,RECEPTION HALL,Why did you seat us in Siberia?
125315,483,161,653000,Selma Bouvier,RECEPTION HALL,Because somebody's husband has a reputation for embarrassing himself in public situations.
125316,483,162,659000,Marge Simpson,RECEPTION HALL,"He's on his best behavior, which is very impressive considering he's mad about a sports result."
125317,483,163,665000,Homer Simpson,RECEPTION HALL,Lousy Saint Louis Cardinals. Can't win the nineteen eighty-five World Series on Classic Sports.
125318,483,164,671000,Fat Tony,RECEPTION HALL,Smile for the camera.
125319,483,165,674000,Marge Simpson,RECEPTION HALL,I was never sure about this marriage.
125320,483,166,676000,Selma Bouvier,RECEPTION HALL,"With that attitude, don't bother coming to the brunch tomorrow."
125321,483,167,680000,Marge Simpson,RECEPTION HALL,We're throwing the brunch!
125322,483,168,689000,Fat Tony,RECEPTION HALL,"Man, that photographer got everything."
125324,483,170,696000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I still can't believe it. I have never been so snubbed at one of Selma's weddings.
125325,483,171,703000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fat Tony! Are you gonna cut my head off and leave it in a manger scene at Christmas? And then an old Italian nun finds it. And she's all... No, no, no, oh, no, no! He's too beautiful to die! Ohhhh!"
125326,483,172,713000,Fat Tony,Simpson Home,"Homer, to restore the sisterical bond, you and Marge are invited to spend the weekend with us at our house down the shore."
125327,483,173,727000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm. So, should I bring a towel?"
125328,483,174,731000,Fat Tony,Simpson Home,We have towels.
125329,483,175,733000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Um, I take a special size."
125331,483,177,739000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,"Come on, Bart. We've been out here for hours."
125332,483,178,742000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,Maybe we've found all the truffles. The only thing I've dug up was these weird-looking mushrooms.
125333,483,179,747000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Forest,I'll dispose of those for you.
125334,483,180,749000,Otto Mann,Springfield Forest,"""Koyaanisqatsi,"" you're about to get watched!"
125335,483,181,752000,Otto Mann,Springfield Forest,"Listen, why don't we just stop this and divide the money."
125336,483,182,756000,Otto Mann,Springfield Forest,"The money? No, no, no, no, no, no. The money is working for us -- what's not working is your stupid sense of smell!"
125337,483,183,763000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Forest,All I smell here is desperation.
125338,483,184,773000,Otto Mann,Springfield Forest,"Ooh, commentary by Philip Glass!"
125340,483,186,781000,Otto Mann,Springfield Forest,No more distractions! Find those truffles! Mush!
125341,483,187,785000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Forest,"If you think that makes me a better musher, you're wrong. Wait a second..."
125343,483,189,794000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Forest,This is our house. There's nothing buried here but hopes and dreams!
125345,483,191,804000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The truffle's right over here!
125346,483,192,810000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Truffle's in your room? I thought you'd been selling them!
125347,483,193,813000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart... I haven't been selling the truffles. I've been eating them.
125348,483,194,818000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Really? Why?
125349,483,195,820000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Vegetarian food is so boring! Pasta, soy... you know what's a bad pizza topping? Broccoli!"
125350,483,196,827000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But I worked so hard! I've got dirt under my fingernails I'll never get out. Not that I'm gonna try.
125351,483,197,832000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, Bart! Take the last truffle... do whatever you want. Sell it, eat it..."
125352,483,198,836000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Or give it to someone who deserves it.
125354,483,200,841000,Bart Simpson,Luigi's,"You spent your life searching for these, but you never had one."
125355,483,201,844000,Bart Simpson,Luigi's,"Well, this is yours."
125356,483,202,847000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,"Bart, you've done a truly kind thing."
125358,483,204,867000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,"Oh, so that's why they don't give pigs truffles."
125361,483,207,873000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,I don't think this is a good idea at all. The only husband of Selma's I liked was Disco Stu. He was so upbeat till he found out she didn't care for disco.
125362,483,208,883000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Yeah, that's his thing. Anyway, Fat Tony and I think this is a chance to patch things up between you and Selma. Plus it's a free weekend at the beach."
125363,483,209,893000,Legs,Simpson Car,"Hey Louie. Don't ask me why, but I got a funny feeling about the new guy."
125364,483,210,898000,Goon,Simpson Car,"Uh, let's brag about our crimes... you first."
125366,483,212,906000,Fat Tony,FAT TONY'S BEACH HOUSE,"Homer, Marge. Come, meet the family! These are my nephews..."
125367,483,213,909000,Fat Tony,FAT TONY'S BEACH HOUSE,"Stevie B., Stevie F., and Vincent."
125369,483,214,914000,STEVIE B.,FAT TONY'S BEACH HOUSE,"But you can call us ""S-Money,"" ""Jell-o Shot,"" and ""The Occurrence."""
125370,483,215,918000,Marge Simpson,FAT TONY'S BEACH HOUSE,I will!
125371,483,216,920000,Fat Tony,FAT TONY'S BEACH HOUSE,"This is my niece, Tushie. She's got two semesters under her belt in contemporary Italian-American design from Sandy Hook Vocational Institute."
125372,483,217,929000,Tushie,FAT TONY'S BEACH HOUSE,"Aw, shut your face, Uncle Tone. God, you two are super pale. But not to worry -- every light in the house is a tanning light."
125373,483,218,939000,Marge Simpson,FAT TONY'S BEACH HOUSE,Can you read by it?
125374,483,219,941000,Tushie,FAT TONY'S BEACH HOUSE,No one's ever tried.
125376,483,221,946000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,"These people are always grinding against each other, and I think they're all related. I wish we'd never come."
125377,483,222,952000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,Selma? Va-va-va-wha?!
125378,483,223,955000,Selma Bouvier,Beach House,Why can't you support my marriage?
125379,483,224,957000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,You've never supported mine!
125380,483,225,959000,Selma Bouvier,Beach House,You married a pig!
125381,483,226,960000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,"Well, you married someone whose first name is ""Fat""!"
125382,483,227,965000,Selma Bouvier,Beach House,I'm late for my mani-pedi-spray-tan.
125385,483,230,980000,The Occurrence,Beach,Boo-frickin'-ya! Losers chug!
125386,483,231,982000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"Well, if you insist."
125387,483,232,987000,Guidos,Beach,Chug! Chug! Chug!
125389,483,234,990000,Selma Bouvier,Beach,Mind if I join you?
125390,483,235,995000,Selma Bouvier,Beach,"Look at our men, Marge -- they're having a great time."
125392,483,237,1000000,Homer Simpson,Beach,You are such a gentle kisser.
125393,483,238,1002000,Fat Tony,Beach,You were kind of all over the place.
125394,483,239,1005000,Selma Bouvier,Beach,"Maybe I've been mean to Homer because I was jealous of your happiness. Now that I'm truly happy, maybe all four of us can start over."
125396,483,241,1016000,Selma Bouvier,Beach House,"TELL ME, WHEN WILL YOU BE MINE / TELL ME, QUANDO QUANDO QUANDO / HEY!"
125397,483,242,1023000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,HEY!
125398,483,243,1025000,Selma Bouvier,Beach House,The boys needed to breathe.
125399,483,244,1027000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,Wouldn't they be girls?
125400,483,245,1028000,Selma Bouvier,Beach House,Mine are boys.
125403,483,248,1036000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,Which is our room again...
125405,483,249,1039000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,You know -- it had that painting of that lady and the monster on the ceiling.
125406,483,250,1043000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,That was a mirror!
125408,483,252,1046000,Legs,Master Bedroom,"Lookin' good, boss."
125409,483,253,1047000,Louie,Master Bedroom,"Yeah, you look like Johnnie Handsome before we shot him in the face."
125410,483,254,1051000,Fat Tony,Master Bedroom,"Hey, I gotta look good for my goomar."
125411,483,255,1054000,Marge Simpson,Master Bedroom,"Goomar?! That's mob talk for ""mistress."" Fat Tony has a mistress!"
125412,483,256,1060000,Homer Simpson,Master Bedroom,He's cheating on Selma? That's crazy! Why go out for a hamburger when you've got rancid steak at home?
125413,483,257,1068000,Homer Simpson,Master Bedroom,I'll just sit here quietly.
125414,483,258,1072000,Homer Simpson,Master Bedroom,Sorry.
125416,483,260,1083000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,How could Tony cheat on me so soon?
125417,483,261,1085000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,"Y'know Selma, from what I've seen here, Fat Tony has a lot of bad influences on him. I walked though a door last night and they were playing cards for real money."
125418,483,262,1097000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,"Well, Homer and I are going to take you away right now."
125419,483,263,1100000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,"Aw, can't we stay one more day? The Occurrence and I are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled."
125420,483,264,1109000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,"Sorry, The Occurrence, but to use your lingo, Homer and I have to be ""that guy."""
125421,483,265,1109000,THE OCCURRENCE,Beach House,"Whoa! You don't wanna be ""that guy."""
125422,483,266,1117000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,"I don't wanna be ""that guy,"" but Marge is making me be ""that guy."""
125423,483,267,1121000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,Enough!
125424,483,268,1123000,Fat Tony,Beach House,"Homer, good morning. May I interest you in a pool noodle?"
125425,483,269,1128000,Fat Tony,Beach House,"We also got pool ziti, pool fusilli -- or if you don't like those, Mama will make you one special!"
125426,483,270,1139000,Old Italian Woman,Beach House,Mother Mary herself couldn't make a noodle big enough to float this one.
125427,483,271,1145000,Old Italian Woman,Beach House,"Tony, we have to leave. For the record, I want to emphasize we're not leaving because today is ""cleanup."""
125428,483,272,1147000,Fat Tony,Beach House,Leave? Why?
125429,483,273,1153000,Selma Bouvier,Beach House,Because you have a girlfriend!
125430,483,274,1156000,Fat Tony,Beach House,"It is true, but it is not what you think."
125431,483,275,1161000,Angela,Beach House,Where is she? Where is this other woman?
125432,483,276,1164000,Selma Bouvier,Beach House,You're the goomar? You have some nerve coming here!
125434,483,277,1165000,Angela,Beach House,I'm Fat Tony's wife. You're the goomar!
125435,483,278,1168000,Selma Bouvier,Beach House,You're nuts! And I've got the ring to prove it.
125436,483,279,1172000,Angela,Beach House,That's a goomar ring. This is a wife ring.
125437,483,280,1178000,Homer Simpson,Beach House,"That's a wife ring? Marge, don't look!"
125438,483,281,1181000,Marge Simpson,Beach House,This doesn't make any sense. There was a wedding. You exchanged vows.
125439,483,282,1186000,Fat Tony,Beach House,I can explain...
125441,483,284,1188000,Fat Tony,Springfield Glen Country Club,"If you spoke Italian, which I knew you did not, you would've known that those were goomar-goombah vows."
125442,483,285,1215000,Priest,Springfield Glen Country Club,Vuoi tu Selma essere la goomar di Tony il Grasso per il resto della tua vita?
125443,483,286,1215000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield Glen Country Club,Si.
125444,483,287,1215000,Priest,Springfield Glen Country Club,E tu Tony il Grasso prendi Selma come la tua goomar finche non ti rompe i coglioni in presenzi ai tuoi compari?
125445,483,288,1215000,Priest,Springfield Glen Country Club,Si.
125446,483,289,1215000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Marge, if I ever tell you I want to get married again, I want you to stick your thumbs into my eyes."
125447,483,290,1222000,Louie,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Yeah, we can show you how to do it. The trick is, don't stop till you hear a pop."
125448,483,291,1226000,Angela,Springfield Glen Country Club,You missed my first open house as a licensed real estate broker for this brutta puttana?
125449,483,292,1233000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield Glen Country Club,I've hit on enough pizza boys to know what that means!
125450,483,293,1238000,Angela,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Then bring it on, sister!"
125452,483,295,1243000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"You were right, Marge. These people are not for us."
125453,483,296,1247000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"In a good marriage, you never say I told you so."
125454,483,297,1247000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Which is lucky for me because you're always right.
