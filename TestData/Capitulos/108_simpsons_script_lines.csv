21750,108,2,18000,Radio Announcer,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"KBBL Talk Radio. And now, Springfield's favorite conservative, and author of the well-selling book ""Only Turkeys Have Left Wings,"" ladies and gentlemen, Birch Barlow!"
21752,108,4,29000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Ugh. That Barlow's a right-wing crackpot! He said Ted Kennedy lacked integrity. Can you believe that?!
21753,108,5,36000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, switch the station. I consider myself politically correct, and his views make me uncomfortable."
21754,108,6,41000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, guys. Now, I'm not very political -- I usually think people who vote are a bit ""fruit-y"" -- but, for some reason, this Birch Barlow really speaks to me..."
21756,108,8,57000,Birch Barlow,KBBL Studios,"Good morning, fellow freedom-likers. Birch Barlow, the fourth branch of government, the fifty-first state. You know, there are three things we're never gonna get rid of here in Springfield. One: the bats in the Public Library..."
21758,108,10,69000,Birch Barlow,Public Library,Two: Mrs. McFearly's compost heap.
21760,108,12,76000,Birch Barlow,MRS. MCFEARLY'S HOUSE,"And three: our six-term mayor, the illiterate, tax-cheating, wife-swapping, pot-smoking Spend-o-crat -- Diamond Joe Quimby!"
21762,108,14,85000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Hey, I am no longer illiterate."
21764,108,16,87000,Birch Barlow,KBBL,"Now why are we doomed to this Quimby quagmire, you ask, o reasonable listener? Because this town is under the stranglehold of a few tie-dyed tree huggers who would rather play hackey-sack than lock up the homeless."
21766,108,18,101000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"This sounds awfully controversial. Lisa, you know I don't like controversy in this house."
21767,108,19,107000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't like him either Mom, but I'm doing a report on local politics for my school project."
21768,108,20,112000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You think you're so big 'cause your class always gets to do projects. Well, um... I'm doing a school project on, uh, fireworks!"
21769,108,21,122000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, I wish you wouldn't lie like that."
21773,108,23,127000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, as a special send-off and a way to say ""Gung hay fat choy"" to our visiting Chinese principals, Bart Simpson has promised us a fireworks display!"
21775,108,25,143000,Chinese Principal #1,Springfield Elementary School,All week he promise big firework display!
21776,108,26,146000,Chinese Principal #2,Springfield Elementary School,Bad student.

21779,108,29,151000,Birch Barlow,Homer's Car,"...so my friends, let's just junk those Dumb-o-crats and their bleeding heart smell-fare program!"
21780,108,30,156000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,"Dad, I had to listen to this jerk all morning. Can we listen to something else?"
21781,108,31,161000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"When I'm driving the car, I get to choose the radio station. When you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station."
21782,108,32,168000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,I can't take this anymore. Let's switch back.
21783,108,33,175000,Birch Barlow,Homer's Car,"Alright my friends, now let's go to the phones. First up is Bob, from South Springfield. Welcome to you, sir."
21784,108,34,180000,Sideshow Bob,Homer's Car,"Hello, Birch. Long-time listener, first-time caller. Kudos for bringing the ""public"" back to the Re""public""an party! It's high time people realized we conservatives aren't all Johnny Hate-mongers and Charlie Bible-thumps, or even -- God forbid -- George Bushes!"
21785,108,35,195000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,That sounds like Sideshow Bob!
21786,108,36,198000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob. Yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box."
21787,108,37,202000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,"Dad, I'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who Sideshow Bob is."
21788,108,38,208000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Phew.
21789,108,39,209000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,"Sideshow Bob used to be Krusty the Clown's sidekick. But in 1990, he framed Krusty for armed robbery and Bart got him put in jail."
21790,108,40,216000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Uh-huh.
21791,108,41,216000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,"When he got out, he married Aunt Selma and tried to murder her."
21792,108,42,220000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Oh, Sideshow Bob."
21794,108,44,222000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! Your mortal enemy is on the radio!
21795,108,45,225000,Dr. Demento,Simpson Home,It's time for more deeee-mentia with Dr. Demento!
21797,108,47,231000,DR. DEMEMTO,Simpson Home,"And now the ""Funny Five..."""
21798,108,48,234000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I meant your other mortal enemy, Sideshow Bob."
21723,108,49,240000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Sideshow Bob! I'm only ten and I already got two mortal enemies.
21771,108,51,245000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Retirement Castle,...and uh this proposed expressway will bring increased commerce to our local merchants.
21799,108,53,253000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,What's in it for us?
21800,108,54,254000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yeah, give us something we like, or we'll ride ya out of town on a rail!"
21801,108,55,258000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well uh, what do you, er, people like?"

21804,108,58,263000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Matlock!!
21805,108,59,267000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well, uh, I suppose I could name it the uh, ""Matlock Expressway."""
21807,108,61,276000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,...but it would be terribly myopic of me to blame all my current woes on one spikey-haired little simpleton.
21808,108,62,285000,Birch Barlow,Springfield Elementary School,"Mm hm. Myopic, or to say the least, intransigent. Now, you mentioned some ""woes"" there..."
21809,108,63,290000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,"Well -- you see, Birch, I'm presently incarcerated."
21811,108,65,296000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,"Convicted of a crime I didn't even commit. ""Attempted"" murder. Now, honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for ""Attempted"" Chemistry? Do they --"
21812,108,66,307000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Prison,"Oh really, now! This is a personal call!"
21813,108,67,310000,Birch Barlow,Springfield Prison,"Now, m-m-my Friends, isn't this just typical? Another intelligent conservative here railroaded by our liberal justice system -- just like Colonel Oliver North, Officer Stacey Koon, and cartoon smokesperson Joe Camel. Well, I've had it!!"
21815,108,69,328000,Birch Barlow,Bart's Classroom,I am gonna make it my mission to see that our friend Bob is set free!
21816,108,70,333000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Classroom,Nooooo!!
21817,108,71,336000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Bart's Classroom,"Well, despite Bart's objections, the people of South Africa can now vote in free Democratic elections."
21818,108,72,342000,Birch Barlow,Bart's Classroom,"My friends, Bob is a political prisoner. I want every loyal listener to do everything they can to get him out of jail!"
21819,108,73,351000,Moe Szyslak,Bart's Classroom,"All right, you heard the man. One grenade each."
21820,108,74,355000,Barney Gumble,Bart's Classroom,"Moe, I think he meant through non-violent grass-roots political action."
21821,108,75,361000,Moe Szyslak,Bart's Classroom,"Aw, geez... really ya think so? All right, give 'em back. Come on, everybody give 'em back."
21822,108,76,367000,Moe Szyslak,Bart's Classroom,"Hey, hey, who pulled the pin on this one?"
21824,108,78,368000,Protesters,Springfield Town Hall,Free Bob! Free Bob!
21826,108,79,373000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Very well. If that is the way the winds are blowing, let no one say I don't also blow."
21828,108,81,380000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Prison,"By special order of the Mayor of Springfield, you are hereby granted a full and complete pardon. Congratulations, Robert Onderdonk Terwilliger."

21834,108,87,427000,C. Montgomery Burns,REPUBLICAN HQ,"Now, then. Gentlemen, the mayoral campaign is upon us and if we hope to defeat this Joe Quimby we need a candidate with name recognition and media savvy. A true leader who will do exactly as he's told."
21835,108,88,439000,Birch Barlow,REPUBLICAN HQ,"Monty, I'm way ahead of you. If you'll just open that door you'll see the next mayor of Springfield."
21836,108,89,452000,The Rich Texan,REPUBLICAN HQ,Whu'd it say?
21837,108,90,453000,Birch Barlow,REPUBLICAN HQ,"No, no. Bob! Bob, come in!"

21839,108,92,460000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,REPUBLICAN HQ,"Why, he's even better."
21840,108,93,462000,Rainier Wolfcastle,REPUBLICAN HQ,I agree. I like the human touch.
21842,108,95,465000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, students, I want you to be on your best behavior for this carefully-choreographed media event. Now this means there is to be no wising-off, no face-making, and no grass-eating. This means you, Ralph."
21843,108,96,477000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, sir."
21844,108,97,478000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,"Hello, children. Hello, Bart."
21845,108,98,481000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Eep.
21846,108,99,482000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,"Young friends, my opponent Joe Quimby is confused about your school system. Do you know what he does? He flip-flops."
21847,108,100,493000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,Sometimes he doesn't know whether he's coming or going.
21848,108,101,501000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,He wants to sell your future short!
21849,108,102,510000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Elementary School,"Hmm. Bart, we can't let Bob steal the spotlight. We're gonna have to stoop to the lowest common denominator."
21850,108,103,515000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I can do that.
21851,108,104,518000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Elementary School,Ack! Help! I'm being attacked by uh things!
21853,108,105,523000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Uncle Mayor was just saying that us kids are the most important natural resource we have!
21854,108,106,529000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School,More important than coal?
21855,108,107,530000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Elementary School,"Er, uh, er yes."
21858,108,110,537000,Sideshow Bob,Sideshow Bob's Limousine,"Ohh, that was a big mistake, Bart! No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it!"

21861,108,113,559000,Singers,Simpson Home,WITHOUT A MAYOR QUIMBY / OUR TOWN WOULD REALLY STINK! / WE WOULDN'T HAVE A TIRE YARD / OR A MID-SIZE ROLLER RINK! / WE WOULDN'T HAVE OUR GALLOWS / OR OUR SHINY BIGFOOT TRAPS! / IT'S NOT THE MAYOR'S FAULT / THAT THE STADIUM COLLAPSED.
21862,108,114,574000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"Quimby. If you were running for Mayor, he'd vote for you."
21863,108,115,577000,Announcer #2,Simpson Home,Paid for by the Mayor Quimby for Mayor Mayoral Committee.

21868,108,120,595000,Jimbo Jones,Street,All right! The mummy's ready for his mystical journey!
21869,108,121,604000,Milhouse Van Houten,Street,What's haaappening?!
21871,108,123,606000,Grampa Simpson,LUNCHEONETTE,"That Quimby fella promised to build us a Matlock Expressway! How you gonna top that, smart guy?"
21872,108,124,616000,Sideshow Bob,LUNCHEONETTE,"Hmm. Oh how's this? I'll not only build the Expressway, I will spend the remainder of this afternoon patiently listening to your interminable anecdotes."
21874,108,126,625000,Grampa Simpson,LUNCHEONETTE,"Hot ziggity zam! Me first! Not many people know I owned the first radio in Springfield. Warn't much on the air then, just Edison reciting the alphabet over and over. ""A"" he'd say, then ""B""; ""C"" would usually follow..."
21876,108,128,651000,Scary Announcer,LUNCHEONETTE,"Mayor Quimby supports revolving-door prisons. Mayor Quimby even released Sideshow Bob, a man twice convicted of attempted murder. Can you trust a man like Mayor Quimby? Vote Sideshow Bob for Mayor."
21879,108,130,670000,Larry King,Springfield Civic Center,"The League of Uninformed Voters presents the Springfield Mayoral Debates. I'm your moderator, Larry King. Now, a word to our audience: Even though we're being broadcast on Fox, there is no need for obnoxious hooting and hollering."
21882,108,133,694000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Civic Center,I shouldn't have shaken hands with those old people.
21883,108,134,702000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Civic Center,I hope that flu doesn't affect his performance out there.
21884,108,135,705000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Civic Center,Don't worry. He's taken a million of these capsules.
21887,108,138,714000,Birch Barlow,CIVIC CENTER,"Sideshow Bob: Councilman Les Wynan says that you're not experienced enough to be mayor. Sir, what do you have to say about that?"
21888,108,139,723000,Sideshow Bob,CIVIC CENTER,I'd say that Les Wynan ought to do more thinkin' and less whinin'!
21889,108,140,731000,Lisa Simpson,CIVIC CENTER,There's no Councilman Les Wynan.
21890,108,141,734000,Bart Simpson,CIVIC CENTER,"Good line, though."
21891,108,142,735000,Birch Barlow,CIVIC CENTER,"Mayor Quimby, you are well-known, sir, for your lenient stance on crime. But suppose for a second that your house was ransacked by thugs, your family tied up in the basement with socks in their mouths. You try to open the door -- but there's too much blood on the knob--"
21892,108,143,751000,Mayor Joe Quimby,CIVIC CENTER,What is your question?
21893,108,144,752000,Birch Barlow,CIVIC CENTER,"My question is about the budget, sir..."

21900,108,151,787000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Town Hall,And the results are in. For Sideshow Bob -- one hundred per cent. For Joe Quimby -- one per cent. And we remind you there is a one per cent margin of error.
21902,108,153,799000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Town Hall,"All right let's go, live, to Bob Headquarters now, for Mayor Terwilliger's victory speech."
21904,108,155,818000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Town Hall,And just look how happy he is!
21852,108,158,835000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's the Rapture! Quick, get Bart out of the house before God comes!"
21906,108,159,842000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"So sorry, Mr. Simpson. Your house is blocking construction of our new Matlock Expressway."
21907,108,160,850000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Now, I am a fair man. You will have seventy-two hours to vacate. At that time, we will blow up your house and any remaining Simpsons."
21908,108,161,858000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, we've got to stop them."
21909,108,162,860000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know what you're up to, Mayor Terwigajer. And no one in my family's gonna stand for it!"
21910,108,163,867000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Move your god darned house, Son!"
21912,108,165,872000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, by special request of the Mayor's office, you are going to be left back."
21913,108,166,878000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You mean I have to repeat the fourth grade?
21914,108,167,881000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, yes... but, not for four or five years. Bart, you're going to kindergarten."
21915,108,168,885000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Kindergarten?
21916,108,169,887000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Ha!
21917,108,170,888000,Kindergarten Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,"Now boys and girls, who knows what this is?"
21918,108,171,892000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Triangle.
21919,108,172,892000,Kindergarten Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,"Very good, Bart. You have first choice of toys for free play."
21920,108,173,897000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Cool! I call the Flintstone Phone!
21921,108,174,901000,FRED FLINTSTONE,Springfield Elementary School,Yabba dabba doo! I like talking to you!
21924,108,177,908000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We're gonna lose our house and end up living under a bridge like common trolls.
21925,108,178,912000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think Bob won that election legally. I can't believe a convicted felon would get so many votes and another convicted felon would get so few.
21927,108,180,924000,Clerk,HALL OF RECORDS,Here you go. The results of last month's mayoral election. All forty-eight thousand voters and who each one of them voted for.
21928,108,181,931000,Lisa Simpson,HALL OF RECORDS,I thought this was a secret ballot.
21929,108,182,932000,Clerk,HALL OF RECORDS,Meh.

21934,108,187,973000,Lisa Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,"This is so cool, Bart. We're just like Woodward and Bernstein!"
21935,108,188,976000,Bart Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,"Yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading Archie comics."
21936,108,189,980000,Homer Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,Stuck-up Riverdale punks. Think they're too good for me.
21937,108,190,985000,Shadowy Figure,PARKING STRUCTURE,You're on the right track. Follow the names.

21945,108,198,1027000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,No Edgar Neubauer.
21947,108,200,1038000,Lisa Simpson,Street,This is hopeless. They're gonna demolish our house for sure. We're gonna have to move into a Motel 6.
21948,108,201,1044000,Bart Simpson,Street,But dad can't afford six dollars a night.
21949,108,202,1047000,Bart Simpson,Street,Heyyy...
21950,108,203,1047000,Bart Simpson,Street,Lis! Lis! C'mere! I found him! I found Edgar Neubauer!

21957,108,210,1087000,Lisa Simpson,PET CEMETERY,"All right, Bob! Now it's personal!!"
21958,108,211,1090000,Bart Simpson,PET CEMETERY,"Hey, uh, he did try to kill me..."
21961,108,214,1122000,Lionel Hutz,Springfield Town Hall,"Mr. Mayor, is it true you rigged the election?"
21962,108,215,1125000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Town Hall,"No, I did not."
21963,108,216,1127000,Lionel Hutz,Springfield Town Hall,"Kids, help."
21965,108,217,1132000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Town Hall,"Oh, I don't mind. We want these children to feel justice has been served. That way, they can sleep soundly tonight on their hard, feculent motel pillows. Well, Bart, Lisa, here I am."
21966,108,218,1148000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,I have a plan. I think we can trap him.
21967,108,219,1156000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you when you say you're innocent..."
21968,108,220,1159000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Town Hall,Indeed I am.
21969,108,221,1161000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Because we all know you're a naive pawn, puppet, if you will, of the most diabolical political genius Springfield has ever known -- Birchibald T. Barlow!"
21971,108,223,1176000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"You don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do you?"
21972,108,224,1180000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,You were just Barlow's lackey!
21973,108,225,1182000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,You were Ronnie to his Nancy!
21974,108,226,1183000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Sonny to his Cher!
21975,108,227,1184000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Ringo to his rest of the Beatles!
21976,108,228,1186000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Town Hall,"Enough! Lies, lies, lies! I did it! I did it all!"
21978,108,230,1193000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Town Hall,"There! Is that what you want, you smarmy little bastards?!"
21979,108,231,1198000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,We want the truth!
21980,108,232,1199000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Town Hall,"You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! No truth-handler, you! Bah! I deride your truth-handling abilities!"
21981,108,233,1208000,Judge Snyder,Springfield Town Hall,Would you get to the point?
21982,108,234,1211000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Town Hall,"Yes. Only I could have executed such a masterpiece of electoral fraud. And I have the records to prove it! Here, just look at these! Each one a work of Machiavellian art!"
21983,108,235,1227000,Judge Snyder,Springfield Town Hall,But why?
21984,108,236,1228000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Town Hall,"Because you need me, Springfield! Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside, you secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! That's why I did this -- to protect you from yourselves! Now, if you don't mind, I have a city to run."
21985,108,237,1249000,Judge Snyder,Springfield Town Hall,Bailiffs! Place the Mayor under arrest!
21986,108,238,1251000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Town Hall,"What? Oh, yes. All that stuff I did..."
21987,108,239,1256000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Bart! We did it! Now we get to keep our house, and you get to go back to fourth grade!"
21989,108,240,1261000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Aww. Tomorrow we were gonna find out who the dish ran away with.
21990,108,241,1265000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"The spoon, Bart."
21991,108,242,1266000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Of course!
21993,108,244,1272000,Sideshow Bob,Somewhere,"Someday, I'll have my vengeance. Someday, when I find my way out of this savage, roach-ridden cesspool..."
21994,108,245,1282000,Prisoner #1,Somewhere,"Say, Terwilliger's a Yalie."
21995,108,246,1284000,Prisoner #2,Somewhere,"Bob, come along! We need an eighth to row against the Princeton alums!"
21996,108,247,1289000,Sideshow Bob,Somewhere,Princeton?
21997,108,248,1294000,Prisoner #2,Somewhere,Row. Row. Row.
