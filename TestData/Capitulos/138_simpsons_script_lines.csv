29889,138,103,0,Troy McClure,MATT GROENING'S OFFICE,"Of course, what Matt meant to say -- according to his attorneys -- is that he couldn't possibly do it alone. And he insisted that we make time to acknowledge the hard work of everyone who makes ""The Simpsons"" possible."

29908,138,122,0,Troy McClure,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"Right about now you're probably saying ""Troy, I've seen every SimpsonS episode. You can't show me anything new"". You've got some attitude, mister. Besides, you're wrong! Because sometimes episodes run long and certain scenes never get aired. So fire up your VCR, because here for the first time ever are the cut-out classics."
29910,138,123,0,Troy McClure,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"When Krusty the Klown got cancelled, he tried everything to stay on the air. Here's what you didn't see..."

29936,138,148,0,Mona Simpson,Springfield Civic Auditorium,"Oh, sure. I read all about it. I mean, it was national news. Do you still work for NASA?"

29965,138,176,0,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I wanna stay here with Mr. Burns.
29966,138,177,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,I suggest you leave immediately.
29967,138,178,0,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst."

29975,138,186,0,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Living Room,His ass is gonna blow!
29976,138,187,0,Troy McClure,Simpson Living Room,"This past summer, all of America was trying to solve the mystery of ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"" Then they found out it was the baby. To keep this bombshell secret, the producers animated several solutions that were never intended to air..."
29977,138,188,0,Troy McClure,Simpson Living Room,"And to keep the show's animators, editors, staff, and hangers-on from leaking the solution, two completely different endings were produced -- one real, one phony. Here's the ending you were never meant to see..."
29978,138,189,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,The one who shot me was...
29979,138,190,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,Waylon Smithers!
29980,138,191,0,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Living Room,Nooo! Wait a minute. Yes.
29981,138,192,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,"With the sun blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world..."
29982,138,193,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth.
29983,138,194,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,I feel like celebrating.
29984,138,195,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about?"
29985,138,196,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,I see.
29987,138,197,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,"Smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulance."
29988,138,198,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,"Or so I thought. At the last moment, Smithers, drunk as a lemur, lurched out of the darkness and fired."
29989,138,199,0,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Living Room,That's right. Just before I'd shot Jasper. I was busy that night.
29990,138,200,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,Stricken I lurched forth in search of aide.
29991,138,201,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,"But finding only slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial."
29992,138,202,0,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to W and S. Waylon Smithers."
29993,138,203,0,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and you're recovered and we can all get back to normal."
29994,138,204,0,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,"Not exactly. Smithers, for attempting to kill me, I'm giving you a five percent pay cut."
29996,138,206,0,Troy McClure,Simpson Living Room,"But of course, for that ending to work, you would have to ignore all the Simpson DNA evidence. And that would be downright nutty."
29997,138,207,0,Troy McClure,Simpson Living Room,"Yes, the Simpsons have come a long way since an old drunk made humans out of his rabbit characters to pay off his gambling debts.
