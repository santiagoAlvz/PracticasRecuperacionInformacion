51918,218,8,120000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Whew. Mercy. Good evening. Our old friend Noah Webster defines laughter as the act or sound of laughing--
51919,218,9,129000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw haw.
51921,218,10,130000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well illustrated, Nelson. And now, fasten your funnybones for Groundskeeper -- oh, or should I say Grinskeeper... No, I'm sorry, Groundskeeper was correct -- Willie!"
51922,218,11,145000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,How many of ye hail from the fair city of Edinburgh?
51923,218,12,150000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,So have you noticed how North Edinburgh golfers putt like this and South Edinburgh golfers putt like this? Eh?

51928,218,17,190000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Kill me.
51929,218,18,190000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, Seymour, it seems we've put together a baseball team, and I was wondering -- who's on first?"
51930,218,19,200000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes. Not the pronoun, but rather a player with the unlikely name of ""Who"" is on first."
51931,218,20,205000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, well, that's just great, Seymour. We've been out here six seconds, you've already managed to blow the routine."
51932,218,21,210000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Sexless freak.
51933,218,22,216000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, seems as though we're just about at the halfway point, so why don't we call it intermission?"
51934,218,23,221000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh! Don't go too far. If you like cafeteria workers in Beatle wigs with tennis racquet guitars, you won't wanna miss the second half."

51938,218,27,239000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I saw Krabappel's butt. I paid.
51939,218,28,245000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oopsie. Mm, this could take a minute."
51940,218,29,248000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"There's an opening, Mom!"
51941,218,30,249000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I don't know... I, I hate to change lanes once I get going... that's really for race car drivers."
51942,218,31,255000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Mom, to your left. He's letting you in. Go!"
51943,218,32,258000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"C'mon, Mom / Flanders, woman!"
51920,218,33,259000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No, no, as soon as I get over, that lane will stop moving. Erma Bombeck said so, and Dave Barry agrees."
51944,218,34,269000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Ohhh, you suck, Marge."
51945,218,35,273000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Elementary School,"C'mon, move it, you clowns!"

51960,218,50,383000,Stan,Car Dealership,"Okay, here's how your lease breaks down. This is your down payment... then here's your monthly... and there's your weekly..."
51961,218,51,389000,Homer Simpson,Car Dealership,"And that's it, right?"
51962,218,52,391000,Stan,Car Dealership,"Yup. Oh, then, after your final monthly payment, there's the routine C.B.P., or crippling balloon payment."
51963,218,53,396000,Homer Simpson,Car Dealership,"But that's not for awhile, right?"
51964,218,54,397000,Stan,Car Dealership,Right.
51965,218,55,398000,Homer Simpson,Car Dealership,Sweet...

51970,218,60,415000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Huh?
51971,218,61,417000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"See? Instead of a cigarette lighter, it's got a lipstick holder."
51972,218,62,421000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Aw, crap! It's a girl's car. I can't drive this."
51973,218,63,426000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, sure you can, doll face."
51974,218,64,430000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,A pretty thing like you can do whatever she wants.
51975,218,65,435000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Shut up! Screw you guys!
51977,218,67,444000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Where's your keys? I'm takin' your car to work.
51978,218,68,446000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You cashed in your 401 to buy that stupid Canyonero. Why can't you drive it?
51979,218,69,452000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Are you saying I'm gay? Because if that's what you think, then just come right out and say it."
51980,218,70,457000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think you're gay. I just have to do my grocery shopping. Now please gimme my keys.
51981,218,71,462000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine.
51982,218,72,470000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sucker.
51984,218,74,475000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Good lord. How am I supposed to get in this beast?
51985,218,75,483000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that's a nice feature. Not much headroom, though..."
51986,218,76,489000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh! Oh, I guess I can drive it for a little while."
51987,218,77,495000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"But Mom, I read that sport utility vehicles are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents."
51988,218,78,500000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Fatal to the people in the other car. Let's roll!
51989,218,79,503000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hang on. The manual says I need to log on to the onboard computer.
51990,218,80,506000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,M-A-R-G-E.
51991,218,81,509000,Female S.U.V. Voice,Simpson Home,"Hello, Marge. Where would you like to go today?"
51992,218,82,514000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No one has ever asked me that before in my life.
51994,218,84,519000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Well, that's a first. I've never been able to fit thirty-two grocery bags into one car before."
51995,218,85,525000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,"Eww, why is Courtney Love on the Wheaties box?"
51996,218,86,529000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Hmm, I thought it was Sandy Duncan."
51997,218,87,531000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Uh-oh. Gridlock at twelve o'clock.
51998,218,88,539000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Oh, crud. And we're so close to the house."
51999,218,89,543000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"Um, I don't want to alarm you, but the ice cream's startin' to go south."
52001,218,90,553000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,"Hey, give me some of that."
52002,218,91,555000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,"Mom, Bart sprayed whipped cream in my eye!"
52003,218,92,558000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,I did not.
52005,218,94,563000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Kids, cut it out!"
52006,218,95,566000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,All right.
52007,218,96,567000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,Hey!
52008,218,97,568000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"C'mon, Mom, just cut across the field."
52009,218,98,570000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Oh, I don't know... It doesn't seem right."
52010,218,99,574000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Do you want to spend your whole life doing what's right?
52011,218,100,576000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,Of course not!
52012,218,101,581000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,Let's do it.
52013,218,102,586000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"Whoooa! You the man, Mom!"
52014,218,103,589000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Outta my way, nature!"

52019,218,108,611000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're tomorrow night's dinner.
52020,218,109,613000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom! Bart took what I said and turned it into an insult!
52021,218,110,617000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's nice, dear!"
52023,218,112,626000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"A three-chambered peanut! Marge, look what I did! Come quick! Hurry! Marge?"
52024,218,113,634000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you've been out there all morning."
52025,218,114,638000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,So?
52026,218,115,640000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,So... lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if you aren't around to see it.
52027,218,116,644000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'll come watch you do nothing after I try out my new high-intensity halogen headlights."
52028,218,117,654000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Nobody will ever cut me off again!
52029,218,118,657000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, please come in. Maggie smells bad. And the cat wants something, but I don't know what."
52030,218,119,664000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm almost done. And tell Bart to get out of my purse.
52032,218,121,678000,Marge Simpson,Highway,S.U.V. coming through. Open up for Marge. Thank you! Whoaaa! Daylight! C'mon. C'mon.
52033,218,122,689000,Marge Simpson,Highway,"Geez! Try the gas pedal, Gramma. It's right there, next to the brake. Oh, forgodssa-- Go back to New Jersey..."
52034,218,123,706000,Marge Simpson,Highway,C'mon! C'mon! Get that corpse off the road! The streets are for the living!
52035,218,124,713000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Highway,"Slow down, you maniac! Show some respect for this coffin full of bricks representing a young man lost at sea."
52036,218,125,715000,Chief Wiggum,Highway,Hey!
52037,218,126,725000,Marge Simpson,Highway,"Oh, great. What'd I do?"
52039,218,128,731000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,This better be important.
52040,218,129,732000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Street,"Can the sweet talk, Thelma and Louise. You have a serious mental illness. The technical term is ""road rage."""
52041,218,130,736000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Street,"I'll see you tomorrow morning at traffic school, Speedy. Now you've got exactly five seconds to get out of my sight."
52042,218,131,748000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Street,Why are the pretty ones always insane?
52044,218,133,756000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Okay, I assume you all know why you're here."
52045,218,134,760000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"That's right. You're all angry, sick people."
52046,218,135,764000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"But over these next eight hours, you will be broken down to the level of infants, then rebuilt as functional members of society, then broken down again, then lunch, then if there's time, rebuilt once more."
52047,218,136,778000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"All right, roll it, Lou."
52048,218,137,784000,Sergeant Crew,Springfield Police Station,"Hello, I'm Sergeant Crew. And I'm here to talk to you about Rooad... raage..."
52049,218,138,792000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Police Station,Duh!
52050,218,139,792000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Police Station,"Quiet, fatso, the sergeant's talking! Go on, dear."
52051,218,140,797000,Sergeant Crew,Springfield Police Station,"In these modern hectic days of fast food, answering machines, and one night stands -- people are getting angrier. Now, what you're about to see is not pretty."
52052,218,141,811000,Construction Worker,Springfield Police Station,"Cut me off, will ya? Take that!"
52053,218,142,816000,Businesswoman,Springfield Police Station,"Learn to drive, dimwit!"
52054,218,143,819000,Judge Snyder,Springfield Police Station,I sentence you to kiss my ass!
52056,218,145,824000,Sergeant Crew,Springfield Police Station,Look familiar? It should. Anger is what makes America great.
52057,218,146,826000,Sergeant Crew,Springfield Police Station,"But you must find the proper outlet for your rage: fire a weapon at your television screen, pick a fight with someone weaker than you, or write a threatening letter to a celebrity."
52059,218,147,839000,Sergeant Crew,Springfield Police Station,"So when you go out for a drive, remember to leave your murderous anger where it belongs: at home."
52060,218,148,850000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"And as if that film wasn't enough, we have a special guest: why, it's Curtis E. Bear, the Courtesy Bear!"
52061,218,149,860000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"For the next three hours, this bear will take your verbal and physical abuse with good nature and aplomb. So if you'll all just grab one of these two by fours..."
52062,218,150,870000,Curtis E. Bear,Springfield Police Station,"Uh, Chief, can I at least shield my crotch?"
52063,218,151,873000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Bears can't talk, Eddie."
52065,218,153,882000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Well, Simpson, did you learn something today?"
52066,218,154,884000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Ooo, did I ever. And that herbal anger rinse just washed the rage right out of me."
52067,218,155,890000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Police Station,"Ah, remember, Midge. You feel the need to rage, you call me, right? I won't even get sexual or nothin'. Unless that's what you want. That, that's not what you want, right?"
52068,218,156,901000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,No thanks. But thanks.
52069,218,157,908000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Police Station,"After you, sweetheart."
52070,218,158,911000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Police Station,"Oh, no. You first, ma'am."
52071,218,159,913000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Well, somebody go first."
52072,218,160,915000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Police Station,"Well, not me."
52073,218,161,917000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Police Station,I'm not going until she goes.
52074,218,162,918000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Oh, for crying out loud... I--"
52075,218,163,921000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Oh, oh, okay, calm down. Just think: what would Curtis E. Bear do?"
52076,218,164,928000,Eddie,Springfield Police Station,Move it! I gotta return this suit!
52077,218,165,936000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Get out of the way!
52079,218,167,940000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Police Station,"Whoa-ho-ho! Thanks, chick-dude!"
52080,218,168,955000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Well, I hope you're happy, Simpson. Those prisoners were one day away from being completely rehabilitated."
52081,218,169,960000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,I'm tearin' up your license!
52082,218,170,965000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Aw, geez, darned laminated... would you mind? I got stubby fingers."
52085,218,173,978000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How could they take away my license? It feels like I lost a limb.
52086,218,174,982000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that's a turn-off."
52058,218,175,984000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, why don't you come to the Wild Animal Park with us?"
52087,218,176,986000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, your father drives like an old lady."
52088,218,177,989000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,At least I've got a license.
52090,218,179,992000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, kids, I went too far."
52092,218,181,1003000,Bart Simpson,WILD ANIMAL PARK,"Oh, what a gyp. They're all just lying around. Do something!"
52093,218,182,1008000,Lisa Simpson,WILD ANIMAL PARK,"Bart, they're not here to entertain us."
52094,218,183,1011000,Homer Simpson,WILD ANIMAL PARK,I've seen plays that were more exciting than this. Honest to God. Plays.
52095,218,184,1018000,Homer Simpson,WILD ANIMAL PARK,I don't wanna pay four bucks to watch some monkey wannabe lay in the sun.
52096,218,185,1021000,Lisa Simpson,WILD ANIMAL PARK,"But Dad, lemurs are nocturnal."
52097,218,186,1024000,Homer Simpson,WILD ANIMAL PARK,"Don't worry, honey. Daddy will fix that broken animal."
52098,218,187,1026000,Lisa Simpson,WILD ANIMAL PARK,No!
52099,218,188,1027000,Homer Simpson,WILD ANIMAL PARK,I'm not gonna hurt him. I'm just gonna wake him up.
52101,218,190,1045000,Homer Simpson,WILD ANIMAL PARK,"Uh-oh. Here's your slingshot, Lisa."
52102,218,191,1049000,Australian Gamekeeper,WILD ANIMAL PARK,"I told 'em a chainlink fence wouldn't hold rhinos. Oh wait, no I didn't. I meant to tell 'em."
52104,218,193,1078000,Homer Simpson,WILD ANIMAL PARK,"Don't worry, kids. I know just what to do. Jumanji! Does anything from the movies actually work?"
52105,218,194,1091000,Chief Wiggum,WILD ANIMAL PARK,"Aw, nuts. Isn't there anybody who can round up these thunder lizards?"
52106,218,195,1096000,Lou,WILD ANIMAL PARK,"Well, they'd need a pretty rugged vehicle."
