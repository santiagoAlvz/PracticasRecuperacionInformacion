82497,320,253,1111000,Mrs. Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,I wouldn't put it past him. He stole my gold tooth the night he left.

82504,320,260,1143000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Town Hall,Stop!
82505,320,261,1145000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Town Hall,"Friends, what Homer did was wrong. But I've been thinking -- maybe I was just as wrong to give you those gifts."
82506,320,262,1153000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Wait a minute, everyone! There's your Christmas up there!"
82508,320,264,1161000,Selma Bouvier,Springfield Town Hall,It's a miracle!
