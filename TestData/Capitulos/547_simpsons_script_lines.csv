142288,547,2,24000,Homer Simpson,Sky,"Hey-hey, what--"
142289,547,3,40000,Homer Simpson,Sky,Cleats.
142290,547,4,42000,Marge Simpson,Sky,"Homie, what happened?"
142291,547,5,44000,Homer Simpson,Sky,Um... maybe some easy-listening music will make you feel better about the story. Turn on eighty-nine point nine.
142292,547,6,54000,Homer Simpson,Sky,"Like most of my problems, it all started at Moe's..."
142294,547,8,57000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"All right, so the rules are, every time the news guy says ""senator,"" we gotta take a drink."
142295,547,9,63000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,It'll be nice to let someone else decide when I drink. Too much pressure.
142296,547,10,68000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, Channel Six tip line? I just caught two senators doin' it in the alley. And me? I'm just a reliable source. Not ""sauce,"" ""source""! Source! ""S-A-U-R-C-E""!"
142297,547,11,79000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,"We have heard from a very reliable sauce, news involving multiple senators."
142298,547,12,85000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,I will read a list of senators...with possibly more senators...to be named later by other senators:
142299,547,13,85000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,"Senator Abercrombie, Senator Billingsley, Senator Beaumont..."
142300,547,14,97000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh damn, the plaster's flaking again."
142302,547,16,102000,Homer Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"Once intoxicated, we had a great idea."
142303,547,17,103000,Lenny Leonard,PLAYGROUND,"Hey, swings!"
142304,547,18,107000,Lenny Leonard,PLAYGROUND,I'm a kid again!
142305,547,19,112000,Carl Carlson,PLAYGROUND,I'll save you!
142306,547,20,117000,Carl Carlson,PLAYGROUND,The only way out is in!
142307,547,21,120000,Homer Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Hey! Look at me! I'm going up a slide!
142273,547,22,123000,Carl Carlson,PLAYGROUND,"Ho-mer, Ho-mer--"
142308,547,23,126000,Homer Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Best recess ever!
142309,547,24,129000,Homer Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Help me guys! Guys?
142310,547,25,133000,Carl Carlson,PLAYGROUND,"Don't worry, Homer. I'll call the cops!"
142311,547,26,134000,Lenny Leonard,PLAYGROUND,I'll write my senator!
142312,547,27,136000,Carl Carlson,PLAYGROUND,Senator!
142313,547,28,139000,Homer Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"Am I gonna die on a playground, like some uncoordinated child?"
142314,547,29,144000,Homer Simpson,PLAYGROUND,But I did learn something from all this. The sprinklers in this park come on at three a.m.
142315,547,30,152000,Softball Player,PLAYGROUND,Thanks for throwing the ball back. Really.
142316,547,31,156000,Marge Simpson,PLAYGROUND,I'll come back with the fire truck. I just have to get the kids to school first.
142317,547,32,161000,Homer Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"Oh, are the kids with you?"
142318,547,33,163000,Bart Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"Hi, Dad! / Homer."
142319,547,34,164000,Homer Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"Hey, guys! Why are you ducked down like that?"
142320,547,35,166000,Bart Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Don't want to be seen with you when you're hitting bottom.
142321,547,36,168000,Lisa Simpson,PLAYGROUND,At least we hope it's bottom.
142322,547,37,170000,Homer Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Don't worry. It's bottom all right.
142325,547,40,177000,Bart Simpson,Skinner's Office,And that's why I was tardy today.
142326,547,41,180000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"And with that tardiness, you have at last crossed the boundary where I can legally apply physical discipline."
142327,547,42,185000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Willie! Cut me a switch!
142329,547,44,187000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,What about the one your ma used on you?
142330,547,45,189000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"It uh, broke on my buttocks."
142331,547,46,191000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Serves you right for eating jam straight out of the jar.
142332,547,47,196000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Dammit! That's not even a swivel chair!
142334,547,49,200000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Street,"Skate! Skate! As fast as you can. / But I'll catch you, I'm the Principal Man! That's the kind of education you're missing."
142335,547,50,212000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Street,Oh no! Uphill! The one place my car can't go.
142337,547,52,221000,Body Shop Clerk,BODY SHOP OFFICE,Would you like a quote?
142338,547,53,224000,Body Shop Clerk,BODY SHOP OFFICE,"""Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go."" Oscar Wilde. P.S., your car is totaled."
142340,547,55,233000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Whoo! Safe!
142341,547,56,235000,Voice,Bart's Treehouse,"Oh, not totally..."
142342,547,57,238000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Wha-- what are you doing in here?
142343,547,58,241000,Snake Jailbird,Bart's Treehouse,Hiding from the cops.
142344,547,59,242000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Well, I can't have cops sniffin' around here. Some of them might be girls."
142345,547,60,246000,Snake Jailbird,Bart's Treehouse,Can't I just stay a little? I only committed this robbery to help my kid.
142346,547,61,251000,Snake Jailbird,Bart's Treehouse,"See, that's Jeremy. I need to get him braces. I always thought that if I'd had braces I'd have smiled more."
142347,547,62,258000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Hey, I bet you have a great smile."
142348,547,63,261000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Ay carumba!
142349,547,64,262000,Chief Wiggum,Bart's Treehouse,"Bart, Bart! We're in whatchamacallit... a pursuit!"
142350,547,65,265000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,So why'd you come here? I run a respectable treehouse.
142351,547,66,268000,Chief Wiggum,Bart's Treehouse,"Just wondering if you've seen anything. Word is you'll, uh, you'll snitch for candy."
142352,547,67,273000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,You can't buy me with a candy bar that has coconut.
142353,547,68,276000,Chief Wiggum,Bart's Treehouse,Maybe this is more your neighborhood.
142354,547,69,278000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Nice real estate. You've got a deal.
142355,547,70,281000,Chief Wiggum,Bart's Treehouse,"So, what do you know?"
142356,547,71,282000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I saw a guy with a gun and a snake tattoo say he was gonna hide out on top of Mount Springfield.
142357,547,72,290000,Chief Wiggum,Bart's Treehouse,"Mount Springfield, eh? Strap on your crampons, boys!"
142358,547,73,294000,Chief Wiggum,Bart's Treehouse,Eddie! Prepare my litter!
142359,547,74,296000,Chief Wiggum,Bart's Treehouse,"Lou, you are responsible for my oxygen, food, water, and cleaning! You have to clean me."
142360,547,75,303000,Snake Jailbird,Bart's Treehouse,"Dude, thank you. Why did you save me?"
142361,547,76,305000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,We outlaws have to stick together.
142362,547,77,307000,Snake Jailbird,Bart's Treehouse,Outlaw? You?
142363,547,78,309000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Stolen bowling shoes, 3-D glasses, Krusty standee...and this ""cage"" for my pet."
142364,547,79,314000,Snake Jailbird,Bart's Treehouse,What do you feed him?
142365,547,80,316000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,My A.D.D. meds.
142366,547,81,319000,Snake Jailbird,Bart's Treehouse,"Listen, would you like two tickets to the school musical. My son plays the butcher... in ""Fiddler on the Roof."""
142367,547,82,328000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I'm busy that night.
142368,547,83,330000,Snake Jailbird,Bart's Treehouse,"Yeah, lucky you."
142371,547,86,338000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,Are you okay?
142372,547,87,341000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,Don't put more in there!
142373,547,88,343000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,Going for record!
142374,547,89,344000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,What record? Stupidest death?
142375,547,90,352000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,Merci beaucoup!
142376,547,91,354000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,"Oh, well, you're very wel--"
142377,547,92,355000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,That's French for: Hello.
142378,547,93,355000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,"Actually, I think it--"
142379,547,94,355000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,"Lucas Bortner, competitive eater."
142380,547,95,360000,Milhouse Van Houten,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,A fat kid with a dream?! I can't compete with that!
142381,547,96,364000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,What does a competitive eater eat?
142382,547,97,366000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,"All the glamor foods: pizza, boiled eggs, chicken wings, and the big enchilada, which is not enchiladas but hotdogs."
142383,547,98,373000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,"Sixty-nine hot dogs is the current record. As the great Kobayashi says, ""Detekurutoki itaiyo."""
142384,547,99,375000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,What does that mean?
142385,547,100,381000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,That's going to hurt coming out.
142386,547,101,381000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,Is Kobayashi the number one... um... uh...
142387,547,102,385000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,"The correct term is ""gurgitator."""
142388,547,103,385000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,I won't be using the correct term then.
142389,547,104,389000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,"Virtually everyone uses his technique: ""Japanesing."" Shall I demonstrate?"
142390,547,105,393000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,"Um, why don't I just go sit alone and-- Oh, you're doing it."
142391,547,106,397000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,Ready... set... Japanese!
142392,547,107,405000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,"Nope, no. That's not going down. This happens from time to time."
142393,547,108,409000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,Maybe this isn't the sport for you.
142394,547,109,411000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,It's not a sport. It's my life.
148728,547,110,414000,Lisa's Thoughts,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,"Aw, he's sweet. What am I doing? He's just Ralph with a dream. The dream of not Ralphing. But I'm sure I could totally change and fix him."
142395,547,111,425000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,Can I join you for lunch?
142396,547,112,425000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,"Um, sure. How many whole pizzas would you like?"
142397,547,113,430000,Lisa Simpson,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,"Um, can I just have a slice?"
142398,547,114,432000,Lucas,ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIA,Interesting technique.
142400,547,116,432000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoa.
142401,547,117,438000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,You didn't tell me you had a PlayStadium Four!
142402,547,118,441000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's the first I've seen it.
142403,547,119,444000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Something's fishy, Bart. Where's the gift receipt? Where's the packet of desiccant that says ""do not eat,"" and believe me, you shouldn't."
142404,547,120,453000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I have a feeling this PlayStadium was ""liberated"" from its previous owner and given to me in gratitude."
142405,547,121,461000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"""Liberated?"" You mean ""stolen?"""
142406,547,122,464000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You can't spell ""crime"" without ""me."""
142407,547,123,464000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"C-r-i- there it is, at the end!"
142408,547,124,472000,Lucas,Simpson Home,"Oh hi, is-is Lisa home?"
142409,547,125,475000,MARGE 7,Simpson Home,"Yes, she is. And who are you?"
142410,547,126,477000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Lucas.
142411,547,127,479000,Lucas,Simpson Home,"It's pronounced ""Luca-dollar"". That's my competition name. I'm a competitive eater."
142412,547,128,484000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Competitive eater? Did I hear right? I could be a competitive eater?
142413,547,129,488000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No! You didn't hear anything!
142414,547,130,489000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes I did! I heard ""competitive eater""!"
142415,547,131,491000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's for people who haven't had heart problems!
142416,547,132,495000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Then that makes me the Jackie Robinson of the sport. And you are the racist Philadelphia manager!
142417,547,133,500000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Quit comparing me to Ben Chapman!
142418,547,134,503000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I will when you open your mind to change!
142420,547,136,507000,Lucas,Simpson Home,"So, what should we practice: um, Vienna sausage; blueberry pie -- short form; oatmeal -- long course; freestyle baked beans; catfish; ooh! cow brains..."
142421,547,137,519000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Beans, beans. We'll do beans."
142422,547,138,524000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,Huh. Never saw the pork eat the beans before.
142424,547,140,529000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, I'm a little surprised Lisa likes him."
142425,547,141,534000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Really? ""Justin Blobber"" over there doesn't remind you of anyone?"
142426,547,142,538000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Eight hundred dollars to cut me outta that slide? It's all about the money with those firemen.
142427,547,143,544000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Women marry their fathers, Marge."
142428,547,144,547000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,So you just might be meeting your future ton-in-law.
142430,547,146,554000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,God bless us.
142431,547,147,556000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You can do better!
142461,547,149,567000,Marge's Thoughts,Simpson Master Bedroom,My sisters are nuts. I'm happy being married to Homer. Most of the time.
142435,547,151,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,What the?
142437,547,153,622000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Maybe you're not cut out for competitive eating.
142438,547,154,625000,Lucas,Simpson Master Bedroom,Are you calling me not fat?
142439,547,155,627000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"No, I'm just, I... maybe you just haven't found the right food. Huh? How 'bout ice cream?"
142440,547,156,633000,Lucas,Simpson Master Bedroom,Yes! I will lay some hurt on that cream!
142441,547,157,637000,Lucas,Simpson Master Bedroom,Oh my God! Brain freeze! Oh my God! Kick me in the head till I pass out.
142442,547,158,645000,Lucas,Simpson Master Bedroom,Harder. I'm still conscious! You must kick me harder!
148518,547,159,654000,Adult Lisa,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Okay honey, I made you pork chops just like you like 'em -- twenty."
142443,547,160,657000,Adult Lucas,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Thanks, babe. Sorry you had to drop out of college to feed me full time. Now give us a kiss."
142448,547,166,673000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,What the?
142449,547,167,676000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Oh, yawn. Another freebie. Better be a sixty-four gig."
142450,547,168,682000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Huh? It's full of lame apps: Bully Avoider, Nosebook, Insta-Grandma, This was stolen from Milhouse!"
142451,547,169,689000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,From my backpack! Where Puppy Goo-Goo sleeps! Maybe it's time to tell me exactly what's going on!
142452,547,170,696000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Relax! Listen to the music of this bubble game.
142453,547,171,704000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"So peaceful... No! I won't let this go! Bart, it's time you told me how you've been getting all this stuff."
142454,547,172,713000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I helped Snake out of a jam so he paid me back in stolen stuff. It was an honorable arrangement. But I never thought he'd steal from you.
142455,547,173,720000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"Snake, eh? I never would've suspected the one criminal in town."
142457,547,175,729000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,You seem stressed.
142458,547,176,731000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,You wanna suck some Squishee?
142459,547,177,732000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,Sure.
142460,547,178,735000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Careful. It's uncut syrup. They give it to horses before they race.
142462,547,179,746000,Kent Brockman,Bart's Treehouse,"Jailbird, A.K.A. Snake -- that's his real name, Albert Knickerbocker Aloysius Snake, has been arrested for a series of thefts and may be put to death under a controversial new statute."
142464,547,181,757000,Chief Wiggum,Bart's Treehouse,"Yeah, we had a law stating ""Three strikes and you're out,"" but I thought it was: ""You're out!"" So I let people go. So now it's ""Four balls and you walk! Right to the electric chair!"" It's, uh, much clearer, Kent."
142465,547,182,772000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"Bart, I'm so sorry. I just wanted to ruin his life, not end it."
142466,547,183,777000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,You ratted him out? He's got a kid!
142467,547,184,781000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,A kid? I was crushed when I lost my Dad and all he did was move to the Holiday Inn. I can still see him smoking on the balcony. He looked like he missed something... maybe me!
142468,547,185,795000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"So you see, we can't let Jailbird fry."
142469,547,186,797000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,Time for the Sleepover Detectives!
142470,547,187,800000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I didn't say there'd be a sleepover.
142471,547,188,802000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"Too bad, 'cause I'm wearing my pajamas under my clothes."
142472,547,189,805000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,And my swimsuit under those.
142473,547,190,807000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,One day it'll all pay off.
142475,547,192,811000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, there's my magazine. Why, look at this! ""What every father should do for his daughter."""
142476,547,193,816000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, if you want me to do something, just tell me. Don't hide behind a magazine."
142477,547,194,824000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Right, right, right, right. According to Judy Kleinsmith, a professional freelance writer, fathers should take their daughters out on little dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would. Then she'll expect the same from the men in her future!"
142478,547,195,839000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wait. Let me get this straight. Sit and eat? That's my punishment?
142479,547,196,843000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not a punishment. But you can't just eat dinner. You have to be gentlemanly and attentive.
142480,547,197,851000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I can fake attentive. I've been watching a football game this whole discussion."
142481,547,198,855000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Not fake attentive. Real attentive.
142482,547,199,858000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, okay. We'll make it fun. I'll take her to that crab place. All the crabs you could smash."
142483,547,200,865000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You know Lisa's a vegetarian.
142433,547,201,867000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,She can smash a salad.
142484,547,202,869000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No! Homer, you can't just do the things you want to do. You have to act like someone you'd want Lisa to marry. If you just act like yourself, she might just... Oh, you know?"
142485,547,203,883000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,She might marry someone like me? You think that would be bad!?
142486,547,204,888000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I love you. But you can be a challenge, like doing the Daily Jumble."
142487,547,205,894000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you are comparing me to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper!"
142488,547,206,899000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I was just trying to--"

142497,547,215,925000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Just ask your daughter to have dinner with you. What is the big deal?

142505,547,223,942000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Calm down, calm down! She doesn't know it's you."
142506,547,224,945000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Hide! Hide!
142507,547,225,948000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, hello? Oh, sure, Liser, your Dad's right here."
142508,547,226,954000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Dad? Did you just call?

142513,547,231,971000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Woo-hoo! I got a date with my daughter!
142514,547,232,972000,Cletus Spuckler,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, we all been there. No need to act like you just invented air conditioning."
142517,547,235,980000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"So you see, Chief, Snake wasn't stealing that stuff out of greed. He was stealing it to thank me."
142518,547,236,987000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Plea denied! Warm up the electric chair, Lou!"
142519,547,237,991000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,You're not done yet?
142520,547,238,993000,Lou,Springfield Police Station,"The instructions are in Swedish, Chief. We got this from ""IKILLYA."""

142526,547,244,1003000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,But-but-but... quit arguing and give him the little wrench.
142527,547,245,1007000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Let him out, Lou. Let him out!"
142528,547,246,1010000,Lou,Springfield Police Station,"But Chief, we've got guns, he's got a little wrench."
142529,547,247,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,It's cold!
142530,547,248,1014000,Lou,Springfield Police Station,All right.
142531,547,249,1020000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Police Station,"Thanks for coming down, Bart. You won't need to save me a third time."
142532,547,250,1024000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Police Station,You're going straight?
142533,547,251,1025000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Police Station,"If I get caught, it's suicide by cop."
142534,547,252,1028000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Oh, I don't like the sound of that."
142535,547,253,1030000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Police Station,"It means I get you to shoot me, dude."
142536,547,254,1032000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Yeah, still sounds like a lot of paperwork."
142538,547,256,1037000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hair volumizer... Cologne?
142539,547,257,1040000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, Marjorie."

142555,547,272,1101000,Lisa Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,I'm fine.
142556,547,273,1104000,Waiter,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Well, have we decided?"

142567,547,284,1132000,Lisa Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,Is that Mom?
