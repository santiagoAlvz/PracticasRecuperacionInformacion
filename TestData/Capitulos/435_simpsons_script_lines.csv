112802,435,1,50000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"...And so, in summary...There are only two real commandments, and the other eight are just ""filler""."
112804,435,3,118000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"And now, I have some exciting news. Tomorrow we'll be blessed with a visit from the highest ranking clergyman of our Presby-Lutheran faith, His Holiness... the Parson."
112805,435,4,130000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,The Parson?! He's coming here?
112806,435,5,134000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Oh my God, she fainted! Let's go get smelling salts!"
112807,435,6,140000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Suckers!
112809,435,8,143000,Kent Brockman,Springfield,Springfielders have camped out all night to get a glimpse of the most saintly person to visit our town since Mother Teresa stopped here to gas up her Vespa.
112810,435,9,151000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield,And I'm sellin' all sorts of faith-based knick-knacks.
112811,435,10,154000,Kent Brockman,Springfield,Let's take a look.
112812,435,11,156000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield,"I'd commit arson for the Parson, clergymen can kiss my apse, all kindsa gems. Surprisingly, none of them have sold. Except for this one."
112790,435,12,166000,Kent Brockman,Springfield,There you have it -- news has never been softer. What's that? The parson is here!
112814,435,13,175000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield,"Oh, my God! It's him! The earthly embodiment of the Elected Chair of the National Congress of Deacons!"
112815,435,14,181000,Parson,Springfield,"Well, well, well, hello, everybody. Oh, I hope you didn't go to all this trouble for little ol' me."
112816,435,15,187000,Ned Flanders,Springfield,Parson! Parson! Give us a quick official church position on family.
112817,435,16,191000,Parson,Springfield,"Well, in these modern times, family is more important than ever."
112818,435,17,195000,Ned Flanders,Springfield,You just made my moustache tingle!
112819,435,18,199000,Ned Flanders,Springfield,Settle. Settle down.
112820,435,19,200000,Parson,Springfield,"Now, now, I am just a man like any other that has been chosen by God. I have come here from our world spiritual headquarters in Michigan City, Indiana to say: keep up the good work!"
112822,435,21,215000,Parson,Springfield,"And now if you'll excuse me, I'll do a little speakin' with your deacon."
112824,435,23,220000,Parson,Springfield,I LOVE TO GO TO CHURCH / IT'S WHERE I LIKE TO BE / I GET A DAY-IN OF PRAY-IN' / AND STILL TEE OFF BY THREE...
112826,435,25,230000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, calm down, Tim. He's just your old roommate from Texas Christian."
112827,435,26,235000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"He's like the Pope of this thing! This would be like Mary Kay visiting you when you were selling her cosmetics. That is, if you had stuck with it."
112828,435,27,243000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,You asked me to quit because I was making more than you!
112829,435,28,245000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Not now, he's here."
112830,435,29,246000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Welcome, Your Holiness."
112831,435,30,250000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,You'll love what we've done with the church. There's fresh wax on all the pews.
112832,435,31,254000,Parson,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, sounds to me like somebody put on more than just one coat."
112833,435,32,258000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Maybe.
112834,435,33,259000,Parson,First Church of Springfield,"Tim, um... is there somewhere that we can talk?"
112835,435,34,261000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Of course, my office."
112836,435,35,262000,Parson,First Church of Springfield,Perfect. WALKIN' TO YOUR OFFICE / IS WHAT I LIKE TO DO / MAYBE WHILE WE'RE AT IT / WE'LL PEEK IN AT YOUR PEWS...
112838,435,37,272000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,'Nilla wafer?
112839,435,38,273000,Parson,First Church of Springfield,I'll take two if you don't mind.
112842,435,39,276000,Parson,First Church of Springfield,"Tim, I'm here because of a problem with your last re-certification. When we tried to charge the filing fee to your credit card, it was declined."
112843,435,40,283000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, yeah, the bank put on a security hold after they saw a charge from an ""Offshore Poker Club."" Helen had bought a fireplace poker from Nova Scotia. She says it shifts logs better than American pokers, but I disagree. We'll get through it. We always do."
112844,435,41,301000,Parson,First Church of Springfield,"Well, love conquers all, huh? I remember when she was Helen Schwarzbaum. In fact, I remember when she was Harold Schwarzbaum."
112845,435,42,309000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,You what?
112846,435,43,310000,Parson,First Church of Springfield,"I've said too much. But, for the three months it took your card to go through, you weren't certified. Anything you officiated during that time: funerals, baptisms, even bingo... well, it just didn't count."
112847,435,44,322000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, well, I'm sure the Lord is understanding..."
112848,435,45,326000,Parson,First Church of Springfield,No he's not.
112849,435,46,327000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,I'll notify those affected right away.
112850,435,47,335000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Tea time! What's going on?
112851,435,48,339000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Helen, I was briefly uncertified."
112852,435,49,342000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"So all those ""Graces"" you said were... a lie?!"
112853,435,50,345000,Parson,First Church of Springfield,That food might as well have been regurgitated by Satan himself.
112854,435,51,349000,Parson,First Church of Springfield,"REGURGITATED BY SATAN / HE COULDN'T KEEP IT DOWN / OL' SIX-SIX-SIX, HE GOT SICK, SICK, SICK / AND THAT'S HOW VOLCANOES WERE BORN..."
112856,435,53,361000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Due to a bureaucratic snafu, I wasn't an official minister when we laid your dear Estelle to rest."
112857,435,54,368000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,So... she's still alive?
112858,435,55,370000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Retirement Castle,I'm afraid not.
112859,435,56,372000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,Good. 'Cause I left her ashes on the bus.
112861,435,58,376000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Coast Guard Headquarters,"So, Captain. When I blessed your vessel, it didn't count."
112863,435,60,381000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Ocean,Maybe the next one.
112865,435,62,388000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Cletus's Shack,...So I'm afraid I wasn't a minister when I blessed your tin-roof shanty.
112813,435,63,393000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,So that's why that ghost keeps a-comin' to the winder!
112840,435,64,396000,Mailman,Cletus's Shack,Afternoon.
112867,435,65,397000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,"Fly away, ghosty! Go back to your haunted cornfield!"
112869,435,67,403000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Reverend Lovejoy? You deliver pizza now? But we didn't order a pizza. But you forgot the pizza anyway. Marge, the pizza place screwed up again."
112870,435,68,413000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,Do you remember when I remarried you two after Homer got that divorce?
112871,435,69,417000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Like it was yesterday...
112872,435,70,424000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Kirk and Luann split up...
112873,435,71,424000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So Homer, fearing we would do the same, preemptively filed for divorce..."
112874,435,72,431000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"But then you remarried us, and we were as solid as ever."
112875,435,73,435000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And I think Apu got lucky with my sister.
112876,435,74,439000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm afraid that joyous occasion fell during a time when I wasn't actually a minister. Uh, since that time, you two have not been legally wed."
112877,435,75,449000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You don't get it, Padre. My old lady and I have a thing goin' on. We don't need a piece of paper to keep it real."
112878,435,76,457000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Who are you calling an old lady?
112879,435,77,458000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I need that paper quick!
112880,435,78,465000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,So you and Mom aren't married? Does that mean I'm a bastard?
112881,435,79,467000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You were born while they were married so legally, no. But in the sense someone calls you one when they're angry, yes."
112882,435,80,474000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not a big deal. We'll just go to City Hall and get married there.
112883,435,81,478000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I think it's romantic. You can pretend you're newlyweds starting a life together.
112884,435,82,484000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock."
112885,435,83,487000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little bastard...
112886,435,84,488000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's the angry one.
112889,435,87,499000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,This isn't the most romantic place to get married.
112890,435,88,503000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Sweetie, any place I'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world."
112891,435,89,508000,Coroner,Springfield Town Hall,Watch your back! Half a corpse comin' through!
112893,435,91,515000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Marge, this time I'm going to give you the wedding you deserve. Let's get out of here!"
112894,435,92,518000,Security Guard,Springfield Town Hall,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's the line to get out."
112896,435,94,529000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hello?
112897,435,95,533000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello. It's me, Lance Romance."
112898,435,96,536000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Your first mission is to look out the window.
112899,435,97,540000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whatever you say, ""Lance."""
112902,435,100,553000,Marty,Simpson Home,"This is Bill and Marty saying ""Marge, go down to the basement""!"
112903,435,101,553000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, what's going on? The violin, pants with a crease, why?"
112904,435,102,570000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. So -- will you marry me -- in style?"
112905,435,103,580000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh yes, Homer! Yes!"
112906,435,104,583000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Did you hear that, Santa? She said yes! Yes! Now, back to your cold, airless tomb."
112907,435,105,591000,Santa Claus,Simpson Home,Ho-ho-ho.
112910,435,108,598000,Marge Simpson,Store,"Oh, it's beautiful. But that's an awful lot to pay for a dress I'll only wear once."
112911,435,109,603000,Bridal Saleslady,Store,"Marge, a woman only gets one chance at a second re-marriage. The choice is yours: you can look like a fairy princess, or a pig wrapped in rags."
112912,435,110,613000,Marge Simpson,Store,Uh... a princess?
112913,435,111,615000,Bridal Saleslady,Store,Fine. We'll do it your way.
112914,435,112,617000,Bart Simpson,Store,"This one's a little gay, isn't it?"
112915,435,113,618000,Tux Salesman,Store,"Well, the last time I checked, pirates weren't gay."
112916,435,114,622000,Homer Simpson,Store,How'd you check?!
112918,435,116,625000,Homer Simpson,Bakery,"Check out this rocket ship cake, Marge."
112919,435,117,628000,Marge Simpson,Bakery,That's for a child's birthday. We're going to get this one.
112920,435,118,631000,Homer Simpson,Bakery,Maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake. And that would be a big surprise because I'd forget about it pretty quick.
112921,435,119,637000,Marge Simpson,Bakery,No rockets! You can pick the frosting.
112922,435,120,640000,Homer Simpson,Bakery,Chocolate.
112923,435,121,641000,Marge Simpson,Bakery,We'll take lemon.
112925,435,123,644000,Marge Simpson,Howard's Flowers,"Okay, I want white roses at the altar, red roses along the aisle, and blue roses in the centerpieces."
112926,435,124,651000,Florist,Howard's Flowers,There are no blue roses.
112866,435,125,652000,Marge Simpson,Howard's Flowers,I want to talk to Howard.
112760,435,126,654000,Florist,Howard's Flowers,Howard died ten years ago.
112927,435,127,656000,Marge Simpson,Howard's Flowers,"Well, did he take all the blue roses with him?"
112928,435,128,658000,Florist,Howard's Flowers,My father was a lovely man. He took very good care of my mother and me.
112930,435,130,663000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,"All right, people, I want every table to have two baskets of bread but only one plate of butter -- that will stimulate conversation."
112931,435,131,671000,Homer Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,What if we...
112932,435,132,672000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,"There is no ""we"" in wedding!"
112933,435,133,672000,Homer Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,"But there is, Marge! The first two letters..."
112934,435,134,675000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,I can't believe you're ruining the second Thursday before the wedding!
112936,435,136,684000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe you told Lenny and Carl they could bring dates! 'Cause they're not even coming to the wedding!
112937,435,137,688000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why not?
112938,435,138,690000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Because their R.S.V.P. cards arrived one day after the deadline!
112939,435,139,695000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, uh, maybe you should take a break from wedding planning. I think you're becoming a... Bridezilla."
112940,435,140,701000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bridezilla? A combination of bride and Godzilla? How could you say that? More like you're a... King Wrong!
112943,435,143,736000,Homer Simpson,GROOM'S ROOM,"No matter what I do, Marge yells at me. If she's like this now, what will she be like after we get married?"
112945,435,145,742000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,"Okay, okay, everyone back off! I want to see myself."
112946,435,146,751000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,A pimple! Not on my day you don't!
112947,435,147,758000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,"Okay, it's go time."
112948,435,148,760000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,Dim the lights.
112949,435,149,762000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,Cue the band.
112950,435,150,766000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,And... release the groom.
112951,435,151,770000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,"Homer, that's you!"
112952,435,152,774000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,We are now eleven seconds behind schedule!
112953,435,153,780000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,Homie?
112954,435,154,803000,Marge Simpson,Swell-Air Hotel,I can't believe Homer left me at the altar.
112955,435,155,806000,Cookie Kwan,Swell-Air Hotel,"Oh, Marge, have a shrimp puff..."
112956,435,156,809000,Cookie Kwan,Swell-Air Hotel,Wipe your tears with a monogrammed napkin...
112957,435,157,813000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Swell-Air Hotel,"I know it is hard, but smile for the cameraman from Gary's Magic Moments."
112958,435,158,817000,Videographer,Swell-Air Hotel,You have my deepest sympathy.
112960,435,160,823000,Homer Simpson,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,What's going on? What's with all the darkness? Hello? Marge! Where am I?
112961,435,161,833000,Homer Simpson,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,What the? I'm chained up like a common bicycle!
112962,435,162,838000,Homer Simpson,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,Who would do this to me?! It would have to be someone who could afford a chain.
112963,435,163,844000,Deep Mysterious Voice,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,You're going to be here a while.
112964,435,164,847000,Homer Simpson,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,But I have to marry Marge!
112965,435,165,848000,Deep Mysterious Voice,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,"As of now, your pathetic little life means nothing."
112966,435,166,851000,Homer Simpson,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,"Just so you know, you're making a pretty bad first impression."
112968,435,168,855000,Marge Simpson,SWELL-AIR HOTEL- BRIDE'S ROOM,It's all my fault: Homer wanted to serve those little cocktail hot dogs. But no. I had to have spring rolls! They taste like nothing!
112969,435,169,869000,Lisa Simpson,SWELL-AIR HOTEL- BRIDE'S ROOM,"I don't understand. Dad would never miss an open bar with chicken wings. Plus he loves Mom, and us, yada, yada, yada."
112970,435,170,876000,Bart Simpson,SWELL-AIR HOTEL- BRIDE'S ROOM,"Hey, I found something!"
112972,435,172,881000,Lisa Simpson,SWELL-AIR HOTEL- BRIDE'S ROOM,Sideshow Bob!
112973,435,173,883000,Lisa Simpson,SWELL-AIR HOTEL- BRIDE'S ROOM,He ruined the wedding -- getting his revenge on us at last!
112974,435,174,888000,Bart Simpson,SWELL-AIR HOTEL- BRIDE'S ROOM,"Because he knows that if Mom and Dad don't get married, I'll never be born!"
112976,435,176,898000,Delivery Man,Simpson Home,I got some wedding registry items for Mrs. Simpson.
112977,435,177,901000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm afraid I'm just... Ms. Simpson now.
112978,435,178,904000,Delivery Man,Simpson Home,"Interesting nuance. I'd like to hear more about it, but uh, company policy forbids chitchat."
112980,435,180,911000,Homer Simpson,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,I miss you so much.
112981,435,181,914000,Deep Mysterious Voice,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,"To remove that chain, you need the key to the lock."
112982,435,182,917000,Homer Simpson,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,"You idiot! How am I ever going to find the key to the... ooh, here it is!"
112983,435,183,923000,Homer Simpson,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,"To get the key I have to lick through a lollipop? Oh, how awful."
112984,435,184,929000,Homer Simpson,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,What the?
112985,435,185,931000,Deep Mysterious Voice,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,The lollipop is made of hot sauce.
112986,435,186,933000,Homer Simpson,DARK MYSTERIOUS ROOM,Whose side are you on?
112988,435,191,944000,Lisa Simpson,Small Creepy House,Sideshow Bob! Drop that knife and give back our Dad!
112990,435,193,949000,Sideshow Bob,Small Creepy House,I'm working on a bust of Krusty and using this knife to aerate the clay.
112991,435,194,956000,Sideshow Bob,Small Creepy House,Anyone for peppermint tea?
112992,435,195,958000,Krusty the Clown,Small Creepy House,"Not for me, but the monkey needs to keep his strength up. We're gonna drop him out of a blimp tomorrow and see what happens."
112993,435,196,963000,Krusty the Clown,Small Creepy House,"Oh, don't worry. Nothing's gonna happen to you, Mr. Teeny Number Seven."
112994,435,197,969000,Bart Simpson,Small Creepy House,"Bob, did you take any breaks yesterday... to kidnap our dad?"
112995,435,198,973000,Krusty the Clown,Small Creepy House,"Impossible. I was with Bob the whole day. Then we watched the deluxe DVD of ""The House of Sand and Fog."" At night we slept in the same bed for warmth. Then we woke up, had a little nosh, watched ""The House of Sand and Fog"" again with commentary..."
112996,435,199,986000,Sideshow Bob,Small Creepy House,The director was an ass.
112997,435,200,988000,Lisa Simpson,Small Creepy House,Fine. But how do you explain this?
112998,435,201,990000,Sideshow Bob,Small Creepy House,"Nice of you to think of me. However, ""SB"" could be anyone -- Scott Baio, the Sultan of Brunei, the former Polish secret police, the Służba Bezpieczeństwa... Or..."
