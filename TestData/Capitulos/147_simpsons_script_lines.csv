32078,147,5,52000,Miss Piggy,Simpson Home,"Not now, frog! Me and Iron-Pants are just getting acquainted!"
32079,147,6,59000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, what's a ""muppet?"""
32080,147,7,61000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but, man... So to answer your question, I don't know."
32081,147,8,71000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why did they make that one muppet out of leather?
32082,147,9,72000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's not a leather muppet, that's Troy McClure. Oh, back in the '70s, he was quite the teen heartthrob!"
32083,147,10,78000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?"

32086,147,13,89000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer! That's just an urban legend. People don't do that type of thing with fish. Troy McClure is a perfect gentlemen, like Bing Crosby or JFK. I wonder where Troy is now?"

147817,147,21,141000,TROY,Springfield,You wouldn't ask a handsome man like me to wear glasses? It'd be a crime against nature!
32092,147,22,150000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"They do make you look kinda like a nerd. Tell ya what -- Just go down to the DMV tomorrow and try to pass that eye test. I'll tear up this ticket, but I'm uh, still gonna have to ask you for a bribe..."

32100,147,30,187000,Fat Tony,SPRINGFIELD DMV,No. What I said was he sleeps with the fishes. You see...
32101,147,31,192000,Louie,SPRINGFIELD DMV,"Fat Tony, please, no! I just ate a huge plate of dingamagoo."

147818,147,33,205000,TROY,SPRINGFIELD DMV,"Ooof! Hel-looo, beautiful. John Law tells me I might need to wear these glasses."
32103,147,34,210000,Selma Bouvier,SPRINGFIELD DMV,"You? Nonsense. You're Troy McClure. I remember you from such films as ""Meet Joe Blow"" and ""Give My Remains to Broadway."" Stars like you don't need glasses!"
32105,147,36,226000,Selma Bouvier,SPRINGFIELD DMV,"Now, Mr. McClure, would you like to take off those glasses and read the top line?"
147819,147,37,233000,TROY,SPRINGFIELD DMV,"Uh, W-seven-star-pound..."

32112,147,49,296000,Selma Bouvier,The Pimento Grove,Being a huge movie star must be good too. What are you working on now?
147825,147,50,300000,TROY,The Pimento Grove,"I've been reading a lot of scripts lately. You know, it's a lot cheaper than going to the movies."
32113,147,51,310000,Selma Bouvier,The Pimento Grove,"Well, thanks for holding up your end of the bargain. I had a pretty good time."

32118,147,58,335000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Troy McClure? He's a washed-up movie star. He could be dating washed-up supermodels.
32119,147,59,340000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, I dunno. Maybe those rumors about his fish fetish weren't true after all..."
32120,147,60,345000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,This changes everything. I'd pay to see him in a movie now. Heh! If only that were possible.

32202,147,180,926000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That reminds me -- Troy said something interesting last night at the bar. Apparently he doesn't really love Selma and the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Well, enough talk. Let's snuggle."
32203,147,181,935000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"What?!! Oh, my God!"
32204,147,182,940000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, could you close your eyes? I'm trying to sleep."

32209,147,190,984000,Macarthur Parker,Hotel,"Oh, who cares? The offers are rolling in. Paramount wants you for a buddy comedy with Rob Lowe and Hugh Grant..."

32212,147,195,1004000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Selma... about you and Troy. We're not sure he's... all he seems.
32213,147,196,1012000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,Marge is right. He's wrong for you. Better you find out sooner than later.
32215,147,197,1016000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Wrong for me? How? Oh, I get it. My sisters have come down with a case of the green-eyed gazungas. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. You're stuck in a menial job you'll be doing ten years after you die, and you're tied down to a man who'd have to bathe to be a slob--"
32216,147,198,1036000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Selma! Troy doesn't love you at all! He's only using you to squelch the rumors about his bizarre personal life and further his career!
32217,147,199,1043000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,You don't know what you're talking about... I have to go now and see Troy.
32219,147,201,1059000,Selma Bouvier,TROY'S HOUSE,Is this a sham marriage?
147871,147,202,1062000,TROY,TROY'S HOUSE,"Sure, baby. Is that a problemo?"
32220,147,203,1064000,Selma Bouvier,TROY'S HOUSE,You married me just to help your career?
147872,147,204,1067000,TROY,TROY'S HOUSE,"You make it sound so sordid. Look, don't we have a good time together?"
32221,147,205,1071000,Selma Bouvier,TROY'S HOUSE,"Yes, but--"
147873,147,206,1072000,TROY,TROY'S HOUSE,"Don't you have everything you ever wanted here? Money, security, a big hot flat rock for Jub-jub?"
32222,147,207,1077000,Selma Bouvier,TROY'S HOUSE,But... don't you love me?
147874,147,208,1080000,TROY,TROY'S HOUSE,"Sure I do. Like I love Fresca. Isn't that enough? The only difference between our marriage and anyone else's is, we know ours is a sham."
32223,147,209,1090000,Selma Bouvier,TROY'S HOUSE,Are you gay?
147875,147,210,1091000,TROY,TROY'S HOUSE,"Gay? I wish! If I were gay there'd be no problem. No, what I have is a romantic abnormality -- one so unbelievable that it must be hidden from the public at all costs. You see--"
32224,147,211,1104000,Selma Bouvier,TROY'S HOUSE,Stop. You're asking me to live a lie. I don't know if I can do that.
147878,147,212,1109000,TROY,TROY'S HOUSE,"It's remarkably easy! Just smile for the cameras and enjoy Mr. Troy's Wild Ride! You'll go to the right parties, meet the right people -- sure, you'll be a sham wife -- but you'll be the envy of every other sham wife in town! So whad'ya say, baby?"
32225,147,213,1128000,Selma Bouvier,TROY'S HOUSE,Tell me again about Mr. Troy's Wild Ride.
147879,147,215,1140000,TROY,Aztec Theater,"One day my lady Selma's gonna have a star right next to mine, so watch out Laszlo Panaflex!"
32229,147,218,1149000,Male Co-host,Insinutainment Tonight Studios,"Tonight, all Hollywood's wondering who'll be chosen to costar in the big new McBain pic, ""McBain IV: Fatal Discharge."""
32094,147,220,1157000,Macarthur Parker,TROY'S LIVING ROOM,"Ohhh, you watching?"
147813,147,221,1159000,TROY,TROY'S LIVING ROOM,"Mac, you gotta get me that part!"
32232,147,222,1160000,Macarthur Parker,TROY'S LIVING ROOM,"I will -- but you gotta do something for me. Problem is, the big parts these days are all going to family men."
147880,147,223,1165000,TROY,TROY'S LIVING ROOM,But I already got married!
32233,147,224,1167000,Macarthur Parker,TROY'S LIVING ROOM,"Yeah, but for a role like this you gotta pour it on. You and uh, wife have gotta have a baby."
147881,147,225,1172000,TROY,TROY'S LIVING ROOM,"A baby, eh? What do I do?"
32234,147,226,1174000,Macarthur Parker,TROY'S LIVING ROOM,"I'll send you over a pamphlet. Uh, listen, you can't buy that kind of P.R. But you can get it for nothing, by having a baby. Which, by the way, your insurance will cover, except for the deductible, which I will reimburse you for if you get the part, which you will if you have a baby."
147882,147,227,1186000,TROY,TROY'S LIVING ROOM,C'est Troy bien!
32235,147,228,1187000,Macarthur Parker,TROY'S LIVING ROOM,"Okay, now listen, let's talk baby names. You can't use Montana, Dakota or Florida -- they're taken."
147883,147,229,1195000,TROY,TROY'S LIVING ROOM,Uh... Oregon?
32236,147,230,1196000,Macarthur Parker,TROY'S LIVING ROOM,"Oh, Pacific Northwest -- very hot."
32238,147,232,1200000,Selma Bouvier,Restaurant,Having a child -- that's a big step.
147884,147,233,1203000,TROY,Restaurant,"You bet it is! Think what it'll mean! Not just the McBain movie, but maybe my own fragrance... ""Smellin' of Troy""!"
32239,147,234,1210000,Selma Bouvier,Restaurant,It is probably my last chance to be a mommy...
32240,147,235,1214000,Maitre D',Restaurant,"Cigarette, Mrs. McClure?"
147885,147,236,1215000,TROY,Restaurant,You bet! From now on she's smoking for two!
32242,147,238,1223000,Selma Bouvier,Troy's Bedroom,C'Mere... Tiger.
32243,147,240,1230000,Selma Bouvier,Troy's Bedroom,Would you like some wine?
147886,147,241,1232000,TROY,Troy's Bedroom,Yes!
32244,147,242,1241000,Selma Bouvier,Troy's Bedroom,"Uh, why don't you come over here and make yourself more comfortable?"
147887,147,243,1246000,TROY,Troy's Bedroom,"No, why don't you come over here and make yourself comfortable? I'm sorry, this whole concept's foreign to me. Who knew a baby would be so much work?"
32245,147,244,1256000,Selma Bouvier,Troy's Bedroom,"Having a baby isn't supposed to be ""work."" It's supposed to be an expression of the feelings we're supposed to have for each other."
147888,147,245,1265000,TROY,Troy's Bedroom,"Oh, like how we built that snowman together in that Newport ad? Remember how ""alive with pleasure"" they said we were?"
32246,147,246,1281000,Selma Bouvier,Troy's Bedroom,"Look, I'm sorry, a loveless marriage is one thing. We're not hurting anybody. But bringing a child into a loveless family is something I just can't do."
147889,147,247,1290000,TROY,Troy's Bedroom,"Oh, great, we'll adopt. I'll call my agent, he'll find some kid who wants in on the deal."
32248,147,248,1296000,Selma Bouvier,Troy's Bedroom,"Goodbye, Troy. I'll always remember you, but not from your films."
32249,147,249,1311000,Selma Bouvier,Troy's Bedroom,"Come on, Jub-Jub, let's go home and I'll microwave you some nice roaches."
32252,147,252,1324000,Male Co-host,Studio,"In a bold move that has stunned Hollywood insiders, newly divorced comeback kid Troy McClure has turned down the supporting lead in ""McBain IV"" to direct and star in his own pet project: ""The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel."" Will the gambit pay off? Twentieth Century Fox is betting it will."
