84774,329,9,61000,Saleswoman,GIRLS' DEPARTMENT,"This is our ""Li'l Hooker"" line. All the girls your age are wearing it... except the freakishly unpopular."
84775,329,10,69000,Lisa Simpson,GIRLS' DEPARTMENT,But I'm eight years old!
84776,329,11,71000,Saleswoman,GIRLS' DEPARTMENT,So is your look.

84779,329,14,79000,Marge Simpson,COSMETICS DEPT.,No.
84780,329,15,79000,Lindsay Naegle,COSMETICS DEPT.,This dermal magnifier will show the extent of the damage.

84794,329,29,126000,Seymour Skinner,Housewares Section,"Edna, we don't need wedding china. The dishes mother won on ""Let's Make A Deal"" are holding up nicely."
84795,329,30,130000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Housewares Section,"Seymour, if we register for these dishes, our wedding guests will buy them for us."
84796,329,31,136000,Seymour Skinner,Housewares Section,"And I suppose those wedding guests will also pay for dishwashing liquid, heated water, and two-sided sponges?"

84801,329,35,161000,Salesman,Housewares Section,"That's not a toy, son. It's a bar code reader. It registers wedding gifts."
84802,329,36,165000,Bart Simpson,Housewares Section,Bull-honky.
84803,329,37,166000,Salesman,Housewares Section,"No, not bull-honky. A couple uses the gun to select gifts they want for their wedding."
84804,329,38,173000,Bart Simpson,Housewares Section,Wow.
84805,329,39,173000,Salesman,Housewares Section,"If you'll excuse me, I'm going to the employee lounge to finish my Shasta."

84814,329,48,224000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Another employee family wedding. What's the traditional peasant gift in these parts? A milking cow?
84815,329,49,231000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Actually, silverware is all that's left on the registry."
84816,329,50,233000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,See if Lenny wants to go in on a spoon.
84818,329,52,246000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Field,"Remember, if anyone asks, you're my niece from out of town."

84824,329,58,268000,Sideshow Mel,Tent,"I see neither blushing bride, nor ardent swain. There is no wedding here!"

84831,329,65,309000,Chief Wiggum,Tent,"So, you thought you'd pull a fake wedding, eh? You're under arrest."
84832,329,66,314000,Bart Simpson,Tent,"C'mon Chief, it was just a prank. Would some flatware make things right?"
84833,329,67,318000,Chief Wiggum,Tent,What does it say on my badge?
84710,329,68,320000,Chief Wiggum,Tent,Cash bribes only.

84836,329,71,326000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,"Bart, the record of your mischief is staggering. Just look at this file."
84837,329,72,331000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,That doesn't look so big.
84838,329,73,332000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,These are directions to the facility where Bart's criminal record occupies three full storage lockers.
84839,329,74,339000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,Six feet by eight?

84843,329,78,352000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,"Juvie?! Please Judge, you can't... I-I'll do anything! I'll squeal on my dad -- he's been up to bad things. Crap you'VE never even thought of."
84844,329,79,359000,Chief Wiggum,Courtroom,We've already got an informer working deep cover on your dad. One he'll never suspect.
84845,329,80,365000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Is it Lenny?
84846,329,81,366000,Chief Wiggum,Courtroom,Dammit! I mean... uh no. No.
84847,329,82,373000,Chief Wiggum,Courtroom,Now take that kid away.
84848,329,83,377000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,No! You're not going to take my baby to jail!
84849,329,84,382000,Chief Wiggum,Courtroom,"All right boys, she's not letting go. Make the switch."
84850,329,85,394000,Ralph Wiggum,Courtroom,Your eyes need diapers.

84856,329,91,433000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My baby boy is in jail! I'm the worst mom in the world.
84857,329,92,440000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's not all your fault. All these years, I watched you turn our son into a time bomb, and yet I did nothing. So in a way, I too am a victim... of you."
84858,329,93,454000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You're a great mom. You were always there for Bart with love and support. His acting out was probably caused by negative reinforcement.
84859,329,94,463000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I get it. Blame the strangler."
84861,329,96,472000,Instructor,JUVIE,Just because you've done time in juvie doesn't mean the world has given up on you. See for yourself the exciting careers that wait for you upon your release.

84863,329,100,486000,Krusty the Clown,JUVIE,"Ex-cons are a Godsend to employers like me. If you ask for a raise, I just call your parole officer and back in the can you go!"

84883,329,120,603000,Bart Simpson,Prison Visiting Room,"It's horrible in here -- the boys beat me up, the girls beat me up..."
84884,329,121,607000,Marge Simpson,Prison Visiting Room,"Now sweetie, you shouldn't hang around with people who beat you. They're not true friends."
84885,329,122,611000,Guard,Prison Visiting Room,Time's up!
84886,329,123,615000,Homer Simpson,Prison Visiting Room,My poor boy is miserable in here. There has to be something I can do to help him.
84887,329,124,622000,Homer Simpson,Prison Visiting Room,"Interesting. Marge, what does that sign say?"
84889,329,126,628000,Warden,Juvenile Prison,"So, why do you want to be a guard here?"
84890,329,127,631000,Homer Simpson,Juvenile Prison,I believe that children are the future -- unless we stop them now.
84891,329,128,636000,Warden,Juvenile Prison,Welcome aboard.

84898,329,135,653000,Homer Simpson,Prison Rec Room,Put that sissy down!
84899,329,136,656000,Homer Simpson,Prison Rec Room,"If you're gonna pick on someone, why don't you pick on someone much bigger than you with a gun?"
84900,329,137,661000,Bart Simpson,Prison Rec Room,Dad?!
84901,329,138,662000,Homer Simpson,Prison Rec Room,That's right. I got a job here so I can watch over you like a mother hen.
84902,329,139,667000,Boy Juvie,Prison Rec Room,His dad's a screw?
84903,329,140,669000,Homer Simpson,Prison Rec Room,"I sure am. Here you go, son. I brought you a lollipop from the guards' lounge."

84910,329,147,696000,Warden,Prison Gymnasium,"Studies show the part of the brain that remembers dance steps is also the anger center. So, juveniles who know how to foxtrot are ten per cent less likely to commit a double homicide."
84911,329,148,710000,Juvie #2,Prison Gymnasium,Who conducted this study?
84912,329,149,713000,Warden,Prison Gymnasium,"The institute of ""Shut Your Fat Face""! Now pair up!"
84913,329,150,719000,Gina Vendetti,Prison Gymnasium,He's mine.
84914,329,151,721000,Juvie Girl,Prison Gymnasium,Him? Why?
84915,329,152,723000,Gina Vendetti,Prison Gymnasium,I like 'em small and bug-eyed.
84916,329,153,727000,Warden,Prison Gymnasium,"You two will dance, and you'll like it. Then you'll have punch and you'll drink it. Then your eyes will meet, and it will be awkward. So help me God."
84917,329,154,741000,Gina Vendetti,Prison Gymnasium,"Okay, here's my rules. Hands at ten and two, no eye contact, and I don't wanna hear how pretty I look."
84918,329,155,748000,Bart Simpson,Prison Gymnasium,"Don't worry, you won't."
84919,329,156,769000,Gina Vendetti,Prison Gymnasium,We're gettin' outta here.
84920,329,157,777000,Warden,Prison Gymnasium,They're escaping! Seal the perimeter!

84922,329,159,788000,Warden,Prison Gymnasium,Can't you go any faster?
84923,329,160,790000,Janitor,Prison Gymnasium,"Well, I can close it faster, or I can close it right."
84924,329,161,796000,Warden,Prison Gymnasium,Can't you do both?
84925,329,162,797000,Janitor,Prison Gymnasium,Talk to the union.
84926,329,163,800000,Bart Simpson,Prison Gymnasium,I'm gettin' out in two weeks. Why would I want to break out with you?
84928,329,164,804000,Bart Simpson,Prison Gymnasium,"Well, you do look pretty in the moonlight."
84930,329,166,813000,Bart Simpson,JUVENILE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY,Hey guards! Help! Help!
84932,329,168,820000,Gina Vendetti,JUVENILE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY,Guess where the next one's going.
84935,329,171,831000,Bart Simpson,Countryside,Why'd you kiss me? Are you lookin' to do the Bartman?
84936,329,172,836000,Gina Vendetti,Countryside,"Hey, I'm only stickin' with you 'til I get these chains off. And if we get caught, I'm tell 'em this was your idea."
84937,329,173,841000,Bart Simpson,Countryside,Yeah? Why would they believe you?
84938,329,174,843000,Gina Vendetti,Countryside,Because I can do this.
84939,329,175,847000,Gina Vendetti,Countryside,"That mean boy he dragged me out of the dance I didn't want to go, but he was too strong!"
84940,329,176,856000,Bart Simpson,Countryside,But you've got twenty pounds on me!
84941,329,177,858000,Gina Vendetti,Countryside,And then he said I was fat!
84942,329,178,862000,Bart Simpson,Countryside,I'm screwed.
84943,329,179,865000,Gina Vendetti,Countryside,"You bet you are. Now as long as we're together, I expect you to be a man."
84944,329,180,869000,Bart Simpson,Countryside,But I have to wizzle.
84945,329,181,870000,Gina Vendetti,Countryside,Fine.
84946,329,182,871000,Bart Simpson,Countryside,I miss prison.
84948,329,184,874000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"I am not chipping in for a birthday cake for that jackass Arnie Pye... let him eat... This is Kent Brockman, live at Springfield Juvenile Hall, the scene of a daring escape by inmates Bart Simpson and Gina Vendetti."
84949,329,185,888000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"To understand the mindset of the escapees, we've brought in an expert, former under-aged offender... Snake."
84950,329,186,894000,Snake Jailbird,Simpson Home,"If they're smart, Kent, they'll stay off the main roads. It's all here in my book: ""Ten Habits of Highly Successful Criminals."""
84951,329,187,900000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"All right, I plugged your book. Now put down the gun."
84952,329,188,907000,Snake Jailbird,Simpson Home,"Tell them I'll be on Conan Thursday, with Heather Locklear and Third-Eye Blind."
84953,329,189,912000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why would Bart escape if he's gonna be released in two weeks?
84954,329,190,915000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You just don't understand boys. He's stupid.
84955,329,191,919000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But he won't know where to go or what to eat.
84956,329,192,923000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Relax, what's the worst that could happen?"
84957,329,193,927000,Alien,Simpson Home,You shall marry my daughter Moonhilda.
84958,329,194,931000,Female Alien,Simpson Home,I can't wait to lay my eggs in his brain.
84959,329,195,935000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No son of mine will be marched down the aisle at the barrel of a ray gun.
84960,329,196,939000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Let's go.
84962,329,198,943000,Bart Simpson,Woods,So why'd they send you to juvie? Shoplift a scrunchie?
84963,329,199,946000,Gina Vendetti,Woods,Get bent. I pushed Snow White over the parapet at Disneyland.
84964,329,200,950000,Bart Simpson,Woods,Oh man. Did she live?
84965,329,201,953000,Gina Vendetti,Woods,"Yeah, but it's not a good life."
84966,329,202,957000,Bart Simpson,Woods,"Gina, before we get any closer, there's something you need to know about me. I think girls are icky-pants."
84967,329,203,963000,Gina Vendetti,Woods,It took a lot of courage to say that. Courage I'm gonna pinch out of you.
84969,329,205,972000,Chief Wiggum,Cletus's Shack,"Say Cletus, have you seen a couple of kids go by?"
84970,329,206,976000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,I don't have such a good memory since I drank my thermometer -- but I whittles what I sees.
84971,329,207,985000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,Is this them?
84972,329,208,987000,Chief Wiggum,Cletus's Shack,"It sure is. We're on the right track. Hey, what're you making now?"
84973,329,209,991000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,"Uh, sometimes I whittles the future."
84974,329,210,998000,Chief Wiggum,Cletus's Shack,Hm.
84976,329,212,999000,Bart Simpson,Woods,Great. I can get these handcuffs off before I get a full-blown case of the cooties.
84977,329,213,1004000,Gina Vendetti,Woods,"Bart, I can't believe you don't know this, but there's no such thing as cooties, cootie shots, cootie force-fields, or cootie insurance."
84978,329,214,1012000,Bart Simpson,Woods,But State Farm took my money!
84979,329,215,1015000,Bart Simpson,Woods,"When we split up, where are you gonna go?"
84980,329,216,1018000,Gina Vendetti,Woods,Don't worry -- my family'll hide me 'til the heat's off.
84981,329,217,1019000,Bart Simpson,Woods,"Wow, your parents are cool!"
84982,329,218,1025000,Bart Simpson,Woods,"Oh man, there's a line."
84983,329,219,1030000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Woods,You keep your ink hole shut about this.
84985,329,221,1052000,Gina Vendetti,BLACKSMITH'S,We're free! We're free!
84986,329,222,1054000,Gina Vendetti,BLACKSMITH'S,"Bart, I'm gonna miss you so much."
84987,329,223,1057000,Bart Simpson,BLACKSMITH'S,"Hey, the next time my Mom asks me to help around the house, I could come live with your family."
84988,329,224,1063000,Gina Vendetti,BLACKSMITH'S,"Don't get fresh with me, jerk."
