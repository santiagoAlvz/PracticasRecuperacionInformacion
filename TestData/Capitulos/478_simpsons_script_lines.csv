124088,478,210,1207000,Bart Simpson,COTTAGE,This is it... I finally get to accept an award for my movie...except it's not just my movie. It was my sister's idea to make this into a short. And so many animators... every day was somebody's birthday. And you know what? It was my Dad's movie too. I only wish he were here and not at Cerritos Auto Square.
124089,478,211,1228000,Homer Simpson,COTTAGE,"You got your wish, boy. I'm proud of ya. I'm sorry I took all the credit."
124090,478,212,1232000,Bart Simpson,COTTAGE,"This whole thing is silly. I mean, isn't the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard?"

Umm, glad I bumped into you, actually. Because, uh, I'm looking to expand beyond comedy. I know what you're thinking, Sir Ridley. You're thinking ""Oh my word, he's been making me laugh all these years, but now he's moving me as well. I'm gonna have to put him in my new film. What do you think?"
124097,478,219,1301000,Homer Simpson,BEVERLY HILTON-TYPE HOTEL,I'm a seat filler.
