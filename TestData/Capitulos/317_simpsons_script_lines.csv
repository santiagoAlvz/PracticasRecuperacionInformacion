81459,317,32,131000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Which means someone lost it. You'll have to put up flyers and see if anyone claims it.
81461,317,34,137000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, this is why people don't tell you things."
81463,317,36,144000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Well, we put up a flyer."
81464,317,37,147000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Let's see someone claim that money now.
81465,317,38,151000,Otto Mann,Springfield Street,"Hey, what does that flyer say?"
81466,317,39,152000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Street,What if it's for guitar lessons? We must know!

81477,317,50,184000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, it doesn't."
81478,317,51,185000,Snake Jailbird,Simpson Home,I'm sorry I wasted your time.
81479,317,52,188000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's the last of them. You did the right thing, Bart, and now you can keep the money."
81480,317,53,193000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Sweet! What am I gonna do with a thousand dollars?
81481,317,54,201000,Alien Rock Band,Simpson Home,IT'S BART'S MOON PARTY FROM OUTER SPACE / WITH R2-D2 PLAYING THE BASS...
81482,317,55,210000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No one's touching the hors d'oeuvres.
81483,317,56,212000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,IT'S BART'S MOON PARTY FROM OUTER SPACE...
81484,317,57,215000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What?
81485,317,58,217000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, why don't you spend the money on something for Mom? She does so much for us."
81486,317,59,222000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... someday I'd like to go on a nice vacation.
81487,317,60,226000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We've gone on plenty of great vacations.
81488,317,61,228000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but you always wind up kidnapped, or on a chain gang... and I don't even want to get into what happened on our honeymoon."
81489,317,62,235000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I still don't know why you had that photo enlarged.
81490,317,63,238000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, forget it. Bart, don't waste your money on me."
81491,317,64,242000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Great lady.
81492,317,65,244000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Look at the cross-hatching on Grover Cleveland's tie...
81494,317,67,248000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Yard,...I completely buy the illusion of shadow!
81495,317,68,251000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School Yard,This must be worth like a million dollars.
81496,317,69,255000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"Time's up. Beat it, doo-rags."
81497,317,70,257000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"Aww, I wanna see it some more!"
81498,317,71,259000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Yard,If you let me keep looking at it I'll give you a quarter.

81501,317,74,272000,Otto Mann,Bart's Treehouse,What's all this other stuff?
81502,317,75,275000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Hey, I'm charging five bucks to get in. They deserve to see the boy behind the bill."
81503,317,76,279000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Bart, that exhibit over there is biased, insensitive and anti-feminist."
81505,317,77,286000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"You can't whitewash history, Lis."
81506,317,78,289000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Bart's Treehouse,"What do I get if I join the museum as a ""friend of Bart""?"
81507,317,79,293000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"A subscription to ""BartForum"" magazine, , and Bart will say ""eat my shorts"" on your home answering machine."
81508,317,80,301000,Moe Szyslak,Bart's Treehouse,"How much to have Bart crank-call me? That would be hilarious. Eh, that's just me, though. You know, I love to laugh."
81509,317,81,307000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bart's Treehouse,"Young man, I believe you have something that belongs to me."
81510,317,82,311000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Prove it, Bony Curtis."
81511,317,83,314000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bart's Treehouse,"When the errant bill struck my chest, it left a distinctive bruise. Had my heart been inside at the time, it could have been fatal."
81512,317,84,323000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,It's a perfect match!
81514,317,86,325000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bart's Treehouse,Yoink!
81515,317,87,328000,Krusty the Clown,Bart's Treehouse,"Without that bill, this ain't a museum. The Hard Rock Caf√© in Phoenix has better crap."
81516,317,88,333000,Sideshow Mel,Bart's Treehouse,I'm recycling this pin in disgust.
81518,317,90,343000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, your museum took in over three thousand dollars!"

81532,317,106,411000,Lisa Simpson,DECK OF TROOP TRANSPORT SHIP,"Grampa, that's so romantic! We gotta go to England!"
81533,317,107,415000,Marge Simpson,DECK OF TROOP TRANSPORT SHIP,That sounds great -- But only if your father promises to behave.
81534,317,108,420000,Homer Simpson,DECK OF TROOP TRANSPORT SHIP,"Marge, I'll be on my best behavior -- you have my word as a gentleman and a lady. Now let's see, which rifle should I bring?"
