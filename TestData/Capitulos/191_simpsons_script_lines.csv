43793,191,39,169000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I've never heard of these Movementarians. Are they some kind of church?
43795,191,40,174000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Who cares what it is? The point is these are some decent, generous people that I can take advantage of."
43796,191,41,179000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But what if they try to talk us into something?
43797,191,42,181000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, Marge, Marge. Remember when those smooth-talking guys tried to sell me a time-share vacation condo?"
43798,191,43,189000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You bought four of them. Thank God the check bounced.
43799,191,44,191000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, I beat the system."
43800,191,45,192000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Watch yourself, Dad. You're the highly suggestible type."
43801,191,46,196000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes. I am the highly suggestible type.
43803,191,48,199000,Movementarians,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Welcome, brother!"
43804,191,49,204000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Outta my way, jerk ass!"
43805,191,50,206000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA FISH-ING / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA FISH-ING / FISH-ING, FISH-ING--"
43806,191,51,216000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Hi, how are y--"
43807,191,52,217000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Fish-ing.
43808,191,53,219000,Jane,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,It certainly is a beautiful day. We should thank the Leader.
43809,191,54,222000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Who the hell is that? Some kind of leader?
43810,191,55,224000,Jane,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Yes. He's the head of our perfect family. And when our galactic vehicle is complete, he will take us to our new home, Blisstonia."
43811,191,56,231000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Why don't you come chat with us about the Leader at the Welcome Center.
43812,191,57,235000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Will there be beer?
43813,191,58,236000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Beer is not allowed.
43814,191,59,237000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Homer no function beer well without.
43815,191,60,239000,Jane,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Would you rather have beer or complete and utter contentment?
43816,191,61,242000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,What kind of beer?
43817,191,62,244000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"The Leader knows how miserable you, Marge, Lisa, Bart and Maggie are."
43818,191,63,248000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Really? I'm surprised about Maggie.
43819,191,64,251000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Just come up and watch our orientation film. You're free to leave at anytime.
43820,191,65,254000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Wow, a free movie. Thanks! Outta my way, jerk ass."
43824,191,66,260000,Announcer,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Once we collect enough money for fuel, our Leader will throw open the doors of The Forbidden Barn, where we will all board our inter-galactic vehicle -- rows 1 through 30 first. Upon our arrival, we will begin our new perfect lives on Blisstonia, well known for its high levels of bliss."
43825,191,67,278000,Carl Carlson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Hey, I don't know about you, but uh, they're not exactly winning me over with these lousy production values here. I'm gonna slip out."
43826,191,68,285000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Uh, you're free to leave whenever you want. But uh -- would mind telling us why?"
43827,191,69,289000,Carl Carlson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Oh, I just didn't...Uh, I didn't think...Um, oh, it's - it's pretty good."
43828,191,70,295000,Otto Mann,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Man, this whole place puffs on the wacky tabacky. I'm outta here."
43830,191,72,299000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Going somewhere? Though you're free to do so.
43831,191,73,302000,Otto Mann,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Uh no, just rearranging my underwear. Ah, there it is."
43832,191,74,314000,Announcer,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"When you surrender yourself to the Movementarians, you are guaranteed a perfect life of serenity, love and loving serenity. Not a guarantee."
43833,191,75,323000,Moe Szyslak,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Loving serenity. It's about damn time.
43834,191,76,326000,Otto Mann,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,I love the Leader!
43835,191,77,328000,Carl Carlson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,The Leader is perfect!
43836,191,78,329000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Wait - I'm confused about the movie. So the cops knew that internal affairs was setting them up?
43837,191,79,335000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,What are you talking about? There's nothing like that in there.
43838,191,80,339000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Well, you see, when I get bored, I make up my own movie. I have a very short attention span."
43839,191,81,343000,Jane,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,But our point is very simple. You see when --
43840,191,82,345000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Ooh, look a bird."
43841,191,83,349000,Jane,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"The ""Circle of Judgment"" never fails to destroy their self esteem. Then he'll be ours to mold."
43842,191,84,355000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Let the judgment begin! I'll get the ball rolling. You're a fat idiot!
43843,191,85,360000,Movementarians,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Yeah, lose some weight! / Amen you're fat / moron-type"
43844,191,86,366000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Uh yeah, I guess I could lose a few pounds. And I can be kind of thick sometimes."
43845,191,87,373000,Seymour Skinner,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,You've failed at everything you've ever tried.
43821,191,88,376000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Whoa, you've got my number on that one, buddy! This is a smart group."
43822,191,89,380000,Moe Szyslak,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,And your stink brings tears to my eyes!
43823,191,90,383000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Now wait a minute, Moe --"
43846,191,91,386000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Oh, my mistake."
43847,191,92,390000,Jane,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Why isn't our low protein gruel wearing down his resistance like all the others?
43848,191,93,394000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,It doesn't wear down your resistance if you eat a whole month's supply.
43849,191,94,397000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,He even ate mine!
43850,191,95,402000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"You gonna finish that, bony?"
43852,191,97,405000,Jane,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Let's try the chant. Everyone loves a droning, repetitive chant."
43853,191,98,409000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Attention, everyone! Let's all give thanks to the Leader for this glorious day!"
43854,191,99,413000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,The Leader is good. / The Leader is great. / We surrender our will. / As of this date.
43855,191,100,417000,Movementarians,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,The Leader is good. / The Leader is great. / We surrender our will. / As of this date.
43856,191,101,423000,Jane,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,It's no use. He's obviously the most powerful mind we've ever dealt with.
43857,191,102,428000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Or... NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER....
43858,191,103,434000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / LEA-DER, LEA-DER, LEA-DER!"
43859,191,104,443000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"BATMAN! / I MEAN, LEADER! I LOVE THE LEADER!"
43860,191,105,453000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,ACT II
43862,191,107,453000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You what?!
43863,191,108,454000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come again, Marge?"
43864,191,109,455000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You what?!
43865,191,110,455000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've joined the Movementarians! And so have all of you!
43866,191,111,458000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We what?
43867,191,112,459000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All I had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house, and a commitment of ten trillion years of labor."
43868,191,113,465000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I can't go along with this, Homer."
43869,191,114,467000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, when I join an underground cult, I expect a little support from my family."
43870,191,115,470000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?"
43871,191,116,473000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I have not been brainwashed. Kill the girl. Kill the girl.
43872,191,117,477000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer!
43873,191,118,478000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What? What did I say?
43874,191,119,480000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Church, cult. Cult, church. So we get bored someplace else every Sunday. Does this really change our day-to-day lives?"
43877,191,120,485000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Of course not! Except that we're all moving to the Movementarian Agricultural Compound to be near the Leader and serve him.
43878,191,121,491000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm not leaving my home!
43879,191,122,493000,Don,Simpson Home,"Oh, yes you are. I'm afraid it's our home now. This house will become the new local Welcome Center for this district."
43880,191,123,499000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And it didn't cost us a dime.
43881,191,124,502000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,Springfield has been overrun by a strange and almost certainly evil sect calling themselves the Movementarians.
43882,191,125,502000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"In exchange for your home and all your money, the Leader of this ""way-out"" and wrong religion, claims he'll take believers away on his spaceship to the planet Blisstonia. Excuse my editorial laugh. But..."
43883,191,126,520000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Ladies and gentlemen, I've just learned of a change in this station's management. Welcome, Movementarians! Continue to improve our lives! I love you, Perfect Leader. And new C.E.O. of K-B-B-O broadcasting!"
43885,191,128,535000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Homer Simpson, your family will be housed here for the first 100,000 years. Then something might open up in a double."
43886,191,129,542000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Hah, why even unpack?"
43888,191,131,545000,Lisa Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Dad and all these other people are obviously the products of mental conditioning.
43889,191,132,549000,Bart Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Yeah, maybe it'll wear off. Like his interest in C.B. radio."
43890,191,133,552000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"That's a negatory, good buddy!"
43891,191,134,553000,Bart Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"I kinda think it's cool. Just pretend you're in a zombie movie. Besides, this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc."
43892,191,135,561000,Bart Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,These rubes in robes haven't met the likes of Bart Simpson before.
43893,191,136,572000,Bart Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,I love the Leader.
43894,191,137,575000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Of course you do.
43896,191,139,578000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"This so-called ""new religion"" is nothing but a pack of weird rituals and chants designed to take away the money of fools... Let us say the Lord's Prayer forty times. But first, let's pass the collection plate."
43897,191,140,592000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Looks like slim pickin's today, Reverend."
43898,191,141,596000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, Lord. Uh, try the emergency plate, Ned."
43875,191,142,600000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,I don't think that's gonna do it.
43899,191,145,604000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"See, Marge? Our lives are so much better now!"
43900,191,146,607000,Glen,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,You two! Stop talking and resume the lima bean harvest!
43901,191,147,611000,Marge Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"When we got married, you promised me my harvesting days were over."
43902,191,148,618000,Moe Szyslak,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Look! The Forbidden Barn opens!
43903,191,149,623000,Movementarians,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,The Leader! / He's coming! / The Leader is coming! / The Leader! / etc.
43904,191,150,629000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Oh boy! We get to see the Leader pass by.
43905,191,151,631000,Lisa Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,We toil in the fields and he rides around in a Rolls Royce?
43906,191,152,634000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Yes, it would be nice if he'd buy American, but what are ya gonna do?"
43907,191,153,640000,Moe Szyslak,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,I'm covered in the dust of the Leader! He favors me!
43908,191,154,644000,Sideshow Mel,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,I am even dustier! Dustier than thou!
43909,191,155,650000,Moe Szyslak,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Oh, look who the new pet is!"
43910,191,156,653000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,I've never been so happy.
43912,191,158,656000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Smithers, why haven't I heard of this ""The Leader?"" He's as rich and wicked as I, but he seems to enjoy tax exempt status."
43913,191,159,664000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Actually sir, with our creative bookkeeping and corporate loopholes, we only pay three dollars a year."
43914,191,160,669000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You're right. We're getting screwed! There must be something I can do about this. Wait! Yes! I think I know just the thing!
43916,191,162,686000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Uh, sir, you have to tell me what your plan is, or nothing will happen."
43917,191,163,691000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Oh, yes, of course, the plan! You see me as a God, right Smithers?"
43918,191,164,695000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Absolutely, sir."
43919,191,165,696000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,You'd kneel before me.
43920,191,166,697000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Boy, would I."
43921,191,167,699000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Yes -- Uh, then I'll form my own religion!"
43922,191,168,699000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"With its own symbol. We'll use this ""Special K!"""
43923,191,169,703000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"I believe that's already a breakfast cereal, sir."
43924,191,170,708000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,And people worship it?
43925,191,171,710000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,In a way.
43926,191,172,711000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"All right, then. Uh, how about this?"
43927,191,173,713000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Uh, why don't you leave the symbol to me, sir."
43928,191,175,731000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ladies and gentlemen, behold your new God...Mr. Burns!"
43929,191,176,740000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ahoy hoy, lowly mortals! In addition to working for me, you may now praise me as your Almighty!"
43930,191,177,747000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Amen, sir."
43931,191,178,759000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ahh, we'll try this again tomorrow."
43932,191,179,762000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ah, he's all right, but he's no bowl of Special K."
43934,191,181,767000,Marge Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"This is ridiculous, we're already married!"
43935,191,182,769000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"But Marge, we're not mass married."
43936,191,183,774000,Barney Gumble,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,At least you got to choose your mate. We got matched up on the print-out.
43937,191,184,779000,Otto Mann,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Hey, remember our agreement. I'm the man."
43938,191,185,782000,Barney Gumble,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,You're the man!
43939,191,186,783000,Seymour Skinner,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"I could've done a lot worse, Mother."
43940,191,187,785000,Agnes Skinner,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Speak for yourself.
43941,191,188,787000,Comic Book Guy,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"So, do you enjoy comic books?"
43943,191,190,791000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,MOVEMENTARIAN SCHOOL,"And who can tell me where thunder and lightning come from? Yes, Bart?"
43944,191,191,796000,Bart Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN SCHOOL,"The Leader, Ma'am."
43945,191,192,798000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,MOVEMENTARIAN SCHOOL,"Very good, Bart. And who invented Morse code?"
43946,191,193,801000,Bart Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN SCHOOL,"Oh, I should know this one. Th--The Leader?"
43947,191,194,806000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,MOVEMENTARIAN SCHOOL,"Ah, correct again."

43963,191,210,910000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, I never thought I'd have to do this again."
43964,191,211,915000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Reverend Lovejoy! You've got to help me! My entire family has been taken in by the evil Movementarians.

43992,191,238,1020000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Fire Department,"Attention all citizens! Even though the Leader himself is completely non-violent, he urges you to be as violent as you like in capturing the Simpsons."
43993,191,239,1033000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Fire Department,"What are you doing? They're not here, you idiots!"
43994,191,240,1036000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Springfield Fire Department,"Idiots? That's slander, sir. And we have it on tape."

44000,191,247,1051000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"All right, already! But do you love the Leader more than having your very own, brand new -- Hoverbikes?"
44001,191,248,1062000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,What do you have to say about the Leader now? Hunh? Hunh?
44002,191,249,1065000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,The hell with him! / What Leader? / He can take a flying leap as far as I'm concerned! / Lea-who?

44007,191,254,1077000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Sorry kids, there's no such thing as Hoverbikes. They're just a couple of Huffys on a fishing line!"
44008,191,255,1084000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,But we heard them hovering!
44009,191,256,1086000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh ho, I'm afraid I played a dirty part in this little charade."
44010,191,257,1090000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,"Well, can we at least keep the bikes?"
44011,191,258,1091000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Oh no, no, no, no, no, no! They're due back at the store by six. Get off 'em! Get off, off! Get off!"
44012,191,259,1096000,Groundskeeper Willie,Flanders Home,"All right, Now, what's so all-fired great about your fancy-pants Leader?"

44017,191,263,1112000,Groundskeeper Willie,Flanders Home,"Oh! This Leader, he sounds like a grand fella."
44018,191,264,1116000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Willie, I'm not sure we're making any headway here."
44019,191,265,1118000,Groundskeeper Willie,Flanders Home,"Would you shut up, woman! He's talkin' about my Leader!"
44020,191,266,1122000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? Anyone like a draft beer?"
44021,191,267,1126000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,Beer?
44022,191,268,1127000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Hmm... Would you like a tall frosty one, Homer?"

44024,191,271,1146000,Homer's Feet,Flanders Home,"Ooh, these cotton-poly blends are sooo comfortable!"
44025,191,272,1150000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Flanders Home,"Go on, Homer. Our commandments clearly state that beer is all right. Try some."
44026,191,273,1163000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Flanders Home,This man is coming with us!
44027,191,274,1164000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"Homer, you don't have to go with them!"
44028,191,275,1166000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,But I want to go.
44029,191,276,1168000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Flanders Home,"Well, I would say the matter is settled."
44030,191,277,1170000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"You know, I pride myself on being a good host, so I'm obliged to offer you a beer. But I'm so darn mad it's gonna be mostly head."
44032,191,279,1183000,Marge Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Homer, come back!"
44033,191,280,1185000,Marge Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,That's my husband!

44035,191,282,1190000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"I'm glad I'm back! Because the moment that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue, I was born again!"
44036,191,283,1199000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Hallelujah!
44037,191,284,1200000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Now I can show all of you what I've come to realize. The reason we're not allowed in the Forbidden Barn is because there is no inter-galactic spaceship! He's taken our money just so he can...build one hell of a spaceship!
44038,191,285,1219000,Leader,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Homer Simpson! Because of your lack of faith, you've ruined mankind's chance for salvation!"
44039,191,286,1225000,Homer Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Whoops.
44040,191,287,1226000,Moe Szyslak,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Nice going there, Homer."
44041,191,288,1227000,Marge Simpson,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Omigosh! Maybe he was telling the truth about everything.

44046,191,293,1263000,Leader,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Uh, do you happen to need a messiah?"
44047,191,294,1266000,Cletus Spuckler,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"No, but I'll take them sacks of money from ya."
44048,191,295,1271000,THE LEADER,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,I should have stayed with the Promise Keepers.
44049,191,296,1274000,Moe Szyslak,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Dammit, it fell apart like everything else I've ever believed in. Oh, I guess it's back to good old fashioned voodoo."

44051,191,298,1285000,Moe Szyslak,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,Come with me.

44054,191,301,1294000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,MOVEMENTARIAN COMPOUND,"Come back to papa, baby."
44056,191,303,1297000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,To think I turned to a cult for mindless happiness when I had beer all along.
44058,191,305,1303000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And you Marge, the bringer of beer!"
44059,191,306,1307000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's wonderful to think for ourselves again.
44060,191,307,1310000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You said it, sister."
