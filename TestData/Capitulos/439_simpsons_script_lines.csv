113854,439,21,105000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That's an awfully crowded classroom.
113855,439,22,113000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Three... two... one... Okay children, I've just been granted tenure, so I'm gonna sit back and let Ralph teach for a while."

113865,439,33,154000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,...And because of cutbacks they were combining math with P.E. They were playing dodge book!
113866,439,34,159000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look at this: Springfield Elementary's rating is so low, it's more than two standard deviations below the norm."

113875,439,43,206000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, that's brilliant! We could go to a school where special doesn't always mean bad! And where the teachers don't have to moonlight as telemarketers."
113877,439,45,214000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Teachers' Lounge,"As you know, the music of Air Supply is timeless. And now their fifty biggest hits are on four CDs..."

113888,439,56,261000,Homer Simpson,Waverly Hills Apartments,Four walls? I was thinking more of something in a two or three.
113891,439,59,270000,Cookie Kwan,Small Apartment,"No windows, no parking, and a man died here."

113905,439,74,332000,City Clerk,Waverly Hills City Hall,It's just a formality to make sure you actually live here. Some people use the address just so their kids can go to our schools.
113906,439,75,338000,Homer Simpson,Waverly Hills City Hall,Ha! I can see them now with their bald heads and their blue-haired wives. How I despise them.

113919,439,87,381000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Waverly Hills Apt. Bldg.,You just have to stay there until that psychopathic school inspector makes a surprise visit. You can come home when the heat's off.
113920,439,88,389000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Waverly Hills Apt. Bldg.,The heat is off. The hissing from the radiator is a snake.
113921,439,89,393000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Waverly Hills Apt. Bldg.,Please just stay there till Bart graduates high school.

113967,439,135,561000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"But I always get A's. At my old school, I got so many A's, the teachers didn't even check my work."
113968,439,136,568000,Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,Maybe that's why you got so many A's.
148722,439,137,569000,Lisa's Thoughts,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh my God, you've been challenged! Well Lisa, let's see how you respond."

113991,439,159,664000,Girl In Riding Boots,Waverly Hills Elementary School,I heard he burned down his old school!
113992,439,160,665000,Boy,Waverly Hills Elementary School,I heard he killed a groundskeeper!
113993,439,161,667000,British Groundskeeper,Waverly Hills Elementary School,Oh my! That's a bit rough.

114001,439,169,695000,Caitlin,Waverly Hills Elementary School,She didn't even know who Alaska Nebraska was.
114004,439,170,697000,Bart Simpson,Waverly Hills Elementary School,Duh. She said that because she respects Alaska's privacy. Just as I have no doubt you guys will respect Lisa's privacy.
114007,439,173,714000,Technician,PHONE COMPANY CONTROL ROOM,"We're approaching bandwidth overload, Sir. It's gossip at Waverly Elementary."

114016,439,182,731000,Bart Simpson,Waverly Hills Elementary School,My plan was to lie. Lie like hell. And that's what I did.
114017,439,183,735000,Chief Wiggum,Waverly Hills Elementary School,"Well, well. Seems like someone forgot about a previous engagement at the bowling alley from two to four-thirty."
114018,439,184,780000,Chief Wiggum,Waverly Hills Elementary School,Get him. And string him up.
114019,439,185,785000,Chief Wiggum,Waverly Hills Elementary School,"You have the right to be delighted. If you do not have a gift, one will be provided for you."

114045,439,213,875000,Geoff,Homer's Apartment,What in God's name was I thinking?!
114048,439,216,879000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Maybe you could come over again. I'll cook you my special microwave burritos. I stop the oven when the middle is still a little bit frozen.
114049,439,217,888000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Apartment,"You know what a girl likes, mister. So, can I see you again?"
114050,439,218,893000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,"How 'bout you, me and my wife have a two-way?"
114052,439,220,899000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Hi.
114053,439,221,902000,Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, I re-graded your paper from the other day, and you got an A."
114054,439,222,906000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Really?
114055,439,223,906000,Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,"My kid's a huge Alaska Nebraska fan. If she could somehow get an autographed photo or t-shirt, that would be ""A-plus"" in my book."
114056,439,224,915000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Did you just wink at me?
114057,439,225,916000,Teacher,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh look, there are pumpkin stickers on the floor. They must've fallen off your homework for next week, which you don't have to hand in."
114058,439,226,926000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I didn't think I'd get a fresh start like this till junior high!
114059,439,227,930000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"L'Ecole, c'est moi!"
114060,439,228,933000,Boy Resembling Ralph,Springfield Elementary School,Oui. C'est toi!
114061,439,229,934000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Even the Ralph of this school speaks French!
114062,439,230,938000,Boy Resembling Ralph,Springfield Elementary School,Au revoir!
114064,439,232,943000,Marge Simpson,TAPAS BAR,I love Tapas! It's like appetizers for a meal that never comes!
114065,439,233,948000,Homer Simpson,TAPAS BAR,Try the Flan De Leche De Cabra...
114066,439,234,951000,Homer Simpson,TAPAS BAR,Be sure to dig around in the gunk.
114067,439,235,956000,Marge Simpson,TAPAS BAR,Homie?
114068,439,236,957000,Marge Simpson,TAPAS BAR,A key to your apartment!
114070,439,237,963000,Marge Simpson,TAPAS BAR,"And I've got a present for you, but you'll have to wait till we're back at the apartment."
114071,439,238,969000,Homer Simpson,TAPAS BAR,Why can't I have it now? You got your present here. Basic fairness dictates... ...oh!
114073,439,240,976000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Caitlin, hi! Do a reading at your bat mitzvah? A sheynam dank!"
114074,439,241,982000,Caitlin,Simpson Home,"Now my bat mitzvah means something! By the way, I was wondering, there's this Alaska Nebraska concert this weekend, and... the tickets are all sold out."
114075,439,242,990000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if it's sold out, even Alaska Nebraska's best friend couldn't do anything about that. Can't build more seats!"
114076,439,243,998000,Caitlin,Simpson Home,Then get us backstage passes.
114078,439,245,1002000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Surprise! I redecorated!
114079,439,246,1006000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Where are my videogames? My X-box?! My Wii?!
114080,439,247,1009000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Apartment,"You don't need a Wii now that I'm here. Because you and me make ""us."""
114081,439,248,1014000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,"You know, you're starting to remind me a lot of my first wife."
114082,439,249,1017000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Apartment,We can talk about that after brunch with my mother.
114085,439,252,1023000,Teenage Stagehand,CONCERT ARENA,"Ms. Nebraska, your purified water and fried chicken skins are here."
114086,439,253,1032000,Alaska Nebraska,CONCERT ARENA,I am so tired of fans in my food.
114087,439,254,1036000,Lisa Simpson,CONCERT ARENA,"Alaska, we've never met, but everyone thinks I'm your best friend."
114088,439,255,1040000,Alaska Nebraska,CONCERT ARENA,"Wait, wait, let me guess. I'm supposed to give all your best friends front row seats and backstage passes."
114089,439,256,1046000,Lisa Simpson,CONCERT ARENA,Could you?
114090,439,257,1047000,Alaska Nebraska,CONCERT ARENA,"First, riddle me this: what's your favorite episode of my show?"
114091,439,258,1051000,Lisa Simpson,CONCERT ARENA,You have a show?
114092,439,259,1054000,Lisa Simpson,CONCERT ARENA,"Look, can you please, please, help a poor little girl who was just trying to fit in? It's what half your songs are about."
114093,439,260,1062000,Alaska Nebraska,CONCERT ARENA,"You know what? I was a little girl who didn't fit in either. So you know what I did? I got a new nose, I got famous, and now I date the starting point guard for the L.A. Clippers. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go meditate and smoke."
114094,439,261,1078000,Alaska Nebraska,CONCERT ARENA,Wait! I want to ask you something.
114069,439,262,1080000,Alaska Nebraska,CONCERT ARENA,Could you tell I lip-synched that whole speech?
114096,439,263,1082000,Alaska Nebraska,CONCERT ARENA,"You know what? I was a little girl who didn't fit in either. So you know what I did? I got a new nose, I..."
114097,439,264,1089000,Lisa Simpson,CONCERT ARENA,That's amazing.
114098,439,265,1090000,Alaska Nebraska,CONCERT ARENA,I know. Security!
114099,439,266,1091000,Lisa Simpson,CONCERT ARENA,"You know, I think those shirts should say ""insecurity."""
114100,439,267,1094000,Lisa Simpson,CONCERT ARENA,"Because if you feel you have to put what you are on your shirt, then I feel sorry for you. Do you feel sorry for me? Guess not."
114102,439,269,1106000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Where have you been? We have mirrors to hang!
114103,439,270,1109000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,I went to a movie.
114104,439,271,1110000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Without me? How'd you get there?
114105,439,272,1112000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,I drove.
114106,439,273,1112000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Without me?
114107,439,274,1115000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Sometimes I think this fifty square foot apartment isn't big enough for the both of us!
114108,439,275,1118000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Fine! You can have your key back!
114109,439,276,1121000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Apartment,"I got it halfway-- Oh, it went back."
114110,439,277,1129000,City Inspector,Homer's Apartment,City inspector.
114111,439,278,1132000,City Inspector,Homer's Apartment,I'm here to verify that this is the residence of Bart and Lisa Simpson.
114112,439,279,1152000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Hurry! Get out the kids' stuff!
114113,439,280,1152000,City Inspector,Homer's Apartment,"Hello, friendos."
114115,439,282,1158000,Katelyn,CONCERT ARENA,Here comes Lisa with our backstage passes!
114117,439,284,1162000,Lisa Simpson,CONCERT ARENA,"People, I'm not who you think I am. I'm just a transfer student who wanted to make some friends. Yes, I lied to you, but you only liked me because of a lie. So if you think about it--"
114118,439,285,1172000,Katelyn,CONCERT ARENA,Get the liar!
114120,439,287,1183000,Kate Lynn,Rodeo Drive-type Street,Those are last year's shoes! Kill her!
114121,439,288,1186000,CAITLYN,Rodeo Drive-type Street,"Also, it's Lisa!"
114122,439,289,1187000,Katelyn,Rodeo Drive-type Street,Kill her twice!
114124,439,291,1191000,City Inspector,Homer's Apartment,"""Go Dog Go"" with pages missing... Lego spaceship poorly assembled... Clearly, this is the home of elementary school children. Too bad. I was looking forward to killing you and making it look like a suicide."
114125,439,292,1205000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,"Thank you, Friendo."
114126,439,293,1207000,City Inspector,Homer's Apartment,I am not your friendo.
114127,439,294,1208000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,"But, I thought... you said..."
114128,439,295,1211000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Mom! Dad! I have to leave Waverly Hills and never come back!
114129,439,296,1216000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Apartment,"I've gotta get back, too! I just remembered I was playing hide and seek with Milhouse."
114131,439,298,1220000,Milhouse Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,Three weeks! This has gotta be some kind of record!
114133,439,300,1223000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,I can't leave my bachelor pad! My bros'll miss me!
114134,439,301,1226000,Geoff,Homer's Apartment,No we won't!
114135,439,302,1228000,Donald,Homer's Apartment,Your comments when we watch movies aren't funny.
114136,439,303,1230000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Why do you watch comedies if you don't want to hear more jokes?
114137,439,304,1233000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Apartment,"Please, I just want to go back to a place where I'm ostracized for being me, not for who I pretend to be."
114138,439,305,1240000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,"What do you think, Marge? Maybe we've outgrown our first apartment."
114139,439,306,1244000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Yeah. A house in the suburbs does sound pretty nice right now.
114140,439,307,1248000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Apartment,"Although, I am gonna miss our little love nest."
114143,439,310,1260000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Tree House,Get a room!
114144,439,311,1261000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Tree House,"C'mon, boy! Be cool!"
114145,439,312,1261000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Tree House,But...
114146,439,313,1264000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Tree House,Be cool or you're grounded!
