100526,387,136,672000,Gil Gunderson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah. That desert air's gonna give the ol' one-two to my bronchitis! Oh boy.

100626,387,238,1141000,Gil Gunderson,JACKPOT REALTY BUILDING,"People, remember, you're selling dreams! When a family owns a home, it means they own a piece of America."
100627,387,239,1146000,Gil Gunderson,JACKPOT REALTY BUILDING,"And what matters most isn't the commission you make, it's the smiles on their faces when they know they own that land free and clear."

100631,387,243,1163000,Gil Gunderson,JACKPOT REALTY BUILDING,"Marge Simpson? What are you doing here? Lookin' for a home on a quiet cul-de-sac, where your neighbor could be Tanya Tucker?"
100632,387,244,1171000,Marge Simpson,JACKPOT REALTY BUILDING,"Listen, Bub. I have something to say to you, and it can't wait."
100634,387,245,1175000,Gil Gunderson,JACKPOT REALTY BUILDING,"Oh well, it looks like we got a Back-out Betty on our hands. But watch Ol' Gil take her from furious to curious."
100635,387,246,1182000,Gil Gunderson,JACKPOT REALTY BUILDING,"Now ma'am. You say you can't wait, and you're right. With interest rates climbing and choice properties in the Kingsbridge School District drying up..."
