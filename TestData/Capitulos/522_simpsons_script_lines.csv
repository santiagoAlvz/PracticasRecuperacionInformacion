135632,522,65,244000,Marge Simpson,STORAGE LOCKER COMPLEX,I think your dad might be gay.
135633,522,66,247000,Homer Simpson,STORAGE LOCKER COMPLEX,That's insane! My dad was married to a woman... who left him... because he ignored her needs for decades. My gay dad is gay for gays.

135642,522,75,307000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,You sure you're not just doing all this because it's cool to be accepting of a gay family member?
135643,522,76,312000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh honey, that's just silly! This'll show Helen Lovejoy, always bragging about her He-She cousin!"
135644,522,77,320000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Abe... we found your storage locker.

135656,522,89,354000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Your father wasted his whole life being married to your mother and having you. We've got to find him a boyfriend before it's too late!
135657,522,90,361000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you put a personal ad on the internet? That's how young people date these days.
135658,522,91,366000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's weird that you don't consider yourself a young person.
135659,522,92,369000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I know. It's weird to me too.
135660,522,93,371000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Help me out of the closet! Wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidly-encroaching death.
135661,522,94,373000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No fatties!

135673,522,105,417000,Grampa Simpson,Park,So move on! You're blocking the ducks!
135674,522,106,419000,Marge Simpson,Park,"Don't you want to be happy, Abe? Admit who you are, a wonderful gay man!"
135675,522,107,426000,Grampa Simpson,Park,What?! I don't ride side-saddle! I'm straight as a submarine!
135676,522,108,431000,Homer Simpson,Park,Then how do you explain this?

135696,522,128,481000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Those things?
135698,522,130,483000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,It was the heyday of pro wrestling. You could make good money if you were the manly mixture of strong and fat we called beefy.
135699,522,131,491000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"Good guys were called ""baby faces""...and bad guys were called ""heels."""

135671,522,138,526000,Bart Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"Grampa, you were the original bad boy!"
135706,522,139,530000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"Yeah, I was boastful before all your football show-boaters, rap music-ers, and TV beach Italians. But there was a downside to being hated... being hated."
135709,522,142,552000,Grampa Simpson,Storage Facility,I just couldn't take it.
135710,522,143,560000,Grampa Simpson,Storage Facility,Being despised was no way to live.

135772,522,204,856000,Lisa Simpson,OLD-TIME WRESTLING PAVILION,Do not. That's ridiculous-- It's just-- It's that-- He's-- He's a rebel and only I can change him!
135774,522,206,883000,Marge Simpson,OLD-TIME WRESTLING PAVILION,It's so sad that Grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his God-given wrestling skills. What kind of person revels in disapproval?!
135775,522,207,891000,Bart Simpson,OLD-TIME WRESTLING PAVILION,"What kind of person, indeed?"
135777,522,209,899000,Milhouse Van Houten,Little League Field,It's the prettiest boy in Springfield... Bart Simpson!
135779,522,211,909000,Bart Simpson,Little League Field,You are the luckiest people in the world! You get to look at me!
135781,522,213,917000,Kirk Van Houten,Little League Field,"Hey Simpson, tell your kid to quit showboating!"
135782,522,214,925000,Sideshow Mel,Little League Field,I've never seen anyone so full of self-regard! And I've worked with Bob Balaban!
135785,522,217,938000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Your behavior at that game was unacceptable! You're lucky they gave you your participant trophy.
135786,522,218,944000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I got one for just watching the game.
135787,522,219,949000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen, getting people riled up is what heels do!"
135788,522,220,951000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Heel? Oh no, tell me you are not trying to be like Grampa!"
135790,522,221,955000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well sure I am. I always thought Grampa was lame, but he's really awesome!"
135791,522,222,960000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Your grandfather is super lame! I mean, if he wasn't a terrible father, what's my excuse for this?"
135792,522,223,970000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know your Grampa seems exciting now... But all that preening and cheating, those turnbuckle antics are not gonna make him happy."
135796,522,227,982000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Burnsy, I can't remember the last time I was so happy."
135797,522,228,987000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You grandson-ruining fiend! Look what your ""number one fan"" did at show and tell!"
135798,522,229,994000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Who would film such a thing?
135799,522,230,999000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It's found footage!
135800,522,231,1001000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,So what! We could use another winner in this family.
135801,522,232,1004000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,How are you a winner? You're cheating in a fake sport!
135802,522,233,1007000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Fake? Ridiculous! If professional wrestling were fake... that would make every fan in the history of the sport a complete and utter moron.
135803,522,234,1017000,C.H.U.M.,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Mercy!
135804,522,235,1018000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You know, I've always had a keen eye for tiny talent."
135805,522,236,1021000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Perhaps you and the lad could ""tag team"" up..."
135806,522,237,1024000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Wrestle with Bart? He ain't beefy, but he is infuriating and you can't teach infuriating. Monty, you're a genius!"
135807,522,238,1032000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Bart cannot be an old-time wrestler! As your inattentive son, and your incompetent employee, I forbid it!"
135809,522,240,1040000,Homer Simpson,OLD-TIME WRESTLING PAVILION,Why does everything I forbid always happen?
135812,522,243,1052000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLERS' DRESSING ROOM,"So, Beautiful, you got your moves memorized?"
135813,522,244,1054000,Bart Simpson,WRESTLERS' DRESSING ROOM,"You know it, Glamorous. Eye gouge, ear bite, folding chair, hair pull, face-fart, flying face-fart, and then I start fighting dirty."
135814,522,245,1063000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLERS' DRESSING ROOM,They're gonna hate you so much.
135815,522,246,1066000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLERS' DRESSING ROOM,"Oh, I get it. You're here to tell the kid he can't wrestle with his Grampa."
135816,522,247,1073000,Marge Simpson,WRESTLERS' DRESSING ROOM,"I don't care if Bart is a wrestler, a busboy, or even a stoplight squeegee man... as long as he's a nice person."
135817,522,248,1083000,Marge Simpson,WRESTLERS' DRESSING ROOM,"But if he gets too much attention for acting bad, he might turn bad on the inside..."
135818,522,249,1089000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLERS' DRESSING ROOM,"Eh, that's women-talk. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to comb out my curls."
135819,522,250,1095000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLERS' DRESSING ROOM,"One, two, three..."
135821,522,252,1101000,Nerdy Fat Kid,WRESTLING ARENA,"Beautiful Bart, can I have your autograph?"
135822,522,253,1104000,Bart Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"Sure, here you go."
135824,522,255,1110000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"Hey Bart, leave some of that bad attitude for the ring."
135825,522,256,1114000,Bart Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,The world is my ring now.
135826,522,257,1121000,C. Montgomery Burns,WRESTLING ARENA,"In this corner, for truth and justice -- Captain Flag and Half-Mast."
135827,522,258,1128000,C. Montgomery Burns,WRESTLING ARENA,"Now entering the ring, the first family of foul play: Glamorous Godfrey and Beautiful Bart!"
135828,522,259,1137000,Bart Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,You all stink!
135830,522,261,1144000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,Glamorous Godfrey is dead.
135832,522,263,1151000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"I am ""Honest Abe!"""
135834,522,265,1157000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"And this is ""Laddie Liberty."""
135835,522,266,1161000,Bart Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,What are you doing?
135836,522,267,1162000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,I ain't a heel no more -- I'm a good guy... and you're a baby-face.
135837,522,268,1166000,Bart Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"But, but, what about the cheating?"
135838,522,269,1167000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,No more cheating.
135839,522,270,1169000,Bart Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,And the preening?
135840,522,271,1170000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,No more preening.
135841,522,272,1171000,Bart Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,But I'm so pretty.
135842,522,273,1172000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,That's for others to say now.
135843,522,274,1174000,C. Montgomery Burns,WRESTLING ARENA,"What are you doing, Godfrey! You're a villain, not some bullet-brained rail-splitter. Without someone to hate, there's no excitement, no thrill!"
135844,522,275,1182000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,I don't care! My grandson's soul is at stake!
135845,522,276,1185000,C. Montgomery Burns,WRESTLING ARENA,How dare you! I wrote a song for you! When am I ever going to use that again? Curse you and this morbidly obese little half-wit.
135846,522,277,1194000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"So they only want to see a good guy fight a bad guy, eh?"
135848,522,278,1205000,Homer Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"He's taking on Mean Man Monty! Go get him, Honest Abe!"
135849,522,279,1208000,Carl Carlson,WRESTLING ARENA,This is why we go to everything in this town -- it always pays off!
135850,522,280,1215000,Bart Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"Honest Abe, can I pin him?"
135851,522,281,1217000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"You know it, Laddie Liberty!"
135852,522,282,1227000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,Damndest boos I ever heard.
135853,522,283,1230000,Bart Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"They're cheering, Grampa."
135854,522,284,1232000,Grampa Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,This is what I've been missing my whole life.
135855,522,285,1237000,Marge Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,"Oh, that was so sweet."
135856,522,286,1241000,Homer Simpson,WRESTLING ARENA,I wish Grampa was my dad.
