78891,308,12,63000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The box says it's the perfect way to spend a day. And why would a box lie to a person?
78892,308,13,76000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The first step is the funnest -- turning all the pieces face up.
78893,308,14,80000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Go crazy, dorks. I got better things to do."
78894,308,15,83000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Hey Bart, I fixed my rock tumbler. What do you say we turn this baby loose on some feldspar?"

78928,308,49,208000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"He's right, Dad. We're missing that singer's head!"
78930,308,51,212000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,This awful. It's like listening to Schubert's unfinished symphony!
78931,308,52,217000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Or when I messed up taping ""City Slickers 2"" and cut off the end. Was Curly's gold just a legend?"
78932,308,53,222000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Or like when... I got nothin'. Uh, let's just find that piece."
78933,308,54,230000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Hey, remember that pet gerbil we used to have? He didn't run away after all."

78973,308,104,444000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, I'm sorry you saw that, but I was very upset that night."
78974,308,105,448000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Quit changing the subject. How do you feel about me right now?
78975,308,106,451000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I love you, of course. But a lot of things you do still drive me crazy."
78976,308,107,456000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,So you mean our whole marriage you've just been resenting me behind my back?

78991,308,122,499000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, so you don't like it when I drink. What other secrets have you been hoarding to use against me?"
78992,308,123,503000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, let it go. It's not always going to be perfect. We've been married for ten years."
78993,308,124,508000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I didn't realize you've been counting the years. Is it that horrible living with me?"
78994,308,125,512000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well this morning isn't a barrel of laughs.
78995,308,126,515000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It is to me! Marge, I can't live like this! I'm tired of walking around on eggshells."
78996,308,127,519000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe if you didn't throw 'em on the floor...
78997,308,128,524000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now you're just making up rules. Who made you Judge Judy and executioner?
78998,308,129,532000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, where are you going?"
78999,308,130,534000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think."
79000,308,131,540000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"But you're not gonna get divorced like Milhouse's parents, are you?"
79001,308,132,544000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no. This is nothing like Milhouse's parents. Now if you need me I'll be staying with Milhouse's father."
79004,308,135,556000,Kirk Van Houten,Kirk Van Houten's Apartment,"Welcome to my place. I just have a few rules. If you see a necktie on the doorknob, I'm with a lady."

79011,308,142,587000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Do I dare to go up? Or is the love that waits behind that window just a lie?
79012,308,143,593000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"Uh, Homer, I think you want your house, next door."
79013,308,144,596000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Stupid Flanders with his misleading silhouette. Well, I guess I have no choice but to go back home and... hey, I never noticed that newspaper box."
79014,308,145,605000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"""Apartment Finder: We put you in your place."" ""Roommate wanted for three bedroom apartment. Spacious, river view, only four hundred dollars a month!"" Thank you, news box... It's gone!"

79017,308,148,623000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,What a well-kept street. And there sure are a lot of gay bookstores for a straight neighborhood.
79018,308,149,634000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,It's a cinch these guys never had any kids.

79023,308,155,655000,Man #2,Springfield,Who's the bear?
79024,308,156,658000,Young Man,Springfield,"Ooh, is that the Mr. Burns you're always talking about?"
79025,308,157,660000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield,"No. He's nobody! Shut up, Stuart!"
79026,308,158,662000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Nice to meet you, Stuart."
79028,308,160,664000,Grady,Village Apartment,"Homer, before you move in, you should know that Julio and I have an active social life."
79029,308,161,670000,Homer Simpson,Village Apartment,"Me too. I'm a member of this club where if I eat one more sub sandwich, I get a free sub sandwich. You probably saw the ads, with this guy who used to be fat, but now he's just ugly."
79030,308,162,677000,Julio,Village Apartment,"Homer, what Grady is saying is that, how can I put this? We might have a cocktails, say, where all the guests are male."
79031,308,163,685000,Homer Simpson,Village Apartment,Are you trying to tell me that you guys are those guys that like guys?
79032,308,164,689000,Grady,Village Apartment,"That's right, Homer. We're gay."
79033,308,165,690000,Homer Simpson,Village Apartment,"You are? Hm, which will win out? My old-fashioned prejudices or the fact that I've already mixed my laundry with yours. I'll have to sleep on it."
79034,308,166,705000,Julio,Village Apartment,He's sleeping in the pantry.
79035,308,167,707000,Grady,Village Apartment,My spices!
79038,308,170,708000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,"You guys lead a fascinating life. Like, why are you reading the New York Times? You don't live in New York."
79039,308,171,714000,Julio,Apartment,I despise the Springfield Shopper. What is that? All the headlines are jokes.
79040,308,172,722000,Julio,Apartment,"Uch, where'd you buy this? From the guy on the exit ramp? This is disgusting."
79041,308,173,725000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,"Calm down, Picky Ricardo. He made us a great breakfast, and you're just ridin' his butt... and not in a good way."
79042,308,174,732000,Grady,Apartment,"Thank you, Homer. It's a pleasure cooking for you."
79043,308,175,735000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,"Well, get used to it, 'cause I'm gonna stay."
79044,308,176,740000,Grady,Apartment,Fabulous! Here's the key to the lotion cabinet.
79045,308,177,742000,Julio,Apartment,"Grady, are you sure you want to live with him?"
79046,308,178,744000,Grady,Apartment,"It's either him or that girl who put ""Mother Earth"" as a reference. And with a male roommate, we can walk around naked."
79047,308,179,751000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,Way ahead of you.
79049,308,181,754000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, sweetie. Your father won't stay mad forever."
79050,308,182,758000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's so weird not having Dad here. I can't fall asleep if I haven't read him his bedtime story.
79051,308,183,765000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hello... hold on.
79052,308,184,767000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Nancy Drew let out a low whistle. 'This isn't an old windmill at all. It's a new windmill!'"" No Dad, I'm sure she won't be killed."

79056,308,188,804000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, and along the way we took photos of interesting doors and gates."
79057,308,189,807000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Your father sure can be thoughtful when he wants to be.
79058,308,190,810000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, please. Let's not fight in front of the kids. Just secretly hate me the way you always have."
79059,308,191,816000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I love watching you guys fight. It's my earliest memory."
79060,308,192,819000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little...!
79061,308,193,822000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, your hands feel so soft."
79062,308,194,824000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You noticed! I've been using Lancôme.
79063,308,195,827000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, it shows! I haven't had a strangle that smooth since I was four."
79064,308,196,831000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'd better go. But before I do, Marge, there's something I want to ask you."
79065,308,197,835000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, Homie?"

79068,308,200,847000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I know Dad cares about you, but his feelings are really hurt. Why don't you just say you're sorry?"
79069,308,201,852000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, marriage is a beautiful thing. But it's also a constant battle for moral superiority. So I can't apologize."
79070,308,202,861000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Couldn't you just say you're sorry and not mean it? I do it all the time. I don't think I've ever meant it.
79071,308,203,865000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! That's not right.
79072,308,204,867000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Mom. See, it's that easy!"

79077,308,210,881000,Homer Simpson,GAY NIGHTCLUB,"Maybe it is. I used to look at Marge and get the same tingle you guys get when you see Rip Taylor. But now, I don't know what's gonna happen. C'mon, let's dance."
79078,308,211,903000,Men,GAY NIGHTCLUB,Homer! Homer! Yeah! Get it on! Shake your bon bon!

79085,308,218,933000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,Tennessee Williams?! But how did he survive in the world of theater?

79091,308,224,960000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,Did you ever get the parody songs I sent you?
79092,308,225,962000,Weird Al,Apartment,Yes.
79093,308,226,963000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,"Which one was better: ""Livin' La Pizza Loca"" or ""Another One Bites The Crust""?"

79097,308,230,1001000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,It would take a man of stone with a funny bone of steel to resist that.
79098,308,231,1005000,Marge Simpson,Apartment,"Homer, would you at least let me take you out on a date?"
79099,308,232,1008000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,I don't know... date a chick with kids...

79108,308,242,1037000,Julio,Apartment Building,"Well, we've got the cure for that. Margaritas!"
79109,308,243,1040000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,Margarita... that's Mexican for Marge. I'll take that as a sign!

79116,308,251,1074000,Julio,Apartment,"Homer, weren't you supposed to meet your wife half an hour ago?"
79117,308,252,1078000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,"You guys don't have a gay time machine, do you?"
79118,308,253,1080000,Julio,Apartment,Yes. It's called Grady's shoe closet.
79119,308,254,1080000,Grady,Apartment,"Hey, Julio: ouch."

79128,308,263,1125000,Grady,Apartment,"Fact is, certain people just aren't right for each other. You gave it a chance, it didn't work. At least you tried."
79130,308,264,1131000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,"But it was Marge. My first and only love. I'm like David Spade without Chris Farley, alone and useless!"
79131,308,265,1139000,Grady,Apartment,"Oh Homer, a guy as cool and special as you will have no trouble. Believe me."
79132,308,266,1150000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,Wow. Wow. I never realized you felt about me that way. We should really take some time to talk and...I'd just end up hurting you!
79134,308,268,1161000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"You know, Moe, I was just thinking. My problems with Marge started because I drink too much. And then tonight alcohol only made things worse. Maybe all of my problems are actually caused by..."
79135,308,269,1172000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take your medicine, ya lush ya."
79137,308,271,1183000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield General Hospital,"Hey, what happened here?"
79138,308,272,1184000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield General Hospital,"Uh, he was drinkin' at Harrigan's Bar down the street, there. They oughtta close that dump down."
79140,308,274,1192000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,That was a close call. We took this much out of you.
79141,308,275,1196000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,But it's still not as bad as the first time I treated you for alcohol poisoning.
79142,308,276,1199000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,"Oh, yeah. The night that destroyed my marriage."
79143,308,277,1203000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,"Destroyed your marriage? Why, I've never seen a woman look so devoted. Let's look at the tape."

79145,308,279,1212000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,It was back when I thought the nurse was stealing sponges.
79146,308,280,1217000,Young Dr. Hibbert,Hospital Room,He's stable now. I'll leave you two alone.
148226,308,281,1221000,Young Marge,Hospital Room,"Homie, I was so worried about you. I was really mad at you tonight, but you're a good person and that's what I see most of the time. Whatever problems we have, we have a lifetime to work them out. Together."
79147,308,282,1233000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,"So, she didn't hate me. She married me because she loved me!"
79148,308,283,1238000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,And I still do.
79149,308,284,1240000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,"Marge, I never want to be apart from you again."
79150,308,285,1242000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,"Well, you'll never have to."

79155,308,287,1249000,Homer's Thoughts,Hospital Room,Or was it?
79152,308,288,1250000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,"Homie, what are you thinking?"
79153,308,289,1252000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,Manly thoughts.
79156,308,290,1257000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,All I have left now are my tapes.
79157,308,291,1262000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,She was stealing sponges. I knew it!
