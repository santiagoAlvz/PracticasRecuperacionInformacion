157834,31,48,280000,Monitor #1,CONTROL ROOM,Looks like there's a jam in delta sector.
157835,31,49,284000,Monitor #2,CONTROL ROOM,"Well, it's too big to be human. Send down a few kids, that should dislodge it."
157836,31,50,288000,Attendant,CONTROL ROOM,Roger.
157837,31,51,297000,Homer Simpson,CONTROL ROOM,OH NOOOOOO!!!!
157838,31,52,299000,Homer Simpson,CONTROL ROOM,I... can't... breathe! Too... many... children...!
157840,31,54,309000,Scott Christian,Simpson Home,... Eyewitnesses estimated the man's weight at somewhere between four and five hundred pounds...
157841,31,55,313000,Female Newscaster,Simpson Home,"And now on the lighter side of the news, and I use the term loosely --"
157843,31,57,318000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,No! The slide is perfectly safe. This was an isolated incident.
157844,31,58,322000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"I understand that, Krusty. Isn't that exactly what you said right before the recall of tainted Krusty Brand Mayonnaise?"
157845,31,59,328000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Now Kent, you know that question is out of bounds. This interview is over."
157846,31,60,333000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right family, I want the truth. Don't pull any punches. Am I just a little bit overweight?"
157847,31,61,343000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, am I?"
157848,31,62,345000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Forgive us, Dad, but it takes time to properly sugarcoat a response."
157849,31,63,348000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Four Hundred and thirty-seven. Fifty-five. Oh my God, three hundred and... Hey, a hundred and fifty. Oh God, it's two hundred and sixty pounds! I'm a big fat pig."
157850,31,64,372000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now Homer, you do have big bones."
157851,31,65,375000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bone."
157852,31,66,379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But I'm going on a diet. From this day forward I pledge there will be no pork chop too succulent, no donut too tasty, no pizza too laden with delicious toppings, to prevent me from reaching my scientifically determined ideal weight! As God is my witness, I'll always be hungry again!"
157853,31,67,401000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, shut up."
157854,31,68,408000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"This old attic's kinda spooky, isn't it boy. I said, isn't it, boy?"
157855,31,69,414000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't you ever do that to me again.
157856,31,70,417000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay.
157857,31,71,418000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart!
157858,31,72,418000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Get away from that thing and help me find my athletic equipment.
157859,31,73,423000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Homer, I found your weights."
157860,31,74,426000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, the Glutimus Maximizer."
157861,31,75,427000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, who's the moptop with the big schnozz?"
157862,31,76,430000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't you know anything, boy? That's Ringo Starr."
157863,31,77,435000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Your mother must have painted this. I guess she thought he was cute... Hey, what the..."
157864,31,78,444000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge!
157865,31,79,446000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer, don't be jealous. I was a schoolgirl, the Beatles were very popular and I had a crush on them."
157866,31,80,451000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Likely story.
157867,31,81,453000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, why did I have to start my diet on pork chop night?"
157868,31,82,458000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, Homer. We've got steamed vegetables and rice cakes for you."
157870,31,84,462000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, wait a minute. Hey, I've been setting my drinks on these things."
157871,31,85,467000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, they're only thirty-five calories apiece."
157872,31,86,471000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hello? Hello? Hello taste... where are you?
157873,31,87,475000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You can put a little something on top for flavor.
157874,31,88,478000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, hey, now you're talkin'!"
157875,31,89,479000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, these are really good. While I know first-hand how fragile young talent is, I'd love to hear the particulars of how your gift was squashed."
157876,31,90,488000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well...
157878,31,92,490000,Mr. Schindler,HIGH SCHOOL ART CLASS,"No, not another portrait of that bongo-beating Liverpudlian!"
157879,31,93,495000,Marge Simpson,HIGH SCHOOL ART CLASS,But Mr. Schindler...
157880,31,94,496000,Mr. Schindler,HIGH SCHOOL ART CLASS,"Someone might have used this canvas to create a masterpiece. Instead, you've soiled it forever."
157881,31,95,502000,Mr. Schindler,HIGH SCHOOL ART CLASS,"Now, this is art!"
157882,31,96,504000,Student,HIGH SCHOOL ART CLASS,"Thank you, Mr. Schindler."
157884,31,98,506000,Lisa Simpson,Young Marge's Bedroom,"Oh Mom, I can't believe you gave up painting because of one small-minded art teacher."
157885,31,99,511000,Marge Simpson,Young Marge's Bedroom,I was so upset I decided to send the portrait to the only man on earth whose opinion I could truly trust.
157887,31,101,517000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,And what was Ringo's response?
157888,31,102,520000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I never got any. And I never painted again.
157889,31,103,523000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe you could take a class at Springfield Community College.
157890,31,104,526000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I think it's a very nice idea. Don't you, Homer?"
157891,31,105,529000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Do I have to do anything?
157892,31,106,530000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
157893,31,107,530000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Great, fine, go nuts!"
157894,31,108,533000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mmm, only thirty-five calories."
157896,31,110,541000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,SPRINGFIELD COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,"Hello, Mrs. Homer!"
157897,31,111,542000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,Apu! What are you doing here?
157898,31,112,545000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,SPRINGFIELD COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,"I've just enrolled in a screenwriting class. I yearn to tell the story of an idealistic young Hindu pushed too far by convenience store bandits. I call it, ""Hands Off My Jerky, Turkey!"""
157899,31,113,556000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,Clever title.
157900,31,114,557000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,SPRINGFIELD COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,"Oh, thank you. Actually, my brother Sanjay thought of it."
157901,31,115,559000,Registrar,SPRINGFIELD COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,Next up!
157902,31,116,560000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,"My mother would like to enroll in ""Painting From Life, 2-B""."
157903,31,117,564000,Registrar,SPRINGFIELD COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast, there, pint size. I'm afraid no one can enroll until Professor Lombardo personally inspects and approves their portfolio."
157904,31,118,572000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,"Oh, Lisa, this was a bad idea."
157905,31,119,574000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,Mom...
157907,31,121,575000,Professor Lombardo,COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,"Very good... Fabulous... Ooh, even better... You have real talent."
157908,31,122,583000,Marge Simpson,COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,Do you really think so? My high school art teacher hated them.
157909,31,123,586000,Professor Lombardo,COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,"What? The man was a fool! But, still, one must admire the force of his conviction."
157910,31,124,591000,Marge Simpson,COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,Then I'm in the class?
157911,31,125,592000,Professor Lombardo,COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,"Oh my dear, there couldn't be a class without you. Now if you'll excuse me, nature calls!"
157912,31,126,599000,Professor Lombardo,COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION,Marvelous!
157914,31,128,604000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"The Heavy Hands don't work unless you move, Homer."
157915,31,129,608000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"I can't move, boy."
157916,31,130,609000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Oh really.
157918,31,132,614000,Professor Lombardo,Professor Lombardo's Class,"Now, using the ""Lombardo Method"", you learn to see everyday objects as a simple grouping of geometrical shapes."
157921,31,133,622000,Professor Lombardo,Professor Lombardo's Class,"Here we see how two concentric circles, various trapezoids, ellipses and, yes, even a rhombus, can create an adorable little bunny rabbit!"
157922,31,134,633000,Professor Lombardo,Professor Lombardo's Class,It's just that easy!
157924,31,136,640000,Lisa Simpson,Professor Lombardo's Class,Lincoln Lincoln I been thinkin' what the hell have you been drinkin'? / Is it water is it wine? / Oh my God it's turpentine! / Faster! Faster!
157927,31,139,660000,Professor Lombardo,Community College Painting Studio,"Bravo. Walk away from it! Now it belongs to the ages. You, not another stroke. Oh well, maybe one more. That's it! Perfect!"
157928,31,140,667000,Professor Lombardo,Community College Painting Studio,"Mmmm. Indeed. Marge, you find the inner beauty of your subject and bring it out for all to see."
157929,31,141,675000,Marge Simpson,Community College Painting Studio,"Well, thank you, Professor Lombardo."
157930,31,142,677000,Professor Lombardo,Community College Painting Studio,"Well, you're welcome, my dear! Marge, walk with me."
157931,31,143,681000,Professor Lombardo,Community College Painting Studio,"Marge, they've asked me to submit the best painting from my class to the Springfield Art Exhibition next week. I've decided to choose your ""Bald Adonis""?"
157932,31,144,692000,Marge Simpson,Community College Painting Studio,Really? You're so supportive. I wish every teacher was like you.
157933,31,145,696000,Professor Lombardo,Community College Painting Studio,"Marge, please. I don't take praise very well."
157934,31,146,699000,Professor Lombardo,Community College Painting Studio,"Oh, another triumph!"
157936,31,148,716000,Marge Simpson,OLD ARMORY HALL,I can't believe it.
157937,31,149,718000,BART & LISA,OLD ARMORY HALL,"Yay, Mom!"
157938,31,150,719000,Homer Simpson,OLD ARMORY HALL,"Woo-ooo! I'm a work of art! ""Last Supper"", eat your heart out!"
157940,31,152,727000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Garbage! What matchbook art school did you flunk out of, you ham-fisted, nearsighted house painter? Smithers, throw this on the dung heap."
157941,31,153,736000,Artist,Burns's Office,"I'm sorry, but this isn't working out. I quit."
157942,31,154,737000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Well, Smithers, I guess that's what you call your ""artistic temperament""."
157943,31,155,741000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Sir, I must remind you that the dedication of the Burns Wing of the museum is only six days away."
157944,31,156,746000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Damnation, Smithers! This idea of yours to immortalize me in a portrait was as half-baked as your idea about me having children!"
157919,31,157,753000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Smithers, find me an artist."
157946,31,158,755000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Sir, I'm afraid you've systematically alienated Springfield's entire art community. The only one left is this Mrs. Homer Simpson."
157947,31,159,762000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Who?
157948,31,160,763000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Well, she won first prize in the Springfield Art Fair, and as the wife of an employee, she'll be easily intimidated."
157949,31,161,767000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Excellent. Once again the wheel has turned and Dame Fortune has hugged Montgomery Burns to her sweet perfumed bosom. Somebody up there likes me, Smithers."
157950,31,162,778000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Somebody down here likes you, too, sir."
157951,31,163,780000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Shut up.
157952,31,164,792000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,Woo woo! Two forty nine! Yeah!
157954,31,166,802000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, Marge. Look at me! My clothes are just hanging off me!"
157955,31,167,807000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that's wonderful, isn't it kids?"
157956,31,168,809000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Pass the moo juice.
157957,31,169,811000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Kids. Remember what I told you about showing a little support.
157958,31,170,812000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Way to go, Dad."
157959,31,171,814000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You look mahvelous.
157960,31,172,815000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What a family.
157962,31,174,817000,Delivery Man,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, what gives? These donuts are pilin' up!"
157963,31,175,820000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, Homer Simpson went on a diet."
157964,31,176,823000,Delivery Man,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh my God! And I just bought a boat!
157966,31,178,834000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Well, don't people answer the door these days?"
157967,31,179,837000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,"Allow me, sir."
157968,31,180,838000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,Open up!
157969,31,181,841000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Mr. Burns. Would you like to come in?
157970,31,182,845000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,Mr. Burns would like to commission you to do a portrait of him. Have you ever painted the rich and powerful?
157971,31,183,850000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, no... just Ringo Starr."
157972,31,184,852000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Rin-go?
157973,31,185,853000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,"He was the drummer for a rock 'n roll combo called the Beatles, sir."
157974,31,186,857000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Beatles, eh? Oh, yes. I seem to remember their off-key caterwauling on the old Sullivan show. What was he thinking? Mrs. Simpson, this commission and all its glory can be yours, but first you must look me straight in the eye and answer one simple question."
157945,31,187,872000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, shoot."
157975,31,188,873000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Can you make me beautiful?
157976,31,189,875000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think that will be a problem.
157977,31,190,877000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,I'm no matinee idol.
157978,31,191,879000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, maybe not, but I have the gift of being able to see inner beauty."
157979,31,192,884000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Hmmm. Mrs. Simpson, you may immortalize me."
157980,31,193,887000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,"Ah, sir, at last the world will see you as I always have."
157981,31,194,892000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Yes, yes, yes! Now don't be stingy with the blush, Smithers."
157982,31,195,898000,MR. BURNS' GEOMETRIC SHAPES,Simpson Home,Now you! Paint!
157983,31,196,902000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, I'm home!"
157984,31,197,904000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Oh, there's an original sentiment."
157986,31,199,906000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Take it outside, Simpson. I'm male modeling."
157987,31,200,909000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm painting his portrait, Homer."
157988,31,201,911000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, isn't that wonderful. My work and my home life come together in such a nice way. Marge, may I see you in the other room?"
157989,31,202,920000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, he's nuts. He thinks he's handsome. Please, make him look handsome. Please, please, please, please..."
157990,31,203,925000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, Homer, don't worry. All I need to do is find Mr. Burns' inner beauty."
157992,31,205,932000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"What were you like as a boy, Mr. Burns? Did you have a dog that you loved."
157993,31,206,938000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Well, aieeee! There's something on my leg! Get it off! Get it off!"
157994,31,207,942000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mr. Burns, she's just a baby."
157995,31,208,947000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, all right, who took the funny pages?"
157996,31,209,951000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,"So, Ziggy goes to the repair shop and there's a sign on the doorbell reading ""Out Of Order."""
157997,31,210,951000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Ah, Ziggy... will you ever win?"
157998,31,211,964000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my."
157999,31,212,965000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"If you'll excuse me, I'm changing for a board meeting."
158000,31,213,968000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns."
158001,31,214,971000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Mom. Did he have those spots all over his body?"
158002,31,215,974000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,I heard that.
158003,31,216,974000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oops.
158004,31,217,975000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,"Would you feel more comfortable if I left, too, sir?"
158005,31,218,978000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Of course not, Smithers. You're like a doctor."
158006,31,219,982000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Smithers, I want my tea!"
158007,31,220,985000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that?
158008,31,221,988000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,"Actually, I value every second we're together -- from the moment I squeeze his orange juice in the morning, till I tuck him in at night. He's not just my boss, he's my best friend, too."
158009,31,222,998000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Bah! Too hot!
158010,31,223,1000000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,"You're right, sir. It's scalding me as we speak."
158012,31,225,1006000,RINGO,ENGLISH COUNTRY MANOR,"Dear Sally. In response to your letter of December the twelfth 1966, me favorite color is blue and me real first name is Richard. Thanks for the snapshot. You're a real cute bird. Luv, Ringo. P.S. Forgive the lateness of my reply."
158013,31,226,1022000,WETHERBY,ENGLISH COUNTRY MANOR,"Mr. Starr, tea and crumpets."
158014,31,227,1024000,RINGO,ENGLISH COUNTRY MANOR,Just set it over there.
158015,31,228,1025000,WETHERBY,ENGLISH COUNTRY MANOR,"Sir, if you'll forgive an old Brit his impertinence, your devotion to your fans is nothing short of remarkable."
158016,31,229,1030000,RINGO,ENGLISH COUNTRY MANOR,"Well, Wetherby, they took the time to write me and I don't care if it takes me another twenty years... I'm going to answer every one of them."
158017,31,230,1039000,RINGO,ENGLISH COUNTRY MANOR,Hello! What's this?
158018,31,231,1042000,RINGO,ENGLISH COUNTRY MANOR,"From Springfield, U.S.A."

158021,31,234,1051000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Will you cease that infernal tootling!
158022,31,235,1054000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I was just practicing.
158023,31,236,1056000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mr. Burns, it's hard to discover your inner beauty while you're shouting at an eight-year-old girl."
158024,31,237,1061000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"We've only got two days left, so I'd advise you to shut up and paint!"
158026,31,239,1065000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, scale. You don't like me and I don't like you, but I've been very good, so you better treat me right."
158027,31,240,1071000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right! Woo woo! Woo woo!
158028,31,241,1075000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge! I'm two-thirty-nine and I'm feeling fine! Look! I'm using the original notches that came with my belt.
158029,31,242,1082000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's wonderful Homer, I'm so proud of..."
158030,31,243,1085000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Let me get this straight. You're pleased with your current appearance? Ah, why my good man, you're the fattest thing I've ever seen. And I've been on safari."
158031,31,244,1096000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you need me, I'll be in the refrigerator."
158032,31,245,1101000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mr. Burns, I've had enough of your... posing. I can finish the portrait myself."
158033,31,246,1107000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Thank goodness. Another day in this suburban nightmare and I would've needed half a white valium. Thank you for your gracious hospitality. See you at the unveiling.
158034,31,247,1118000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, what are you doing?!"
158035,31,248,1122000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No. Burns is right. What's the use?
158036,31,249,1124000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't you listen to him. He's just a mean little S.O.B.
158037,31,250,1128000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge.
158038,31,251,1129000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought there was some good in everybody until I met him.
158039,31,252,1132000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, well, just so long as you paint a nice picture of him by noon tomorrow."
158040,31,253,1135000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think I can.
158041,31,254,1136000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What?! Marge, you have to."
158042,31,255,1138000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't make that man beautiful. I'm just not good enough. I guess I'm no artist.
158043,31,256,1144000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, what's this?"
158044,31,257,1146000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's for you, Marge. From merry old England."
158045,31,258,1149000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,From the desk of Ringo Starr!
158046,31,259,1149000,RINGO,Simpson Home,"Dear Marge. Thanks for the fab painting of yours truly. I hung it on me wall. You're quite an artist. In answer to your question, yes, we do have hamburgers and fries in England, but we call french fries chips. Luv, Ringo. P.S. Forgive the lateness of my reply."
158048,31,261,1167000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Marge. Paint. I think you can do it."
158049,31,262,1174000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, Homer. If you think I can."
158051,31,264,1205000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM,"Friends, art lovers, security personnel. Today is a red letter day for the Springfield Palace of Fine Art. A new wing for our museum and a portrait commemorating the man who ponied up the dough."
158052,31,265,1218000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM,"Ladies and gentlemen, may I invite you to behold... Montgomery Burns!"
158053,31,266,1228000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM,Smithers!
158054,31,267,1236000,Professor Lombardo,SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM,I don't care for this at all.
158058,31,268,1242000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM,"Umm... Hello. My name is Marge Simpson and I painted this. Maybe you'd like to know what possessed me to do it. Well, I guess I wanted to show that beneath Mr. Burns' fearsome head with its cruel lips, spiteful tongue and evil brain, there was a frail withered body -- perhaps not long for this world -- as vulnerable and beautiful as any of God's creatures."
158059,31,269,1278000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM,"Provocative, but powerful."
158060,31,270,1280000,MRS. HOOVER,SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM,"He's bad, but he'll die. So I like it."
158061,31,271,1285000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM,"Marge... a word, please."
158062,31,272,1287000,C. Montgomery Burns,SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM,"You know, I'm no art critic, but I know what I hate. And I don't hate this. Your painting is bold but beautiful. And uh, incidentally, thanks for not making fun of my genitalia."
158063,31,273,1303000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM,I thought I did.
