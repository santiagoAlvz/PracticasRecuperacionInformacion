All this drinking, violence, destruction of property -- are these the things we think of when we think of the Irish?"

38451,171,44,235000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"""What are you looking at?"" The innocent words of a drunken child. Well, I'll tell you what we're looking at, young man: a town gone mad. A town whose very conscience was washed away in a tide of beer and green vomit."
38452,171,45,248000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm going down to Moe's for a coupla beers.
38453,171,46,250000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll come with you.
38454,171,47,251000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No! No more drinking! I'm tired of looking like the world's worst mother.
38455,171,48,256000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. What about that freezer lady in Georgia?"
38457,171,50,263000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,But what's the solution? Are we so bereft of ideas that we must revive the antiquated notion of prohibition? Channel Six says yes.
38458,171,51,272000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Prohibition! They tried that in the movies and it didn't work. I predict this is the last we'll be hearing about prohibition.
38460,171,53,280000,Temperance Women,Springfield Town Hall,We want prohibition! We want prohibition!
38461,171,54,284000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"You can't seriously want to ban alcohol. It tastes great, makes women appear more attractive, and makes a person virtually invulnerable to criticism."
38462,171,55,293000,Helen Lovejoy,Springfield Town Hall,"Oh, won't somebody please think of the children?!"
38463,171,56,297000,Maude Flanders,Springfield Town Hall,What kind of an example are we setting?

38466,171,59,310000,Very Old Clerk,Springfield Town Hall,Seems there's been a prohibition law on the books in Springfield for 200 years. It's just never been enforced.
38467,171,60,317000,Councilmen,Springfield Town Hall,"Get outta here, ""Clerk Guy""!"
38468,171,61,320000,Very Old Clerk,Springfield Town Hall,There's also a law requiring ducks to wear long pants.
38469,171,62,324000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Wait a minute, let me see that. Well, I'll be darned, long pants..."
38470,171,63,328000,Maude Flanders,Springfield Town Hall,Read the other one. The non-duck one.
38471,171,64,331000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"""And spirituous beverages are hereby prohibited, under penalty of catapult."""
38474,171,67,331000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hibbert Home,"Did you see this, Bernice? It..."

38477,171,70,367000,Head Of Duff,Springfield City Dump,"No, we're not worried. Our customers buy Duff for its robust taste, not its alcoholic content. I predict our new alcohol-free ""Duff Zero"" will sell even better than our previous brand."

38483,171,76,401000,Narrator,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""","Dateline: Springfield. With prohibition back in force, sobriety's peaceful slumber was shattered by its noisy neighbor: the speakeasy!"
38484,171,77,409000,Homer Simpson,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""","Glad you're finally back in business, Moe."
38485,171,78,411000,Moe Szyslak,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""","Yeah, that was a scary coupla hours."
38487,171,80,413000,Narrator,Springfield,"The suppliers of the illegal booze? Gangsters, running truckloads of smuggled hooch all the way from Shelbyville. And John Law was helpless."
38488,171,81,420000,Fat Tony,Springfield,You didn't see nothin'.
38432,171,82,423000,Eddie,Springfield,I don't know why people are always bad-mouthin' the Mafia.
38189,171,84,438000,Chief Wiggum,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""",Wahoo!
38489,171,85,439000,Shocked Old Woman,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""",So!

38492,171,88,452000,Helen Lovejoy,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""",Pervert!!!
38493,171,89,453000,Chief Wiggum,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""","Oh, boy. That sounded bad."
38495,171,91,455000,Helen Lovejoy,Mayor's Office,We demand you bring in a police chief who will enforce the prohibition law.
38496,171,92,459000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Mayor's Office,Demand? Who are you to demand anything? I run this town. You're just a bunch of low-income nobodies.
38497,171,93,466000,Quimby's Aide,Mayor's Office,"Uh, election in November. Election in November."
38498,171,94,468000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Mayor's Office,"What, again? This stupid country."
38499,171,95,472000,Narrator,Mayor's Office,"With rum-running hoodlums in the catbird's seat, Springfield sent for the one man who could clean up the town and shoot the gangsters... Rex Banner."
38502,171,98,497000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Ow! Hey, I was watching that. And I was sitting there."
38503,171,99,502000,Rex Banner,Springfield Police Station,"Rex Banner. I'm running this department now. Wiggum, you're out. Suspended indefinitely."
38504,171,100,507000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Huh?
38505,171,101,509000,Rex Banner,Springfield Police Station,Tuck in that shirt! Get those shoes shined! Take that badge out of your mouth! You're police officers.
38506,171,102,515000,Rex Banner,Springfield Police Station,What are you waiting for? Somebody to kiss you goodbye?
38507,171,103,518000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Well, no, no... no. I guess not."
38508,171,104,526000,Narrator,Springfield Police Station,"Wasting no time, Rex Banner tore into the bootleggers like a chippie tearing into a lobster."
38509,171,105,539000,Fat Tony,Springfield Police Station,How do you know you don't like bribes if you've never taken one? Here.
38510,171,106,543000,Rex Banner,Springfield Police Station,Say... this is nice... No! No bribes!
38511,171,107,548000,Fat Tony,Springfield Police Station,"Okay, you win. From now on, we'll stick to smuggling heroin."
38512,171,108,552000,Rex Banner,Springfield Police Station,See that you do.
38514,171,110,553000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"At first I thought prohibition was a good thing. People were drinking more and having a lot more fun. But without beer, prohibition doesn't work."
38515,171,111,562000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Hey, hi, can I arrest any of you people for anything?"
38516,171,112,566000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
38518,171,113,567000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Aw, geez. I don't have anything to do anymore. With Banner around, alcohol and crime are history in this town. And so am I."
38519,171,114,575000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now don't say that! Alcohol is a way of life. Alcohol is my way of life. And I aim to keep it!
38520,171,115,582000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Sounds like you have a plan.
38521,171,116,584000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do..."
38522,171,117,590000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, boy, think of a plan."

38527,171,122,603000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"We're going out, Marge. If we don't come back, avenge our deaths."

38530,171,125,609000,Bart Simpson,CITY DUMP,"Whoa, bonanza! Let's load it up before the rats regroup."
38531,171,126,613000,Homer Simpson,CITY DUMP,"Right. Now remember, don't mention this to anyone. Not your mother, not Rex Banner, not anyone."
38534,171,129,630000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Heh, Rex Banner. What a dope."
38535,171,130,632000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,Yeah. Look at him trying to aim that stupid gun.

38539,171,134,646000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Really? I heard good.
38541,171,136,655000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"What happened to you, Homer? And what have you done to the car?"
38542,171,137,659000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Nothin'.
38543,171,138,661000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think it had broken axles before.
38544,171,139,663000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Before! Before! You're living in the past, Marge! Quit living in the past."
38545,171,140,671000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's funny... I used to be able to go down there.
38546,171,141,676000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Going bowling. Not back - avenge deaths.
38547,171,142,678000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why do you have so many bowling balls?
38548,171,143,680000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm not going to lie to you, Marge. So long!"
38517,171,146,696000,Bart Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Aw, rats, another gutter ball! Gee, Homer, you sure do suck tonight!"

38557,171,153,725000,Barney Gumble,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""","Forty-five bucks?! Well, this better be the best tasting beer in the world! You got lucky..."
38559,171,155,740000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"You see, boy, the real money's in bootlegging, not in your childish vandalism."
38560,171,156,746000,Bart Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oh, so many wasted nights..."
38562,171,158,750000,Eddie,ATMOSPHERIC DINER,"What's the matter, Chief?"
38563,171,159,752000,Lou,ATMOSPHERIC DINER,"Yeah, you've barely touched your Banana Kaboom."
38564,171,160,756000,Rex Banner,ATMOSPHERIC DINER,This isn't a very happy birthday for Rex Banner.
38565,171,161,768000,Barney Gumble,ATMOSPHERIC DINER,"Hello, fishies!"
38567,171,163,772000,Rex Banner,ATMOSPHERIC DINER,"Listen, rummy, I'm going to say it plain and simple: Where'd you pinch the hooch? Is some blind tiger jerking suds on the side?"
38568,171,164,779000,Barney Gumble,ATMOSPHERIC DINER,Yes?
38570,171,166,781000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait a minute. I forgot to make sure the coast was clear. Aw, it's probably clear. Let's go."

38575,171,171,805000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well -- and I can explain, remember -- I fill the balls with beer that I found at the dump, then I bowl them and some underground pipes take them into Moe's."
38576,171,172,813000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, that's very clever!"
38577,171,173,816000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh?
38578,171,174,816000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mo-om!
38579,171,175,817000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it is. I've known your father since high school and this is the cleverest thing he's ever done. Besides, he's only breaking a silly, two-hundred-year-old law..."
38580,171,176,825000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It is silly, Marge. And look at all the money I'm making!"
38581,171,177,828000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Whooh...
38582,171,178,829000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mo-om!! Prohibition may be unpopular, but it's the law and we still have to--"

38585,171,181,842000,Rex Banner,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""","Open up, Curly. This is a raid."
38586,171,182,845000,Moe Szyslak,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""","A raid?! Curly?! Um, all right, but, uh, I don't know what you... expect to find in a simple, uh, neighborhood...pet shop."
38587,171,183,863000,Rex Banner,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""","Pet shop, eh? Well, I just have one question -- what kind of pet shop is filled with rambunctious yahoos and hot jazz music at 1:00 a.m.?"
38588,171,184,871000,Moe Szyslak,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""",Um... er... the best damn pet shop in town!
38590,171,186,880000,Rex Banner,"Moe's ""Pet Shop""","All right... but you people remember: baby turtles and alligators may seem like a cute idea for a pet, but they grow up. Let's go, boys."

38631,171,226,1043000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What on earth happened down there?
38632,171,227,1045000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,One of the stills --
38633,171,228,1047000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh... nothing, Marge. I think it must have been that bean I had for dinner."
38634,171,229,1054000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ka-boom! Blam! Oh, excuse me again, dear."
38635,171,230,1057000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, there's no point in pretending you're making those noises. Your homemade liquor is exploding again."
38636,171,231,1063000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What, dear?"
38637,171,232,1063000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ka-BLAMMO.
38638,171,233,1065000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You've made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal. Why not quit now, while you're ahead?"
38639,171,234,1072000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Boom.
38640,171,235,1076000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll be right back.
38641,171,236,1085000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's hot!
38642,171,237,1092000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I thought about what you said, honey, and I've decided to quit."
38644,171,239,1097000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Oh, well... Fun's over, but I still have my wonderful money."
38645,171,240,1102000,Chief Wiggum,Street,Stick 'em up.
38646,171,241,1103000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Geez, what happened to you, Wiggum? You look terrible."
38647,171,242,1106000,Chief Wiggum,Street,"Yeah, never mind how I look. You gonna give me the money or not?"
38648,171,243,1109000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Well, I don't think so. You don't even have a trigger on that thing."
38649,171,244,1112000,Chief Wiggum,Street,"Yeah, I had to sell the trigger and most of the handle to feed my family. C'mon, give me the dough. I can throw this pretty hard."
38650,171,245,1119000,Homer Simpson,Street,Poor Wiggum.
38651,171,246,1121000,Chief Wiggum,Street,Poor Wiggum.
38652,171,247,1122000,Homer Simpson,Street,"I'll bet you really hate Rex Banner, huh?"
38653,171,248,1124000,Chief Wiggum,Street,"Um, who?"
38654,171,249,1126000,Homer Simpson,Street,The guy who took your job.
38655,171,250,1127000,Chief Wiggum,Street,"Oh, yeah... More than anything in the world!"
38656,171,251,1130000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Hey, how would you like to show him up by beating him at his own game?"
38657,171,252,1139000,Rex Banner,Street,"I'm happy to report that the flow of illegal liquor seems to have dried up. Public drunkenness has ceased and those mysterious liquor clouds over Evergreen Terrace are gone. People, Rex Banner has won your war against alcohol."
38659,171,254,1154000,Voice In Crowd,Street,What about the Beer Baron?
38660,171,255,1155000,Rex Banner,Street,"I suspect he was just an invention of the media. The idea that someone like that could operate under my very nose is laughable. Well, you all know what laughter sounds like."
38661,171,256,1169000,Kent Brockman,Street,We now go live to Evergreen Terrace where I'm informed that former Police Chief Wiggum has captured the Beer Baron.
38662,171,257,1177000,Crowd,Street,/ Good golly! / Heavens! / They captured Homer?!
38664,171,259,1180000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"..then, the liquor-filled bowling balls travelled through a network of underground pipes, finally emerging at a nearby speakeasy."
38665,171,260,1187000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You forgot one thing, Wiggum."
38666,171,261,1190000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Yeah? What's that?
38667,171,262,1191000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I filled the balls with a funnel.
38668,171,263,1194000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That was a very sweet thing you did for poor Wiggum, but what's going to happen to you?"
38669,171,264,1200000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, probably just a slap on the wrist..."
38671,171,266,1202000,Very Old Clerk,Springfield Town Square,"...And he who shall violate this law, shall be punished by catapult."
38672,171,267,1202000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Last time I help you.
38673,171,268,1210000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Square,"Sorry. I thought you'd get a fine, or at most three, four years in jail."
38674,171,269,1214000,Rex Banner,Springfield Town Square,Hold it. This machine is two centuries old. Better test it first.
38675,171,270,1224000,Rex Banner,Springfield Town Square,"Okay, go ahead."
38676,171,271,1226000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Wait! Wait! You can't do this! All my husband did was violate a law that doesn't make sense. Now, I'll admit car crashes and fist fights have been down recently, but prohibition has cost us our freedom. Our freedom to drink."
38678,171,273,1242000,Rex Banner,Springfield Town Square,"Now hold on a minute, Missy. It's not up to us to choose which laws we want to obey. If it were, I'd kill everyone who looked at me cockeyed. Our laws are in place for a reason. And when someone..."
38679,171,274,1252000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Square,"Send him back to momma, boys..."
38680,171,275,1258000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Square,"That was unexpected. Well, reset the catapult. And let's get this over with."
38681,171,276,1264000,Very Old Clerk,Springfield Town Square,Wait!
38682,171,277,1265000,Very Old Clerk,Springfield Town Square,I've discovered more lines on the parchment! It says that the prohibition law which was passed here 200 years ago was repealed 199 years ago.
38683,171,278,1277000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Square,Release the prisoner!
38684,171,279,1281000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Square,"On behalf of the city, I'd like to apologize, and ask how long it will take for you to flood this town with booze again."
38685,171,280,1288000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Well, sorry, I'm not in that business anymore."
38686,171,281,1292000,Fat Tony,Springfield Town Square,Four minutes.
38688,171,283,1294000,Narrator,Main Street,"And so, one town's brief flirtation with prohibition ended in a joyous remarriage to Lady Liquor! Congratulations, Springfield! We wish you the very best!"
38689,171,284,1304000,Homer Simpson,Main Street,"To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems!"
