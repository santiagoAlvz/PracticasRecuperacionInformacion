9638,65,5,111000,Chief Engineer,STARSHIP ENGINE ROOM,"It's no good, Captain, I canna' reach the control panel!"
9640,65,7,115000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Movies! What a rip-off.
9641,65,8,117000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't have to sit here and take this. I... .
9642,65,9,124000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Hubba hubba! Oh you kid!
9643,65,10,126000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thank you, dear. Now be good for Grampa while we're at the parent/ teacher meeting. We'll bring back dinner."
9644,65,11,132000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What are we going to have?
9645,65,12,133000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Well that depends on what your teachers say. If you've been good... pizza. If you've been bad... uh... ... let's see... poison.
9646,65,13,141000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What if one of us has been good and one of us has been bad?
9647,65,14,144000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Poison pizza.
9648,65,15,145000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh no. I'm not making two stops.
9650,65,17,149000,Homer Simpson,Highway,"All right, I'll talk to Lisa's teacher this year. You can have Bart's."
9651,65,18,153000,Marge Simpson,Highway,That's the way we do it every year.
9652,65,19,155000,Homer Simpson,Highway,All right. Tell you what. I'm thinking of a number between one and 50.
9653,65,20,158000,Marge Simpson,Highway,Is it 37?
9654,65,21,160000,Homer Simpson,Highway,"I mean, no."
9655,65,22,161000,Marge Simpson,Highway,Homer!
9656,65,23,162000,Homer Simpson,Highway,"Please Marge... please, please, please, please, please?"
9657,65,24,164000,Marge Simpson,Highway,"Oh, all right."
9658,65,25,165000,Homer Simpson,Highway,Woo hoo! U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!
9660,65,27,176000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Ach.
9661,65,28,193000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Hee hee!
9662,65,29,206000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart has been guilty of the following atrocities: synthesizing a laxative from peas and carrots, replacing my birth-control pills with Tic Tacs..."
9663,65,30,213000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I'm sorry... I'm sure Bart doesn't really mean to be bad."
9665,65,32,218000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Now's our chance to be bad.
9667,65,34,221000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,Mr. Simpson... I just wanted to tell you that you've done a wonderful job with Lisa. You must have read to her at a young age.
9668,65,35,229000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I did. I did read to her!
9670,65,36,233000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Eight o'clock... Happy Days. The Fonz, Henry Winkler, is worried he's losing his cool."
9671,65,37,235000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I've always been a firm believer in the three ""R's"": ""reading TV Guide""... ummmm, writing to TV Guide... and renewing TV Guide."
9672,65,38,249000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, we don't usually do this, but we have some witnesses. Come in, Arthur."
9673,65,39,257000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Now where did Bart stick the fireworks?
9674,65,40,262000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Oh...
9676,65,42,266000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Over the lips and past the gums, look out dentures, here I come."
9677,65,43,273000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ew!
9679,65,45,281000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"""My child is on the Honor Roll at Springfield Elementary."" You know, I never thought I'd find a replacement for my ""Where's the Beef"" bumper sticker. Heh, heh, heh... ""Where's the Beef""."
9680,65,46,292000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,Uh... we'd like the desk back Mr. Simpson.
9681,65,47,294000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Huh? Oh.
9684,65,50,310000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I really don't see how this helps Bart.
9685,65,51,313000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Just do it.
9686,65,52,315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Bus-ted!
9687,65,53,316000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Homer, we have a problem here."
9688,65,54,319000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect. I won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing Lisa!
9689,65,55,324000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,We're talking about Bart.
9690,65,56,326000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Oh. That guy.
9691,65,57,328000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,I think the problem here is discipline. If Bart does something wrong you should punish him.
9692,65,58,333000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in."
9693,65,59,339000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,He's the boy you love to hate.
9694,65,60,341000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, you've got to start being firm with him. I believe with persistent discipline even the poorest student can end up becoming... oh... say Chief Justice of the Supreme Court."
9696,65,61,352000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. What great men he would join. John Marshall... Charles Evans Hughes... Warren Burger... mmm burger.
9697,65,62,364000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,And what if we don't?
9698,65,63,365000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Then there's no telling how low he can sink.
9700,65,65,369000,Announcer,CHIPPENDALE-TYPE DANCE CLUB,"All right, ladies. Prepare to be blown away by ""Bang-Bang Bart!"""
9701,65,66,382000,Rowdy Woman,CHIPPENDALE-TYPE DANCE CLUB,You're fat!
9702,65,67,383000,Bart Simpson,CHIPPENDALE-TYPE DANCE CLUB,"Just more of me to love, honey."
9704,65,69,390000,Marge Simpson,CHIPPENDALE-TYPE DANCE CLUB,"Oh, my poor baby."
9706,65,71,399000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh oh.
9707,65,72,411000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,What? Whazzat?
9708,65,73,414000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hi mom. Hi dad. Home already? Boy, time really flies when you're reading... The Bible? Ew."
9709,65,74,422000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we brought some pizza."
9711,65,76,426000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,If you don't start making more sense we're gonna have to put you in a home.
9712,65,77,430000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,You already put me in a home.
9713,65,78,432000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on ""60 Minutes."""
9714,65,79,435000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll be good.
9715,65,80,438000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Look what your bad egg of a son did to my teeth!
9716,65,81,440000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you and your stories... ""Bart broke my teeth""... ""the nurses are stealing my money""... ""this thing on my neck is getting bigger""..."
9717,65,82,445000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Now this is exactly what Bart's teacher was talking about. Our son did something wrong and you look the other way.
9718,65,83,454000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But Marge, look at that hangdog expression. He's learned his lesson. Let's get him a present."
9719,65,84,461000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Please, Homer. Why do I always have to be the bad guy?"
9720,65,85,465000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, all right. Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth -- he gets to break yours."
9721,65,86,471000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, this is gonna be sweet."
9722,65,87,473000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no, no."
9723,65,88,474000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh.
9724,65,89,475000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, we're sending you to bed without your supper."
9695,65,90,478000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, right. Like you're gonna let me go hungry. I'll be eatin' that pizza in five minutes."
9725,65,91,483000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! Stop being confident.
8830,65,92,484000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dog gone it!
9237,65,93,485000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh Grampa!
9669,65,94,492000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm starving! Somebody bring me some food, quick!"
9602,65,95,496000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm a-comin' boy!
9637,65,96,498000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, get back here."
9726,65,97,503000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,There must be something to eat around here.
9727,65,98,523000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Gee, maybe they mean it this time. From now on I guess I'd better straighten up and fly..."
9728,65,99,529000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, don't tell your mother, but I brought you some pizza."
9729,65,100,532000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Just promise me you'll try to be good.
9730,65,101,534000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I promise.
9731,65,102,536000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Thataboy.
9732,65,103,541000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Sucker.
9734,65,105,549000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well, well. If it isn't the tooth fairy."
9735,65,106,558000,Announcer,Springfield Retirement Castle,Coming for Christmas... the Itchy & Scratchy Movie!
9737,65,108,574000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart!
9738,65,109,575000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Stick around, Mr. Bond. Things are really starting to ""cook."""
9740,65,111,585000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, come quick! There's an Itchy and Scratchy MOVIE!!!"
9741,65,112,591000,Announcer,Simpson Home,If you want suspense...romance...you'll find it in the Itchy & Scratchy Movie. Coming soon to a theater near you. 53% new footage.
9742,65,113,620000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Wow.
9743,65,114,622000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, did you take out the garbage like I asked?"
9744,65,115,625000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Indeed I did.
9745,65,116,628000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey you goats, get outta here!"
9746,65,117,632000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boy, you're going to have to be punished for this."
9747,65,118,634000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you could punish me. But that means you'd have to think of a punishment, sit here and make sure I do it..."
9749,65,120,643000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Or you could let me go play with Milhouse while you spend the afternoon watching unpredictable Mexican sitcoms.
9750,65,121,651000,Bumblebee Man,Simpson Home,"Ayy, el estomago!"
9751,65,122,655000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Run along, ya little scamp."
9754,65,125,671000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Jin-gle Bells, Jin-gle Bells..."
9755,65,126,675000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! Why are you doing that?
9756,65,127,677000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'unno.
9757,65,128,678000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, this time you must be punished."
9758,65,129,680000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you could punish me, but..."
9759,65,130,683000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No tricks, boy. I said I'm gonna punish you and come Hell or high water I... wait a minute..."
9760,65,131,690000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ice cream truck!
9761,65,132,698000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Me, me. I was here first!"
9762,65,133,700000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, what were we talking about, boy?"
9763,65,134,705000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... we were talking about the time you beat jury duty.
9764,65,135,710000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah. The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
9765,65,136,719000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We're home.
9766,65,137,720000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We got beets!
9767,65,138,722000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, are you pulling up the carpet?"
9768,65,139,724000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Yuh - huh.
9769,65,140,725000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why are you letting him do this?
9770,65,141,727000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'unno.
9771,65,142,728000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well punish him!
9772,65,143,729000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right. All right. Bart, go to your room."
9773,65,144,731000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,See ya in the funny pages.
9774,65,145,733000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How could you let this happen?
9775,65,146,735000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How could you let this happen?
9776,65,147,736000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I wasn't here!
9777,65,148,738000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh. How convenient.
9778,65,149,740000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, do you want your son to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or a sleazy male stripper?"
9779,65,150,746000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Can't he be both like the late Earl Warren?
9780,65,151,749000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Earl Warren wasn't a stripper.
9781,65,152,751000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now who's being naive.
9782,65,153,752000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, you have to help discipline your son."
9783,65,154,755000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, Marge. I swear to you, the next time he does something wrong I'll punish him and make it stick."
9784,65,155,762000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Tonight on Eye On Springfield, we meet a man who's been hiccuping for forty-five years."
9785,65,156,767000,Man,Simpson Home,Kill me... Kill me...
9786,65,157,770000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,But first we'll examine the growing Itchy & Scratchy mania with their new movie premiering today!
9787,65,158,775000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I got my ticket.
9788,65,159,777000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"I'm here live in Korea to give you a first hand look at how American cartoons are made. But first, let's take a look back at the year 1928. A year when you might have seen Al Capone dancing the Charleston on top of a flagpole."
9789,65,160,797000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"It was also the year of the very first Scratchy cartoon, entitled ""That Happy Cat""."
9791,65,161,797000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"The film did very poorly. But the following year Scratchy was teamed up with a psychotic young mouse named Itchy. And cartoon history was made. Here's their first cartoon together: ""Steamboat Itchy."""
9792,65,162,826000,Itchy,Simpson Home,"Oh me, oh my!"
9793,65,163,867000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,During the war Itchy & Scratchy put their differences aside and teamed up to fight a bigger foe.
9794,65,164,890000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,We'll be back with a real life Itchy & Scratchy. A rabid mouse in Boston who attacked and killed a small cat.
9795,65,165,901000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie?"
9796,65,166,903000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Sounds like something you'd say.
9797,65,167,905000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, where is she?"
9800,65,170,917000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,Oh my Lord!
9802,65,172,920000,Chief Wiggum,Street,"Aw, isn't that cute. A baby driving a car."
9803,65,173,922000,Chief Wiggum,Street,"And look, there's a dog driving a bus."
9804,65,174,929000,Driver,Street,Hey!
9805,65,175,943000,Snake Jailbird,Street,All rrright. Time for a crime spree.
9807,65,177,949000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, boy. This calls for the biggest punishment I've ever handed down. And this time it's gonna stick!"
9808,65,178,955000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Homer. This isn't funny."
9809,65,179,957000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Damn right. Bart, you can't go to see that Itchy & Scratchy movie. Ever!"
9811,65,181,973000,Snake Jailbird,Simpson Home,"Oh, nnnooo. Beta."
9812,65,182,979000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you gotta let me see that movie. Can't you just give me a spanking?"
9813,65,183,984000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, go nuts."
9814,65,184,986000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it.
9815,65,185,990000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished, but the Itchy and Scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. How would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?"
9816,65,186,1002000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmm...
9818,65,188,1002000,Astronaut,Homer's Living Room,That's one small step for man; one giant leap for mankind.
9819,65,189,1010000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Living Room,"YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY/ I'VE GOT LOVE IN MY TUMMY/ AND I FEEL LIKE LOVIN' YOU..."
9820,65,190,1016000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Living Room,"... LOVE YOU, SUCH A SWEET THING/ GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT THING..."
9790,65,191,1022000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Living Room,"Sorry, but the punishment stands."
9821,65,193,1033000,Guy,Aztec Theater,I regret nothing!
9822,65,194,1042000,Homer Simpson,Aztec Theater,"Someday you'll thank me for this, son."
9823,65,195,1045000,Bart Simpson,Aztec Theater,Not bloody likely.
9824,65,196,1046000,Homer Simpson,Aztec Theater,"No, it's true. You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt. But, my dad wouldn't get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage."
9825,65,197,1060000,Bart Simpson,Aztec Theater,"Dad, what's the point of this story?"
9826,65,198,1062000,Homer Simpson,Aztec Theater,I like stories.
9827,65,199,1064000,Bart Simpson,Aztec Theater,"Look, can I please go to the movie?"
9828,65,200,1066000,Homer Simpson,Aztec Theater,"I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I can't go back on it. You're welcome to watch anything you want on TV."
9829,65,201,1072000,Bart Simpson,Aztec Theater,TV sucks.
9830,65,202,1074000,Homer Simpson,Aztec Theater,"I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that."
9832,65,204,1078000,Announcer,Simpson Home,The master craftsman can make three mailboxes an hour.
9833,65,205,1082000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm not licked yet. I can entertain myself. No matter how good a movie is, it can't compare to the imagination of a small boy."
9835,65,207,1104000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,How was it?
9836,65,208,1105000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It wasn't that great.
9837,65,209,1106000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Be honest.
9838,65,210,1107000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"It was the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life. And you wouldn't believe the celebrities who did cameos. Dustin Hoffman, Michael Jackson... of course they didn't use their real names, but you could tell it was them."
9839,65,211,1118000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa.
9840,65,212,1119000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Sorry Bart.
9842,65,214,1125000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOLYARD,It's just not the same.
9843,65,215,1129000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOLYARD,I've seen the Itchy & Scratchy Movie 13 times.
9844,65,216,1133000,Nelson Muntz,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOLYARD,I've seen it 17 times.
9845,65,217,1136000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOLYARD,You guys must be gettin' pretty tired of that movie by now.
9846,65,218,1138000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOLYARD,No one who saw the movie would say that!
9847,65,219,1142000,Nelson Muntz,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOLYARD,Let's get him!
9849,65,221,1147000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Homer, we'd like to talk to you."
9850,65,222,1150000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,But then I won't be watching TV. You can see the bind I'm in.
9851,65,223,1153000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Dad, you've got to let Bart see that movie. I've never seen him like this. He has the demented melancholia of a Tennessee Williams heroine."
