123692,477,74,428000,Julio,Julio's Hair Salon,Marge... It's time I told you the truth. You've been grayer than a Seattle Cinco de Mayo for years now.

123694,477,76,438000,Julio,Julio's Hair Salon,"Yes, the dye not only colors your hair, but the fumes wipe the experience from your mind."

123697,477,79,454000,Julio,Julio's Hair Salon,"Oh, Janis, I'm so sorry, can we reschedule? It's a battle of the Blue and Gray and I'm Gaybraham Lincoln, baby."
123698,477,80,463000,Middle-aged Lady,Julio's Hair Salon,"Oh, that's okay. I only needed a touchup. My husband and I can use the time to take a long romantic walk."

123700,477,82,474000,Julio,Julio's Hair Salon,"Oh, her self-confidence doesn't come from a bottle. Now, let's rub this toxic blue goo onto your scalp."

123711,477,93,529000,Executive #2,Homer's Head,"The last time we faked a stroke, it led to a real one!"
123712,477,94,531000,Executive #1,Homer's Head,"We're running out of time, people! We need an answer! And it needs to be great!"

123717,477,99,547000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I love it. I know I use the word ""empowering"" a lot, but this time it really is that."
123718,477,100,552000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I just have one question about hair. Where does mine start? Head, head, head, hair... where's the border?"

123724,477,106,583000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I can't talk now, I'm talking to myself! No, no, Homer, go ahead. Thanks, Homer, it'll just be a minute. What's up?"
123725,477,107,588000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Hey wingman, you're supposed to be here like you promised."

123726,477,110,599000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,I can't take it. I'm just going to draw a hairline on.
123728,477,112,606000,Homer Simpson,SINGLES CLUB,"So basically, my job is to make you look good by comparison. Like West Virginia does for Virginia."

123737,477,121,638000,Attractive Friend,SINGLES CLUB,What's that?
123738,477,122,639000,Moe Szyslak,SINGLES CLUB,Walk away from you.
123740,477,124,642000,Dr. Kissingher,SINGLES CLUB,"""Taking Down a Rival,"" aka ""Talk Blocking."""

123742,477,126,650000,Lenny Leonard,SINGLES CLUB,"No, they just sawed off the ends and painted over the nubs. Hey, where you goin', baby?"
123743,477,127,656000,Lenny Leonard,SINGLES CLUB,Oh no you don't.
123744,477,128,661000,Lenny Leonard,SINGLES CLUB,Nice talk-blocking. Would you be willing to wingman for me?

123746,477,130,667000,Lenny Leonard,SINGLES CLUB,I just ordered this bottomless pitcher of beer and circumference-less platter of nachos.
123747,477,131,670000,Homer Simpson,SINGLES CLUB,Deal!

123757,477,143,714000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Right. It's just weird. Normally I think your mom is hot--
123758,477,144,718000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Take that back!
123759,477,145,718000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm sorry. What I mean is, she's not hot any more..."
123760,477,146,722000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Take that back!

123763,477,149,736000,Lisa Simpson,Supermarket,Huh. Let's see what cousin Jessica's up to.
123764,477,150,742000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,There's a woman who's got it all under control.

123771,477,157,766000,Bernice Hibbert,Supermarket,Such audacity!
123772,477,158,768000,Ralph Wiggum,Supermarket,Grandma had hair like that when she went to sleep in her forever box.
123773,477,159,781000,Lisa Simpson,Supermarket,"You can't listen to those women, Mom. Change threatens them. They didn't like it when the Springfield Shopper started printing in color."
123774,477,160,788000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,Neither did I. I didn't want to know what color the Statue of Liberty was. But you know what? I was wrong. And these ladies are too.
123775,477,161,798000,Cashier,Supermarket,"Ma'am, do you have any kind of a... discount card?"
123776,477,162,800000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,What kind of card?

123780,477,166,809000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,"A.A.A.? No, I'm not in triple-A. I don't like their ""Westways"" magazine. They'll give four diamonds to any place that's got a lid on the toilet."
123781,477,167,819000,Cashier,Supermarket,"No, I meant the A.A... R..."
123782,477,168,825000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,P?! The A.A.R.P.?! Well that tears it. I don't want this milk and I'm not gonna take it back.

123784,477,170,838000,Gil Gunderson,Supermarket,"Right here, ma'am. Oh boy, a ""put back!"" I hope it takes me by the freezer section. Stick my head in the pizza case it's like a ski vacation! I can imagine the pepperonis are Swiss chalets nestled in a big layer of mozzarella snow!"
123785,477,172,855000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, eyewitnesses to your fight described you as ""berserkoid,"" ""totally aggro,"" and said you punched Milhouse ""like fifty billion times."" That's an excessive number of times."
123786,477,173,867000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"What's bothering you, son?"
123787,477,174,869000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I... I don't want to talk about it.
123788,477,175,871000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Thank God. I don't want to either.
123790,477,177,873000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Springfield Elementary School Psychologist's Office,"Remember, Bart, anything you say here is confidential."
123791,477,178,878000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Psychologist's Office,Can we close the door?
123792,477,179,880000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Springfield Elementary School Psychologist's Office,"Oh, there is no door. State regulations."

123794,477,181,884000,Terri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School Psychologist's Office,Still freakin' out 'cause your Mom aged thirty years in a day?
123795,477,182,888000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Springfield Elementary School Psychologist's Office,"Don't judge them too harshly. They recently learned they were once two-thirds of conjoined triplets. And the third one is out for revenge. Now Bart, share your most intimate thoughts with me."
123796,477,183,897000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Psychologist's Office,I don't think I want to.
123797,477,184,899000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Springfield Elementary School Psychologist's Office,"Oh... Well, maybe it'd be easier for you to talk to my colleague Doctor Thera-bear."
123798,477,185,904000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Psychologist's Office,Well...
123799,477,186,907000,Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Springfield Elementary School Psychologist's Office,Hold on. I'm not allowed in the room while you talk to the bear.
123800,477,187,913000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Psychologist's Office,"All right, I know there's a camera in you somewhere."
123802,477,189,920000,Seymour Skinner,SECRET ROOM,They never think to look behind the Jazz-Fest Poster.
123804,477,191,927000,Patty Bouvier,STARBUCKS-STYLE COFFEE SHOP,So it's true -- your hair committed blue-icide.
123806,477,193,933000,Marge Simpson,STARBUCKS-STYLE COFFEE SHOP,"I thought you'd be more supportive. I mean, you went gray yourselves."
123807,477,194,937000,Selma Bouvier,STARBUCKS-STYLE COFFEE SHOP,"No, we didn't. This is just smoke and ash."
123809,477,196,947000,Patty Bouvier,Coffee Shop,"So what does your husband, Vidal Baboon, think of the new look?"
123810,477,197,951000,Marge Simpson,Coffee Shop,"He loves it! He calls me his ""silver belle!"""
123811,477,198,955000,Selma Bouvier,Coffee Shop,That means he hates it. If he really liked it he'd just paw at it instead of getting all clever.

123837,477,224,1059000,Bouncer,Alleyway,"What, did he eat your candy house and push you into the oven?"
123838,477,225,1062000,Marge Simpson,Alleyway,"Odd, that's what the valet just asked me."

123847,477,234,1088000,Homer Simpson,NIGHTCLUB,Uh-oh. Usually when it gets this quiet Mr. Burns is standing behind me.
123848,477,235,1092000,C. Montgomery Burns,NIGHTCLUB,"Actually, I'm standing in front of you."
123849,477,236,1095000,C. Montgomery Burns,NIGHTCLUB,I decided to hit the local nighteries with my trusted wingman.
123850,477,237,1098000,Burns' Wingman,NIGHTCLUB,"I flew the first packet of royal mail across the Khyber Pass, dodging the poison-tipped spears of the dreaded Zim-Zam Tribe."

123861,477,248,1137000,Homer Simpson,NIGHTCLUB,"Marge, Marge, put down that broom. You've got nothing to be afraid of from them. I'm a wingman. Part of a great tradition including Val Kilmer from ""Top Gun,"" Wedge Antilles from ""Star Wars,"" and me, from now. And you know why I'm a great wingman? Because I have the confidence that comes from knowing I get to go home to you."
123863,477,250,1163000,Homer Simpson,NIGHTCLUB,And you know what else this whole experience has taught me?
123864,477,251,1166000,Marge Simpson,NIGHTCLUB,True beauty isn't about hair color?
123865,477,252,1169000,Homer Simpson,NIGHTCLUB,Probably.
123866,477,253,1170000,Marge Simpson,NIGHTCLUB,"But be honest, when I say ""beautiful woman,"" what pops into your head?"

123871,477,258,1196000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, as a feminist, virtually anything a woman does is empowering."
123872,477,259,1196000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh.
123873,477,260,1200000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Is my job creating power, empowering?"
123874,477,261,1203000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No. It's oddly dehumanizing.
123875,477,262,1206000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Dad, did you color your hair too?"
123876,477,263,1209000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Only my hairdresser knows for sure.
