85348,331,33,156000,Homer Simpson,UNCLE TYRONE'S HOUSE,I'll right-side you!
85349,331,34,159000,Marge Simpson,UNCLE TYRONE'S HOUSE,"All right, kids, you don't have to go. But I insist we do something tonight as a family. We'll play board games, put photos in an album, measure how much you've grown..."

85538,331,223,974000,Raoul,Raoul's Penthouse,"Grampa, I must confess: I am not as interested in women as my open shirt might suggest. To be frank, they disgust me."
85539,331,224,984000,Grampa Simpson,Raoul's Penthouse,Uh-oh.
85540,331,225,985000,Raoul,Raoul's Penthouse,"Yes. Now, let us enjoy one of your rambling, disjointed yet somehow erotic tales."
