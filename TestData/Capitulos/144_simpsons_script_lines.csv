31335,144,15,130000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"To celebrate our bicentennial, all twenty of you will write an essay about Jebediah Springfield, and the best eighteen will be put on file in the school library, available to anyone who requests them."
31336,144,16,140000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Can we do illustrations?
31337,144,17,142000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,No.
31340,144,19,144000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, they need volunteers to play old-timey people in the parade. Look, I can be a butter churner, a typhoid carrier... an apprentice! I think I'll be an apprentice, Marge."
31341,144,20,156000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What kind of apprentice?
31342,144,21,157000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's for my master to decide.
31343,144,22,160000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How about town crier? You'd be great at that.
31344,144,23,162000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You think so?
31345,144,24,163000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, Dad! You're a big fat loudmouth. And you can walk when you have to."
31346,144,25,167000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah! Well, if you kids believe in me that much, I'll give it my best shot."
31349,144,28,189000,Mechanical Voice,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Dangerous river crossings threatened life and limb, but helped our founding fathers save on bridge tolls."
31351,144,30,197000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Excuse me. I didn't mean to startle you, but I do love to talk Jebediah. Even when I'm drinking my chicory."
31352,144,31,204000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"I'm the curator, Hollis Hurlbut."
31353,144,32,206000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Hi, I'm Lisa Simpson. I'm here to research a report on Jebediah."
31354,144,33,210000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Oh, you're in for a treat. You know, some historians consider Jebediah Springfield a minor patriot. But I think you'll find he's easily the equal of William Dawes or even Samuel Otis."
31356,144,35,226000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Congratulations, Ned, you are our new town crier."
31358,144,37,230000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"May your shrill, nasal voice ring throughout our streets and brains."
31359,144,38,234000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Town Hall,"Thankily-dank, Mayor, I shan't disappoint. Har ye, har ye! I declare myself pickled tink about Springfield's Bicen-ciddily-ti-ten-toodily-rin-tin-tennial Day!"

31361,144,40,250000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Hear ye! Hear ye! Ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by all! Chooseth Homer Simpson and he shalt rock thy world!
31363,144,42,262000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Hall,"Good God, he is fabulous!"
31364,144,43,264000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Town Hall,He's embiggened that role with his cromulent performance!
31366,144,44,267000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Top-notch criering, I admit. But the hat and bell belong to Flanders, so no dice."
31367,144,45,273000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Town Hall,"Aw, they're just family heirlooms. That shouldn't stand in the way of Homer takin' my job and--"
31368,144,46,278000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Less chat, more hat."
31369,144,47,281000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Woo hoo! Hear ye! Hear ye! The Homer Broadcasting System is on the air! All hollering, all the time! I'm gonna make the..."
31370,144,48,292000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"You're to restrict your cryering to the parade, and selected pre-approved publicity events."
31371,144,49,296000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Okay.
31373,144,51,301000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"This case holds our most treasured exhibit... objects owned and used by Jebediah. Here's his fife, upon which he sounded the sweet note of freedom; his hatchet, with which he hacked at the chains of oppression; and his chamber pot."
31374,144,52,317000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,Wow!
31375,144,53,319000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,Excuse me. My microwave johnnycakes are ready.
31376,144,54,340000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"""The Secret Confessions of Jebediah Springfield?"" ""Know ye who read this: there is more to my life than history records."""
31377,144,55,345000,Jebediah Springfield,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Firstly, I did not tame the legendary buffalo. It was already tame. I merely shot it. Secondly, I have not always been known as Jebediah Springfield. Until 1796, I was Hans Spr端ngfeld, murderous pirate. And the half-wits of this town will never learn the truth. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha--"
31378,144,56,375000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"""--ha ha ha ha ha."" Oh my God! Our town hero is a fraud! ""I write this confession so that my infamy will live on long after my body has succumbed to my infectious diphtheria."""
31380,144,58,399000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,Heeere's johnnycakes! Is everything okay? You look a bit flushed.
31381,144,59,405000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Oh, it's just the excitement of studying Jebediah."
31382,144,60,408000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Sounds like you've come down with a serious case of ""Jebeditis."""
31383,144,61,408000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,Just when I was getting over my Chester A. Arthritis.
31384,144,62,408000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,You had arthritis?
31385,144,63,419000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Uh, no."
31387,144,65,424000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hear ye, hear ye! What's for breakfast?"
31388,144,66,427000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Toast.
31389,144,67,428000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't understand thee, Marge."
31266,144,68,430000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Ye olde toast.
31390,144,70,435000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What would you say if I told you Jebediah Springfield wasn't as great as he's cracked up to be? Look.
31391,144,71,441000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Jebediah was really a vicious pirate named Hans Spr端ngfeld. His tongue was bitten off by a Turk in a grog house fight!
31392,144,72,448000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No tongue, eh? How did he talk and eat and laugh and love?"
31393,144,73,453000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,He had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
31394,144,74,456000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, that'd do."
31395,144,75,458000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,He was one of the evillest men of the 1780's. He even tried to kill George Washington!
31396,144,76,463000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The dastard!
31397,144,77,470000,Spr端ngfeld,Simpson Home,Gimme all your money!
31398,144,78,472000,Washington,Simpson Home,Never!
31402,144,82,490000,Betsy Ross,Simpson Home,"I got the white stars you wanted, but I couldn't find any red hearts, yellow moons, or green clovers."
31403,144,83,496000,Washington,Simpson Home,"Well, I'll use it, but I'm not paying for it."
31404,144,84,500000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"The next time Hans Spr端ngfeld was seen, he had changed his name to Jebediah Springfield."
31405,144,85,506000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, honey, when my family first came to this state, they had a choice of living in Springfield or Stenchburg. You know why they chose Springfield? Because everyone knows Jebediah Springfield was a true American hero. End of story."
31406,144,86,522000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I believe you, honey."
31407,144,87,523000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You do?
31408,144,88,524000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of course I do. You're always right about this type of thing, and for once, I want in on the ground floor."
31409,144,89,530000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, thanks, Dad."
31411,144,91,532000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Ralph, A. Janey, A. And Lisa, for your essay, ""Jebediah Springfield: Superfraud,"" F."
31412,144,92,538000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,But it's all true!
31413,144,93,543000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,This is nothing but dead white male bashing from a P.C. thug. It's women like you who keep the rest of us from landing a husband.
31415,144,95,551000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, nice talking to you."
31416,144,96,559000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa?
31417,144,97,561000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Miss Hoover thought I made the whole thing up. She called me a P.C. thug.
31419,144,98,566000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've been called a greasy thug too, and it never stops hurting. So here's what we're gonna do: grease ourselves up real good, and trash that place with a baseball bat."
31420,144,99,576000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"That won't help, Dad. No one's ever going to believe me."
31421,144,100,580000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But you have proof! We could go get that confession out of Jebediah's fife.
31422,144,101,584000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We could?
31423,144,102,585000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, we can use the baseball bat to smash open the case."
31424,144,103,587000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No baseball bat.
31427,144,106,592000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Hi, Mr. Hurlbut."
31428,144,107,593000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Oh, you're back. And you've brought a friend."
31429,144,108,597000,Homer Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Town Crier. I'd like to ask you a few questions. One: where's the fife, and two: give me the fife."
31430,144,109,602000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Hey, stop! I've got nothing but respect for the office of town crier, but this is well outside your jurisdiction."
31431,144,110,608000,Homer Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Oh yeah? Well, put this in your fife and smoke it!"
31432,144,111,612000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,What the...?
31433,144,112,613000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,That's Jebediah's secret confession. It proves he was a fraud.
31435,144,114,623000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"I think, Lisa, that you've been taken in by an obvious forgery. Unfortunately, historical research is plagued by this sort of hoax. This so-called ""Confession"" is just as phony as the Howard Hughes will, the Hitler Diaries, or the Emancipation Retraction."
31436,144,115,639000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,But it explains why there's no record of Jebediah before 1795! He was Hans Spr端ngfeld until then!
31437,144,116,647000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,That's preposterous! Now get out -- you're banned from this Historical Society! You and your children and your childrens' children! For three months.
31440,144,119,666000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,I'm not going to give up. I refuse to believe that everyone refuses to believe the truth.
31442,144,121,676000,Lisa Simpson,Copy Jalopy,"I'd like 25 copies on goldenrod, 25 on canary, 25 on saffron, and 25 on paella."
31443,144,122,684000,Wiseguy,Copy Jalopy,"Okay, one hundred yellow."
31444,144,123,687000,Lisa Simpson,Copy Jalopy,"You don't have to help me with this, Dad."
31446,144,124,688000,Homer Simpson,Copy Jalopy,"Oh, sure I do. I always believe in helping the little guy, and you're the littlest guy I know."
31447,144,125,694000,Comic Book Guy,Copy Jalopy,Question: is your name Ridley Scott or James Cameron?
31448,144,126,697000,Homer Simpson,Copy Jalopy,"No, it's Homer."
31449,144,127,698000,Comic Book Guy,Copy Jalopy,"Well, then I will thank you to stop peering at my screenplay, ""Homer."" And if I see a movie where computers threaten our personal liberties, I will know that you stole my idea."
31450,144,128,706000,Homer Simpson,Copy Jalopy,I'm just waitin' for my kid.
148571,144,129,708000,Homer's Brain,Copy Jalopy,Mental note: steal his idea.
31452,144,131,713000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hi, Apu. Can I put this poster in your window?"
31453,144,132,717000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, of course you can, you little pixie! Woo! You are just as sweet as the stix which bear your name."
31454,144,133,724000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Take that down! As a semi-legal immigrant, your poster could land me in a predicament as red-hot as the candies which bear that name."
31455,144,134,735000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,He wouldn't let me put it up.
31456,144,135,737000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Okay, well, that's not gonna stop us. I know a much better way to get attention..."
31458,144,137,742000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hear ye, hear ye, my daughter has something to tell you about Jebediah Springfield."
31460,144,139,748000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Aw, the little cutie wants to do something cute... Shut up, ya bums, shut up! Go ahead, angel."
31461,144,140,757000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Jebediah Springfield was nothing more than an evil, blood-thirsty pirate who hated this town!"
31462,144,141,762000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Good God. Homer, y'know I support most any prejudice you can name, but your hero-phobia sickens me. You and your daughter ain't welcome here no more. Barney, show 'em the exit."
31463,144,142,775000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,There's an exit?
31464,144,143,777000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"""Evil blood-thirsty pirate""... Hello, Town Jubilation Committee? I got something that's going to make you a lot less jubilant."
31466,144,145,787000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Can't you understand, little girl? Jebediah was no criminal."
31467,144,146,790000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Town Hall,That's right. The reason they say he had a silver tongue is because he was such a fine speaker.
31468,144,147,796000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,That's a myth that got mixed up with the truth.
31470,144,148,798000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,You are tampering with forces you can't understand. We have major corporations sponsoring this event.
31471,144,149,804000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,I hope you know you're sponsoring a celebration for a murderous pirate!
31472,144,150,808000,Corporate Type,Springfield Town Hall,"A pirate?! Well, that's hardly the image we want for Long John Silver's!"
31473,144,151,813000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Town Hall,"Well, I see no way of settling this. I say we imprison them for the duration of our Bicentennial."
31474,144,152,819000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"There is one way: get the silver tongue. If Jebediah's who I say he is, then it should still be in his grave."
31476,144,154,826000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Springfield Town Hall,"Well, yes, but human decency prevents--"
31477,144,155,830000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"DIG HIM UP! Dig up that corpse!! If you really love Jebediah Springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong!"
31478,144,156,839000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Dig up his grave! Pull out his tongue!
31479,144,157,842000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Can't we have one meeting that doesn't end with us digging up a corpse?
31481,144,159,859000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Graveyard,"Now, Lisa, when you see there's no silver tongue in there, will you stop trying to ruin Jebediah's reputation?"
31482,144,160,866000,Lisa Simpson,Graveyard,Yes.
31483,144,161,867000,Homer Simpson,Graveyard,What do we win if the tongue is there?
31484,144,162,869000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Graveyard,Credibility.
31485,144,163,870000,Homer Simpson,Graveyard,What a jip.
31488,144,166,882000,Chief Wiggum,Graveyard,Jebediah Springfield has been replaced with a skeleton!
31489,144,167,886000,HURLBUT,Graveyard,No. That's the skeleton of Jebediah.
31490,144,168,888000,Chief Wiggum,Graveyard,"Gotcha, gotcha. Okay, ah, well, let's start looking for that silver tongue."
31491,144,169,892000,Lisa Simpson,Graveyard,"Don't forget to look in his shoes. When I lose something, sometimes it turns up in my shoes."
31492,144,170,897000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Graveyard,"Actually, if it's anywhere, it would be lodged in the sinus."
31493,144,171,901000,Chief Wiggum,Graveyard,"Alright, here goes... Forgive us, Jebediah, we mean no disrespect."
31494,144,172,909000,Chief Wiggum,Graveyard,"Well, that settles that. There is no silver tongue. Is there, Bonesy?"
31495,144,173,915000,Skull,Graveyard,"Oh, I wish, Chief! With that kinda dough, I could buy me some eyeballs! Ha ha ha!"
31496,144,174,919000,Chief Wiggum,Graveyard,"That's the spirit, Bonesy. Why don't you sing a song for the nice people?"
31497,144,175,923000,Skull,Graveyard,"Alright. ""Camptown ladies sing this song / Doo-dah / Doo-dah / Etc."""
31498,144,176,933000,Lisa Simpson,Graveyard,I was so sure...
31499,144,177,935000,Homer Simpson,Graveyard,"Hear ye, hear ye, everybody makes mistakes. Let's go home."
31500,144,178,939000,Chief Wiggum,Graveyard,"Not so fast, Simpson. This foul business was all your fault."
31501,144,179,943000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Graveyard,"By the power vested in me, I hereby strip you of your ceremonial bell--"
31502,144,180,948000,Homer Simpson,Graveyard,No! Nooooooo!!
31503,144,181,951000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Graveyard,-- and tri-corner hat.
31504,144,182,954000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Graveyard,"You will have the hat cleaned, and then return it."
31507,144,185,964000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Dad, I'm really sorry. I know how much you wanted to be in the parade."
31508,144,186,969000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, it's not your fault, honey. I'm supposed to be the responsible one. I shouldn't have let you let me get carried away."
31510,144,188,990000,Jebediah Springfield,Simpson Home,Why did you dig up the bones of the past? Why did you disturb the ghosts of history?
31511,144,189,996000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I-I-I...
31512,144,190,1000000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,General Washington?!
31513,144,191,1003000,Washington,Simpson Home,"You did some good work exposing Jebediah, Lisa. Don't stop now. There's just one piece left in the puzzle."
31514,144,192,1011000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"But I've caused so much trouble already, General Washington. I can't go on."
31515,144,193,1015000,Washington,Simpson Home,"We had quitters in the Revolution, too. We called them ""Kentuckians."" Well, I'll just have to find another little girl to be President. What's your friend Janey's number?"
31516,144,194,1025000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No! Not Janey! She'll pack the Supreme Court with boys!
31517,144,195,1030000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, let me help you, George Washington, I still want to help you."
31518,144,196,1034000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"""I want to help you, George Washington?"" Even your dreams are square."
31520,144,198,1043000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Can you open my milk, Mommy?"
31521,144,199,1046000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm not Mommy, Ralph. I'm Miss Hoover."
31523,144,201,1060000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,The missing piece of the puzzle... I've got it!
31525,144,203,1073000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,You!? What are you doing here?
31365,144,204,1075000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"I was right about Jebediah, and now I can prove it."
31527,144,205,1079000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"Oh, please, not that claptrap again. Haven't you hurt Jebediah enough with your childish tales of pirate ships and fisticuffs and a silver tongue that can't be found?"
31528,144,206,1088000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,That's because you stole it!
31529,144,207,1089000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"That's a lie! I'm an antiquarian, dammit! It's my job to seek out the truth!"
31530,144,208,1095000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"But when you found the truth, you couldn't take it! You couldn't stand that you'd devoted your life to a fraud! So you covered it up! Didn't you? Didn't you?!"
31531,144,209,1104000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,"No! No, tha... that's preposterous... I... I mean I couldn't... You... you can't..."
31532,144,210,1108000,Lisa Simpson,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,Stop it! Where's the silver tongue?!
31533,144,211,1126000,HURLBUT,HISTORICAL SOCIETY,I thought no one would ever find it.
