132426,510,33,329000,Lisa Simpson,BASEMENT,"Yes, it's the preferred term. And most scientists believe that what enters a black hole never comes out. But some think they may be a gateway to other universes."
132427,510,34,338000,Homer Simpson,BASEMENT,"Hey, can it open a pretzel bag for me? Help a brother out, B.H."

132438,510,45,369000,Marge Simpson,BASEMENT,"Okay, that's it! I'm putting a baby-gate across the black hole, and don't throw anything more into it! Uh-oh, yes, Homer."

132450,510,57,444000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, it's possible that someone may have started a business called ""Magic Craphole Waste Removal,"" but it wasn't me."
132452,510,59,469000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Stop! This is a black hole, not a lawn and leaf bag! If one more thing gets in there it could reach critical mass!"
132453,510,60,482000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I did it! I hit my first homerun!

132498,510,105,683000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But--
132499,510,106,685000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Eh-eh, school night."

132535,510,143,836000,Little Marge,MARGE'S CHILDHOOD HOME,"Um... Mr. Demon, could you come back for my sisters later?"
132536,510,144,842000,Demon,MARGE'S CHILDHOOD HOME,"Very well, you have thirty years. But when I return, Marge, I shall take your favorite child."
132537,510,145,848000,Lisa Simpson,MARGE'S CHILDHOOD HOME,I thought I was the favorite.
132538,510,146,851000,Lisa Simpson,MARGE'S CHILDHOOD HOME,Not the favorite! Not the favorite!

132552,510,159,887000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Y'know, it's really not fair you're charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover!"
132553,510,160,893000,Comic Book Guy,Simpson Home,The only way to buy that comic book for twenty-five cents is to go back to nineteen seventy-four.
