6648,54,6,101000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Pfft, the lottery. Exploiter of the poor and ignorant."
6649,54,7,105000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"You know, I heard the jackpot's up to one hundred and thirty million dollars."
6650,54,8,111000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,One hundred and thirty million dollars!
6527,54,9,113000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Did you say one hundred and thirty million dollars?
6586,54,10,115000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Yeah!
151288,54,11,116000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Wow!
6651,54,13,124000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Yes, yes, here's your lottery ticket. Thank you for knocking over my inventory. Please come again."
6652,54,14,129000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Bart, I need some lucky numbers, fast! How old are you? Uh-huh, and what's your birthday? No kidding. And what's Lisa's birthday?... What? You don't know your sister's birthday? What kind of brother are you?"
6653,54,15,140000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Strap on your bullet proof vest, Sanjay. It's time for another bank run."
6654,54,16,144000,Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"All right, but if I don't make it, promise you won't sleep with my wife."
6655,54,17,147000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,I promise nothing.
6657,54,19,150000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You'll never guess what happened Marge! Are you ready? I... have... a feeling... that we may win... the lottery!
6658,54,20,159000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But we never ever...
6659,54,21,161000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. Go-get-all-your-money..."
6660,54,22,166000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. We each play our birthday. And that's enough excitement for me.
6661,54,23,173000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You don't understand, Marge. The lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. Uh, the lottery and you."
6662,54,24,182000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, we're on a tight budget here. Promise me you won't get carried away."
6663,54,25,186000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, Money... I mean Honey. Ooooh! Here comes a news report about the lottery!"
6664,54,26,191000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, down in front."
6665,54,27,192000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,The whole state is suddenly in the grip of lottery fever. And Springfield is no exception.
6667,54,29,199000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Library,"In fact, every copy of Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" has been checked out from the Springfield Public Library."
6669,54,31,205000,Kent Brockman,Newsroom,"Of course, the book does not contain any hints on how to win the lottery. It is, rather, a chilling tale of conformity gone mad."
6671,54,33,214000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School,"But there's already one big winner. Our state's school system, which gets fully half the profits from the lottery."
6674,54,34,219000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Just think what we can buy with that money. History books that know how the Korean War came out. Math books that don't have that Base six crap in them.
6675,54,35,227000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"And a state of the art detention hall, where children are held in place with magnets."
6676,54,36,232000,Teacher #1,Springfield Elementary School,Magnets. Always with the magnets.
6678,54,38,240000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've never been so sure of anything in my life. I am going to win this lottery.
6679,54,39,247000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one."
6680,54,40,251000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Correction. Three hundred and eighty million to fifty. So what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?"
6681,54,41,257000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Put it in the bank.
6682,54,42,258000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Give it to the poor.
6683,54,43,260000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What do kids know about spending money?
6684,54,44,262000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"What are you gonna do, Homer?"
6685,54,45,263000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmm...
6686,54,46,266000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"Hey Homer, what'd you do? Get a haircut or something?"
6687,54,47,270000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look closer, Lenny!"
6688,54,48,272000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,Oh I know what it is. You're the biggest man in the world now. And you're covered in gold.
6689,54,49,278000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fourteen carat gold!
6691,54,51,279000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Take a hike boss, I'm running things now."
6692,54,52,283000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,All hail king Homer!
6695,54,55,300000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,We now take you to the drawing live -- I hope you've got your tickets. I've got mine.
6697,54,57,304000,Lou,Springfield Police Station,"They're about to start, Chief."
6698,54,58,306000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"No, you've got the wrong number. This is nine one two."
6700,54,60,311000,Krusty the Clown,The Krusty the Clown Show,"We'll be with you in a minute, kids. This could be our ticket outta here, Mel."
6702,54,62,317000,Lottery Announcer,Springfield,I will now draw the first winning number.
6704,54,64,321000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've got so many tickets I can't lose!
6705,54,65,325000,Lottery Announcer,Simpson Home,The first number is... seventeen.
6672,54,67,328000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You can still win some money if you have five out of six.
6673,54,68,330000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoo-hoo!
6706,54,69,332000,Lottery Announcer,Simpson Home,And the second number is... three.
6707,54,70,334000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Receipts, ugh."
6708,54,71,336000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I knew we wouldn't win."
6709,54,72,338000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well why didn't you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret??? If you were seventeen, we'd be rich! But no! You had to be ""10."""
6710,54,73,350000,Lottery Announcer,Simpson Home,And the final number is... forty-nine.
6711,54,74,353000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,Thirty-eight... forty-nine... Ohmigod! I won! I won!
6712,54,75,364000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Recapping our day's top story -- the winner of today's state lottery is me, Kent Brockman! Can we get a shot of me?"
6713,54,76,372000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,There you go.
6714,54,77,373000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,In other news... uh... a tragic mix-up today in Cleveland... many people killed... uh... Goodbye.
6715,54,78,386000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh well... we lost the money, but at least we've still got each other."
6716,54,79,390000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, the dog's dead."
6718,54,81,399000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Grampa, he's not dead!"
6719,54,82,401000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not."
6720,54,83,404000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not fair to toy with people's emotions like that.
6721,54,84,407000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,He is dead! I'll get a shovel.
6722,54,85,410000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, he's not dead, but he is awfully sick."
6723,54,86,413000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, sure! The old man's off his rocker. If Grampa says he's dead he must be alive."
6724,54,87,420000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,He is alive. He's wagging his tail.
6725,54,88,422000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,That don't mean nothin'! Dogs wag their tails for hours after they die. I'm tired of this conversation. Let's talk about something else. I'm going home.
6728,54,91,437000,Vet,Animal Hospital,Clear! Ugh... Clear!
6729,54,92,440000,Nurse,Animal Hospital,Doctor... he's gone.
6730,54,93,442000,Vet,Animal Hospital,This is the part of the job I hate.
6731,54,94,448000,Homer Simpson,Animal Hospital,"Hey, you did the best you could."
6732,54,95,450000,Vet,Animal Hospital,"I love animals. I spend my life saving them and they can't thank me. Well... the parrots can -- but, anyway let's see what's wrong with this little fella."
6733,54,96,463000,Vet,Animal Hospital,I'm afraid that your dog has a twisted stomach. He needs an operation to correct it or he'll die.
6735,54,97,467000,Marge Simpson,Animal Hospital,"Hmm, how much will it cost?"
6736,54,98,473000,Vet,Animal Hospital,Seven hundred and fifty dollars.
6737,54,99,475000,Marge Simpson,Animal Hospital,Oh dear!
6738,54,100,477000,Vet,Animal Hospital,This is never an easy decision. It's an awful lot of money.
6739,54,101,479000,Homer Simpson,Animal Hospital,Well... I guess we'll have to talk it over.
6740,54,102,482000,Bart Simpson,Animal Hospital,Talk what over? What's there to talk about?
6741,54,103,484000,Bart Simpson,Animal Hospital,What are we going to talk over?
6742,54,104,487000,Krusty the Clown,Animal Hospital,Mr. Teeny needs a refill of his nicotine gum.
6744,54,106,489000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,I can't help but notice we're leaving the hospital. When's the dog going to get his operation?
6745,54,107,494000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven."
6747,54,109,502000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"In Doggie Heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and..."
6748,54,110,511000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Is there a Doggie Hell?
6749,54,111,515000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... of course. There couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
6750,54,112,519000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Who's in there?
6751,54,113,520000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester.
6752,54,114,524000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Checkers.
6753,54,115,526000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy.
6754,54,116,532000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey! Wait a minute, does this have anything to do with Santa's Little Helper?"
6755,54,117,535000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, honey. Seven-hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money. We really can't afford this operation."
6756,54,118,542000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're gonna just let him die?
6757,54,119,543000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I know you're upset --
6758,54,120,545000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Darn right I'm upset!
6759,54,121,546000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, watch your language. Oh. You did. Sorry."
6760,54,122,550000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,We are not going to let our dog die! And that's IT! Lousy dog-killing sonsa...
6761,54,123,557000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...
6762,54,124,567000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, come on! I'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. Marge, make him stop."
6764,54,125,577000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right. All right. We'll find a way. Lousy manipulative dog.
6766,54,127,581000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.
6767,54,128,584000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Please, do go on..."
6768,54,129,586000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...
6769,54,130,592000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Oh, please, continue..."
6770,54,131,594000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,I thought maybe you...
6771,54,132,596000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Oh. Well, thanks for your time."
6772,54,133,601000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"What makes a man endanger his job, and yes, even his life, by asking me for money?"
6773,54,134,606000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"People like dogs, Mr. Burns."
6774,54,135,609000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?"
6775,54,136,619000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Uh... if YOU did it, sir?..."
6776,54,137,621000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Exactly! You'd be fit to be tied! Dogs!
6778,54,139,626000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
6779,54,140,626000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What?
6780,54,141,628000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You are NOT going to perform that operation yourself.
6781,54,142,630000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.
6782,54,143,642000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe you're right, Marge."
6783,54,144,647000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I've found a way we can pay for the operation.
6784,54,145,650000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam?"
6785,54,146,652000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No. I'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices. Homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while."
6786,54,147,663000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, from now on you'll have to get your hair cut for free at Springfield Barber College."
6787,54,148,668000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No problemo.
6788,54,149,669000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm going to give up buying my weekly lottery ticket, and I found a way to stretch the food budget. Fried chicken night will now be organ meat night. Ham night will be Spam night. And porkchop night..."
6790,54,151,681000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,... will now be chub night.
6791,54,152,682000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Chub? I don't even know what that is!
6792,54,153,684000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, I'm afraid we'll have to stop getting you those volumes of Encyclopedia Generica from the grocery store."
6793,54,154,691000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"But, Mom, next week is volume four: Copernicus through Elephantiasis."
6794,54,155,695000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"We all have to make sacrifices, dear. Maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer..."
6795,54,156,702000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats..."
6796,54,157,710000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think you've thought this through.
6798,54,159,718000,Nurse,Animal Hospital,"Good news, Mr. Danielson, we saved your gamecock. But I'm afraid he'll never fight again."
6799,54,160,723000,Mr. Danielson,Animal Hospital,That's what you think. He'll fight and he'll win!
6800,54,161,730000,Vet,Animal Hospital,Clamp. Wipe... No! No!
6801,54,162,739000,God,Animal Hospital,"Come to the light, boy. Come into the light. Come on now. There's a good boy. Come on. Come on."
6802,54,163,762000,Nurse,Animal Hospital,Um... Simpson?
6803,54,164,771000,Vet,Animal Hospital,It's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of dental school.
6805,54,166,775000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lousy chub night. Hey, how come he gets meat and we don't?"
6806,54,167,782000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You wouldn't want what he's eating. It's mostly just snouts and entrails.
6807,54,168,786000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Mmm... snouts.
6808,54,169,789000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Yes, I'm back. Kent Brockman is not the kind of a man who would leave a $500,000 a year job just because he won a lottery. Hey, I'm a journalist."
6809,54,170,798000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy."
6810,54,171,803000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's that?
6811,54,172,805000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A dinosaur.
6812,54,173,807000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Of course I'm not the only one who benefited from last week's big payoff. Our state's schools got their share too. Here, lottery officials present Springfield Elementary with a brand new eraser."
6813,54,174,816000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,"One eraser? Oh, I'm used to my government betraying me. I was in Nam. I served for three --"
6814,54,175,822000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"And speaking of lotteries, here are the winning numbers for this week's forty-thousand dollar ""jackpot"": 3 - 6 - 17 - 18 - 22 and 29."
6815,54,176,832000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh no! Those are my numbers! If it wasn't for that dog, I would've won!"
6817,54,178,839000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Class, for tomorrow, I want you to write a report on Copernicus."
6819,54,181,845000,Sadistic Barfly,Moe's Tavern,"C'mon boozehound! You want the twenty five cents, don't you? Keep singin'!"
6820,54,182,850000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,BUFFALO GALS WON'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT... OH BUFFALO GALS...
6821,54,183,856000,Young Barfly,Moe's Tavern,Who's that old rummy?
6822,54,184,857000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Before his dog got sick, that ""old rummy"" used to be my best customer."
6823,54,185,862000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,AND DANCE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOONNNNNNNN!
6824,54,186,866000,Sadistic Barfly,Moe's Tavern,"Go get it, pal."
6825,54,187,868000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,My quarter!!!
6827,54,189,870000,Trainee,Springfield Barber College,"Okay, I'll just even this out and."
6828,54,190,874000,Trainee,Springfield Barber College,Mr. Laswell! I've done it again.
6830,54,192,879000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know you can't understand me, but you're a lousy dog and I hate you."
6831,54,193,885000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Not now.
6832,54,194,887000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Can't you see I'm reading a third-rate biography of Copernicus I found at the bus station?
6833,54,195,893000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Dumb dog.
6834,54,196,900000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, did you close the gate?"
6835,54,197,902000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes.
6836,54,198,906000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, you mean tonight."
6837,54,199,909000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The dog will get out!
6838,54,200,911000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! Close the gate.
6839,54,201,913000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa! Close the gate.
6840,54,202,917000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Close the gate, Maggie."
6841,54,203,939000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Here boy!
6843,54,205,941000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Here Santa's Little Helper!
6844,54,206,945000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's all my fault. I called him a dumb dog.
6845,54,207,949000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait! There he is. No... that's a horse.
6848,54,210,1008000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Have you found a picture yet?
6849,54,211,1010000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Not one that I want the public to see.
6851,54,213,1017000,Ned Flanders,Burns Manor,... So recycling is our way of giving Mother Earth a great big hug.
6852,54,214,1024000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Yes, well, it does sound like fun. I can't wait to start pawing through my garbage like some starving raccoon."
6854,54,215,1032000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Release the hounds. Well, neighbor I see you've got your running shoes on. That's a good thing."
6855,54,216,1047000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,What's wrong with Crippler?
6856,54,217,1048000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"He's getting on, sir. He's been here since the late sixties."
6857,54,218,1052000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Ah yes, I'll never forget the day he bagged his first hippie. That young man didn't think it was too ""groovy."""
6859,54,220,1062000,C. Montgomery Burns,Dog Pound,I'm looking for something in an attack dog. One who likes the sweet gamy tang of human flesh.
