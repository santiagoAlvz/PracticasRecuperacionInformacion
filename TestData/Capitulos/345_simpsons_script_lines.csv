89240,345,1,33000,Bart Simpson,Sidewalk,"Some sucker will think he's getting beer, but he's really gonna get a face full of melon!"
89185,345,2,39000,Milhouse Van Houten,Sidewalk,Seedless melon!
89241,345,3,42000,Bart Simpson,Sidewalk,Shhh. Don't ruin the moment.
89242,345,4,46000,Barney Gumble,Sidewalk,"Oh boy, free beer!"
89243,345,5,48000,Milhouse Van Houten,Sidewalk,Oh man!
89244,345,6,49000,Barney Gumble,Sidewalk,"Easy, Barney... easy..."
89245,345,7,53000,Barney Gumble,Sidewalk,Remember the twelve steps.
89246,345,8,55000,Barney Gumble,Sidewalk,One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-ten-eleven-twelve!
89247,345,9,62000,Barney Gumble,Sidewalk,"Nice try, boys. Now, as the Roadrunner said to the Coyote, ""meep meep""!"
89248,345,10,69000,Bart Simpson,Sidewalk,Everyone in town is wise to us. We need someone new we can prank.
89249,345,11,80000,Bart Simpson,Sidewalk,Sweet. Fresh meat.
89250,345,12,82000,Milhouse Van Houten,Sidewalk,Meat's not sweet. It's savory.
89251,345,13,85000,Tourist,Sidewalk,"Hi, bean sprouts! The name's Howell Huser. I travel the country gawkin' and talkin', and I was hopin' to take in your town."
89252,345,14,94000,Bart Simpson,Sidewalk,We can show you around. If you don't mind a heapin' helpin' of local color.
89253,345,15,99000,HOWELL HUSER,Sidewalk,Why my favorite color is local!
89254,345,16,102000,HOWELL HUSER,Sidewalk,"Ooh, watermelon. Want to plant the seeds?"
89255,345,17,105000,Milhouse Van Houten,Sidewalk,It's seedless.
89258,345,20,110000,HOWELL HUSER,Lake,Radioactivity?
89259,345,21,112000,Bart Simpson,Lake,That means it's a place where we do radio... activities.
89260,345,22,121000,HOWELL HUSER,Lake,I'm happy to be exposed to that kind of radioactivity.
89261,345,23,127000,Milhouse Van Houten,Lake,"Ya know, the fish here are so friendly, you can walk right up and feed 'em."
89262,345,24,131000,HOWELL HUSER,Lake,Hmm...
89263,345,25,135000,HOWELL HUSER,Lake,"Well howdy, little feller."
89264,345,26,139000,HOWELL HUSER,Lake,Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh! I can't wait till this is over! Ow!
89266,345,28,147000,HOWELL HUSER,Springfield Street,I was thinking maybe we could visit the hospital now.
89267,345,29,151000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Street,Perhaps a stick of gum will lighten your mood.
89268,345,30,154000,HOWELL HUSER,Springfield Street,It always has in the past.
89269,345,31,159000,HOWELL HUSER,Springfield Street,Finger pain?! I thought I had gum comin'! That tears it!
89270,345,32,165000,HOWELL HUSER,Springfield Street,"I've been smilin' for forty-seven years, and you two broke my streak!"
89271,345,33,171000,HOWELL HUSER,Springfield Street,Shame on you. And shame on you.
89272,345,34,173000,HOWELL HUSER,Springfield Street,And shame on your whole ill-mannered town!
89273,345,35,177000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Street,"Hey, that guy's shaming us."
89274,345,36,180000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Street,My self-esteem sure didn't need that!
89275,345,37,183000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Street,Loser!
89276,345,38,188000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Street,"Yeah, get out, shamey!"
89277,345,39,190000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,I don't think we'll be hearing from him again.
89279,345,41,196000,Female Host,Simpson Home,"So, kitchen wizard. I understand you have a book coming out."
89280,345,42,199000,Kitchen Wizard,Simpson Home,"Yes, it's about Winston Churchill's life between the wars."
89281,345,43,202000,Female Host,Simpson Home,"Up next on the Soft News Network, let's hear from our own wide-eyed wanderer, Howell Huser."
89282,345,44,209000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh.
89283,345,45,210000,HOWELL HUSER,Simpson Home,"I've ambled and rambled across this country, and never found a town I didn't like... till now."
89284,345,46,210000,HOWELL HUSER,Simpson Home,"And the name of that town, is Springfield."
89286,345,48,223000,HOWELL HUSER,Simpson Home,"I was attacked, humiliated, and fed misleading gum. I give Springfield the lowest rating I've ever given a city: a six out of ten."
89288,345,50,234000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I hope this bad publicity doesn't affect tourism.
89289,345,51,238000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Eh, who needs tourists? They never buy my maps to stars' homes, anyway."
89290,345,52,248000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Have you read them all? Okay, good."
89293,345,55,257000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"We need to bring...tourism back to Springfield. As usual, I will open the floor to all crazy ideas that jump to people's minds."
89294,345,56,265000,Barney Gumble,Springfield Town Hall,Stronger beer! / Gladiator fights! / Poetry slam! / Giant rats!
89295,345,57,270000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,I have a real suggestion.
89296,345,58,272000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Springfield Town Hall,Y'arrr.
89297,345,59,275000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Why don't we legalize same-sex marriage? We can attract a growing segment of the marriage market, and strike a blow for civil rights."
89298,345,60,283000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"Yeah, them gay guys got lots of disposable income. I can serve fancy drinks and charge ten bucks a pop. What's in a martini?"
89299,345,61,291000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Town Hall,Gin and vermouth.
89300,345,62,293000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,And that makes a what?
89301,345,63,294000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Town Hall,A martini.
89302,345,64,295000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,Never heard of it. But I'm still in favor of that same-sex marriage deal.
89303,345,65,299000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Then it's settled. We'll legalize gay money -- I mean uh gay marriage!
89304,345,66,305000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Town Hall,I propose we also legalize gay funerals -- starting with this guy.
89305,345,67,310000,Martin Prince,Springfield Town Hall,I'm not gay. I'm nothing yet!
89306,345,68,313000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"Okay, now let's say I put a Lean Cuisine in a blender and I pour some beer on it. What do you call that?"
89307,345,69,319000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Town Hall,A Lean Cuisini?
89308,345,70,319000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,Wrong.
89309,345,71,325000,Calypso Singer,Springfield Town Hall,"WHEN MY MAN AND I SHOPPED FOR WEDDING GOWNS / WE WERE MOCKED AND SHUNNED AND PUSHED AROUND / BUT YESTERDAY, WE FOUND A PLACE TO BE GAY / I'M GOING TO MARRY MY HARRY IN SPRINGFIELD TOWN..."
89310,345,72,337000,Calypso Chorus,Springfield Town Hall,GAY-O / IT'S OKAAAAY-O / TIE THE KNOT AND SPEND ALL YOUR DOUGH. / GAY-O / COME STAAAAY-O / VISIT OUR WEBSITE FOR FURTHER IN-FO.
89311,345,73,350000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Springfield -- a place where everyone can marry. Even dudes. We're just off route two oh two. Do not take the Jefferson Avenue Exit. For God's sake, do not take that exit."
89314,345,76,370000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"While I have no opinion for or against your sinful lifestyles, I cannot marry two people of the same sex any more than I can put a hamburger on a hot dog bun. Now go back to working behind the scenes in every facet of entertainment!"
89315,345,77,386000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Excuse me, Reverend."
89316,345,78,387000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Yes.
89317,345,79,389000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"As long as two people love each other, I don't think God cares whether they both have the same hoo-hoo or ha-ha."
89318,345,80,395000,Nelson Muntz,First Church of Springfield,Haw-haw!
89319,345,81,397000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,The Bible forbids same-sex relations.
89320,345,82,401000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Which book?
89321,345,83,402000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Which book? The Bible!
89322,345,84,403000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,But Reverend... Scriptural scholars disagree on the significance for Christians of many of the Old Testament's proscriptions.
89323,345,85,405000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Jesus' teachings stressed inclusiveness and compassion...
89324,345,86,419000,Mayor Joe Quimby,First Church of Springfield,Lovejoy's an idiot -- his church is giving up hot gobs of gay green. He could get two hundred bucks a couple.
89325,345,87,426000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Two hundred bucks a couple, eh?"
89326,345,88,434000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Hey, I gotta get in on this! These people have rights! The right to buy me a sixty-two inch TV!"
89328,345,90,447000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now begins the long and spiritual journey to becoming an ordained minister.
89329,345,91,453000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Let's see, ""Name"" ""Homer Simpson""."
89330,345,92,456000,Computer Voice,Simpson Home,You are now an ordained minister.
89331,345,93,464000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now to answer all the pop-ups. Ooh, a talking moose wants my credit card number. That's only fair."
89334,345,96,487000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,"...And do you, Julio, take Thad to be your lawful wedded life partner, in Massachusetts and Vermont... maybe Canada... stay outta Texas... as long as you both are gay?"
89335,345,97,498000,Julio,GARAGE,I do.
89336,345,98,500000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,It brings me great joy to unite two such loving people. Photo mouse pads for sale out back.
89338,345,100,510000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, what's next? Adam and Steve or Madam and Eve?"
89339,345,101,513000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you married every gay couple in town."
89340,345,102,516000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, what can I say? I love love."
89341,345,103,518000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn."
89342,345,104,521000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hm... where's Lenny and Carl?
89343,345,105,523000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't you push them! They've gotta work that out for themselves.
89344,345,106,527000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But I'm only two hundred dollars short of fourteen thousand, eight hundred dollars."
89345,345,107,531000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, what about people of the opposite sex who want to get married?"
89346,345,108,535000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Opposite? Yuck!!
89347,345,109,536000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I mean a man and a woman.
89348,345,110,539000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm. Well, maybe marriage isn't just for gays. What's that thing called when a guy is gay for a girl?"
89349,345,111,545000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Straight.
89350,345,112,546000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, look at me. I'm straight as a one dollar bill. La de da. Ooh."
89352,345,114,562000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Do you Cletus take Brandine to be...
89353,345,115,565000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Wait a minute! Are you two brother and sister?
89354,345,116,568000,Brandine Del Roy,Simpson Garage,We's all kinda things!
89356,345,117,573000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Garage,A new epidemic is raging through Springfield -- and this one didn't start with Krustyburger's Whatchamacarcass Sandwich. I'm talking about an outbreak of marriage fever!
89357,345,118,583000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Garage,Reverend Simpson...
89358,345,119,583000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Please, Kent. Call me Your Holiness."
89359,345,120,586000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Garage,"I can't. I just can't. Homer, have we started down a slippery slope, where marriage becomes so meaningless that anyone could marry anything?"
89360,345,121,594000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Oh Kent, not anything. It has to exist. Or does it?"
89361,345,122,600000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Garage,"Well, call me old fashioned, but I believe that marriage described in the Bible--"
89362,345,123,604000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"If you love the Bible so much, why don't you marry it? In fact, I now pronounce you and the Bible man and wife. And you're the wife. You owe me two hundred bucks."
89363,345,124,615000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Garage,"Homer, your impulsive marriages are gonna lead to a lot of divorces."
89364,345,125,618000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Which will lead to a lot more impulsive marriages. Which will put more green in the blue. The blue being my pants.
89365,345,126,627000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Garage,"I'm sorry, Homer. But I'm gonna have to leave you hanging there."
89366,345,127,630000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Garage,If I may say a word.
89367,345,128,631000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Garage,"Why, we're joined live now by Krusty the clown. Krusty?"
89368,345,129,635000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Garage,I want to clear up a misconception about the Whatchamacarcass Sandwich. I used non-diseased meat from diseased animals. Everyone does it.
89370,345,131,648000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Homie, I'm so proud of you. You stood up for people's right to express love in its most perfect form, a binding legal contract."
89371,345,132,660000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Hey Saturated Fats, I came to ask you a favor."
89372,345,133,663000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lemme get my belt sander. Maybe I can grind the ugly off your face.
89373,345,134,666000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,Very funny.
89374,345,135,666000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I wasn't joking.
89375,345,136,670000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"I'm getting married, and I need you to perform the ceremony."
89376,345,137,673000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're getting married?! Patty, that's wonderful!"
89377,345,138,677000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So tell, tell. Who's the lucky man? What does he do? Let me guess: does he work in Customer Support?"
89378,345,139,684000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,You can guess all night and never get it. Her name's Veronica.
89355,345,140,690000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But Veronica's a girl's name. Did you know that?
89379,345,141,694000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,I'm marrying a woman. I'm... I'm gay.
89380,345,142,701000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"You're not disappointed, are you?"
89381,345,143,702000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh no. No no. No. I'm just... surprised.
89382,345,144,707000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, big surprise. Hey Marge, here's another bomb: I like beer."
89383,345,145,718000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,So Patty. You're a woman who likes women. I guess that fear I always had of you stealing Homer away is unfounded.
89385,345,147,727000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I'd be a lot more worried about me leaving you for a sausage patty than your sister Patty."
89387,345,149,734000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Next time it'll be your eye. Marge, did you really think I was straight?"
89388,345,150,738000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I guess I could have seen the signs."
89389,345,151,759000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"You could see it from space, Marge. This isn't a problem for you, is it?"
89390,345,152,764000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh no. Oh no. Why would it be? I love you and I love gay marriage, so I'd be a super-hypocrite if I didn't love your gay marriage. Right?"
89391,345,153,773000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now Patty, here's a veil I picked out just for you."
89392,345,154,779000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,It smells like cheeseburgers.
89393,345,155,781000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Give it back!
89394,345,156,783000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why are we dressed as Sunday Best Simpsons for dinner with Aunt Patty?
89395,345,157,787000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Because she's bringing over someone very special. Her fiancée.
89396,345,158,793000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Is this one of those reality deals where a guy gets a million bucks for marrying Aunt Patty? But they have to honeymoon in a box full of snakes?
89397,345,159,800000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son, that's the stupidest idea I ever heard. And I know exactly who would pay top dollar for it."
89398,345,160,807000,Woman,Simpson Home,"You've reached Fox. If you're pitching a show where gold-digging skanks get what's coming to them, press one. If you're pitching a rip-off of another network's reality show, press two."
89399,345,161,818000,Woman,Simpson Home,Please stay on the line. Your half-baked ideas are all we've got.
89400,345,162,822000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Actually your aunt is marrying a very lucky... woman.
89401,345,163,828000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought you said Aunt Patty was just waiting for the right man.
89402,345,164,832000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"As opposed to you, who grabbed the first blimp that floated by."
89403,345,165,835000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Correction. The first blimp that got her pregnant.
89404,345,166,839000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Seriously Dad, I'm worried. You should go on a diet."
89405,345,167,842000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little...
89406,345,168,846000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Save my place.
89407,345,169,853000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"This is my fiancée, Veronica."
89408,345,170,855000,Veronica,Simpson Home,It's a pleasure to meet you all.
89409,345,171,857000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So Veronica, what do you do?"
89410,345,172,860000,Veronica,Simpson Home,I'm a pro golfer.
89411,345,173,861000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No surprises there.
89412,345,174,864000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aunt Patty, where did you two meet? Alternative book store? Ethiopian restaurant?"
89413,345,175,869000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,It was so romantic -- like a scene from a Hollywood movie...
89414,345,176,873000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, ""Bride of the Monster."""
89416,345,178,877000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,I was at the LPGA Ritz Bitz Celebrity Pro-Am...
89418,345,180,882000,Krusty the Clown,Golf Course,"Lady golfers? I thought we played this stupid game to get away from the women. With the yak, yak, yak and the spend, spend, spend! Am I right?"
89420,345,182,891000,Veronica,Golf Course,"Hey, clown. Watch out for this lady driver."
89421,345,183,897000,Veronica,Golf Course,Are you all right?
89422,345,184,899000,Patty Bouvier,Golf Course,Never better.
89423,345,185,907000,Veronica,Golf Course,I'll bet that's how angels cough.
89424,345,186,910000,Patty Bouvier,Golf Course,I've been wearing that three wood ever since.
89425,345,187,916000,Marge Simpson,Golf Course,Whoa! Save something for your wedding night.
89426,345,188,919000,Veronica,Golf Course,"Oh, we're saving everything for our wedding night."
89427,345,189,922000,Patty Bouvier,Golf Course,That's what Mom would want.
89428,345,190,924000,Marge Simpson,Golf Course,I don't think it's exactly what Mom would want.
89429,345,191,927000,Patty Bouvier,Golf Course,"Marge, are you sure you're okay with this?"
89430,345,192,930000,Marge Simpson,Golf Course,Of course. Everyone should do whatever they want. Take a bear to church! Read a book with your feet! Change your name to Gooble-Glop!
89431,345,193,937000,Patty Bouvier,Golf Course,"Oh, I get it. You act all liberal, but you can't handle it when your sister finds love in her own locker room."
89432,345,194,947000,Patty Bouvier,Golf Course,"Marge, if you can find it in your heart to accept me for who I am, I would love to see you at the ceremony. If not, I'll see you at Homer's funeral...which should be pretty soon."
89433,345,195,961000,Homer Simpson,Golf Course,Got him! Uh-oh.
89435,345,197,967000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,What am I not invited to this time?
89436,345,198,969000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Gay wedding. But I can get you in.
89437,345,199,971000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,You can? Is there an open bar?
89438,345,200,973000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, cash."
89439,345,201,975000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I say this whole thing is against nature!"
89440,345,202,979000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"So, wanna do a jigsaw puzzle tonight?"
89441,345,203,982000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Selma, I'm getting married in an hour."
89442,345,204,984000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"I know, I know. I'm just having trouble getting used to the idea of being alone."
89443,345,205,989000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,Don't lay that on me. You got married three times.
89444,345,206,993000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Actually, four. You see, last week..."
89445,345,207,997000,Disco Stu,Simpson Home,Disco Stu just got an annulment from John Paul Two. Boogie down!
89446,345,208,1003000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Selma, we'll always be there for each other. I don't know about Marge, though. If she doesn't show up today...I have no non-identical sister!"
89447,345,209,1016000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Lord, please help me say the right words this afternoon, as I consecrate another gay union that angers you so."
89448,345,210,1023000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And please let thy Holy Spirit open the heart of my wife. Amen.
89449,345,211,1028000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I just can't believe my sister would keep me in the dark all these years, then expect complete acceptance on the day she gets married."
89450,345,212,1040000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You handsome devil. Someday they'll let you and me get married! Can you imagine the children?
89451,345,213,1049000,Homers,Simpson Home,"I love you, Homer... I love you too, Homer... Oh, Homer."
89454,345,216,1065000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The toilet seat's up!
89455,345,217,1066000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But that wouldn't happen unless...
89456,345,218,1070000,Veronica,Simpson Home,DUDE LOOKS LIKE A LADY... DUDE LOOKS LIKE A LADY...
89457,345,219,1077000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,She's a man! Looks like Patty's gonna get something she didn't register for.
89460,345,222,1095000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Queerly beloved, we're here to join Veronica and Patty in matrimony. But the news isn't all good. They've written their own vows. Patty?"
89461,345,223,1105000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Garage,"Veronica, in you I have found a soul mate. You are the perfect woman for me: truthful, honest, hiding nothing."
89463,345,224,1114000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Garage,At last I have found the yin to my yin.
89464,345,225,1120000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"If anyone knows a reason why these two should not be joined, let them speak now... or forever hold their peace."
89465,345,226,1126000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Garage,No! I can't let this happen!
89466,345,227,1128000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Garage,I knew it! You think everyone in the world should have a big dumb man like you!
89467,345,228,1133000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"People please, can we wrap this up? It's gonna rain and I've gotta get the bikes in here."
89469,345,230,1137000,Marge Simpson,GARAGE,"Patty, it's not what you think. Veronica is a man!"
89471,345,232,1146000,Sideshow Mel,GARAGE,Look at the size of that Adam's apple!
89472,345,233,1149000,Patty Bouvier,GARAGE,"Veronica, how could you?"
89473,345,234,1152000,Veronica,GARAGE,"Patty, I love you. But long before we met, I disguised myself as a woman, and lied my way onto the LPGA tour."
89474,345,235,1159000,Patty Bouvier,GARAGE,"I can see why you lied to other golfers, caddies, fans and officials, but how could you lie to me and the sponsors?"
89475,345,236,1167000,Veronica,GARAGE,"Because you fell in love with me as a woman, and I didn't want to lose you. But now I'm asking you, not as Veronica, but as the man I am: Leslie Robin Swisher."
89476,345,237,1177000,Leslie,GARAGE,"Patty, will you marry the real me?"
89477,345,238,1184000,Patty Bouvier,GARAGE,"Hell no, I like girls!"
89478,345,239,1193000,Patty Bouvier,GARAGE,"Marge, thank you for accepting me for who I am."
89479,345,240,1196000,Marge Simpson,GARAGE,"Well, I've learned a lesson. Just because you're a lesbian, it doesn't make you less of a bein'."
89480,345,241,1203000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,"Patty, I admire your decision. It takes courage to follow your heart and walk out on a non-refundable wedding ceremony. So I'm gonna waive the rose petal removal fee and prorate the cake-handling surcharge."
89481,345,242,1216000,Patty Bouvier,GARAGE,Thanks.
89482,345,243,1218000,Lisa Simpson,GARAGE,"Well, that's the end of Dad's wedding business."
89483,345,244,1220000,Bart Simpson,GARAGE,Why?
89484,345,245,1222000,Patty Bouvier,GARAGE,"Hey, twisted sister. You still have that jigsaw puzzle?"
89485,345,246,1226000,Selma Bouvier,GARAGE,There never was a jigsaw puzzle. I was trying to make you jealous.
89486,345,247,1230000,Patty Bouvier,GARAGE,"Hey, wanna go to the airport and leave a bag unattended?"
89487,345,248,1233000,Selma Bouvier,GARAGE,It is a good way to meet security personnel. Let's go.
89462,345,252,1252000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Next!
89491,345,253,1254000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Simpson Garage,Hurry! Before she changes her mind!
