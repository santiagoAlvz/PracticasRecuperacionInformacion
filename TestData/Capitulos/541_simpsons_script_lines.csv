140700,541,24,176000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Really? Don't you ever look up at the sky?
140701,541,25,186000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I always wondered what that was.
140702,541,26,189000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, I'm concerned about your sudden generosity. The doctor said to bring you in right away if you display kindness or warmth."

140704,541,28,201000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"As of now, each of those nuclear nitwits is wearing a video camera -- with a direct feed to me."

140710,541,33,226000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Each of these buttons represent an employee. When I press it, he or she dies."
140711,541,34,236000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What's wrong with this thing?
140713,541,36,261000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, remember kids, the school says you must have a valentine card for everyone in your class."
140714,541,37,268000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How does this mean anything when everyone's forced to do it?
140715,541,38,271000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What did I say about pointing out the meaninglessness of things?
140716,541,39,275000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Not to.
140717,541,40,277000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, no way I'm giving a valentine to Nelson. He's a bully, and I do not love him."

140719,541,42,283000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's because Jesus knows one day he gets to look his enemies in the eye and say: ""It was me who sent you to Hell."""
140720,541,43,283000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, your school requires you to give everyone a Valentine card in an envelope with a fun sticker. Your teacher put out an email alert... with a video attachment."
140721,541,44,303000,Will Lyman,Simpson Home,"Welcome to Firstline. Tonight: Valentine's Day: Always A Massacre."" At this school, children may give valentines to whomever they choose. Danny is unpopular, due to rumors he sleeps in the raw with his ma and his pa."
140722,541,45,319000,Will Lyman,Simpson Home,"Human young are born with the ability to count valentines, and Danny realizes he's been snubbed."
140723,541,46,325000,Anonymous Expert,Simpson Home,"Past generations of children were used to rejection. But today's kids, raised in a climate of video games and instant messaging, are fragile weirdoes."
140724,541,47,335000,Will Lyman,Simpson Home,"On February fifteenth, two a.m., after checking the mailbox one last time, Danny nearly died from an overdose of little candy hearts."

140729,541,52,372000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's so funny?
140730,541,53,374000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.
140731,541,54,380000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Look at these jerks.
140732,541,55,397000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't understand what's so great about these state of the art, solar-powered, computo-glasses."
140733,541,56,402000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll let you try them on, right after I decide if these videos are ""Funny Or Die"". Funny, funny, die, die, funny, funny but the guy died..."
140735,541,58,413000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, a simple Sunday drive will reveal the hidden wonders of our hometown!"

140742,541,65,446000,Bart Simpson,Car,Da-ad! Lisa's my little sister!
140744,541,67,450000,Homer Simpson,Car,The rearview mirror was invented in nineteen eleven for just this reason...
140745,541,68,454000,Bart Simpson,Car,"Interesting. When was the term ""shut up"" invented?"
140746,541,69,457000,Homer Simpson,Car,"As early as eighteen fifty-nine, ""shut up"" was used to shut up..."
140747,541,70,460000,Marge Simpson,Car,"Homie, I think the kids are just hungry."
140748,541,71,463000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Glasses, direct me to the nicest restaurant I can afford."
140749,541,72,466000,Glasses,Car,Accessing soup kitchens...
140750,541,73,468000,Homer Simpson,Car,"That's it, I'm taking you off."
140751,541,74,471000,Homer Simpson,Car,Reality!
140753,541,76,473000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Krusty Burger,"I'm sorry, sir."
140754,541,77,475000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,"Okay, let's see what we've got here."
140758,541,81,496000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Squeeze here. Rotate there. Pause for sweet talk. Oh glasses, you're so wonderful."
140759,541,82,503000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you using your glasses for snuggling?!
140761,541,83,507000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But the avatar looks just like you!
140762,541,84,509000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm afraid wives don't make passes at husbands in those glasses.
140763,541,85,515000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Glasses, find me a great gift for my wife. Under five dollars."
140764,541,86,519000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I heard that!

140773,541,95,544000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm not happy with you."
140774,541,96,546000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, honey, I know these glasses are a radical new technology and should be worn in moderation. Isn't that right, glasses?"
140775,541,97,553000,Glasses,Simpson Home,Yes. Just like I told you.
140776,541,98,555000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Anyway, I'm giving them up... ...to whoever dares take them."

140787,541,109,617000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No. No valentine for you, Nelson."
140788,541,110,624000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'll give a valentine to a loser. I'll give a valentine to a dork. I'll even give a valentine to a girl. But I won't give a valentine to a bully.
140789,541,111,639000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,And what if I don't?
140790,541,112,641000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Simpson, there's gonna be a heart in my hand. Either paper... or yours."
140792,541,114,648000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, everybody!"
140793,541,115,648000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"That's strange. I'm hearing a voice, but I'm not seeing a user icon."

140805,541,127,678000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why is it the recipe card you need is always the one Homer writes his cocktail ideas on?
140806,541,128,685000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe these bleep-bloop glasses can help.
140807,541,129,688000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, Marge Simpson, entering the Matrix, for a brownie recipe."

140856,541,177,900000,Dr. Carlock,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, maybe if you just concentrate on one problem, like his temper."
140857,541,178,903000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Everything in the newspaper makes him mad.
140858,541,179,906000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Not Marmaduke! Never Marmaduke!
140860,541,181,909000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Marmaduke was horrible today! Also, Marge is in therapy and she didn't even tell me!"

140864,541,185,933000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I guess the only choice is to come clean and tell her what I know... and how I know.
140865,541,186,937000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Whoa-ho, bad idea! No, no. Chicks do not like finding out they're being spied on. I speak from looooooooooooooooooong experience. Now, you gotta make it seem like you found out by accident there. Ooh! Next week youse schedule an appointment with the therapist, after hers, and then you ""bump into"" Midge in the waitin' room, there."
140866,541,187,963000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, that's great. How do you get your ideas?"
140867,541,188,967000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Pretty much all my friends are divorced guys.
140869,541,190,970000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, Homie! Dinner's almost ready! Pork chops with my secret seasoning!"
140870,541,191,977000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, you do like your secrets, don't you, Marge?"
140871,541,192,981000,Thought Bubble Moe,Simpson Home,"Don't lose your cool, Homer. The building block of a marriage is long silence. Hey, where'd she go?"
140872,541,193,988000,Thought Bubble Moe,Simpson Home,"Good, good, you held your tongue. Because... hey, where'd you go?"
140873,541,194,992000,Thought Bubble Moe,Simpson Home,Doesn't anybody want me to give 'em advice?
140874,541,195,995000,Thought Bubble Moe,Simpson Home,"Okay there, Fido. When you see that squirrel outside, at first, you play it cool, you understand?"
140878,541,198,1004000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"""I fear you""? This is what Valentine's Day means to you?"
140879,541,199,1008000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"This is what it means to everyone. How can you be forced to say ""I love you?"" People only give valentines because they're scared of what would happen if they didn't."
140880,541,200,1018000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Nelson, you frighten me so / The psycho-est bully I know / You're a sociopath / in need of a bath / I'm sure you'll wind up on Death Row."
