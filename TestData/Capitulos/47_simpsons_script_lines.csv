4684,47,232,932000,Patty Bouvier,Bouvier House,Shut up with that pen-scratching down there!
4685,47,233,935000,Homer Simpson,Bouvier House,I will send you every cent I earn for the baby. But you will not see me again until I am a man.
4687,47,235,955000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That is so sad.
4688,47,236,957000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, c'mon, honey. You know how it turns out. After all, you wouldn't be here today if I hadn't become the responsible head of a household."
4689,47,237,967000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?"

4721,47,272,1083000,Homer Simpson,Gulp 'N' Blow,"No, Marge, I just can't. I mean, look at me. I'm a Trainee... They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. But I can't buy you a decent wedding ring."
4722,47,273,1093000,Marge Simpson,Gulp 'N' Blow,Any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
4723,47,274,1100000,Homer Simpson,Gulp 'N' Blow,"Marge, for you."
