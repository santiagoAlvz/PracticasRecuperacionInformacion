109315,421,3,36000,C. Montgomery Burns,DOWNTOWN SPRINGFIELD STREET,"Actually, my nuclear plant did that. And now that you know, your life is in danger."

109317,421,5,61000,Mayor Joe Quimby,DOWNTOWN SPRINGFIELD STREET,"Oh, come on people, your drunken shenanigans destroy this town every year. And Ireland is so much more than the imbibing of spirits. The Irish gave the world the paddy wagon, the shamrock shake, and folk dancing where you don't move your arms."
109318,421,6,79000,Bart Simpson,DOWNTOWN SPRINGFIELD STREET,Where's the I.R.A. when you need 'em?
109319,421,7,81000,Ira Man,DOWNTOWN SPRINGFIELD STREET,We've renounced the ways of the gun and the bomb.

109323,421,11,112000,Bart Simpson,PARADE ROUTE,Two kinds of Irish people? What are they fighting over? Who gets to sleep in the bathtub?
109324,421,12,116000,Moe Szyslak,PARADE ROUTE,"Actually, those Prots and Cathies have hated each other for centuries."
109325,421,13,121000,Lisa Simpson,PARADE ROUTE,It always comes down to trans-substantiation versus con-substantiation.
109326,421,14,130000,Protestant Leprechaun,PARADE ROUTE,Grrr... grrr...
109328,421,16,130000,Lisa Simpson,PARADE ROUTE,Stop it! Both of you! You have a common land! A literature! And the sweetest songs on earth! TOORA LOORA LOORA -- TOORA LOORA LIE / HUSH MY LITTLE BABY / HUSH NOW DON'T YOU CRY

109332,421,20,174000,Mayor Joe Quimby,PARADE ROUTE,"Oh no, without the booze these guys all remember how much they hate each other!"
109333,421,21,186000,Marge Simpson,PARADE ROUTE,This was such a pleasant St. Patrick's Day till the Irish people showed up.
109334,421,22,192000,Marge Simpson,PARADE ROUTE,Urchins!
109335,421,23,194000,Marge Simpson,PARADE ROUTE,They took my cupcakes!
109336,421,24,196000,Patrick,PARADE ROUTE,"All right, you unwanted miracles! Give back the lady's cupcakes -- ya don't have the teeth for it!"
109337,421,25,202000,Urchin,PARADE ROUTE,"Aye, but we could gum the frosting."
109338,421,26,204000,Patrick,PARADE ROUTE,"If it's good gummin' you're after, wouldn't you rather have this lovely cabbage?"
109339,421,27,210000,Patrick,PARADE ROUTE,"Here you go, ma'am -- not a sprinkle nor jimmy askew."
109340,421,28,213000,Marge Simpson,PARADE ROUTE,"Thank you so much, Mister..."
109341,421,29,216000,Patrick,PARADE ROUTE,Patrick Farrelly at your service.
109342,421,30,217000,Marge Simpson,PARADE ROUTE,"Marge Simpson. Well, Mr. Farrelly, the least I could do is offer you a cupcake."
109343,421,31,228000,Patrick,PARADE ROUTE,"Light, moist, and such a marvelous shape retention. Marge, I own a small bakery... will you bake for me?"
109344,421,32,235000,Marge Simpson,PARADE ROUTE,Me? A professional baker's employee? Imagine how different my life would be!
109346,421,34,243000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Here we are at school, kids."
109347,421,35,245000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Hey, what are those boxes in the back?"

109349,421,37,247000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,See ya!

109351,421,39,250000,Patrick,Simpson Car,Bless your heart! You won't regret it.
109353,421,40,252000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"I already don't! Homer, I've got great news!"
109354,421,41,256000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,I'll use my one phone call to find out all about it!
109356,421,43,263000,Mulk,Springfield County Court House,Mulk request change of venue. Green monster cannot get fair trial in downtown Springfield.
109357,421,44,272000,Judge Snyder,Springfield County Court House,Granted!
109358,421,45,274000,Judge Snyder,Springfield County Court House,Homer Simpson?! You are a repeat offender.
109359,421,46,277000,Homer Simpson,Springfield County Court House,Three-peat.
109360,421,47,278000,Judge Snyder,Springfield County Court House,Bail is set at twenty-five thousand dollars.
109361,421,48,281000,Homer Simpson,Springfield County Court House,I make that in a year.
109362,421,49,283000,Judge Snyder,Springfield County Court House,I suggest you see a bail bondsman.
109365,421,52,288000,Lucky Jim,LUCKY JIM'S,"Okay Simpson, all your information checks out. I called your boss to verify your employment, and he says you're fired for getting arrested. You'd be amazed how often that happens."
109367,421,54,292000,Lucky Jim,LUCKY JIM'S,We'll put up your bail money. Just pay us ten per cent and show up for your court date.
109368,421,55,306000,Homer Simpson,LUCKY JIM'S,And if I don't show up?
109369,421,56,308000,Wolf,LUCKY JIM'S,Then you gotta deal with me.
109370,421,57,310000,Wolf,LUCKY JIM'S,"The name's Wolf and I'm a bounty hunter. If someone skips bail I track 'em down and bring 'em back. I also take a tooth, make a plaster cast, put it on this necklace then replace the tooth at my expense."
109371,421,58,322000,Wolf,LUCKY JIM'S,"Well, time to go back to my world of sleazy bars, tattoo parlors, and greasy spoons."
109372,421,59,328000,Homer Simpson,LUCKY JIM'S,What a great job. And I could use a job right now.
109373,421,60,332000,Wolf,LUCKY JIM'S,"Whoa, not just anyone can be a bounty hunter. You have to pass an online exam -- no wait, they got rid of that. There is a ten-dollar filing fee, but you can get around it. Congratulations, you're now a bounty hunter!"
109376,421,63,344000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Okay, I've set my trap. Now to scatter my cheese cubes and the rats will come. Condos! Affordable condos! Bail-jumpers welcome!"
109377,421,64,356000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Street,"""Bail jumpers welcome!"" That's refreshing, after the cold shoulder we got at the Town Homes at Sterling Pointe."
109380,421,66,364000,Gloria,Sidewalk,"Let's not get too excited, till we find out if it's in a good school district."
109381,421,67,369000,Snake Jailbird,Sidewalk,So wait -- are we telling people now?
109382,421,68,371000,Homer Simpson,Sidewalk,Stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!
109384,421,70,379000,Homer Simpson,Alley,"Now, are you gonna come quietly, or do I have to..."
109385,421,71,383000,Homer Simpson,Alley,"Now, let's think about this. If you shoot me, I won't be able to stop you and you'll be free to go. But someone may come after you. Probably not, given your reputation for shooting people who come after you. What I'm trying to say is, not shooting me now would be the biggest mistake of your life."
109388,421,74,416000,Ned Flanders,Alley,Bullet-proof glass.
109389,421,75,416000,Homer Simpson,Alley,Flanders!
109390,421,76,419000,Ned Flanders,Alley,"Yep, I'm just replacing the front window at my store, which was broken in the riot."
109392,421,78,424000,Ned Flanders,Alley,"Young man, what would your mother say if she knew you were shooting nice people in the brain?"
109393,421,79,429000,Snake Jailbird,Alley,She'd say that year off from Princeton was the worst decision I ever made.
109394,421,80,434000,Ned Flanders,Alley,"Well son, if you take responsibility for your actions, this could be the start of a better life for you."
109395,421,81,440000,Snake Jailbird,Alley,Maybe you're right. Maybe I should...
109396,421,82,446000,Homer Simpson,Alley,"This case is ""in the bag."""
109397,421,83,448000,Ned Flanders,Alley,"Homer, you could've killed him!"
109398,421,84,450000,Homer Simpson,Alley,"I sure could've, thanks to you."
109400,421,86,454000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Mall,Now I can clearly see potential customers walk right past my store. Enjoy your shopping elsewhere!
109401,421,87,460000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Hey, Ned."
109402,421,88,460000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,I brought you something.
109403,421,89,465000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,He hands a greeting card to Ned.
109404,421,90,466000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,ANGLE ON: GREETING CARD
109405,421,91,466000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Mall,What the?
109406,421,92,467000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,It's your share of the money for bringing in that bail jumper.
109407,421,93,471000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Ned, I never thought I'd say this, but we make a great team."
109408,421,94,474000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Mall,"Us... a team? As the salad said to the soup, ""I'm all mixed up."""
109410,421,95,476000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"We should be bounty hunters together. You're kind and smart, I'm cruel and strong. Together, we're nothing. But together, we're the perfect bounty hunter."
109411,421,96,488000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Mall,"Well... I could use money. But you have to promise me something, Homer."
109412,421,97,492000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,Sure. What is it?
109413,421,98,494000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Mall,We have to do everything by the book.
109414,421,99,496000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,And you have to promise no diddilies or doodilies.
109415,421,100,500000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Mall,"My friend, you have a deal-arooney!"
109418,421,103,516000,Patrick,Au Naturel,"Oh Marge, your talent with cakes is a rare and precious thing."
109419,421,104,520000,Marge Simpson,Au Naturel,"Well, um, thanks, but I've been wondering... why do you only have me make spheres, rods, and half-moon shapes?"
109420,421,105,528000,Patrick,Au Naturel,Well Marge... I'll tell you--
109421,421,106,531000,Patrick,Au Naturel,Right after I talk to these customers. Excuse me.
109422,421,107,534000,Patty Bouvier,Au Naturel,We're going to a bachelorette party for a really naughty girl.
109423,421,108,538000,Selma Bouvier,Au Naturel,Yeah. We need something tasty and tasteless.
109424,421,109,542000,Patrick,Au Naturel,"I've got just the thing, courtesy of my newest baker: freshly-frosted ass-cake."
109426,421,111,548000,Marge Simpson,Au Naturel,Oh my God! This is an erotic bakery!
109427,421,112,557000,Patty Bouvier,Au Naturel,Delicious!
109428,421,113,559000,Selma Bouvier,Au Naturel,"We'll take it. Now, what do you have in the way of a suggestive cannoli?"
109429,421,114,562000,Patrick,Au Naturel,"Oh, we have quite a selection."
109431,421,116,568000,Patrick,Au Naturel,I'll leave you with the book.
109432,421,117,571000,Marge Simpson,Au Naturel,How could you not tell me this is an erotic bakery?!
109433,421,118,575000,Marge Simpson,Au Naturel,"Marge, calm down. For as long as there's been baking, there's been erotic baking. It fills a need, and harms no one."
109434,421,119,581000,Marge Simpson,Au Naturel,Harms no one? Explain that to... well what about... I think you forgot about... Hmm...
109435,421,120,590000,Patrick,Au Naturel,My number-one customers are married couples. Your friends and neighbors. I just made a custom order for the Hibberts.
109436,421,121,596000,Patrick,Au Naturel,It's an exact replica of the good Doctor's...
109437,421,122,598000,Patrick,Au Naturel,I don't want to know!
109438,421,123,599000,Patrick,Au Naturel,It's not what you think it is.
109439,421,124,601000,Patrick,Au Naturel,Good.
109322,421,125,602000,Patrick,Au Naturel,It's his penis.
109352,421,126,603000,Patrick,Au Naturel,That's exactly what I was thinking!
109440,421,127,605000,Patrick,Au Naturel,"Marge, this is a valuable public service. Without your baking, people like me will be forced into back alleys, repurposing Ho-Hos and Ding Dongs. You have a great gift. Don't let it go to waste!"
109441,421,128,618000,Marge Simpson,Au Naturel,Well... okay.
109443,421,130,624000,Homer Simpson,Homer And Ned's Office,"This taser is awesome. Finally, a practical use for electricity."
109444,421,131,628000,Ned Flanders,Homer And Ned's Office,"Dear Lord, thank you for creating so many evil criminals for us to bring in. And also, thank you for my partner Homer, who..."
109445,421,132,634000,Ned Flanders,Homer And Ned's Office,Did you just taser my coffee?
109446,421,133,636000,Homer Simpson,Homer And Ned's Office,Just warming it up. Now to melt the cheese in this croissant...and get rid of a little excess earwax...and smoke a relaxing cigar.
109447,421,134,649000,Ned Flanders,Homer And Ned's Office,"Homer, can we take it easy on the taser?"
109448,421,135,651000,Homer Simpson,Homer And Ned's Office,No problem.
109449,421,136,655000,Ned Flanders,Homer And Ned's Office,Our first bail jumper!
109450,421,137,656000,Homer Simpson,Homer And Ned's Office,Let's roll.
109453,421,140,660000,Ned Flanders,Homer And Ned's Office,"Homer, take the taser out of your pants."
109454,421,141,662000,Homer Simpson,Homer And Ned's Office,"No, it looks cool!"
109455,421,142,679000,Clay Roberts,Homer And Ned's Office,Who's there?
109456,421,143,679000,Ned Flanders,Homer And Ned's Office,Bible salesman!
109458,421,145,711000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Daddy's home! I brought you kids some stuff from work!
109459,421,146,715000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here you go, son. Shell casings."
109460,421,147,718000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoa! There's still bullets in some of these!
109461,421,148,721000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Point them away from your sisters when you hammer them.
109462,421,149,724000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes sir!
109463,421,150,725000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What'd you get for me?
109464,421,151,727000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Something for the sweetest little scientist in the world. A new chemistry set.
109465,421,152,732000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, is this from a meth lab?"
109466,421,153,734000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The biggest one in town.
109467,421,154,736000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,This is evidence.
109468,421,155,738000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Evidence that I love my little girl.
109469,421,156,741000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I brought you some flowers! A full dozen this time! No tricks!"
109470,421,157,746000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie. I got you something too."
109471,421,158,751000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,A sterling silver picture frame -- with pictures of our kids in it.
109472,421,159,756000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, for now. I guess things are workin' out pretty good at your bakery job. Maybe we could order one of your cakes for Lisa's birthday."
109473,421,160,764000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How dare you?!
109474,421,161,765000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What'd you do that for?
109475,421,162,767000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, sorry muscle spasm."
109476,421,163,770000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm not convinced.
109477,421,164,771000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Still on the fence.
109478,421,165,773000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now I believe you.
109480,421,167,776000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,He'll be here sooner or later.
109481,421,168,785000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"So, how 'bout a little stakeout music?"
109482,421,169,787000,Ned Flanders,Homer's Car,"Homer, I don't think we have the same musical tastes."
109483,421,170,790000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Well, I like A.C.-D.C."
109484,421,171,792000,Ned Flanders,Homer's Car,I like their Christian cover band: A.D.-B.C.! KINDLY DEEDS / DONE FOR FREE / KINDLY DEEDS

109490,421,177,817000,Ned Flanders,Homer's Car,Hm. I've never seen anyone eat pizza like that.
109491,421,178,820000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Oh, you've gotta try it. This way the pepperonis stay intact till they reach your stomach. Then, BAM!"
109492,421,179,827000,Ned Flanders,Homer's Car,"Man, that's harder to swallow than evolution."
109493,421,180,830000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"You've got to roll it from the point. Here, let me show you."
109494,421,181,837000,Ned Flanders,Homer's Car,Not bad.
109495,421,182,838000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Now let it unfurl in your stomach.
109497,421,184,841000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,There he is!
109499,421,186,851000,Ned Flanders,Downtown Springfield,"Oh, kitten whiskers!"
109500,421,187,852000,Homer Simpson,Downtown Springfield,There's one thing he didn't count on: my reckless indifference to human life!
109502,421,189,862000,Ned Flanders,Car,"Lord, in your mercy, could you give my friend a stroke?"
109504,421,191,870000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner Home,"Seymour, those string beans were cooked to perfection. After twenty years I am finally starting to like you."
109506,421,192,876000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"Just wait for dessert, sir. I made it with you in mind."
109507,421,193,879000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner Home,Outstanding! I'll just shut my eyes and let you place it before me.
109509,421,195,886000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,"Seymour, what's going on? I'm coming down there!"
109510,421,196,889000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner Home,Quick! We'll have to eat from each end. We'll know we're safe when our lips meet in the middle!
109513,421,199,898000,Ned Flanders,Subway Car,"Homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! You need a special sticker just to bring a bike! Have you no respect for the law?"
109514,421,200,905000,Homer Simpson,Subway Car,"Hey, it worked, didn't it? Okay smart guy, you're going in the bag."
109516,421,202,911000,Homer Simpson,Subway Car,"Oh, wait. I left a sandwich in there."
109517,421,203,916000,Ned Flanders,Subway Car,"Homer, no! You promised... Everything was supposed to be by the book!"
109518,421,204,919000,Homer Simpson,Subway Car,You know what your problem is? You haven't become as bad as the people we chase!
109519,421,205,923000,Ned Flanders,Subway Car,This partnership is over!
109520,421,206,924000,Homer Simpson,Subway Car,I'll tell you what's over! This partnership!
109522,421,208,928000,Ned Flanders,Homer's Car,"You know, if you take your foot off the accelerator going downhill, you wouldn't use so much gas."

109530,421,216,960000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I hid it all in the one place you'd never look.
109531,421,217,965000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I can see you withholding sex or withholding cake. But withholding sexy cake? I know we have to move past this, but I don't see how."

109533,421,219,982000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"First, why don't you and I and the cake take a shower?"

109540,421,230,1010000,Lucky Jim,LUCKY JIM'S,This is one jumper that Homer can't catch.
109541,421,231,1016000,Ned Flanders,LUCKY JIM'S,Homer!
109542,421,232,1017000,Lucky Jim,LUCKY JIM'S,Seems he never showed up in court on his St. Patrick's Day arrest.
109543,421,233,1021000,Ned Flanders,LUCKY JIM'S,Not interested.
109544,421,234,1022000,Lucky Jim,LUCKY JIM'S,"All right. If you don't want the job, I'll just give it to one of these guys."
109545,421,235,1033000,Ned Flanders,LUCKY JIM'S,"I'm sure they're all competent professionals, but you'd best leave it to me."

109550,421,240,1053000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,I figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at Lisa's recital.
109551,421,241,1056000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And how did you know I wouldn't be there?
109552,421,242,1058000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Lucky guess.
109553,421,243,1060000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you'll never take me alive!"
109554,421,244,1064000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Forgot my keys.

109557,421,247,1146000,Ned Flanders,Springfield,For the last few weeks. But most of the time I've known you you've treated me like dirt!

109569,421,259,1209000,Ned Flanders,CONCRETE,"""...lest I come and strike the earth with a curse."" Thus ends the book of Malachi. I guess I did know the whole Old Testament by heart. Out with the old... in with the new. Testament, that is. Matthew One. ""The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham..."""

109573,421,263,1241000,Homer Simpson,CONCRETE,Make it life and you've got a deal.
109576,421,266,1244000,Marge Simpson,PENITENTIARY,"Don't feel too bad, Homie. You'll be free tomorrow. And I used all my new baking skills to make a special cake to remind you of me."
