50600,214,4,109000,Dennis Conroy,SPRINGFIELD STADIUM,"Thank you, Cyndi Lauper..."
50601,214,6,111000,Dennis Conroy,Broadcast Booth,"Just a reminder, folks, we do have a baseball game today."
50602,214,7,116000,Dennis Conroy,Broadcast Booth,"I am Dennis Conroy, and heeere come your Isotopes!"
50603,214,8,123000,Homer Simpson,Broadcast Booth,Boooo!
50604,214,9,123000,Dennis Conroy,Broadcast Booth,Let's welcome two new additions to the team...
50606,214,11,123000,Dennis Conroy,PLAYING FIELD,"... Smash Diggins and Fishbone Walker. Lucky for us, they were sent down from the majors for drug violations."
50608,214,13,136000,Homer Simpson,RIGHT FIELD BLEACHERS,"Oh, stupid Isotopes. Hurry up and lose so we can get out of here!"
50609,214,14,141000,Lisa Simpson,RIGHT FIELD BLEACHERS,"Why do you hate the Isotopes so much, Dad?"
50610,214,15,143000,Homer Simpson,RIGHT FIELD BLEACHERS,"Because, I loved them once and they broke my heart. Let that be a lesson to you, sweetie: never love anything."
50611,214,16,149000,Lisa Simpson,RIGHT FIELD BLEACHERS,Even you?
50612,214,17,150000,Homer Simpson,RIGHT FIELD BLEACHERS,Especially me.
50613,214,18,151000,Bart Simpson,RIGHT FIELD BLEACHERS,"But you've gotta support the team, Dad. They're already threatening to move to Moose Jaw."
50614,214,19,155000,Marge Simpson,RIGHT FIELD BLEACHERS,"That's right. Like my mother always said, you've gotta stick it out, even if you picked a loser. To the bitter end."
50616,214,21,163000,Dennis Conroy,Field,First pitch of the game...
50618,214,23,168000,Dennis Conroy,Broadcast Booth,That's a rotator cuff. His career's over.
50619,214,24,170000,Homer Simpson,Broadcast Booth,I'm going to warm up the car.
50620,214,25,171000,Marge Simpson,Broadcast Booth,But there's only been one pitch!
50621,214,26,173000,Homer Simpson,Broadcast Booth,And it sucked!
50622,214,27,174000,Dennis Conroy,Broadcast Booth,"Bases loaded, two outs, bottom of the ninth, and it's do or die."
50623,214,28,174000,Homer Simpson,Broadcast Booth,"""HITLER IS A JERK, MUSSOLINI..."""
50624,214,29,181000,Dennis Conroy,Broadcast Booth,"That'll bring up Babe Ruth the fourth. Of course, he's no Babe Ruth the third... but the franchise is very excited about this illegitimate great-grand-bambino..."
50625,214,30,191000,Dennis Conroy,Broadcast Booth,"And, what's this? He's pointing to the right field bleachers! Probably at a dying little boy."
50626,214,31,198000,Bart Simpson,Broadcast Booth,"Mom, am I dying?"
50627,214,32,200000,Marge Simpson,Broadcast Booth,"No, of course not!"
50628,214,33,201000,Lisa Simpson,Broadcast Booth,"Is he, Mom? You can tell me."
50629,214,34,203000,Marge Simpson,Broadcast Booth,No!
50630,214,35,204000,Dennis Conroy,Broadcast Booth,"Now he's pointing to the ground. Is he indicating a bunt? Yes, he's bunting!"
50631,214,36,212000,Marge Simpson,Broadcast Booth,"Good hustle, kid."
50633,214,38,214000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,NOW IT DOESN'T WORK.
50635,214,40,216000,Homer Simpson,Car,"So, who won? The losers?"
50636,214,41,218000,Bart Simpson,Car,"No, they lost."
50637,214,42,219000,Homer Simpson,Car,Losers.
50638,214,43,221000,Marge Simpson,Car,"But only by two points. And they didn't resort to stealing bases like the other team, so it's kind of a moral victory."
50639,214,44,227000,Lisa Simpson,Car,"With a little middle relief, they might even make the playoffs."
50640,214,45,230000,Homer Simpson,Car,"You'll be in your cold, cold grave before that ever happens."
50641,214,46,234000,Marge Simpson,Car,"Homer, would you please stop talking about the children's graves?"
50643,214,48,243000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,What's the hubub? Did Moe finally blow his brains out?
50644,214,49,247000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Quiet! We're watchin' the Isotopes!
50645,214,50,249000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Shut it off. They're losers.
50646,214,51,251000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Where you been? The Isotopes are on fire!
50647,214,52,253000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, that sniper at the all-star game was a blessing in disguise."
50648,214,53,257000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Now we're in the championship game.
50649,214,54,260000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Championship?

50659,214,64,308000,Dennis Conroy,Moe's Tavern,Jumping Jesus! He got all of that one! It's going... going... going...
50660,214,65,315000,Dennis Conroy,Moe's Tavern,Our technical director today was Stan Kadlubowski.
50661,214,66,318000,Dennis Conroy,Moe's Tavern,It's out of here! 'Topes win!

50691,214,96,433000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,None. That's why we're jumping to the conclusion that this was the work of no good punk kids.
50692,214,97,439000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Kids?
50693,214,98,440000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Therefore, effective immediately, I am imposing a curfew: any kid caught on the street after dark will be shot. Or returned to their parents, as the situation may warrant."
