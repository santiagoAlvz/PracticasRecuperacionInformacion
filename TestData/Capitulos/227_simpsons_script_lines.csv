54603,227,36,203000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We didn't? That's odd. Seems like we would've done that right after we left the car place.
54604,227,37,210000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know, but we didn't."
54605,227,38,211000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, here it is, so we can open it and find out now."

54611,227,44,229000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mel Gibson is just a guy, Marge. No different than me or Lenny."
54612,227,45,232000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Were you or Lenny ever named sexiest man alive?
54613,227,46,235000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmmm, I'm not certain about Lenny."
54614,227,47,237000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Besides, it's not just his chisled good looks. People magazine says he's a devoted father, goes to church every week, and likes to fix things around the... Homer, let's make love!"

54642,227,73,337000,Edward,Aztec Theater,"No, sorry, but like all celebrities, he's in Hollywood attending benefits for various diseases."
54644,227,75,350000,Mel Gibson,Aztec Theater,Did they like it?
54645,227,76,351000,WILLIAM,Aztec Theater,"Well, they haven't seen it yet, Mel."
54646,227,77,353000,ROBYN,Aztec Theater,How'd you get here from L.A. so fast?
54647,227,78,354000,Sideshow Mel,Aztec Theater,John Travolta flew me in his jet. Now I have to help him move next weekend. He deliberately waited 'til we were in the air to ask me!
54648,227,79,361000,WILLIAM,Aztec Theater,"You know, you really didn't have to make this trip, Mel. The screening's gonna go fine. Believe me."
54649,227,80,364000,Sideshow Mel,Aztec Theater,I don't know. I think this movie was a big mistake. All I do is talk for two hours. I don't shoot anybody! What was I thinking?!
54650,227,81,370000,ROBYN,Aztec Theater,You shouldn't worry about the movie. William and I both think it's fabulous.
54651,227,82,374000,WILLIAM,Aztec Theater,"And I think we know a little something about the movie business. Oh, Robyn, you've gotta see the director's cut of ""Booty Call!"" It's fabulous!"

54657,227,88,400000,Homer Simpson,Movie Theater,At least the Jimmy Stewart version had that giant rabbit who ran the savings and loan.

54662,227,93,413000,Marge Simpson,Theater Lobby,"I liked it. It was nice to see a movie where people solved their problems with words, instead of bullets and chasing."
54663,227,94,420000,Homer Simpson,Theater Lobby,"Oh, you're just saying that because your ""boyfriend"" was in it. I'll bet you would've hated it if me and Lenny were Mr. Smith."
54664,227,95,427000,Marge Simpson,Theater Lobby,Will you stop acting so jealous?
54665,227,96,429000,Sideshow Mel,Theater Lobby,"Listen, I don't wanna get spotted by the crowd, so I'm gonna take a leak behind the dumpster."

54696,227,128,518000,Sideshow Mel,PRIVATE JET,Maybe. Or maybe he's the only person with the guts to tell me the truth.
54697,227,129,522000,Sideshow Mel,PRIVATE JET,Turn the plane around! I want to go to 742 Evergreen Terrace.

54708,227,140,555000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen, Gibson, I'm tired of Hollywood pretty boys like you and Jack Valenti thinking you can have any woman you want. You see this?"
54709,227,141,564000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It symbolizes that she's my property and I own her.

54722,227,154,596000,Sideshow Mel,Simpson Home,"The problem I have is people love me so much, they never criticize me. I speed all the time, but cops never give me a ticket. If I don't pay my taxes, the I.R.S. pays 'em for me."
54723,227,155,605000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, you poor thing..."

54744,227,176,660000,Homer Simpson,Mel Gibson's Office,"Sorry, son, but we're going to be very busy. Mel's movie really stinks."
54746,227,178,665000,Homer Simpson,Mel Gibson's Office,"Okay, this opening scene should be in fast motion. Everybody likes that 'cause it looks funny."
54747,227,179,679000,MAN ON RIGHT,Mel Gibson's Office,"Hey, Mr. Smith's coming to Washington. He's really honest. That could be bad news for us corrupt politicians."

54750,227,181,679000,MAN ON RIGHT,Mel Gibson's Office,How do you figure?
54751,227,182,679000,MAN ON LEFT,Mel Gibson's Office,"Well, if he doesn't play ball, we'll teach him a thing or two."

54770,227,201,708000,Sideshow Mel,Mel Gibson's Office,You want me to replace the villain with a dog? I mean nobody'll know what's going on!
54771,227,202,713000,Homer Simpson,Mel Gibson's Office,They will if you set up that the dog is evil. All you have to do is show him doing this and people will suspect the dog.
54772,227,203,723000,Sideshow Mel,Mel Gibson's Office,"Maybe this wasn't a good idea, Homer. I'm sorry I dragged you out here. L-Let me pay your bus fare home."
54773,227,204,728000,Homer Simpson,Mel Gibson's Office,Ah-ah-ah! Now here's your biggest problem of all...
54774,227,205,732000,Sideshow Mel,Mel Gibson's Office,The filibuster scene? That was Jimmy Stewart's favorite!
54775,227,206,735000,Homer Simpson,Mel Gibson's Office,"And it was fine for the 1930's. The country was doing great back then. Everyone was into talking. But now, in whatever year this is, the audience wants action! And seats with beverage holders, but mainly action."
54776,227,207,749000,Sideshow Mel,Mel Gibson's Office,You really think the end is boring?
54777,227,208,750000,Homer Simpson,Mel Gibson's Office,"Oh! Mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage I've ever seen. And it's not easy for me to say that."
54780,227,209,757000,Sideshow Mel,Mel Gibson's Office,"Hmm, I guess it is a little flat. Okay, let's reshoot the ending. I'll call the hair and make-up ladies. You see if the teamsters will work for free."
54781,227,210,763000,Homer Simpson,Mel Gibson's Office,Piece o' cake. Now where's that kid with my latte?
54783,227,212,767000,Marge Simpson,Beverly Hills,"According to the map, this house is owned by the dog from ""Frasier."" And that's where Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche live."

54789,227,218,786000,Sideshow Mel,SCREENING ROOM,"... is a little different than what we had, but I think you'll like it. It's missing some sound effects and the computer guys haven't added the twinkle in my eye..."
54790,227,219,792000,Homer Simpson,SCREENING ROOM,"Mel, you're coming off desperate. Roll it, Louie!"
54791,227,220,799000,Homer Simpson,SCREENING ROOM,Here comes two!
54792,227,221,804000,MR. SMITH/MEL,SCREENING ROOM,"Well, I'm not licked! And I'm going to stay right here and fight for this lost cause... Somebody'll listen to me. Somebody'll..."
54794,227,223,816000,Senator Payne,SCREENING ROOM,I believe the Senator has yielded the floor.
54796,227,225,823000,MR. SMITH/MEL,SCREENING ROOM,"Yield this, Senator Payne..."
54797,227,226,833000,MR. SMITH/MEL,SCREENING ROOM,I move we impose some serious term limits!
54798,227,227,836000,Homer Simpson,SCREENING ROOM,I second that motion...
54799,227,228,836000,Homer Simpson,SCREENING ROOM,...with a vengeance!
54800,227,229,844000,MR. SMITH/MEL,SCREENING ROOM,"All in favor, say ""die!"""
54802,227,231,844000,Senate Leader,SCREENING ROOM,"Mr. Smith, this is highly unorthodox!"
54804,227,233,868000,DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING MAN,SCREENING ROOM,I'm the President of the United States and I demand to know what's going on here!
54805,227,234,878000,MR. SMITH/MEL,SCREENING ROOM,"Happy birthday, Mr. President."
54806,227,235,894000,Sideshow Mel,SCREENING ROOM,"Pretty cool, huh?"
54807,227,236,895000,Edward,SCREENING ROOM,"You, uh, you chopped off the President's head."
54808,227,237,899000,Sideshow Mel,SCREENING ROOM,I bet you didn't see that coming.
54809,227,238,901000,ROBYN,SCREENING ROOM,You impaled a United States Senator with the American Flag.
54810,227,239,904000,WILLIAM,SCREENING ROOM,Why did Mr. Smith kill everybody?
54778,227,240,906000,Homer Simpson,SCREENING ROOM,It was symbolism. He was mad.
54812,227,241,909000,Edward,SCREENING ROOM,"But this was gonna be the studio's prestige picture. Like ""Howard's End,"" or ""Sophie's Choice."""
54813,227,242,915000,Homer Simpson,SCREENING ROOM,Those movies sucked. I only saw 'em to get Marge into the sack. PS: mission accomplished.
54814,227,243,922000,Edward,SCREENING ROOM,But we've already bought five Golden Globe awards!
54815,227,244,925000,Sideshow Mel,SCREENING ROOM,I don't make movies to win awards -- especially now that I have two Oscars.
54816,227,245,929000,Sideshow Mel,SCREENING ROOM,I make movies for guys like him.
54817,227,246,931000,Homer Simpson,SCREENING ROOM,"Yeah, guys like me."
54818,227,247,932000,Edward,SCREENING ROOM,"Who are you, anyway?"
54819,227,248,934000,Homer Simpson,SCREENING ROOM,"Do the words ""Executive Producer"" mean anything to you?"
54820,227,249,937000,Sideshow Mel,SCREENING ROOM,Executive Producer?
54821,227,250,938000,Homer Simpson,SCREENING ROOM,We'll talk.
54822,227,251,939000,Edward,SCREENING ROOM,"You've desecrated a classic film! This is worse than ""Godfather III!"""
54823,227,252,942000,Sideshow Mel,SCREENING ROOM,"Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa. Let's not say things we can't take back."
54824,227,253,945000,Edward,SCREENING ROOM,"All right. All right, I'm sorry. But this film is never going to see the light of day."
54826,227,255,952000,Sideshow Mel,SCREENING ROOM,Look! They're towing away a Range Rover!
54827,227,256,956000,Sideshow Mel,SCREENING ROOM,"Yoink! C'mon, Homer. We've got a movie to premiere!"
54828,227,257,959000,Edward,SCREENING ROOM,"We've gotta get that film back, or we'll all be fired, ya know what I mean?"
54829,227,258,963000,WILLIAM,SCREENING ROOM,Yeah.
54830,227,259,963000,Edward,SCREENING ROOM,Huh?
54831,227,260,963000,WILLIAM,SCREENING ROOM,Yeah.
54832,227,261,963000,Edward,SCREENING ROOM,Huh?
54833,227,262,963000,WILLIAM,SCREENING ROOM,Yeah.
54834,227,263,963000,Edward,SCREENING ROOM,Huh?
54835,227,264,964000,WILLIAM,SCREENING ROOM,Fired!
54837,227,266,976000,Edward,Movie Studio,Give us the film!
54838,227,267,978000,Sideshow Mel,Movie Studio,Never!
54839,227,268,979000,Tram Guide,Movie Studio,"And, on your left, you'll see Ranier Wolfcastle filming his latest movie, ""Saving Irene Ryan."""
54840,227,269,985000,Irene Ryan,Movie Studio,"You put me down, you big lummox! Je-eedd!!"
148013,227,270,989000,WOLFCASTLE,Movie Studio,"Shut up, old lady. And stop kicking me there."
54841,227,271,995000,Homer Simpson,Movie Studio,Watch out! Comin' through! Mach schnell!
54842,227,272,998000,Sideshow Mel,Movie Studio,Homer! Land mine!
54843,227,273,999000,Homer Simpson,Movie Studio,I'm on it.
54845,227,275,1005000,Security Guard,Movie Studio,"G'night, Mr. Gibson."
54846,227,276,1006000,Sideshow Mel,Movie Studio,"'Night, Gus."
54779,227,278,1011000,Sideshow Mel,Street Outside Studio,I'm gettin' too old for this crap.
54848,227,279,1013000,Homer Simpson,Street Outside Studio,"How old are you, anyway?"
54849,227,280,1014000,Sideshow Mel,Street Outside Studio,"Well, I've been told I can play anywhere from 28 to..."
54850,227,281,1017000,Homer Simpson,Street Outside Studio,Sorry I asked.
54851,227,282,1019000,Homer Simpson,Street Outside Studio,"Oh, crap! Here they come!"
54852,227,283,1021000,Sideshow Mel,Street Outside Studio,"Well, that's it Homer. We should've known better than to match wits with studio executives."
54853,227,284,1026000,Homer Simpson,Street Outside Studio,"Hey, come on, turn that down-under frown upside down. We're not finished yet."
54855,227,286,1034000,Bart Simpson,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,"Wow, these dummies look pretty good."
54856,227,287,1037000,Batman,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,"Well, I've had a lot of surgery, old chum."
54857,227,288,1039000,Robin,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,Shh! Mr. Limato said he'd fire us if you didn't stop bothering the customers.
54858,227,289,1045000,Marge Simpson,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,"Homer, what are you doing here?"
54859,227,290,1048000,Homer Simpson,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,No time talk! Need steal car! Must save powerful but controversial movie!
54861,227,292,1056000,Homer Simpson,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,Hel-lo.
54862,227,293,1058000,Homer Simpson,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,"Quick, Mel, get in!"
54863,227,294,1059000,Sideshow Mel,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,"Oh, forget it, Homer, let's just give 'em the stupid movie."
54864,227,295,1062000,Homer Simpson,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,"Movies aren't stupid! They fill us with romance and hatred and revenge fantasies. ""Lethal Weapon"" showed us that suicide is funny."
54865,227,296,1071000,Sideshow Mel,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,That really wasn't my intention.
54866,227,297,1073000,Homer Simpson,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,"Before ""Lethal Weapon 2"", I never thought there could be a bomb in my toilet, but now I check every time."
54867,227,298,1079000,Marge Simpson,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,It's true. He does.
54868,227,299,1082000,Sideshow Mel,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,"Movies mean that much to you, Homer?"
54869,227,300,1084000,Homer Simpson,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,They are my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.
54870,227,301,1090000,Homer Simpson,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,No offense.
54871,227,302,1091000,Sideshow Mel,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,"Ah, what the heck. Let's hit the road!"
54872,227,303,1093000,Sideshow Mel,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,"Shove over, Junior."
54873,227,304,1100000,Batman,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,"That thoughtless destruction will surely bankrupt the museum, old chum."
54874,227,305,1104000,Robin,HOLLYWOOD AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,Shut up!
54876,227,307,1116000,Bart Simpson,HOLLYWOOD BLVD.,"Mom, you've gotta take my picture in this car so I can show Milhouse!"
54878,227,308,1120000,Marge Simpson,HOLLYWOOD BLVD.,"Oh sorry, honey, I used up the last roll on that man I thought was Judge Judy."
54879,227,309,1124000,Homer Simpson,HOLLYWOOD BLVD.,"Well, I think we lost 'em."
54880,227,310,1126000,Homer Simpson,HOLLYWOOD BLVD.,"Oh, wait. There they are."
54881,227,311,1127000,Sideshow Mel,HOLLYWOOD BLVD.,"Let me try something. Take the wheel, Lisa."
54882,227,312,1130000,Lisa Simpson,HOLLYWOOD BLVD.,But my Dad can...
54883,227,313,1130000,Sideshow Mel,HOLLYWOOD BLVD.,I said you.
54885,227,315,1132000,Edward,MERCEDES,We've got 'em now...
54887,227,317,1144000,ROBYN,MERCEDES,"Oh, no! We killed Mel Gibson!"
54888,227,318,1145000,Edward,MERCEDES,"You all saw it. He came at me with a knife, right?"
54889,227,319,1151000,WILLIAM,MERCEDES,Wait a minute. He's just a dummy!
54890,227,320,1154000,Edward,MERCEDES,"I know, but he sells tickets. Let's go!"
54892,227,322,1162000,Homer Simpson,ROAD WARRIOR CAR,"Great idea, Mel. Now it's my turn."
54893,227,323,1166000,Sideshow Mel,ROAD WARRIOR CAR,What are you doing?
54894,227,324,1167000,Homer Simpson,ROAD WARRIOR CAR,"I'm tired of running away. Did ""Braveheart"" run away? Did ""Payback"" run away? It's time we showed those suits what we're made of."
54896,227,326,1177000,WILLIAM,MERCEDES,What the heck is that?!
54897,227,327,1180000,ROBYN,MERCEDES,"Well, the one on the left is Mel Gibson. I don't know who the other two guys are."
54898,227,328,1183000,Sideshow Mel,MERCEDES,Will you please tell me the rest of the plan?!
54899,227,329,1185000,Homer Simpson,MERCEDES,"It's your plan, from ""Braveheart."" Your army mooned the enemy until they could take no more and surrendered."
54900,227,330,1193000,Sideshow Mel,MERCEDES,"No, they didn't. They attacked us in a horribly bloody battle. Remember?"
54901,227,331,1197000,Homer Simpson,MERCEDES,"Actually, I didn't see it, but on the poster it..."
54902,227,332,1199000,Sideshow Mel,MERCEDES,Jump!!!
54903,227,333,1200000,Sideshow Mel,MERCEDES,"Homer, are you okay?!"
54904,227,334,1203000,Homer Simpson,MERCEDES,I think so.
54905,227,335,1204000,Homer Simpson,MERCEDES,No.
54908,227,338,1209000,Sideshow Mel,Lobby,"All in favor, say die!"
54909,227,339,1209000,Sideshow Mel,Lobby,That digital sound really lets you hear the blood splatter.
54910,227,340,1217000,Homer Simpson,Lobby,"I don't get it, Mel. How can you be so calm and cool? My stomach's full of vomiting butterflies."
54911,227,341,1222000,Homer Simpson,Lobby,"Okay, that's it. Let's get ready to meet our public."
54912,227,342,1229000,Moe Szyslak,Lobby,"Well, that was disgusting."
54877,227,343,1231000,Comic Book Guy,Lobby,Worst ending ever.
54400,227,344,1233000,Ned Flanders,Lobby,I think I'm gonna be sick.
54913,227,345,1235000,Woman,Lobby,I'm Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter and you'll be hearing from my attorney!
54914,227,346,1239000,Homer Simpson,Lobby,/ Ow!
54915,227,347,1240000,Homer Simpson,Lobby,We shoulda put in the dog with the shifty eyes.
54916,227,348,1243000,Homer Simpson,Lobby,"Oh, I'm sorry I ruined your career, Mel."
54917,227,349,1248000,Sideshow Mel,Lobby,"It's not your fault, Homer. I guess there's just no room in today's crazy, gentle America for violent dinosaurs like us."
54918,227,350,1255000,Homer Simpson,Lobby,"How did the country lose its way, Mel? When did we stop rooting for the man with the flame-thrower, or an acid-spraying gun of some kind?"
54919,227,351,1263000,Sideshow Mel,Lobby,I blame the Internet. And the return of swing music.
54920,227,352,1266000,Homer Simpson,Lobby,"Well, whatever it is, we've got to get rolling on our next picture."
54921,227,353,1269000,Homer Simpson,Lobby,"Hey, what about a prequel to something? Everybody loves prequels."
54922,227,354,1273000,Sideshow Mel,Lobby,I don't.
54923,227,355,1274000,Homer Simpson,Lobby,"Okay, Mr. Difficult. How about a teen sex romp where you and your buddies are always trying to get some?"
54924,227,356,1281000,Homer Simpson,Lobby,"No, wait. A ghost who wins the lottery! You could be the ghost or the lottery commissioner. Ooh, what about Indiana Jones? Does anyone own the rights to that?"
54925,227,357,1293000,Homer Simpson,Lobby,"Hey, Mel. I fell out."
