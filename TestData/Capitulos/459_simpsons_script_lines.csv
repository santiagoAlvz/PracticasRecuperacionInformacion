118862,459,54,298000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,"Well, well, well, the community service detail. You people make me sick."

118903,459,94,473000,Homer Simpson,Coffee Shop,Aw dang! I lost track of time! I'm gonna be late for work.
118904,459,95,477000,Chief Wiggum,Coffee Shop,No you won't. Follow me.
118905,459,96,482000,Homer Simpson,Coffee Shop,Wow. So this is what it feels like to be a pregnant lady.

118913,459,104,512000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"Sir, I think something's going down. Something big."
118914,459,105,516000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Hm. Could that be some sort of narcotics transaction?
118915,459,106,519000,Otto Mann,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, what are you asking me for?"

118919,459,110,532000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,No.
118922,459,113,534000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,"Hey Homer, hand me my coffee."
118923,459,114,536000,Homer Simpson,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,Want some sugar?
118924,459,115,538000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,"No, no, I got it."
118925,459,116,545000,Homer Simpson,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,Impressive.
118926,459,117,547000,Homer Simpson,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,"Hey, would it be okay if I uh... ""ran a make"" on myself?"
118927,459,118,551000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,G'ahead.
118928,459,119,555000,Homer Simpson,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,"Drunk and disorderly? That's a little redundant. Hey, uh, mind if I do a little ""spring cleaning?"""
118929,459,120,562000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,"I'll tell you what -- I'll just look the other way while you press ""control F3""..."
118930,459,121,562000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,You just put yourself on Amber Alert!
118931,459,122,572000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,"Oh my God, oh my God! Um..."
118932,459,123,576000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,"Okay, that's better."
118933,459,124,579000,Moe Szyslak,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,Not a good time to be carrying this cake.

118935,459,126,588000,Homer Simpson,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,Really? Me?
118936,459,127,590000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,"Homer, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret: cops don't have many friends. Civilians are scared of us, and uh, other cops just remind us of things we want to forget. That's why our friendship is so special to me."
118937,459,128,604000,Homer Simpson,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,Chief... me too.
118938,459,129,607000,Snake Jailbird,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,"Um, y'know I've been back here for like, ten hours. Any chance of a bathroom break?"
118939,459,130,611000,Chief Wiggum,Chief Wiggum's Police Car,"Thanks a lot, Jailbird. Now I've got you on burglary and killing a moment."
118941,459,132,618000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Mrs. Simpson, Bart has always been what we educators term a ""Nogoodnik,"" but lately his behavior has taken a more sinister turn."
118942,459,133,626000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, we have reason to believe your son has been dealing drugs."
118943,459,134,630000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Dealing drugs? That's impossible. He... he doesn't have the math skills!
118944,459,135,637000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Marge, I know you've tried everything to keep Bart under control: Ritalin, Lithium, Zoloft... well, they didn't work. He has moved on to drugs."
118947,459,138,650000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart? Bart, are you here?"
118949,459,140,655000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,You really know how to roll 'em Bart.
118950,459,141,658000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's drug talk! But I could be mistaken. Let me just listen to a little more, out of context."
118951,459,142,666000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,This product is unbelievable!
118952,459,143,667000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"It's imported, you know!"
118954,459,146,676000,Chief Wiggum,Mountain,Ever worry the sun's not going to come back after it goes down at night?
118955,459,147,680000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,No...
118956,459,148,681000,Chief Wiggum,Mountain,"Uh, me neither. But, but you know who does? Ralphie. Got a lot of worries, that kid: What if the bed wets him? What if Superman decided to kill everybody?"
118957,459,149,692000,Homer Simpson,Mountain,"Hey, Ralph's a good kid. And he should be, he's got a great Dad."
118958,459,150,697000,Chief Wiggum,Mountain,"Homer Simpson, you always know the perfect thing to say."
118959,459,151,701000,Lou,Mountain,"Chief, Chief, it's Lou!"
118960,459,152,705000,Chief Wiggum,Mountain,"Okay, what is it now?"
118961,459,153,706000,Lou,Mountain,They're shooting at us! We need backup now!
118962,459,154,709000,Chief Wiggum,Mountain,You need backup or you want backup?
118963,459,155,712000,Lou,Mountain,We got a two-eleven in progress!
118964,459,156,715000,Chief Wiggum,Mountain,"Hey, what have I told you about not using the numbers?!"
118965,459,157,718000,Lou,Mountain,"It's an armed robbery, dammit!"
118966,459,158,721000,Chief Wiggum,Mountain,I guess we should go.
118968,459,160,727000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Ooh, ooh! Can I cuff him?!"
118969,459,161,728000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Square,"Sure, why not?"
118970,459,162,730000,Lou,Springfield Town Square,"Chief, come on, he's not trained!"
118971,459,163,732000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Square,"Who are you, the rules police?"
118972,459,164,734000,Lou,Springfield Town Square,"Uh, no -- we are the police police."
118973,459,165,736000,Johnny Tightlips,Springfield Town Square,Nobody moves or the doughboy gets popped.
118975,459,167,740000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Square,Take your hands off my brother from another mother!
118976,459,168,746000,Johnny Tightlips,Springfield Town Square,Let's get outta here!
118977,459,169,747000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Square,"Not to worry, Homer. That's what bulletproof vests are for."
118979,459,171,752000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Square,Uh-oh.
118982,459,174,767000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,Is he gonna be okay?
118983,459,175,768000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,It's gonna be touch and go. His left lung was filled with shamrock shake. McDonald's didn't even sell them this year.
118985,459,177,778000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,"Don't worry, Sarah. Clancy was there for me. And I'll be there for him."
118986,459,178,805000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,Oops.
118989,459,179,812000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,"Don't die on me, Clancy. You said our friendship was special. Well if it was so special, wake up you fat sack of..."
118990,459,180,827000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital Room,Homer... what happened to me?
118991,459,181,831000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,You saved my life. And I came here every day to make sure you pulled through.
118992,459,182,836000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital Room,"Thanks, Homer. You're a true friend. Unlike that Lou."
118993,459,183,840000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital Room,You're too late.
118994,459,184,842000,Lou,Hospital Room,"Chief, I've been sleepin' on that couch for a week."
118995,459,185,844000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital Room,You missed the wakeup. That's all that counts.
118996,459,186,849000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,"Clancy, I haven't seen my family in days. Would you mind if I went home now?"
118997,459,187,853000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital Room,Now? But I just woke up.
118998,459,188,856000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,"Well, if you really want me to stay..."
118999,459,189,859000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital Room,"No, no. You do what you have to do. Live your life. Which I saved."
119000,459,190,863000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,Fine! I'll stay a little more.
119001,459,191,865000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital Room,Great! Great! And can you read me a story... that you write yourself?
119002,459,192,869000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital Room,"It should be about an imaginary meeting between Babe Ruth and Hitler. But make no mention of baseball or Germany. And, begin."
119004,459,194,911000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Awesome. You finally made my room cool!
119005,459,195,915000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart Simpson, are you a drug-o?"
119006,459,196,918000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What? No! Not until you raise my allowance.
119007,459,197,922000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, can you explain what you were doing in the basement with Milhouse?"
119008,459,198,926000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Getting higher and higher...
119010,459,200,929000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,...Scores on Battle Ball!
119012,459,202,935000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, that's pretty nifty. Let me try."
119013,459,203,941000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my gosh, that's adorable! This one's going on the Christmas tree."
119014,459,204,946000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's no fun if my Mom likes them!
119015,459,205,950000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, toilet! If you can handle Dad, you can handle this!"
119017,459,207,954000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, where you been the last few weeks?"
119018,459,208,957000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Playing nursemaid to Chief Wiggum.
119019,459,209,959000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,People who get shot in the chest are such big babies.
118987,459,210,965000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Ahhh, that is so much better than hospital beer."
119020,459,211,969000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,"Well, well, well. So this is the ""Saint Elmo's Fire"" reunion that Andrew McCarthy himself was going to attend."
119021,459,212,977000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, maybe I lied. But you've been so needy... ""I'm hungry,"" ""I'm itchy,"" ""that's not my blood type..."""
119022,459,213,980000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, yeah, yeah... whoa... what have we here?"
