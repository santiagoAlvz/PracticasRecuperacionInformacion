128662,496,4,86000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Airport,"Cousin Kathy invited us so our feelings wouldn't be hurt, and we're going so her feelings won't be hurt."
128663,496,5,92000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Airport,I just don't understand the world of grownups.
128664,496,6,97000,Ticketing Agent,Springfield Airport,"Sorry sir, your bag is two pounds over the limit. Are you sure everything inside is essential?"

128679,496,21,137000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Airport,We're not with him.
128680,496,22,142000,Tsa Agent,Springfield Airport,We'll need to have a special agent check this out.
128682,496,24,148000,Tsa Agent,Springfield Airport,You're clear.

128684,496,26,151000,Tsa Agent,Springfield Airport,True patriots breastfeed.
128686,496,28,154000,Tsa Officer,Springfield Airport,"Sir, you've been selected for a pat-down."
128687,496,29,155000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Airport,Woo hoo! Can you focus on my shoulders -- that's where I carry my stress.
128688,496,30,160000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Airport,"Now, if I fart, that's 'cause I'm so relaxed."
128690,496,32,166000,Flight Attendant,Airplane,"Sir, there isn't enough room."
128691,496,33,167000,Homer Simpson,Airplane,Yes there is! Woo hoo.
128693,496,35,174000,Captain,Plane,"Welcome to flight 55 to Bozeman, Montana by way of Miami. Due to an unforeseen jailbreak in New South Wales, our takeoff is gonna be just a little bit delayed.

128694,496,36,188000,Homer Simpson,Plane,Huh? What the--
128695,496,37,191000,Ethnic Man,Plane,"Crazy food indeed, my friend."
128698,496,40,202000,Captain,Airplane,"Good news, folks. We've been cleared to taxi back to the terminal. You still can't get off, but you will be able to look through the window and see other people walking around and making fun of us."
128699,496,41,210000,Captain,Airplane,No word on takeoff.
128700,496,42,213000,Flight Attendant,Airplane,"Sir, return to your seat."
128701,496,43,215000,Homer Simpson,Airplane,But I have to go to the bathroom!
128702,496,44,217000,Flight Attendant,Airplane,You should've thought of that before you drank the fluids you need to live!
128703,496,45,226000,Homer Simpson,Airplane,Don't tread on pee! We probably have rights!
128704,496,46,236000,Homer Simpson,Airplane,Airlines don't treat people like people anymore!
128705,496,47,239000,Homer Simpson,Airplane,You make us beg for a filthy pillow that a barnyard rat wouldn't curl up and die in! And watch pre-taped messages that make crashing look like fun!
128706,496,48,247000,Homer Simpson,Airplane,Never putting me next to a pretty girl...
128708,496,50,253000,Flight Attendant,Airplane,We're gonna need the air marshal.
128709,496,51,259000,Air Marshal,Airplane,Now you've done it!
128711,496,53,262000,Air Marshal,Airplane,I need backup!
128712,496,54,264000,Air Marshal,Airplane,"Come on, ladies. You're all deputies now."

128714,496,56,274000,Homer Simpson,Airplane,"You can check my carry-on, but you can't check my spirit! And why is there moisture between the windows?! And don't wake me up to land! Just land!"
128716,496,58,292000,Homer Simpson,Airplane,I regret nothing... except this part!
128717,496,59,298000,Marge Simpson,Airplane,This is the last airline that would take us.
128718,496,60,301000,Lisa Simpson,Airplane,Looks like we're back to traveling on tramp steamers and produce trucks.
128719,496,61,305000,Bart Simpson,Airplane,I call shotgun!
128720,496,62,306000,Lisa Simpson,Airplane,It's too early to call shotgun!
128721,496,63,307000,Bart Simpson,Airplane,It's never too early to call shotgun!
128722,496,64,309000,Marge Simpson,Airplane,No one's shotgun! Now be quiet!
128725,496,67,315000,Homer Simpson,SECURITY EXAMINATION ROOM,"I'm still gonna make my flight, right? 'Cause if not, you have to put me up in a first class hotel... that's how it works. I..."

128729,496,71,342000,Homer Simpson,SECURITY EXAMINATION ROOM,And why is there moisture in between the windows?!
128730,496,72,344000,Homer Simpson,SECURITY EXAMINATION ROOM,And don't wake me up to land!
128732,496,74,359000,Mystery Man,Kwik-E-Mart,"A six pack of Duff, please."
128733,496,75,361000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh yes, Mr. Homer."
128735,496,77,363000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,What gave me away?
128736,496,78,365000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, the hot dogs spin counterclockwise in fear whenever you are near, sir."
128737,496,79,370000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Why are you in disguise?
128738,496,80,371000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Because of that dumb viral video with a hundred and fifty million hits, I can't go out in public."
128739,496,81,376000,Gil Gunderson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey, it's the guy from the plane."

128766,496,108,484000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,"Now, I may not be some mani-pedied TV blowhard..."
128767,496,109,484000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,"But I do speak for the common man who does his lousy job, goes to church twice a year and watches women's tennis 'cause he likes to hear 'em grunt. I bet Chuck the cameraman and Steve the sound guy know where I'm coming from."
128769,496,110,504000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,"Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about! Those real people out there who buy their coffee from the mini-mart, and grab enough sugar packs for a week! Honest, hardworking, sugar-stealing Americans!"
128771,496,112,518000,Adriatica Vel Johnson,TV Studio,"Nash, I'm scared! Find me a rich husband! Quick!"
128772,496,113,521000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,"Dad, you out-talked the talking heads!"
128773,496,114,524000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"From now on when someone asks me, I'm gonna say you are my father."
128774,496,115,528000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,"Aw, son. Now I regret bad-mouthing you to that girl you liked."
128775,496,116,533000,Cbsbn Executive,TV Studio,"Homer, the way you just demolished our number one on-air personality was... fantastic! You are the kind of ill-informed gasbag this network cannot get enough of. We only have eleven now. Not to mention our liberal straw man."

128779,496,120,560000,Marge Simpson,TV Studio,How can you refer to your audience that way?
128780,496,121,562000,Female Cbsbn Executive,TV Studio,"Well, what you do is you take a derogatory term and think of other words that start with the same letter."
128781,496,122,567000,Cbsbn Executive,TV Studio,"Homer, you're getting your own show."
128782,496,123,569000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,Finally. But I want to do it my way: classy and sophisticated.
