142867,549,4,134000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,We are all here because drinkin' in our bars is down. Mom and Pop bartenders can't compete with big box stores like Booze Barn and Hooch City.
142868,549,5,147000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Thanks, Cap. Now what I'm proposing is a superhero pub crawl. Our clientele dress up in costume and go drinking from bar to bar. Their masks make 'em feel uninhibited, and invulnerable."

142871,549,8,178000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, you got it, Moe. We can make up superhero drink names and charge 'em double. Like, uh, Nick Fury, Agent of Schnapps; Sex in the Batmobile; and the Wolveriskey! 'Ere, check out my uh, portfolium here."

142878,549,15,218000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Street,Why do they call this a yard of ale?
142879,549,16,220000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Street,"Easy. After you drink one, you're passed out in your yard."
142882,549,19,240000,Homer Simpson,TIPSY MCSTAGGERS,"Well, better get home. The delightfulness ended hours ago."
142883,549,20,245000,Moe Szyslak,TIPSY MCSTAGGERS,"Homer, the best thing for you to do in this situation is keep drinking."
142887,549,24,262000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Front Door,"Why are you doing this to me, booze? I drank every kind of you!"
142888,549,25,268000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Front Door,"See ya, Homer! / Bye, Dad!"
142889,549,26,269000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Front Door,"Have a good day, you two! Don't be me!"

142897,549,34,299000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Simpson! Smock up!
142898,549,35,301000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Every time I do art, some do-gooder teacher sends it straight to a therapist."
142899,549,36,305000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Your stuff is pretty disturbing.
142900,549,37,308000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I've never acted on any of it!
142901,549,38,310000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"You will take art, you will enjoy art, and you will make something in a kiln your mother can use."
142903,549,40,317000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Maggie! Why'd you do that?
142905,549,42,331000,Mrs. Trunch,ART CLASS,"And you shall leave immortal! Also, take out the trash."
142906,549,43,336000,Mrs. Trunch,ART CLASS,"Honest! / Inspiring! / Yes... necessary! / Oh, Milhouse-ian!"
142907,549,44,344000,Mrs. Trunch,ART CLASS,"Oh Bart, it's wonderful!"
142908,549,45,347000,Bart Simpson,ART CLASS,Really? Wonderful? I just drowned a grasshopper in paint and let him crawl on the paper till he died.
142909,549,46,352000,Mrs. Trunch,ART CLASS,You know what that's called? Mixed-media conceptual art.
142910,549,47,355000,Bart Simpson,ART CLASS,"No it's not, because I hate art."
142911,549,48,358000,Mrs. Trunch,ART CLASS,"Oh, then it's protest art!"
142912,549,49,360000,Bart Simpson,ART CLASS,Stop encouraging me!
142913,549,50,361000,Mrs. Trunch,ART CLASS,I will admire you from afarrr!

142921,549,58,382000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Oh yeah. She lives in a trailer down by Yogurtland. Now kiss me. I wanna make somebody mad.
142922,549,59,388000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,What's my no-good daughter up to now?
142925,549,62,395000,Haitian Woman,Trailer,Now you have everyt'ing you need for the voodoo. Would you like a bag?

142928,549,65,404000,Bart Simpson,Trailer,"Uh, plastic."
142929,549,66,405000,Haitian Woman,Trailer,Just like the chicken foot say you would!!!
142931,549,68,416000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, did you get Trunch's D.N.A.?"
142932,549,69,418000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, got it out of her purse."
142933,549,70,421000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,How'd you do that?
142934,549,71,423000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Art teachers don't have a desk. They just throw their purse anywhere.
142935,549,72,428000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,VOODOO SPELL / VOODOO SPELL / SEAGULL BEAK AND BONE OF MEL
142936,549,73,428000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,PURPLE HEART AND TEAR OF CHUM...

142939,549,76,447000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, right, we need one more thing from her purse."
142940,549,77,450000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,I've got these.
142941,549,78,451000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hm. She's got tickets to the play ""God of Carnage""."
142942,549,79,455000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Orchestra? On an art teacher's salary? That's black magic!
142943,549,80,461000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"Where's Mrs. Trunch? I need to know the correct density of ""points"" in my pointillism."
142944,549,81,466000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Sorry, but I don't think we'll be seeing much of Trunch today."
142945,549,82,472000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yep. I cast a voodoo spell on her. I won't bore you with the dark details, but let's just say she's in no condition for teaching."
142946,549,83,481000,Mrs. Trunch,Springfield Elementary School,"Class, I have an announcement. I'm afraid I can't teach today. I have a tummy ache."
142947,549,84,488000,Mrs. Trunch,Springfield Elementary School,A very special tummy ache.

142952,549,89,503000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Happy with your two-timing boyfriend now?
142954,549,91,513000,Bart Simpson,Skinner's Office,"I admit, I did make a voodoo doll of Mrs. Trunch. But I just asked for a stomach ache, not a baby!"
142955,549,92,518000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Classic wish-maker's mistake -- vague language.
142956,549,93,522000,Bart Simpson,Skinner's Office,So I did make her pregnant?
142957,549,94,523000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Of course not. Doesn't work that way.
142958,549,95,525000,Bart Simpson,Skinner's Office,Just how do women get babies?
142959,549,96,527000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"I'm not allowed to discuss that with fourth graders. Fifth grade, you get every dirty detail."
142961,549,98,532000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Do you know how embarrassed I was to get a call, at my arraignment, for my behavior during the pub crawl, because of a voodoo curse my son placed on his art teacher?"
142962,549,99,542000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I didn't mean to make her pregnant. I just hate art so much.
142963,549,100,545000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, everyone does, son. That's why they lock it up in museums where no one will ever visit."
142965,549,102,552000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"So, uh, your boy's got magic knock-up powers, huh?"
142966,549,103,555000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, I created three kids, and no one's making a big deal of that."
142967,549,104,559000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Not true! Whenever I compliment your virility, you act all weird. And you are very virile."
142968,549,105,565000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Yeah... well just talk about sports!
142969,549,106,567000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,No problem. Wish I had that Tom Brady's libido.
142972,549,109,572000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh it's amazing how many Cheerios Maggie drops in the back seat.
142973,549,110,577000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here you go. Put those in the trash, then you can help me unload the dishwasher."
142974,549,111,582000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"A minute of fun, a lifetime of work. I've never heard of a pregnancy like this."
142975,549,112,587000,20-something Wife,Simpson Home,There he is.
142976,549,113,588000,20-something Husband,Simpson Home,"Jenny, this is crazy."
142977,549,114,589000,20-something Wife,Simpson Home,Nothing's crazy at this point. Are you the boy that makes babies?
142978,549,115,593000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I like to think I'm the boy that makes families.
142979,549,116,597000,20-something Husband,Simpson Home,"See, Jenny. He's just a jerk kid."
142980,549,117,598000,20-something Wife,Simpson Home,It's just... we've been trying so hard to start a family. With all the money we've spent on I.V.F.... you have no idea...
142981,549,118,608000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, maybe I can help. But it'll cost you."
142982,549,119,611000,20-something Husband,Simpson Home,How much?
142983,549,120,612000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Five dollars. Plus one dollar haw-haw insurance.
142984,549,121,615000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"Trust me, the insurance is worth it."
142986,549,123,620000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,BY THE POWER OF THIS PLACE / MAKE A BABY WITH A FACE.
142987,549,124,624000,20-something Husband,Bart's Treehouse,"That's great, really. Really glad we're getting a baby with a face."
142989,549,126,630000,20-something Husband,Springfield Elementary School Playground,No haw-haw! It worked!
142990,549,127,633000,20-something Wife,Springfield Elementary School Playground,I'm pregnant!
142991,549,128,634000,20-something Husband,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Look Bart, I really, I can't believe there's a connection here. But, uh, we have some friends who are in the same dark place we were. Can we give them your name?"
142992,549,129,642000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Only if they have five dollars.
142993,549,130,644000,20-something Husband,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Yes, right. I'll make sure that they have five dollars."
142994,549,131,646000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,With them.
142995,549,132,648000,20-something Husband,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Look, I'm sorry our check bounced, man. I can have the bank teller call you."
142996,549,133,651000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Just give me the cash and you'll get your drivers license back.
142998,549,135,654000,Jimbo Jones,VACANT LOT,"Please keep the chatter down while the Womb Wizard is casting his spells. Ones are appreciated, people."

143001,549,138,671000,Marge Simpson,Tent,"Homie, I can't find my spatula! Can you get another one?"
143002,549,139,674000,Homer Simpson,Tent,Flanders! Can we borrow your spatula?!
143003,549,140,677000,Ned Flanders,Tent,That was my spatula!
143004,549,141,678000,Homer Simpson,Tent,And you never bought a replacement?
143005,549,142,680000,Ned Flanders,Tent,"Ah, too much aggravation! We just forego flipped food!"
143010,549,147,690000,Homer Simpson,Tent,Why you little! I'll teach you to answer peoples' prayers!
143013,549,150,698000,Husband,Tent,"Yeah... y'know, I just don't think we're gonna get in to see him today."
143015,549,152,704000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"What is your problem, boy?"
143016,549,153,707000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Maybe when I've got a Dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face, it sets, I don't know, a low bar?"
143017,549,154,714000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Wow. I've gotta take that in. While I do, have some bar nuts."
143018,549,155,717000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Aren't those full of germs?
143019,549,156,719000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Eat the nuts! They're your dinner!

143021,549,158,726000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Not so fast.
143022,549,159,728000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Nobody comes into my bar and kidnaps two paying customers.
143023,549,160,732000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Thanks, Moe, I... huh. Must've left my wallet at home."
143024,549,161,737000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Take 'em! Take 'em! Fill their pockets with corn and toss 'em to the pigs.
143025,549,162,741000,Louie,Moe's Tavern,Don't tell us our business!

143030,549,167,757000,Fat Tony,Grateful Gelding Stables,I need your boy to make a baby.
143031,549,168,761000,Homer Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Do you really need the boy's help to make a baby? Just do a little of the bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-potsie, and the bop-bada-bop-bada-bop."
143032,549,169,768000,Fat Tony,Grateful Gelding Stables,You sound like every doctor I've ever been to. But it's not for me. It's for her.
143033,549,170,775000,Fat Tony,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Meet my filly, Cheesesteak, the love of my life."
143034,549,171,781000,Fat Tony,Grateful Gelding Stables,Who has apple breath? You has apple breath.
143035,549,172,787000,Fat Tony,Grateful Gelding Stables,"And this horse, who I have briefly ""borrowed,"" is the winner of last year's Springfield Stakes -- Rear Admiral. So work your magic and breed me a champion."
143036,549,173,798000,Bart Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Look, Fat Tony. I don't know what you know about voodoo, but it only works on people. Horses? That's crazy talk!"
143037,549,174,805000,Fat Tony,Grateful Gelding Stables,You will breed me a champion by morning... or it will be the last sunrise you ever see.
143038,549,175,812000,Louie,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Don't over-promise, boss. It might be overcast."
143039,549,176,814000,Fat Tony,Grateful Gelding Stables,How'd you like a cast over your face?
143040,549,177,817000,Louie,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Well, as long as there were breathe holes..."
143041,549,178,820000,Louie,Grateful Gelding Stables,Y'know. Just sayin'.
143042,549,179,824000,Homer Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Well boy, if there was ever a good time for you to find out where babies come from, in the grossest way possible, with your life on the line, this is it."
143043,549,180,832000,Fat Tony,Grateful Gelding Stables,One more thing -- it better be a boy.
143044,549,181,836000,Homer Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,Anything else?
143045,549,182,838000,Fat Tony,Grateful Gelding Stables,It would be helpful if he could go undercover with police horses and find out what they know.
143046,549,183,851000,Bart Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Hey, this is all your fault."
143047,549,184,852000,Homer Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,How is it my fault?
143049,549,185,854000,Bart Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,"I wouldn't be here if you were more of a role model! Pub crawls, naked Frisbee golf..."
143050,549,186,859000,Homer Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,I just did that because it was a series of funny words!
143051,549,187,863000,Bart Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Well, it's your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to Hell!"
143052,549,188,867000,Homer Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Huh? Maybe you're right, boy. It's time I was a better father. And I'll start by saving us. I just need to facilitate some horse intercourse."
143053,549,189,876000,Homer Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Come on, buddy. Just make a champion thoroughbred and we're outta here."
143054,549,190,884000,Bart Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,What's his problem?
143055,549,191,898000,Homer Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Hey, you know, I don't think this guy likes girls."
143056,549,192,901000,Bart Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,Big deal. I don't like girls either.
143057,549,193,904000,Homer Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,Not like that. It's like this. ...Smithers ... ...Mr. Largo... ...Danny Kaye... What? Everyone knows.
143058,549,194,918000,Homer Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,Now where's she going?
143059,549,195,920000,Homer Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Hey, I know that horse! It's Sudsley! Sudsley Brew-Right!"
143060,549,196,927000,Homer Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,That horse was instrumental in me becoming a man.
143062,549,198,931000,12-Year-Old Homer,Springfield Street,Ew. That tastes horrible!
143063,549,199,958000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Beer transformed that cute little boy into the man you see before you.
143064,549,200,968000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Whoa! They like each other!
143065,549,201,970000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"You know, pregnant is pregnant..."
143066,549,202,973000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,What are you talking about?
143067,549,203,975000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"We're not lost, boy. Not by a longshot. We just have to set the mood."
143068,549,204,986000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"LET THEM PLAY! WE WON'T LOOK, WE'LL TURN AWAY / GO MAKE LOVE, THEN EAT SOME HAY..."
143069,549,205,998000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,WE'LL BE DEAD...SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD
