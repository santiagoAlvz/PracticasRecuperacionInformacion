121802,470,1,72000,Pilot,NEW YORK,We're unbalanced! It's not fair!
121804,470,3,80000,Chairman,Statue of Liberty's Crown,I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
121805,470,4,84000,Chairman,Statue of Liberty's Crown,"We are here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong -- in dark rooms, glued to their televisions, too terrified to skip the commercials."
121806,470,5,93000,Nbc Executive,Statue of Liberty's Crown,Well I think--
121807,470,6,93000,Chairman,Statue of Liberty's Crown,"NBC, you are here to listen and not speak!"
121808,470,7,97000,Chairman,Statue of Liberty's Crown,I think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health scare.
121810,470,9,102000,Female Executive,Statue of Liberty's Crown,"A new disease! No one's immune! It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic, and instead of summer, it's all the time!"
121812,470,11,110000,Network Executive,Statue of Liberty's Crown,Now I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves...
121813,470,12,113000,Female Executive,Statue of Liberty's Crown,He loves being that guy.
121814,470,13,115000,Network Executive,Statue of Liberty's Crown,"...but, Janice, we do have standards. This can't be a made-up disease. The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public."
121815,470,14,124000,Chairman,Statue of Liberty's Crown,We do have something we've been holding onto -- but it hasn't been tested.
121816,470,15,128000,Chairman,Statue of Liberty's Crown,"Get over here, NBC."
121817,470,16,129000,Nbc Executive,Statue of Liberty's Crown,"Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I..."
121819,470,18,129000,Female Executive,Statue of Liberty's Crown,Wow. Wow.
121821,470,20,139000,Chairman,Statue of Liberty's Crown,So we've got our deadly disease. Now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household... something that people are a little bit afraid of already...
121824,470,22,149000,Kent Brockman,NEWSROOM SET,"Housecat Flu is coming, people! The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the Housecat Flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern..."
121825,470,23,160000,Kent Brockman,NEWSROOM SET,"So petter beware, that warm body on your lap just might be...ready to destroy your tender vittles."
121828,470,26,172000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Living Room,"Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more info if they experience any of the following symptoms: mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night..."
121830,470,28,182000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty Burger,"You know, I don't know when this was ever a good idea."
121833,470,31,194000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hurry up, boy. We have to burn everything the cat touched before the virus makes us paranoid."
121834,470,32,204000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer!
121835,470,33,206000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Stop burning!
121836,470,34,208000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,They have a vaccine!
121837,470,35,211000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right. We'll get the vaccine.
121838,470,36,217000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, did you know he was in the pile?"
121839,470,37,220000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought he was an old clump of rags.
121842,470,40,225000,Mayor Joe Quimby,HOSPITAL LOBBY,"Don't worry, people. We have enough vaccines for... one child per family."
121844,470,42,231000,Krusty the Clown,HOSPITAL LOBBY,I don't even have a kid that I admit to having!
121845,470,43,233000,Mayor Joe Quimby,HOSPITAL LOBBY,"Please use your time in line wisely to ""Sophie's Choice"" your child."
121847,470,45,238000,Krusty the Clown,HOSPITAL LOBBY,What a crook.
121849,470,47,245000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,This isn't the line for a movie. Why are you wearing that costume?
121850,470,48,248000,Comic Book Guy,Hospital,"Because, you see, I am afraid of needles, but Wolverine is not."
121851,470,49,252000,Comic Book Guy,Hospital,Snikt! Snikt!
121852,470,50,258000,Comic Book Guy,Hospital,Need... acceptable currency... for delicious treat...
121853,470,51,268000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,Mr. Burns? Where's he going?
121854,470,52,275000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,"Yes, I'd like thirty-seven snifters of your influenza syrup. One for me, one for Smithers here and the rest for my hounds."
121855,470,53,283000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Hospital,Give him what he wants -- he's the only taxpayer in this town.
121856,470,54,287000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"But Mr. Mayor, these people have waited in line. And dogs can't even get the disease."
121857,470,55,292000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,They'll see me take it and they'll want some. Yes 'oo will. Yes 'oo will. You little jelly belly.
121858,470,56,298000,Waylon Smithers,Hospital,"Sir, perhaps we should get out of here before people start resenting you."
121859,470,57,303000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital,Hurry up and get in -- I'll drive.
121861,470,59,313000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital,"Hurry everyone, roll in the shards!"
121862,470,60,316000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital,Come on! Like this!
121863,470,61,316000,Chief Wiggum,Hospital,Healthy. Gettin' healthy. Ow! Gettin' healthy... and very sleepy.
121865,470,63,331000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Ahhh. I feel as hail and hearty as an eohippus.
121866,470,64,335000,Personal Physician,Burns Manor,"Mister Burns, I did a little blood work earlier today and I'm afraid I've got a bit of hard news."
121867,470,65,342000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Spit it out, Doctor! I haven't got all day."
121868,470,66,345000,Personal Physician,Burns Manor,You certainly don't. You see... I am afraid you're dying.
121869,470,67,348000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Dying?!
121870,470,68,350000,Personal Physician,Burns Manor,"Yes, it's a number of factors really... whooping cough, hectic fever, cancrum otis, Wellington's ooze, the Lambeth plague, and skull collapse."
121871,470,69,362000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,How long do I have?
121872,470,70,364000,Personal Physician,Burns Manor,"Five, six weeks tops. You might live to see the Wheat-Eared Warbler return to Swinton Park. But I wouldn't count on it."
121874,470,72,374000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"You want me to tell the employees, sir?"
121875,470,73,377000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,No. It's better that they hear it from me. I'll tell them the truth in the simplest way I know how.
121876,470,74,396000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Why did Burns make us all come here?
121877,470,75,398000,Carl Carlson,Burns Manor,I bet he's got something up his sleeve.
121878,470,76,400000,Lenny Leonard,Burns Manor,I don't like that he hired a band to play ominous music.
121879,470,77,412000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Good evening -- I have very sad news for all of you.
121881,470,79,417000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Burns Manor,"Well, maybe he's going to jack up our electric rates. I will have to hand-crank my wiener warmer. Hand-crank my wiener warmer."
121882,470,80,427000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,The truth is... I'm dying.
121883,470,81,431000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Hell yeah!
121884,470,82,432000,Carl Carlson,Burns Manor,Finally! A break for the black man!
121885,470,83,434000,Lenny Leonard,Burns Manor,This better not be a gag!
121886,470,84,436000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,It's not! My days are roman numeraled!
121888,470,86,440000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Stop this! Stop this at once or I'll...
121889,470,87,442000,Carl Carlson,Burns Manor,Or what? You're just gonna die soon anyway!
121891,470,89,446000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,I'm warning you! You are making a very powerful temporary enemy!
121892,470,90,451000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"Sir, you'd better not rile them up. The first course is oysters on the half shell."
121893,470,91,453000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"I see. I am well and truly hated. However, you will change your tune when you see the legacy I'm leaving behind me."
121894,470,92,466000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"I'm leaving all my money to an orchard that will grow inedible ""me""-shaped fruits."
121895,470,93,472000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,They're as addictive as they are poisonous.
121896,470,94,480000,Lenny Leonard,Burns Manor,Melt his ice sculpture!
121897,470,95,485000,Barney Gumble,Burns Manor,It's starting to drip!
121898,470,96,492000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,I haven't a friend in the world.
121899,470,97,494000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"You have me, sir."
121900,470,98,495000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"I pay you, Smithers. And no kind of love can come from one man paying another."
121901,470,99,500000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"Well, but there's..."
121902,470,100,501000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,I'll just retire to my bed.
121903,470,101,503000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"Uh, that's where we put everyone's coats."
121904,470,102,507000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Shred them in the wood chipper and use the rags to wax my car.
121905,470,103,516000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Why does everyone hate me?
121907,470,105,533000,Waylon Smithers,Cliff Overlooking The Sea,"Sir, what are you doing?"
121908,470,106,535000,C. Montgomery Burns,Cliff Overlooking The Sea,"Smithers, I want to die quietly, on my own terms, crushing as many of those baby sea turtles as I possibly can."
121909,470,107,544000,C. Montgomery Burns,Cliff Overlooking The Sea,"Goodbye, insufficiently cruel world!"
121912,470,110,573000,Bart Simpson,Woods,"Anthill, wasp nest, moose poop, Mr. Burns... Mr. Burns?"
121915,470,112,579000,Bart Simpson,Woods,My poop stick has brought him back to life! But which end?
121916,470,113,585000,Bart Simpson,Woods,What do you want?
121917,470,114,586000,Bart Simpson,Woods,"C'mon, man, leave me alone."
121918,470,115,588000,C. Montgomery Burns,Woods,Friend?
121919,470,116,590000,C. Montgomery Burns,Woods,You my mommy-daddy-puppy?
121920,470,117,593000,Bart Simpson,Woods,Whoa! Your brains have turned to oatmeal!
121921,470,118,596000,C. Montgomery Burns,Woods,My name Oatmeal?
121922,470,119,598000,Bart Simpson,Woods,"This is too weird, man."
121923,470,120,600000,C. Montgomery Burns,Woods,Wait for Oatmeal!
121925,470,122,612000,Bart Simpson,Woods,What am I gonna do with you?
121927,470,124,618000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Look, I know you're cool now, but my Dad hates you more than celery, and my Mom said no new pets -- so I'm hiding you in my room."
121928,470,125,625000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bart's Bedroom,Oatmeal accept premise.
121929,470,126,628000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Bart, who are you talking to?"
121931,470,128,635000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,What's all that noise?
121932,470,129,637000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I'm playing with my Sergeant Activity Doll.
121933,470,130,639000,Sgt. Activity Doll,Bart's Bedroom,Why not buy another of me?
121934,470,131,644000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Hm... Well, okay."
121935,470,132,660000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Okay, okay. I'll find you some food."
121936,470,133,662000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bart's Bedroom,Me not feel good.
121938,470,135,671000,Bartender,Springfield Union Station,"Hey pal, you look like you lost your best friend."
121939,470,136,673000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Union Station,He was more than a friend. He was the reason I got up in the morning. Because he would inject me with coffee at six a.m. in the back of the head. My new boss will never take his place.
121940,470,137,686000,Bartender,Springfield Union Station,"New boss, huh? What's he like?"
121941,470,138,688000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Union Station,"Oh, a lot like my old boss. Ruthless. Went to Yale. Made a fortune in energy. Basically hairless."
121942,470,139,695000,Bartender,Springfield Union Station,"Ah, yeah."
121943,470,140,697000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Union Station,He likes to stack men naked. I guess that's a start.
121945,470,142,704000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Cemetery,"A Philanthropist, a Humanitarian, a Man of Peace. These are among the people who've come today to spit in Montgomery Burns' open grave."
121946,470,143,715000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Cemetery,The fact that Mr. Burns' thirty-seven pound body was never found did nothing to lessen the salivary salvos.
121914,470,144,721000,Funeral Director,Springfield Cemetery,"Hold, please."
121947,470,145,725000,Funeral Director,Springfield Cemetery,You may continue.
121949,470,147,726000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I hope they use that spit for a good cause, like sealing wedding envelopes."
121950,470,148,731000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Or helping a railroad worker grip his sledgehammer!
121951,470,149,734000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Now they're dancing on his grave!
121952,470,150,737000,Chazz Busby,Simpson Home,"Dance, you sons of bitches! Dance like it's me down there!"
121954,470,152,738000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Thank God Mr. Burns isn't alive to see this.
121955,470,153,743000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Come back! I'm not finished giving you your bath!
121958,470,156,759000,Sgt. Activity Doll,Simpson Home,Attack during their sacred holiday!
121959,470,157,763000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, apparently Mr. Burns is in a state of shock from the trauma he underwent."
121960,470,158,767000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh man, this is great. The most evil man in town is in our power. He will do my bidding... at that fantasy football auction. And anything else my limited imagination can come up with."
121961,470,159,790000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just because Mr. Burns was mean to you, that doesn't give you the right to abuse him when he's helpless."
121962,470,160,795000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, it's the golden rule: treat others the way they mess with you."
121963,470,161,800000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not up to you. We're going to take him to our moral and civic leaders. They'll know the right thing to do.
121964,470,162,806000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Simpson Home,"All those in favor of treating Mr. Burns the way he messed with us say ""aye."""
121966,470,164,806000,Everyone,Springfield Town Hall,Aye!
121967,470,165,806000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"People of Springfield, to quote Shakespeare, ""the quality of mercy is not strained..."""
121969,470,167,819000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"You know, it takes a lot for an eight-year-old to stand up in front of the whole town."
121970,470,168,824000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Eight-year-old? I always thought you were a midget!
121971,470,169,827000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"We're called ""little people"" and I'm not one."
121972,470,170,831000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"People of Springfield, as a nerd, I understand your desire for revenge, but this sweet, harmless man is not the same remorseless monster who tormented us all."
121973,470,171,843000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Town Hall,He's close enough!
121975,470,172,845000,Guido Guy,Springfield Town Hall,"Yeah, Seaside Heights ain't Maui, uh, but you take what you can get. Whoa!"
121978,470,175,855000,Dick Cheney,COMPOUND,You done pullin' the wings offa those bees?
121979,470,176,857000,Waylon Smithers,COMPOUND,"Almost, Mr. Vice President. May I ask why I'm doing this?"
121980,470,177,861000,Dick Cheney,COMPOUND,I don't know. I'm bored.
121981,470,178,863000,Waylon Smithers,COMPOUND,"When my old boss got bored, he liked to listen to Thomas Edison reciting ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"" on a wax cylinder."
121982,470,179,869000,Dick Cheney,COMPOUND,"What do you think I am, a thousand years old? I got a myPod full of Lee Greenwood."
121984,470,181,881000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Now boy, everyone in town gets Burns for half an hour to do as they will."
121985,470,182,886000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"This town can't teach its kids or collect its garbage, but we lead the nation in pointless revenge."
121986,470,183,892000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Amen.
121987,470,184,894000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Okay, Burnsie, follow the carrot!"
121988,470,185,912000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"Dad, you're gonna wreck him for everybody!"
121989,470,186,915000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Don't worry, boy, another girder always swings in for you to walk on right when you get to the end."
121990,470,187,924000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Where's the other girder?
121993,470,190,928000,Snake Jailbird,Kwik-E-Mart,"Okay, here's your choice: cash in my hands or blood on the jerky."
121994,470,191,932000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"I believe you want the ""Assistant Manager, sir."""
121995,470,192,936000,Snake Jailbird,Kwik-E-Mart,Oh I can't shoot him! I've got him next!
121996,470,193,939000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, that is your bad luck because he is mine right now. Come back in half and hour and he can be your accomplice."
121997,470,194,944000,Snake Jailbird,Kwik-E-Mart,I was going to take him ice skating.
121998,470,195,946000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,What was that?
121999,470,196,947000,Snake Jailbird,Kwik-E-Mart,Nothing.
122000,470,197,947000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,What was that? Ice skating? Do you do axels and Salchows? What do you do?
122003,470,200,952000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,Check out my new Dad!
122004,470,201,952000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield,"Sorry, lame-o, it's two o'clock, which makes him my Uncle Ed for an hour."
122005,470,202,963000,DOLPH,Springfield,"No, it's Saturday, which makes him that guy at the Youth Center who really believes in me."
122006,470,203,968000,DOLPH,Springfield,"There's still time for me to turn my life around, right?"
122007,470,204,972000,DOLPH,Springfield,"It's not that easy, man!"
122009,470,206,979000,Otto Mann,Simpson Home,All yours.
122010,470,207,980000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What did you do with him?
122011,470,208,982000,Otto Mann,Simpson Home,Found a way to use him as a bong.
122015,470,212,990000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, Mr. Burns is here for you again."
122016,470,213,993000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Already?
122017,470,214,995000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"A little tired of revenge, are we?"
122018,470,215,997000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I've done all I can do in that medium."
122019,470,216,1001000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right. Mr. Burns, I'm gonna show you that not all of us in this town are vindictive and cruel."
122020,470,217,1007000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Not today.
122022,470,219,1015000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,"I thought after all you went through, you just might want to spend an hour in a place where you felt at home."
122023,470,220,1021000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Lots of room for friends.
122024,470,221,1023000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,"Actually, sir, the man who lived here didn't have many friends. But you're a better person than he ever was."

122027,470,224,1036000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,"Yes, technically it's you. But like I said, people change and--"

122043,470,239,1090000,Waylon Smithers,DICK CHENEY'S HOUSE,I... I am.
122044,470,240,1091000,Dick Cheney,DICK CHENEY'S HOUSE,"You realize that every time I don't get what I want, Al Qaeda wins?"

122051,470,247,1117000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Street,"Silence, you sadistic monster! I've got my memory back, and I'm going to wreak a terrible vengeance. Taking an idea I got from a Stephen King book, I'm going to cover this town with a dome!"

122060,470,256,1169000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,You were given six weeks to live. And you've outlived it! I think what kept you alive was that for once in your life you were helping other people.
122061,470,257,1181000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Street,Could it be? Perhaps kindness did keep me alive.

122073,470,269,1243000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Thank God your son can't see the way you're behaving.
