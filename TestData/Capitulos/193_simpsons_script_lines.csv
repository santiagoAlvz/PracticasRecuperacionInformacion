44401,193,44,195000,Jay,Amphitheater,"So what can I do for ya, huh?"
44402,193,45,196000,Bart Simpson,Amphitheater,"Well, if you're running the show, how could you leave out, Krusty the Clown?"
44403,193,46,200000,Jay,Amphitheater,"Ah, Krusty the Clown. That takes me back. Didn't he die in a grease fire?"
44404,193,47,206000,Bart Simpson,Amphitheater,"No, he's alive. And he is so funny you could plotz. At least according to his press release."
44405,193,48,211000,Jay,Amphitheater,"Well, if he's half as alive as you say he is, he's in."

44411,193,54,234000,Bart Simpson,Amphitheater,Tell him it'll count towards his community service.
44412,193,55,237000,Krusty the Clown,Amphitheater,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. All right, I'll do it. Boy, you swipe one pair of Haggar slacks and you're payin' for it the rest of your life."
44413,193,56,251000,Steven Wright,Amphitheater,I finally got around to reading the dictionary. Turns out the zebra did it.
44414,193,57,259000,Homer Simpson,Amphitheater,I don't get it.
44415,193,58,260000,Lisa Simpson,Amphitheater,"Dad, the zebra didn't do it. It's just a word at the end of the dictionary."
44416,193,59,264000,Homer Simpson,Amphitheater,I still don't get it.
44417,193,60,266000,Lisa Simpson,Amphitheater,It's just a joke.

What's the deal with that?"
44526,193,170,793000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"One's residential, the other is business."
44527,193,171,795000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Oh. Well, that makes sense. What'll they think of next? Blue pages?"
44528,193,172,802000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,They have those. They're government listings.

44544,193,188,866000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"'Cause comedy ain't funny anymore. Instead of time-tested jokes about women drivers and doctor bills, you got some big-chinned schlub readin' typos from the Palookaville Post. Well here's a headline for ya... ""Nobody Cares!"""
