3176,42,232,974000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,"You know Smithers, I've always despised the laziness of the common worker. Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak. So I replaced the flesh -- which is weak -- with steel, which is strong. Behold, the greatest breakthrough in labor relations since the cat o' nine tails."
3177,42,233,997000,Waylon Smithers,Laboratory,"How long till it's up and running, sir?"
3178,42,234,999000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,"Keep your pants on, Smithers. First, we need... The human brain."
3180,42,236,1005000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, here's a good job, Dad. Oh wait, you have to know how to operate a ultrasonic lithotryptor."
3181,42,237,1010000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How hard can it be?
3182,42,238,1011000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Dad. Here's one. Twenty-eight dollars an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people."
3183,42,239,1018000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, what job is that?"
3184,42,240,1020000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Grave digger.
3186,42,242,1027000,Crypt Keeper Willie,Cemetery,"Deeper. Wider. Faster. I wouldn't bury me turtle in that mud puddle. Ah, what's the use?"
3187,42,243,1033000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,Sheesh. What a slave driver.
3188,42,244,1045000,Waylon Smithers,Cemetery,"What corpse should we unearth, sir?"
3189,42,245,1048000,C. Montgomery Burns,Cemetery,I don't know. I feel like a kid in a candy store.
3190,42,246,1052000,C. Montgomery Burns,Cemetery,"Hello! An open grave. Smithers, get him out quickly, the stench is overpowering."
3192,42,247,1058000,Waylon Smithers,Cemetery,"What a minute, sir. That's Homer Simpson. He wasn't exactly a model employee."
3193,42,248,1063000,C. Montgomery Burns,Cemetery,"Well, who is a model ... employee?"
3194,42,249,1066000,Waylon Smithers,Cemetery,"Ehhh... Simpson will do just fine, sir."
3195,42,250,1072000,Waylon Smithers,Cemetery,"Did you hear that, sir?"
3196,42,251,1074000,C. Montgomery Burns,Cemetery,"No, I didn't. Who is it? Frankenstein? The Booger Man?"
3197,42,252,1079000,Waylon Smithers,Cemetery,"It's the man in the bag, sir. I think he's alive."
3198,42,253,1082000,C. Montgomery Burns,Cemetery,Oh... bad corpse. Bad corpse. Stop scaring Smithers. Satisfied?
3199,42,254,1088000,Waylon Smithers,Cemetery,"Thank you, sir."
3201,42,256,1097000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,Excellent.
3202,42,257,1099000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,"Smithers, hand me that ice cream scoop."
3203,42,258,1101000,Waylon Smithers,Laboratory,Ice cream scoop?
3204,42,259,1102000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,"Damn it, Smithers. This isn't rocket science, it's brain surgery."
3205,42,260,1111000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,"Hel-lo. Look at me, I'm Davey Crockett."
3206,42,261,1137000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,"Look, Smithers, a twitch... it's moving. It's alive! Oh, that fellow at Radio Shack said I was mad... well who's mad now?!"
3207,42,262,1149000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,Hi there. I'm your dad-dy.
3208,42,263,1170000,Robot,Laboratory,Mmm... sprinkles.

3212,42,267,1178000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's your father, he's missing."
3213,42,268,1179000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad's missing? Get outta here.
3214,42,269,1181000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He's been gone for two days.
3215,42,270,1183000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whayda ya know, she's right."
3217,42,272,1186000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"It wasn't suppose to be this way. It was supposed to be a thing of beauty, not this abomination."
3218,42,273,1197000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh Smithers, I was wrong to play god. Life is precious, not a thing to be toyed with. Now, take out that brain and flush it down the toilet."
3219,42,274,1206000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, his family might appreciate it if you returned the brain to his body."
3220,42,275,1210000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, come on. It's 11:45."
3221,42,276,1214000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy dog eyes... all right."

3191,42,279,1224000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,"Oh, will you quit your complaining."
3223,42,280,1226000,Waylon Smithers,Laboratory,"Sir, do you know what this means? He is alive."
3224,42,281,1229000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,"Oh you're right, Smithers. I guess I owe you a coke."
3225,42,282,1233000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,"And as for you, you clinking, clattering, cacophony of colligenous cogs and camshafts, take that."
3226,42,283,1241000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,Ahhh!
3227,42,284,1243000,Waylon Smithers,Laboratory,"Run, sir!"
3228,42,285,1247000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,"Every bone... shattered... organs... leaking vital fluids. Slight headache... loss of appetite. Smithers, I'm going to die."
3229,42,286,1259000,Waylon Smithers,Laboratory,"Sir, is there nothing I can do?"
3230,42,287,1261000,C. Montgomery Burns,Laboratory,"Well, perhaps. Smithers go to my office. In the third drawer of my desk are surgical tools and some ether..."
3232,42,289,1272000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Did you have a nightmare, Homie?"
3233,42,290,1274000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No. Bart bit me.
3234,42,291,1275000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, man, you were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab."
3235,42,292,1279000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
3237,42,294,1284000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads? Well my body was crushed so I had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame.
3238,42,295,1292000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just a dream!
3239,42,296,1296000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Oh that's right. It's all a dream.
3240,42,297,1303000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Or is it?
3241,42,298,1303000,TV Announcer,Simpson Home,Next week on The Simpsons.
