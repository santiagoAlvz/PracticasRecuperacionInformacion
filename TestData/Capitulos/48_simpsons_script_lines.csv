4926,48,142,627000,Dave Shutton,Well,"Timmy, where are your parents?"
4927,48,143,629000,Bart Simpson,Well,"Uh... I have no family. I tried to enroll in school, but your Principal Skinner turned me away because of my shabby clothes."
4928,48,144,637000,Seymour Skinner,Well,He's a liar!
4929,48,145,640000,Crowd,Well,Booooooo!
4930,48,146,640000,Kent Brockman,Well,"The circumference of the well is thirty-four inches. So, unfortunately, not one member of our city's police force is slender enough to rescue the boy."
4931,48,147,649000,Chief Wiggum,Well,"By God, men -- you're a bunch of marshmallows!"
4932,48,148,652000,Fat Cop,Well,"Why don't you go, Chief?"

4935,48,150,655000,Kent Brockman,Well,"Although the well is too dark to see the boy, Timmy has told us his foot is trapped under a rock. Thus, any attempt to pull him up would snap him like a twig."
4936,48,151,665000,Kent Brockman,Well,"In desperation, the city is considering more unorthodox solutions."
4937,48,152,668000,Falcon Man,Well,"Grasping the child firmly in his talons, Socrates here will fly him to safety! Just watch!"
4938,48,153,680000,Falcon Man,Well,I don't think he's coming back.
4939,48,154,683000,Sailor,Well,"With this hook, and this hunk of chocolate, I'll land your boy. And I'll clean him for free."
4940,48,155,689000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Well,"Although we can't reach your boy, we can freeze him with liquid nitrogen so that future generations can rescue him."
4942,48,157,696000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty, we ask you to watch over little Timmy O'Toole, trapped in that well."
4944,48,159,708000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! What's wrong with you?
4945,48,160,710000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero."
4946,48,161,712000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"How do you mean, dad?"
4947,48,162,713000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, he fell down a well... and can't get out..."
4948,48,163,717000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How does that make him a hero?
4949,48,164,719000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it's more than you did!"
4950,48,165,721000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"And finally, Channel Six's own Krusty the Clown has gathered members of the entertainment community -- who normally steer clear of fashionable causes -- for a video called ""We're Sending Our Love Down The Well."""
4951,48,166,728000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"I wanted to do something to help that boy. So I called my good friend Sting. He said, ""Krusty, when do you need me?"" I said Thursday -- he said, ""I'm busy Thursday"" -- I said, ""What about Friday?"" He said, ""Friday's worse than Thursday."" Then he said, ""How about Saturday?"" I said, ""Fine."" True story."
4952,48,167,752000,Sting,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I used to open for Krusty in uh, '69. In fact, he fired me as I recall."
4953,48,168,759000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Sting.
4954,48,169,760000,Sting,Simpson Home,"But this isn't about show business. This is about some kid down a hole, or something, and we've all got to do what we can."
4955,48,170,768000,Sting,Simpson Home,THERE'S A HOLE IN MY HEART / AS DEEP AS A WELL / FOR THAT POOR LITTLE BOY / WHO'S STUCK HALF-WAY TO HELL.

4963,48,178,802000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Well, we gotta pay for promotion, shipping, distribution... you know, those limos out back -- they aren't free... Whatever's left, we throw down the well."
4965,48,180,814000,Souvenir Hawker,Well,Authentic Timmy O'Toole baby teeth! Six dollars a bag!
4966,48,181,819000,Bernard,Well,Step to the rear... plenty of room in the back.

4974,48,189,890000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but I couldn't get through my sock. Goodnight everybody."
4975,48,190,898000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart Simpson! The thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness and love of the entire community. When they find out you've been fooling them, they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors."
4976,48,191,910000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah? And how are they gonna find out?
4977,48,192,912000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The police will catch you sooner or later.
4978,48,193,914000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The police. They couldn't catch a cold.
4979,48,194,917000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe not, but I bet you're stupid enough to have left a ""Property of Bart Simpson"" label on that radio."
4982,48,197,930000,Lou,Well,"And Cinderella had the most beautiful gown at the ball. With eight satin petticoats, each more delicate than the last. I think he's asleep."
4983,48,198,942000,Eddie,Well,Want to get a cup of coffee?
4984,48,199,943000,Lou,Well,Okay. Brave little guy.
4985,48,200,961000,Eddie,Well,"Hey, I almost tripped over this thing."
4987,48,202,975000,Bart Simpson,Well,What did I do to deserve this?
4988,48,203,978000,Bart Simpson,Well,Help! Help! I fell down the well.
4989,48,204,981000,Eddie,Well,Tell us something we don't know.
4990,48,205,985000,Bart Simpson,Well,No! My name is Bart Simpson!
4991,48,206,988000,Lou,Well,What are you doing down there?
4992,48,207,990000,Bart Simpson,Well,"Look, I'll level with you. There is no Timmy O'Toole. It was just a prank I was playing on everybody."
4993,48,208,998000,Lou,Well,"Well, you sure fooled us, kid."
4994,48,209,1000000,Eddie,Well,"Hey, I got an idea for a prank. Let's go home and go to sleep. ."

4999,48,214,1020000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You must think we're the worst parents in the world.
5000,48,215,1024000,Eddie,Simpson Home,"Yeah, that's... pretty much the feeling down at the station."
5002,48,217,1029000,Homer Simpson,Well,"Don't worry, son. Just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll..."
5003,48,218,1037000,Bart Simpson,Well,Ow! Knock it off you bald boob!
5004,48,219,1040000,Homer Simpson,Well,"Hey, don't make me come down there!"
5005,48,220,1041000,Bart Simpson,Well,Like to see you fit.
5006,48,221,1043000,Homer Simpson,Well,"Why, you little --"
5007,48,222,1044000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Well,Put a man on him.
