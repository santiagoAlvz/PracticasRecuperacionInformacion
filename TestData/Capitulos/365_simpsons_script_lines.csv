94606,365,2,39000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Maybe he's cheating on us with the Episcopalians.
94607,365,3,42000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Look at 'em, with their bright, airy narthex and light, flaky Eucharist. I wouldn't mind dipping my hand in their font."
94608,365,4,53000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Christ is born, who's on my horn?"
94610,365,5,55000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Bad news, Ned. There's been a horrible train wreck."
94611,365,6,60000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,So many little plastic Christmases ruined.
94612,365,7,64000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,You want me to deliver the Christmas sermon? I feel like I'm born again again!
94613,365,8,74000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Don't be nervous, Ned. You've practiced this so many times in the shower."
94614,365,9,77000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,Aagh! Paper cut!
94615,365,10,84000,Barney Gumble,First Church of Springfield,Now there's no one to deliver the sermon!
94616,365,11,87000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Did anyone order a hero?
94617,365,12,93000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Okay, Christmas, Christmas... you know how your paper boy always sends you a Christmas card with his home address on it? What's up with that?"
94618,365,13,104000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,First Church of Springfield,I wanted you to tip me!
94619,365,14,106000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,No tip till they bring back Hagar the Horrible!
94620,365,15,109000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,First Church of Springfield,That's not my decision!
94621,365,16,110000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, it's never anybody's decision... anyhoo... I'd like to tell you all a little story I call ""The First Christmas."""
94623,365,18,115000,Sideshow Mel,First Church of Springfield,"I, for one, am dying to hear it!"
94625,365,20,125000,Homer Simpson,NAZARETH (1 B.C.),A carpenter named Joseph was about to get some frankly preposterous news...
94627,365,22,129000,Mary,MARY'S HOUSE,Joseph... you know I have never lain with a man.
94628,365,23,134000,Joseph,MARY'S HOUSE,Tell me about it.
94629,365,24,136000,Mary,MARY'S HOUSE,And yet... I am with child.
94630,365,25,138000,Joseph,MARY'S HOUSE,A pregnant virgin?! That's every man's worst nightmare.
94631,365,26,144000,Angel,MARY'S HOUSE,"Hail Mary, full of grace."
94632,365,27,147000,Joseph,MARY'S HOUSE,That's not all she's full of.
94633,365,28,148000,Angel,MARY'S HOUSE,"Quiet, you. Mary, you carry in your womb the Son of God, who will grow up to become King of the Jews."
94634,365,29,155000,Mary,MARY'S HOUSE,So... not a doctor.
94635,365,30,157000,Angel,MARY'S HOUSE,"Well, he will be able to heal the sick."
94636,365,31,159000,Mary,MARY'S HOUSE,But nothing to hang on the wall.
94639,365,34,165000,Hibbert Wise Man,King Herod's Palace,King Herod! We three wise men come bearing gifts for the King of the Jews.
94640,365,35,170000,Hibbert Wise Man,King Herod's Palace,We bring gold...

94642,365,37,173000,Frink Wise Man,King Herod's Palace,"...And myrrh, which I am re-gifting! 'Cause who needs myrrh? Here's the tag."
94643,365,38,179000,King Herod,King Herod's Palace,Thank you. Which one should I open first?
94644,365,39,183000,Skinner Wise Man,King Herod's Palace,"This is awkward. Eh, the king of the Jews we seek is a-a newborn child."
94645,365,40,191000,King Herod,King Herod's Palace,Find this pretender to my throne and bring him to me.
94646,365,41,195000,Frink Wise Man,King Herod's Palace,"Uh, now, you wouldn't hurt the little boychik..."
94647,365,42,198000,King Herod,King Herod's Palace,"Of course not. Kings don't hurt babies... giant, pointy swords hurt babies."
94648,365,43,205000,Frink Wise Man,King Herod's Palace,"Good King Herod except you don't really have the ""good"" so what do you have, really then?"
94651,365,46,214000,Innkeeper,Bethlehem Inn,"Now, don't you worry, I've got plenty of rooms at my inn. All with brand new carpeting."
94652,365,47,219000,Mary,Bethlehem Inn,I think my water just broke.
94653,365,48,221000,Innkeeper,Bethlehem Inn,"You can have the barn. Uh, now feel free to come by the main house for breakfast. There won't be any."
94656,365,51,233000,Joseph,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Just keep pushing, sweetie. The doctor will be here any second."
94657,365,52,237000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Shalom, everybody!"
94659,365,54,241000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Grateful Gelding Stables,I've got some very good news. Caesar just invented the caesarean!
94660,365,55,248000,Marge Simpson,Grateful Gelding Stables,Get him outta here!
94661,365,56,256000,Shepherd Carl,Grateful Gelding Stables,I knew I'd like him. But I never dreamed I'd adore him.
94662,365,57,259000,Shepherd Lenny,Grateful Gelding Stables,I've got the Messiah's nose! I've got the Messiah's nose!
94663,365,58,262000,Shepherd Carl,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Give it back, give it back -- he'll kill us all!"
94664,365,59,265000,WISE MAN HIBBERT,Grateful Gelding Stables,He looks just like his dad.
94665,365,60,269000,WISE MAN HIBBERT,Grateful Gelding Stables,Not you.
94666,365,61,270000,Joseph,Grateful Gelding Stables,"I'm not the father, I'm not a wise man, I'm nothing. This is the worst Christmas ever."
94667,365,62,276000,Joseph,Grateful Gelding Stables,Maybe a little toot off the old wineskin'll cheer me up.
94668,365,63,287000,Joseph,Grateful Gelding Stables,My wine turned into water! Who could've performed such a cruel miracle?
94670,365,65,292000,Joseph,Grateful Gelding Stables,Why you little--
94672,365,66,295000,Angel,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Joseph, no! He has to stay alive till he's thirty-three, when he'll be renounced by his friends and crucified!"
94674,365,68,301000,Angel,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Sorry, kid."
94675,365,69,305000,Mary,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Anytime anyone suffers in the world, he starts crying again. Can you do something?"
94676,365,70,312000,Joseph,Grateful Gelding Stables,Me? But I'm watching the Orange Bowl.
94677,365,71,316000,Mary,Grateful Gelding Stables,Now!
94681,365,75,330000,Joseph,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Hmm... you like physical comedy, eh? Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk."

94688,365,82,357000,Mary,Grateful Gelding Stables,Aww... I think this non-traditional household just might make it.
94689,365,83,364000,Joseph,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Jesus, Mary and Joseph! We've got a great family. Now let's get some sleep."
94690,365,84,369000,Frink Wise Man,Grateful Gelding Stables,Herod is coming for the child! Manger danger! Manger danger!
94691,365,85,376000,Innkeeper,Grateful Gelding Stables,"The kid you're looking for is in there. The other tenants have been complaining about the incessant swaddling. All hours, day and night."
94692,365,86,382000,Lou,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Gee Chief, I feel pretty bad tryin' to take out a baby."
94693,365,87,386000,Chief Wiggum,Grateful Gelding Stables,"Eh, don't worry, boys. No one will ever speak or write of this again."
94694,365,88,391000,Matthew,Grateful Gelding Stables,What a boffo beginning for my book!
94695,365,89,397000,Innkeeper,Grateful Gelding Stables,There they are! I see his head dealie!

94708,365,101,459000,Congregation,First Church of Springfield,Ohhh...!

94712,365,105,472000,Energizer Bunny,Simpson Home,I don't know why I'm so run down. I must be low on Christmas spirit.

94743,365,133,638000,Young Burns,PACIFIC ATOLL,"I don't have to listen to you. On this island, military rank means nothing -- we're in a state of nature, where the strong of will control the weak!"

94745,365,135,653000,Young Burns,PACIFIC ATOLL,How'd you like to be the Archduke in charge of coconuts?
94734,365,137,664000,Grampa Simpson,PACIFIC ATOLL,Days turned to weeks. Weeks turned to months. Months turned back to days. Even Burns was startin' to look good to me.
94747,365,138,674000,Young Burns,PACIFIC ATOLL,"Hey sailor, my eyes are up here!"
94735,365,139,679000,Grampa Simpson,PACIFIC ATOLL,"By Christmas Eve, our hopes of rescue were fading..."
148250,365,140,686000,Young Burns,PACIFIC ATOLL,"You know, Simpson, we've had our dust-ups... So I've made you a little peace offering."
148171,365,141,692000,Young Grampa,PACIFIC ATOLL,A shaving kit! Is this pomade?
148251,365,142,696000,Young Burns,PACIFIC ATOLL,It's nothing really. Just seagull brains and snail goo.

94738,365,151,730000,Santa Claus,Hilltop,"Thank you, boys. I guess I must have run into a sudden storm."
148253,365,152,735000,Young Burns,Hilltop,"Yes, yes. Everything happens to you."
94739,365,153,738000,Santa Claus,Hilltop,My sleigh! It's ruined!
148176,365,154,740000,Young Grampa,Hilltop,"Well, we'll get you up and running or my name ain't Young Grampa Simpson!"
94741,365,156,766000,Santa Claus,Beach,"Boys, I'm almost ready. I'm just missing Prancer... and Rudolph!"
94749,365,157,773000,Santa Claus,Beach,And now to bring joy to boys and girls around the world! Ho-ho- Dammit!
94775,365,158,782000,Young Burns,Beach,"Sorry, Chuckles. Change of plan."
94776,365,159,784000,Young Burns,Beach,This sleigh is my ticket off this hell hole! And I'm keeping all the toys for myself. Because at heart I'm just a very wicked child.
148177,365,160,792000,Young Grampa,Beach,You backstabber! And I let you spoon me.
148178,365,161,809000,Young Grampa,Beach,"Let's go, you flying hat rack!"

94754,365,169,864000,Grampa Simpson,PACIFIC ATOLL,Except for that!
94756,365,171,865000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I waited and waited, but Santa never came back! If I hadn't invented a jet ski made of coconuts, I'd have never gotten home. And then when I did, the war was over and the nurses were all kissed out."
94757,365,172,877000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's quite a tale, Grampa."
94758,365,173,882000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's true, I tells ya--"
94759,365,174,884000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's Santa!

94764,365,179,905000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Cyrus, I miss you every day..."
94765,365,180,908000,Santa Claus,Simpson Home,He misses you too.
94766,365,181,911000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,He-- wha-- who?
94767,365,182,913000,Santa Claus,Simpson Home,"Your brother didn't die in the war, Abe. He crashed into Tahiti and he liked it so much, he never left. And now, if you like, I'll take you to him."
94768,365,183,923000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Will we be back for the Tournament of Roses Parade?
94769,365,184,926000,Santa Claus,Simpson Home,Probably not.

94704,365,189,936000,Santa Claus,Tahiti,"I kept putting it off, and then I was just too embarrassed."
94777,365,190,941000,Elderly Cyrus,Tahiti,"Sorry I never called, Abe. I was too busy with my fifteen native wives!"
94779,365,192,950000,Grampa Simpson,Tahiti,"Fifteen? Woo, that sounds like a lotta sex!"
94780,365,193,954000,Elderly Cyrus,Tahiti,"I said wives, not girlfriends."
