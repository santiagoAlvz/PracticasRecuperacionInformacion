127902,493,1,1315000,Bart Simpson,Krustylu Studios,Is there any better feeling than waiting for a live Krusty show to start?
127903,493,2,1315000,Milhouse Van Houten,Krustylu Studios,Maybe watching your bride coming down the aisle.
127904,493,3,1315000,Bart Simpson,Krustylu Studios,Hmmm.
127906,493,5,1315000,Thought Bubble Homer,Krustylu Studios,Why does she get to eat before the reception?
127907,493,6,1315000,Sideshow Mel,Krustylu Studios,Seltzer bottle connected and pressurized?
127908,493,7,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,Check.
127909,493,8,1315000,Sideshow Mel,Krustylu Studios,Roll-up dicky set to six?
127910,493,9,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,Nope. Eleven!
127912,493,11,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"My comedy comes from taking risks! Or avoiding them, I can't remember."
127913,493,12,1315000,Female Marketing Executive,Krustylu Studios,"Krusty, we need to talk."
127914,493,13,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,Make it fast. I've got a coiled up spring ready to boi-oi-oi-oi-oing. Why can't I be funny with just my words? Bill Maher doesn't put dangerous things near his crotch except when he's off work.
127915,493,14,1315000,Male Marketing Executive,Krustylu Studios,"It's about your vodka, ""Absolut Krusty."""
127916,493,15,1315000,Female Marketing Executive,Krustylu Studios,"We're having trouble persuading people it's hip to drink a vodka made by a clown, in a bottle shaped like a clown, that does this when you open it..."
127917,493,16,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,Always gets me.
127918,493,17,1315000,Male Marketing Executive,Krustylu Studios,"Yeah, plus that TV special where you drank another brand of vodka didn't help."
127919,493,18,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,I used up my stuff poisoning deer!
127920,493,19,1315000,Male Marketing Executive,Krustylu Studios,"If we're ever gonna sell your vodka, we need to do something completely unorthodox: a viral marketing campaign."
127921,493,20,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,Get to the point! Unless you want a face full of clown chunks!
127922,493,21,1315000,Male Marketing Executive,Krustylu Studios,People are more likely to drink your vodka if they think all their coolest friends are drinking it.
127923,493,22,1315000,Female Marketing Executive,Krustylu Studios,So we pay for a big party at the home of a Springfield trendsetter.
127924,493,23,1315000,Male Marketing Executive,Krustylu Studios,"...your Brockman, your Bumblebee Man..."
127925,493,24,1315000,Female Marketing Executive,Krustylu Studios,"He invites his cool friends, we serve free cocktails, made with your vodka, generating buzz."
127926,493,25,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,We've got buzz.
127927,493,26,1315000,Female Marketing Executive,Krustylu Studios,Positive buzz.
127928,493,27,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,That exists? Wow.
127930,493,28,1315000,Female Marketing Executive,Krustylu Studios,So all you have to do is find one of your loyal fans whose house we can trash and friends you can exploit.
127931,493,29,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,I need a drink.
127932,493,30,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,Not that! Never that!
127933,493,31,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Hey, hey kids! Who wants to host a viral marketing event?"
127935,493,33,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,All you have to do is write me a letter about how hip and influential your parents are.
127936,493,34,1315000,Bart Simpson,Krustylu Studios,"Milhouse, I'm gonna win that thing."
127937,493,35,1315000,Milhouse Van Houten,Krustylu Studios,"How do you know, Bart? Maybe for once I'll win."
127938,493,36,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,Children of troubled marriages not eligible.
127941,493,39,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,So... why are you here? Is it about that unauthorized Krusty lookalike I hired for Lisa's first communion? What was his name?
127942,493,40,1315000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Krappy the Klunk.
127943,493,41,1315000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,See?
127944,493,42,1315000,Female Marketing Executive,Simpson Home,"Homer, we're here to throw the most redonkulous marketing outreach this town's ever seen. All you have to do is invite every cool person you know."
127945,493,43,1315000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I wrote the application. Do any of my friends get to come?"
127946,493,44,1315000,Male Marketing Executive,Simpson Home,"One friend. He can listen to music with headphones on, he gets one slice of cheese pizza, and if the party gets slow, he has to pretend to let Krusty save him from drowning."
127947,493,45,1315000,Female Marketing Executive,Simpson Home,Redonkulous!
127948,493,46,1315000,Male Marketing Executive,Simpson Home,Off the dilge!
127950,493,48,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This party is so much better than the crummy ones we plan.
127951,493,49,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I hope Bart's having fun.
127952,493,50,1315000,Sideshow Mel,Simpson Home,And that's why John Gielgud is more of a father to me than my own father!
127953,493,51,1315000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Where's the nachos you promised?
127954,493,52,1315000,Sideshow Mel,Simpson Home,There'll be time enough for nachos!
127955,493,53,1315000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,Why can't I go to the grownup room?
127956,493,54,1315000,Sideshow Mel,Simpson Home,You said the clown scared you.
127957,493,55,1315000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,Well he did a little.
127929,493,57,1315000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Living Room,"Boy, everyone from the nuclear plant is here. Except the bosses, of course."
127959,493,58,1315000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Living Room,"Yeah, even Homer's not dumb enough to invite..."
126602,493,59,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,So!
127960,493,60,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,"This is the famous ""party."""

127962,493,62,1315000,Female Marketing Executive,Simpson Living Room,He's destroying our youthful demographic!
127963,493,63,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Living Room,"Oh God, I need a drink!"
127964,493,64,1315000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Living Room,...so the car in front of us forgot to validate his... um...
127965,493,65,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,I was in an anecdote once!
127966,493,66,1315000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Living Room,"Um, I have surgery in the morning."
127967,493,67,1315000,Worker,Simpson Living Room,Yeah and... I'm the one having the surgery.
127968,493,68,1315000,Female Marketing Executive,Simpson Living Room,"Homer, you're the nominal host! Do something!"
127970,493,70,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Mr. Burns, so glad you're here! Finally the party can get started!"
127971,493,71,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,Your cotillion seems to be in full promenade.
127972,493,72,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Good one... uh... Mr. Burns, everyone is dying to hear you sing karaoke."
127973,493,73,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"C'mon, just pick a popular song."
127974,493,74,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,Do you have anything by Prince... Wilhelm of Prussia?
127975,493,75,1315000,Karaoke Operator,Simpson Living Room,"I have sixteen million songs, but, uh, no."
127976,493,76,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Just play the oldest, stupidest thing in your catalog."
127977,493,77,1315000,Karaoke Operator,Simpson Living Room,Let me check my beeswax cylinders.
127978,493,78,1315000,Karaoke Operator,Simpson Living Room,"Ah, here we are..."

127986,493,86,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Indeed. That Homer Simpson is the beating baboon heart of this party.
127987,493,87,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"...So he says, ""Bigamy is having one too many wives."" To which I replied, ""So's monogamy."""
127988,493,88,1315000,Cletus Spuckler,Simpson Home,/ Yeah!
127989,493,89,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,I may have a use for this Simpson character higher up in the organization.
127991,493,90,1315000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,Really? Well... as safety inspector he hasn't exactly set the world on fire. Although he came close several times.
127993,493,92,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Simpson, you're probably wondering why you're here."
127994,493,93,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"It's never good. I always wind up being chased by hounds, or falling through a trap door...or being a peg in your game of human croquet..."
127995,493,94,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"When I made you a hoop you split your pants! Now here at the plant there's no position more important than our accounts man, who's responsible for glad-handing our customers and suppliers. I'd like you to take over that position."
127996,493,95,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"The last thing I understood in that was ""pants."""
127997,493,96,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Just give me your answer! And make it quick! Our current ""account man,"" Robert Marlowe here, is retiring at the end of the month."
127998,493,97,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,In two weeks the only tie I'll be wearing is for autoerotic pleasure.
127999,493,98,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes. Simpson, only you have the bonhomie and rotund charm to replace him. It means a hefty expense account and a corner office."
128000,493,99,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, in that case..."
128001,493,100,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Before you say yes, Simpson, I feel it's my duty to warn you... ...account men lose their soul."
128002,493,101,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Woo hoo! No more church!
128003,493,102,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"So long, Sector 7-G...hello, Sector 22-F!"
128007,493,106,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"The higher they rise, the further they fall!"
128008,493,107,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You know, you're kind of a downer."
128009,493,108,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I thought you were retiring. Why are you still here?
128010,493,109,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, you're a baby account man. Still on the bottle. So for my last good deed before I retire, I'm gonna help you persuade Mayor Quimby to sign off on a nuclear rate hike."
128011,493,110,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh-oh, a meeting with the Mayor. How do I prepare for that?"
128012,493,111,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I see. Now, how do I prepare for the meeting with the Mayor?"
128013,493,112,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I am really enjoying this, but, um... Hello! Meeting with the Mayor?"
128014,493,113,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Awww... bourbon go bye-bye.
128015,493,114,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"There ain't enough bourbon in Kentucky for you, big guy."
128016,493,115,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, the governor wrote me a letter to that effect."
128019,493,118,1315000,Homer Simpson,Chophouse,"Wow, I can't believe I'm eating steak with the Mayor. The next time I vote for you it's gonna be on purpose."
128020,493,119,1315000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Chophouse,"Much obliged. Now, ah, where would you uh like to discuss your proposed tax breaks?"
128021,493,120,1315000,Carl Carlson,Chophouse,"Hey Homer! / Look at you, man!"
128022,493,121,1315000,Homer Simpson,Chophouse,I've outgrown you!
128023,493,122,1315000,Homer Simpson,Chophouse,"Ah, Mr. Mayor! More peanut nore?"
128024,493,123,1315000,Carl Carlson,Chophouse,"Say what you will, man, he's pretty resourceful."
128027,493,126,1315000,Homer Simpson,SPORTS STADIUM,"Wow, these seats are amazing."
128028,493,127,1315000,Robert Marlowe,SPORTS STADIUM,And if you don't like the score you can change it yourself.
128029,493,128,1315000,Homer Simpson,SPORTS STADIUM,Bo-ring.
128030,493,129,1315000,Homer Simpson,SPORTS STADIUM,"God, what a great game! And you too can be on the winning team, Mr. Mayor. The Springfield Nuclear Team."
128031,493,130,1315000,Mayor Joe Quimby,SPORTS STADIUM,I have never heard an analogy involving sports! I love it!
128033,493,132,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I can't believe that was work!
128034,493,133,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, but work is over now. Wanna drink with me till I fall asleep?"
128035,493,134,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, well..."
128036,493,135,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I really should look at this picture a little longer.
128037,493,136,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Okay, let's go."
128038,493,137,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Great. Now in honor of my last day on the hamster wheel, I have a little gift for you."
128039,493,138,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,This set of bar tools has been passed down from account man to account man since the dawn of history... 1956.
128040,493,139,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Can you be my dad?
128041,493,140,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,If your mom was a secretary there's a good chance I am.
127990,493,142,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Welcome home, handsome!"
128043,493,143,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's a rat race, but it looks like I won."
128044,493,144,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,To the victor go the spoils.
128045,493,145,1315000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you were supposed to read me a bedtime story."
128046,493,146,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh sorry, sweetie. Bart can read it to you."
128047,493,147,1315000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Read to Lisa? Why don't you just ask me to kiss her?
128048,493,148,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,If you kissed her that would be lovely.
128049,493,149,1315000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll read! I'll read!
128050,493,150,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And kiss.
128051,493,151,1315000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Does anybody want my opinion?
128052,493,152,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Please, Lisa. I had eighteen martinis today."
128053,493,153,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hel-lo.
128055,493,155,1315000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"All right, Lis, let's get this stupid bedtime story over with."

128062,493,162,1315000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Well, I could help you..."
128063,493,163,1315000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"I don't want your help! I'll get one of those jobs where you don't need to read, like French fry maker or general."
128064,493,164,1315000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Well, you're getting my help."
128065,493,165,1315000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Forget it.
128066,493,166,1315000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Don't you want to be able to read the things people carve into your chest in prison?
128067,493,167,1315000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,I guess.
128068,493,168,1315000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Close enough.
128070,493,170,1315000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"""But when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo found her promise very hard to keep."""
128071,493,171,1315000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"We did it, Bart! I'm a mentor!"
128072,493,172,1315000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Big deal. You taught me to read one book.
128073,493,173,1315000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No Bart! You can read other books too!
128074,493,174,1315000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What?!
128075,493,175,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, what are you doing?"
128076,493,176,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,My work is so meaningless.
128077,493,177,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You make electricity. It runs the hospital!
128078,493,178,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You can't touch electricity, Marge. You can't feel it."
128079,493,179,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's because it would kill you.
128080,493,180,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It already is killing me, Marge. You're the only one I can talk to. My wife just doesn't get it."
128081,493,181,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm your wife.
128082,493,182,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"My job is my wife. Loneliness, my mistress. Despair, my sex buddy. Angst is a chick I met online, but then it turned out it was really a guy."
128083,493,183,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm going to bed.
128084,493,184,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't understand me. Only she understands me.
128085,493,185,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Another round, kid?"
128086,493,186,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... I got here after you did.
128088,493,188,1315000,Marge Simpson,Condo Skyscraper,"I'm sorry to bother you at home, Mr. Marlowe..."
128090,493,190,1315000,Marge Simpson,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,...but my husband's acting pretty odd. Coming home late. Drinking in the morning.

128092,493,192,1315000,Marge Simpson,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,I don't suppose you'd consider taking your old job back so Homie can go back to his old job?
128093,493,193,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,"Sorry, Marge. That account job hollowed me out like a cheap chocolate bunny. I've been divorced three times, I've got a cocktail addiction, a shrimp cocktail addiction, and I can't stop bending women to my sexual will."
128094,493,194,1315000,Marge Simpson,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,"Well, you certainly won't be bending me-- Wait, how did I end up in your bedroom?"
128095,493,195,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,"Lady, I am smoother than an Eisenhower-era freeway."
128096,493,196,1315000,Marge Simpson,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,"Look, I came to talk about my husband, and... How did we get in here?"
128097,493,197,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,I think better in the shower. There's room in here for two.
128098,493,198,1315000,Marge Simpson,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,I'm a happily married woman!
128099,493,199,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,"Wow, no woman's ever done that to me before. Your husband is a lucky man."
128100,493,200,1315000,Marge Simpson,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,I know! And I don't want him to stray from anything except his diet. And I don't really want him to do that.
128102,493,201,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,"Marge, I made a big mistake years ago -- I gave up on my family. Then I gave up on my secret other family. I missed my son's graduation, my father's funeral and my dog's best in show. Don't let Homer make the mistakes I did."
128103,493,202,1315000,Marge Simpson,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,Luann?
128104,493,203,1315000,Luann Van Houten,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,It's not what you think.
128105,493,204,1315000,Kirk Van Houten,Robert Marlowe's Fancy Apartment,It's much weirder.
128107,493,206,1315000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,You're reading a chapter book! For fun. Bullies! To me!
128108,493,207,1315000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,Let's see the name of this wedgie ticket.
128110,493,209,1315000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"""Little Women?"" Are you aware that's another way of saying ""girls?"""
128111,493,210,1315000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Look, I had to read it to my sister."
128112,493,211,1315000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Elementary School,Well maybe we should hear a little.
128113,493,212,1315000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,And then maybe you'll be hearing from my sisters.
128114,493,213,1315000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,Your fists are sisters?
128115,493,214,1315000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,Yeah. Poke-ahontas and Sock-ajawea!

128118,493,217,1315000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"""...and Amy and Jo hugged one another close, and everything was forgotten in one hearty kiss."" End of chapter eight."
128119,493,218,1315000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Elementary School,You can't stop now! I want to know if their father comes home.
128120,493,219,1315000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,Does Jo learn to handle her hasty temper?
128121,493,220,1315000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,Does Amy get over her conceitedness?
128122,493,221,1315000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Aw, come on, guys, it's getting dark."
128123,493,222,1315000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,Okay. But you better be here tomorrow after school.
128124,493,223,1315000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,'Cause we're gonna keep making you read us a lame old girl's book!
128126,493,225,1315000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,Bart needs to work on differentiating the character voices a little better.
128127,493,226,1315000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Elementary School,"I know! I keep going ""why is Meg saying that,"" and then I realize it's Beth."
128128,493,227,1315000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,/ That's right.
128130,493,229,1315000,Dottie,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Your wife is here, Mr. S."
128131,493,230,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Tell her I'm at a meeting, not drinking..."
128132,493,231,1315000,Dottie,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,This is a whisper-amplifying intercom!
128134,493,233,1315000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Homer, I want you to come with me and the kids on a family vacation."
128135,493,234,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Of course, of course. Family is everything to us company men. Now, where shall we go on your vacation?"
128136,493,235,1315000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,The farthest thing from this office I know: rafting down Rattler River Canyon.
128137,493,236,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"That's great, let me run the numbers because I really want the Simpson account. And give these cigars to your children."
128138,493,237,1315000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Don't talk to me like I'm a client!
128139,493,238,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You're not a client. You're the client.
128141,493,240,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Simpson! Put on your charm-their-pants-off pants! The mumpish oafs in Washington are sending their sternest band of nuclear regulators, handpicked to resist all blandishment."
128142,493,241,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'll handle it. I always do.
128143,493,242,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Rafting, eh? It's a perfect way to entertain them. Finally, humanity has found a use for water."
128144,493,243,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Mr. Burns, I can't go rafting with you because-- wait a minute, could this all work?"
128145,493,244,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh no you don't.
128146,493,245,1315000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Coggily-doggily.
128147,493,246,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"It all fits. Mr. Burns, rafting it is."
128148,493,247,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Excellent.
128149,493,248,1315000,Dottie,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"But Mr. S... you just promised this week to Mrs. S, Master B., and Mamselles L. and M.!"
128150,493,249,1315000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Now relax, Dottie. Leave everything to me."
128152,493,251,1315000,Homer Simpson,Rattler River Canyon,"Oh Marge, this is the most romantic trip you ever nagged me into."
128153,493,252,1315000,Marge Simpson,Rattler River Canyon,And maybe when we get home we can ride down something else.
128154,493,253,1315000,Homer Simpson,Rattler River Canyon,"Not sure what you're going for, but"
128155,493,254,1315000,Homer Simpson,Rattler River Canyon,"Uh... Marge, why don't I catch us some salmon?"
128156,493,255,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Rattler River Canyon,It's about time. We've been making small talk about Mussolini for fifteen minutes.
128157,493,256,1315000,Homer Simpson,Rattler River Canyon,"Well I, uh, found that contact lens I was missing. Lemme just screw her back in."
128158,493,257,1315000,Homer Simpson,Rattler River Canyon,"So, everybody good?"
128159,493,258,1315000,Regulator,Rattler River Canyon,"Why did you get us ""Diversity Kittens on Melting Pot Mountain?"""
128160,493,259,1315000,Diversity Kitten,Rattler River Canyon,It's more fun to play with a ball of yarn if it has all the colors in it.
128161,493,260,1315000,Wheelchair Kitten,Rattler River Canyon,And yarn should be allowed to marry dental floss!
128162,493,261,1315000,Homer Simpson,Rattler River Canyon,"Uh-oh. If you've got that, then..."
128164,493,263,1315000,Skanky Girl,Simpson Raft,Are you sure you're Martin Scorsese?
128165,493,264,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Raft,Enjoy the outdoors you stupid kid!
128166,493,265,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Raft,This family time is so precious. Gotta go.
128168,493,267,1315000,Regulator,Simpson Raft,"Homer! I want a Long Island ice tea, America's most complicated cocktail."
128169,493,268,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Raft,Homer! Are you... schmoozing those men?
128171,493,270,1315000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Raft,"Um, I think we're supposed to get off here."
128172,493,271,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Raft,"Take us out first! Anyone can start a family! These days, no one can find a job!"
128173,493,272,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Raft,"Let's see, my family gives me love and sex. My work gives me money and sleep..."
128174,493,273,1315000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Raft,Hurry! We're heading for the falls!
128175,493,274,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Raft,My co-workers are like a family. But in some ways my family is like a family too...
128176,493,275,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Raft,"For God's sakes, Homer! I've given you three children!"
128177,493,276,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Raft,Whose side are you on?
128178,493,277,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Raft,"Yours, Homie. I'm always on yours."
128179,493,278,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Raft,How ironic. I survived the Titanic by making a raft out of steerage passengers and now this!
128180,493,279,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Simpson Raft,"Mr. Burns, your heart will go on!"
128181,493,280,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Raft,Marlowe? I thought you retired!
128182,493,281,1315000,Robert Marlowe,Simpson Raft,I can't! Treasury Bills are paying nothing! Nothing!
128184,493,283,1315000,C. Montgomery Burns,Riverbank,"Well, Simpson, you were willing to let me go over a waterfall, but you cut operating expenses by six percent, so you're forgiven."
128185,493,284,1315000,Homer Simpson,Riverbank,"Thanks. Now if you'll excuse me, I don't really like bourbon or business talk, just good old Simpson family fun."
128186,493,285,1315000,Homer Simpson,Riverbank,"Hey kids, I'm it!"
128187,493,286,1315000,Homer Simpson,Riverbank,I'm okay! And I found some gold!
128101,493,287,1315000,Marge Simpson,Riverbank,See? Luckiest man in the world.
128188,493,289,1315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm so glad you're not an Accounts Man anymore."
128189,493,290,1315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yep, your worries are over. I'm back to being a boring old Safety Inspector at a nuclear power plant."
