75592,296,55,254000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because she took the trouble to wander away and talk to a stranger.

75639,296,102,453000,Lenny Leonard,Lenny's Apartment,"Oh, I share a common wall with a jai alai court."
75641,296,104,459000,Lenny Leonard,Lenny's Apartment,That's just the sound of the pelota hitting the fronton. I find it soothing.

75651,296,114,504000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Dad, we have to find a place soon. I really have to go to the bathroom and I'm out of tokens."
75652,296,115,509000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"You know, I heard of a new reality show where they let you live in a home for free."
75653,296,116,513000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh yeah, the gimmick is, it's a house from 1895. And you gotta do everything like they did back then."
75654,296,117,519000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"1895, forget it. We'd be too late to save Lincoln and too early to save Kennedy."
75655,296,118,524000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,You could save McKinley.
75656,296,119,525000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"It's not a time machine, Moe."

75669,296,132,575000,Homer Simpson,TESTING ROOM,I'll teach you to whistle on the Sabbath!
75670,296,133,578000,Female Executive,TESTING ROOM,They go to pieces over nothing. They're perfect for reality TV.
75671,296,134,583000,Homer Simpson,TESTING ROOM,Where's that kid with my latte?!
75672,296,135,585000,Homer Simpson,TESTING ROOM,"He's not coming, is he? Is he?"

75726,296,188,797000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yeah, I can't wait to see which one of 'em dies first."
75727,296,189,799000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Look, we can't give up. We're on TV. And when you're on TV, you dig in your claws and you never let go. Just like Bill Moyers!"
75728,296,190,820000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Telegram for Heywood U. Cuddlemee. Heywood U. Cuddlemee? Big guy in the back, Heywood U. Cuddlemee? He-- Ooh, that little... Ooh! I'm gonna drive a golden spike where your union meets your central pacific. Stop."

75737,296,199,887000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,This is boring.
75738,296,200,888000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yeah, switch it to the Elderly Animal Channel."
75742,296,204,907000,Female Executive,REALITY CHANNEL STUDIOS,The show's getting boring -- we're losing viewers.
75743,296,205,909000,Mitch,REALITY CHANNEL STUDIOS,"I have an idea. It's crazy, but it just might work. Like it did last week. On another show. We bring in the biggest, most famous star from a 70's sitcom whose phone hasn't been disconnected."
74948,296,207,923000,David Lander,1895 HOUSE,Hello!
75684,296,208,924000,Marge Simpson,1895 HOUSE,Squiggy?

75746,296,210,930000,David Lander,1895 HOUSE,"'Cause nobody's watching you clowns! If you was to ask me, you're all too calm and happy. The essence of drama is conflict. That's why they gave me this taser."
75748,296,212,945000,Mitch,REALITY CHANNEL STUDIOS,All right. This still isn't working. To fix this show is gonna take some original thinking. Everyone pull out your TVs and start flipping around.
75749,296,213,953000,Female Executive,REALITY CHANNEL STUDIOS,I think I've got an idea... turn to channel twenty-four.
75751,296,215,964000,David Lander,1895 HOUSE,"Hello, Laverne... Hello, Laverne..."
75753,296,217,973000,David Lander,House,"Hello, Laverne..."

75758,296,222,988000,Homer Simpson,House,Lisa! Explain!
75759,296,223,990000,Lisa Simpson,House,I guess the network made our show more exciting by dumping the house in a river.
75760,296,224,994000,Homer Simpson,House,Marge! Throw me an old-timey rope in an old-timey way!
75761,296,225,999000,Marge Simpson,House,This rope was woven from handlebar mustaches.
75763,296,227,1005000,Homer Simpson,1895 HOUSE,"You monsters! You've turned this show into a ""Survivor"" clone."
75765,296,229,1009000,Mitch,REALITY CHANNEL STUDIOS,"Mr. Simpson, your contract allows us to do anything we want to you."
75766,296,230,1013000,Homer Simpson,REALITY CHANNEL STUDIOS,"I would never sign that! Unless there was a red sticker that said ""sign here."""
75767,296,231,1015000,Mitch,REALITY CHANNEL STUDIOS,"Uh-huh, that's what we used."
75768,296,232,1020000,Homer Simpson,REALITY CHANNEL STUDIOS,Where do you get those things anyway?
75771,296,235,1042000,Marge Simpson,1895 HOUSE,"Oh no, everything's ruined. Our good bellows... our stereopticon... Squiggy! Homer, your strop! Your strop!"
75772,296,236,1059000,Homer Simpson,1895 HOUSE,Our lives are ruined!
75773,296,237,1061000,Mitch,1895 HOUSE,"Oh yeah, this is great stuff."
75774,296,238,1063000,Mitch,1895 HOUSE,"Let's take lunch, people."
75775,296,239,1065000,Bart Simpson,1895 HOUSE,Do we get lunch?
75776,296,240,1066000,Mitch,1895 HOUSE,"We're not allowed to interfere with the reality of the show, which reminds me... Burn the leftovers! Leave nothing!"
75777,296,241,1073000,Homer Simpson,1895 HOUSE,I can't remember the last time I cried like this.
75778,296,242,1076000,Lisa Simpson,1895 HOUSE,When you put your T-shirt on backwards?
75779,296,243,1078000,Homer Simpson,1895 HOUSE,"Oh, yes! The tag chafed my throat! Let's go eat some bugs."
75781,296,245,1095000,Man,Clearing,Psst! Psst!
75782,296,246,1100000,Homer Simpson,Clearing,"Savages! I'll handle this, Marge."
75783,296,247,1105000,Homer Simpson,Clearing,We come in peace. We takem your land.
75784,296,248,1108000,BEARDED MAN,Clearing,We're not savages. I'm a paralegal from Cleveland.
75785,296,249,1111000,Female Castaway,Clearing,And I'm a nutritionist from Santa Fe.
75786,296,250,1113000,BEARDED MAN,Clearing,"We were a ""tribe"" on another reality show, but we lost the final challenge."
75787,296,251,1117000,Sad Man,Clearing,I just couldn't eat any more kangaroo testicles.
75788,296,252,1120000,Female Castaway,Clearing,So the show just abandoned us here.
75789,296,253,1121000,Sad Man,Clearing,"The weird part is, now I can't get enough of them."
75790,296,254,1124000,BEARDED MAN,Clearing,But now we're going to escape. We're going to overpower your crew and return to civilization.
75791,296,255,1128000,Homer Simpson,Clearing,"Wow. Marge, I think I figured out their primitive language!"
75792,296,256,1133000,Marge Simpson,Clearing,That's my Homie!
75794,296,258,1136000,Mitch,HILLY AREA,Is it so gosh darn hard to get cocktail sauce in the middle of the Amazon?
75796,296,260,1161000,Cameraman #1,HILLY AREA,"Geez, now we know what it feels like to be tormented."
75797,296,261,1164000,Cameraman #2,HILLY AREA,And yet I've learned nothing.
75798,296,262,1172000,Homer Simpson,HILLY AREA,And now to wreck their precious helicopter.
75799,296,263,1175000,Marge Simpson,HILLY AREA,"No, Homer, no! That's our only way home!"
75800,296,264,1178000,Homer Simpson,HILLY AREA,"Yeah, but... okay... Oh..."
75801,296,265,1184000,Homer Simpson,HILLY AREA,That Lenny sure had a crazy apartment.
75803,296,267,1190000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, it sure is good to be home."
75804,296,268,1193000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No more reality shows for us. Let's watch some quality scripted television.
75805,296,269,1216000,Cop #1,Simpson Home,"Well, here's the thing, Inspector. The button for five doesn't light up."
75806,296,270,1221000,Cop #2,Simpson Home,I think I'm gonna be sick.
75807,296,271,1222000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it! TV was the one good thing in my life and now I can't enjoy it any more.
75808,296,272,1229000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, I guess we'll have to find a new way to entertain ourselves."
75809,296,273,1233000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What about books?
75810,296,274,1234000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah. If we read books we could form a club.
75811,296,275,1237000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,If we formed a club we could serve drinks.
75812,296,276,1239000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Dad, why don't we watch you drink from a hose?"
75813,296,277,1242000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good idea, Lisa."
75814,296,278,1245000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, the water's off. I'll use my eye to see what the trouble is."
75815,296,279,1250000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, off again. Maybe I can hear what's going on."
75816,296,280,1259000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, this has become a game of wits, has it?"
75817,296,281,1263000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Perhaps my other eye will get to the bottom of this.
