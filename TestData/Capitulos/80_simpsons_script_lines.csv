14085,80,171,767000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Courtroom,"And if we freeze on frame 138 , we distinctly see a puff of blue hair coming from the grassy knoll..."
14086,80,172,775000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,"Now, Apu, Mrs. Simpson claims that she forgot she was carrying that bottle of..."
14087,80,173,781000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,Delicious... bourbon... brownest of the brown liquors... so tempting... What's that? You want me to drink you? But I'm in the middle of a trial... Excuse me.

14096,80,182,831000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Courtroom,"You are wearing a red and white striped club tie, in a half Windsor knot."
14097,80,183,836000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,"Oh, I am, am I? Is that what you think? Well, if that is what you think, I have something to tell you. Something that may shock and discredit you. And that thing is as follows..."
14098,80,184,850000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,I'm not wearing a tie at all.
14099,80,185,855000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Courtroom,"But, if I am wrong about that, maybe I am wrong about Mrs. Simpson."

14105,80,191,871000,Lionel Hutz,Simpson Home,"Uh, was he the black guy on the Mod Squad?"
14106,80,192,874000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Mr. Hutz when I grow up I want to be a lawyer just like you.
14107,80,193,878000,Lionel Hutz,Simpson Home,"Good for you, son. If there's one thing American needs, it's more lawyers. Can you imagine a world without lawyers?"
14110,80,196,892000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,"... And so, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... I rest my case."
14111,80,197,897000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Mr. Hutz, do you know you're not wearing any pants?"
14112,80,198,901000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,What?

14116,80,202,913000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,The lawyer.
14117,80,203,913000,Lionel Hutz,Courtroom,Right.
14118,80,204,915000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,The foreman will pass the verdict to the Bailiff.
14119,80,205,920000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,This verdict is written on a cocktail napkin!
14120,80,206,923000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"... And it still says ""guilty!"" ... And ""guilty"" is spelled wrong!"
