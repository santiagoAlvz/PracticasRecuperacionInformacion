52504,220,1,66000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Mmm.
52505,220,2,85000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So I said to that nurse, ""You can take your free tetanus shot and shove it."""
52506,220,3,85000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you told her, Dad."
52507,220,4,93000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You better believe I did.
52509,220,6,100000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You still haven't told us why Lenny bit you.
52510,220,7,103000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I really gave him no choice. Y'see..."
52511,220,8,105000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Lousy meat-eating scum.
52512,220,9,107000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh?
52513,220,10,108000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Not you.
52515,220,11,111000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm going over to protest this disgusting new restaurant called ""The Slaughterhouse."" It's decorated with hanging steer carcasses and a fountain of blood."
52516,220,12,119000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, I heard about that place on ""The Red Grocer."""
52517,220,13,123000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"The worst part is, you pick out your own cow and they kill it right in front of you!"
52518,220,14,127000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, maybe the animals don't mind, honey. They might enjoy being the center of attention."
52519,220,15,133000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I think I read somewhere that cows like being killed.
52520,220,16,136000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wait. There's a place like that in Springfield?! Then why are we eating this crap?
52521,220,17,142000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, everybody, we're going to the Slaughterhouse!"
52522,220,18,146000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You didn't need to knock the food on the floor.
52523,220,19,149000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Didn't I?
52525,220,21,159000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,Wow. It's even more wonderful than Lisa said!
52526,220,22,164000,Marge Simpson,Slaughterhouse,Ooh-woo. A complimentary basket of hooves.
52527,220,23,168000,Marge Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Beef salad, beef on the cob, beef-fried beef, uh... Is there anything on the menu that isn't meat?"
52528,220,24,174000,Waiter,Slaughterhouse,"Ha, not likely."
52529,220,25,175000,Bart Simpson,Slaughterhouse,Cool. Even this menu is made of meat. It's an entire chicken pounded flat.
52530,220,26,180000,Marge Simpson,Slaughterhouse,How clever! The kids' menu's on the beak.
52531,220,27,184000,C. Montgomery Burns,Slaughterhouse,"Mm, I think I'll take... Ooh, that one."
52532,220,28,189000,C. Montgomery Burns,Slaughterhouse,"No, he's a bit listless, isn't he? Give me... Ooh, that spirited fellow..."
52533,220,29,195000,C. Montgomery Burns,Slaughterhouse,"Oof. Well, he didn't put up much of a fight. Uh, why don't you pick one for me?"
52534,220,30,202000,C. Montgomery Burns,Slaughterhouse,"On second thought, I'll just have a glass of milk. From that cow."
52536,220,32,210000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Wait a minute. Is this the biggest steak you've got? 72 ounces? I thought this was supposed to be a steakhouse, not a little... girly... underpantsy... pink doily... tea party place."
52537,220,33,222000,Waiter,Slaughterhouse,"Well, there is one steak that's only available by special request, uh... We call it, uh, ""Sir Loin-A-Lot."" It's, uh, the size of a Boogie-board."
52538,220,34,229000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Oooh, I'll have that one. And to drink... ... meatballs."
52539,220,35,233000,Waiter,Slaughterhouse,"Very good, sir."
52540,220,36,236000,Waiter,Slaughterhouse,Ladies and gentlemen... This brave man has accepted the Sir Loin-A-Lot challenge. He will pit his stomach against sixteen pounds of indomitable tenderloin.
52541,220,37,247000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,They like me because I'm brave.
52542,220,38,249000,Waiter,Slaughterhouse,Only two people have ever finished the whole thing.
52543,220,39,254000,RED,Slaughterhouse,"Uh, if you want some friendly advice, pal, I wouldn't tackle the big'un right away."
52544,220,40,258000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,Oh yeah? What do you know about it? Y--
52545,220,41,271000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,It's you! You're him! You're Tony Randall!
52546,220,42,275000,RED,Slaughterhouse,"Red Barclay's my name. I'm a trucker, and I've eaten steaks from coast to coast, with taters and toast. Take my advice, this one's not for greenhorns."
52547,220,43,284000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,Greenhorns! Who's a greenhorn? What's a greenhorn?
52548,220,44,289000,Bart Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"It's an insult. Sock him, Dad. Sock everybody."
52549,220,45,292000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Oh, you're just jealous 'cause you don't have the belly for it anymore. Mr. No-Belly... Mr... Hasn't-Got-A-Belly..."
52550,220,46,300000,RED,Slaughterhouse,"Well... I have just finished a whole lamb, but, uh, I reckon I could take you to school. You're on, boy."
52551,220,47,312000,Marge Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Is it safe to eat that much food, Dr. Hibbert?"
52552,220,48,314000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Slaughterhouse,"You know, I wouldn't have thought so before I bought 12 per cent of this restaurant. But now I feel a balanced diet can include the occasional eating contest."
52553,220,49,322000,Marge Simpson,Slaughterhouse,But what if he chokes?
52554,220,50,323000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Slaughterhouse,Not to worry. We have the latest Heimlich machine.
52555,220,51,334000,Waiter,Slaughterhouse,"On your left, the pride of the American trucking industry, Reliable Red Barclay!"
52556,220,52,344000,Waiter,Slaughterhouse,"And on your right, Homer somebody!"
52557,220,53,346000,Bart Simpson,Slaughterhouse,Go Dad!
52558,220,54,347000,Marge Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Yeah, c'mon Homie!"
52559,220,55,348000,Bart Simpson,Slaughterhouse,Go! Go! Go!
52560,220,56,348000,Waiter,Slaughterhouse,Gluttons to your marks...
52561,220,57,348000,Waiter,Slaughterhouse,Annnnd... gorge!
52562,220,58,354000,Diners,Slaughterhouse,Chew! Chew! Chew!
52563,220,59,357000,Diners,Slaughterhouse,Chew! Chew! Chew!
52565,220,61,360000,Marge Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"No, Homer! Don't fill up on bread!"
52566,220,62,362000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Huh? Oh, right. The steak."
52567,220,63,368000,Bart Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Come on, Dad, pick up the pace. Chew and swallow, no savoring."
52514,220,64,372000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,Must eat beef... must defeat guy I just met...
52569,220,65,383000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,So much steak... lungs filling... sinuses packed with meat...
52570,220,66,388000,Bart Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Come on, Dad, just twelve more pounds."
52572,220,68,394000,Cow #1,Slaughterhouse,"Oh, humans are so ridiculous. He's not even halfway through Walter and he's already hallucinating."
52573,220,69,402000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,Lousy drunks. I'll show them.
52574,220,70,416000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,What's happening to me? There's still food... but I don't want to eat it. I've become everything I've ever hated.
52575,220,71,430000,Waiter,Slaughterhouse,"The winner and still champion, Reliable Red Barclay!"
52576,220,72,436000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"My hat's off to you, Red. You're a true American hero. And you did it with style and dignity and... Hey, you're not breathing. Don't people usually breathe?"
52577,220,73,449000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Slaughterhouse,This man is dead. Looks to me like beef poisoning.
52579,220,75,454000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Slaughterhouse,Probably from some other restaurant.
52581,220,77,465000,Waiter,Slaughterhouse,You'd better take one of these too. He's eaten quite a lot.
52582,220,78,469000,Red's Friend #1,Slaughterhouse,There goes the finest trucker who ever lived.
52583,220,79,472000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"He called me ""Greenhorn."" I called him Tony Randall. It was a thing we had."
52584,220,80,478000,Red's Friend #2,Slaughterhouse,"In 38 years, he never missed a shipment. But I guess this is one delivery ol' Red won't be making."
52585,220,81,485000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Oh yes he will! And on time, too!"
52586,220,82,489000,Marge Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Oh no. Oh, no..."
52587,220,83,492000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"I've got to, honey. I owe it to ol' Red, as both his friend and his killer."
52588,220,84,497000,Bart Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Oh, lemme go with you, Dad!"
52589,220,85,498000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,Don't you have school?
52590,220,86,499000,Bart Simpson,Slaughterhouse,Don't you have work?
52591,220,87,500000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Ah, touch√©."
52592,220,88,502000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Bye, Marge!"

52594,220,90,507000,Marge Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Good-bye, Homer."
52595,220,91,508000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,That didn't sound like you meant it.
52596,220,92,510000,Marge Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"Oh, all right. Good-bye, sweetheart, have a nice trip."
52597,220,93,513000,Homer Simpson,Slaughterhouse,"That's more like it. So long, suckers!"
52600,220,95,529000,Homer Simpson,Red's Truck,Why you gotta... Come on! Ah! Now I'm gettin' the hang of this thing. I don't know why I didn't become a trucker before.
52601,220,96,540000,Bart Simpson,Red's Truck,"Well, you're not really a trucker now."
52602,220,97,541000,Homer Simpson,Red's Truck,"Oh, yeah? My left arm says different."
52603,220,98,544000,Bart Simpson,Red's Truck,"Well, according to Red's schedule, we have to make it to Atlanta in three days."
52604,220,99,548000,Homer Simpson,Red's Truck,Piece o' cake. Just need a little truck-driving music.

52611,220,109,589000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, Dad and Bart have been everywhere! They've eaten submarine sandwiches, grinders, and hoagies."
52612,220,110,595000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not fair. Your father always gets to have such exciting adventures. Maybe it's time we took a walk on the wild side...
52614,220,112,605000,Lisa Simpson,Downtown Springfield,We're buying a new doorbell?
52615,220,113,607000,Marge Simpson,Downtown Springfield,A musical doorbell!

52632,220,129,680000,Homer Simpson,Truck Stop,Wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop? Watching all the people come and go. You could have a different best friend every day.
52633,220,130,687000,Bart Simpson,Truck Stop,I suppose.
52634,220,131,687000,Homer Simpson,Truck Stop,"Great. I'll write your mother and tell her the marriage is off. And then when the paperwork is done, I'll make Gwenn my wife."

52644,220,141,719000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"If your father was here, there'd be process servers, repo men, and bounty hunters to beat the band."
52645,220,142,725000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait, people are coming. I think they're Jehovah's Witnesses."
52646,220,143,728000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Yess!!
52647,220,144,731000,Missionary #1,Simpson Home,"Wait, Marlon. You know, I just had a thought. Maybe we're bothering people by trying to change their religion. What if we don't have all the answers?"
52648,220,145,737000,Missionary #2,Simpson Home,"You're right, Noreen. Let's go get real jobs."
52649,220,146,744000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I would have feigned interest.
52650,220,147,750000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Still no visitors! It's time we opened up a can of whup-tushy on this situation. What's the number for Luigi's?

52668,220,167,814000,Homer Simpson,DRIVE-IN,It ate everybody.
52669,220,168,816000,Homer Simpson,DRIVE-IN,Stupid!
52671,220,170,819000,Homer Simpson,Highway,I bet ol' Red caught himself a mess o' catfish with these fishing sticks.
52672,220,171,824000,Bart Simpson,Highway,"Uh-huh. Bet he used bait, too."
52673,220,172,826000,Homer Simpson,Highway,"Relax, boy. We're ahead of schedule."
52674,220,173,828000,Bart Simpson,Highway,"Actually, we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours."
52675,220,174,831000,Homer Simpson,Highway,Ten hours?! We gotta roll!
52677,220,176,838000,Homer Simpson,Roadside Market,"Uh, yeah. I need something that'll keep me awake, alert, and reckless all night long."
52678,220,177,842000,Clerk,Roadside Market,"Well, Congress is racing back to Washington to outlaw these..."

52680,220,179,848000,Clerk,Roadside Market,Hey! You can't take that many pep pills at once!
52681,220,180,851000,Homer Simpson,Roadside Market,No problem. I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills.
52683,220,182,858000,Homer Simpson,Red's Truck,Okay-We're-All-Set-Let's-Put-The-Pedal-To-The-Metal!
52684,220,183,864000,Homer Simpson,Red's Truck,"I whole-heartedly-agree. Oh-man-I'm-really-wired. This-is-a-big-mistake-I-can... Ohhh, here comes the sleeping pills. So drowsy. Pep-pills-perking-up-again. I-could-drive allll Niiight..."
52689,220,189,909000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Truck,I fell asleep at the wheel! But we didn't crash. It's a miracle!
52691,220,191,918000,Homer Simpson,Gas Station,You'll never believe what happened. I fell asleep at the wheel and the truck drove here by itself.
52692,220,192,924000,Trucker #1,Gas Station,"Yeah, that Navitron Auto-Drive System's made our jobs cushier than ever."

52697,220,197,937000,Trucker #1,Gas Station,Sh-hey-hey-hey-sh! Didn't your union rep tell you about the scam we got goin'?
52698,220,198,941000,Homer Simpson,Gas Station,"Well, I'm not really a trucker, so I don't talk to the rep that often."
