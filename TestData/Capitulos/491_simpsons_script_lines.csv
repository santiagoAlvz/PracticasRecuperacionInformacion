127525,491,211,894000,Gordon Ramsay,English Bedroom,What the hell was that?!
127528,491,214,899000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fun me... fun me... fun me...
127529,491,215,903000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, I was thinking... was it really such a great idea to invite your father to that dinner?"
127530,491,216,907000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Relax -- Dad will be the life of the party. He'll be the fourth Mouth-keteer.
127531,491,217,912000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But there weren't Four Musketeers...
127532,491,218,915000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah-huh: Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan."
127534,491,219,918000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,D'Artagnan wasn't a musketeer! He only had a letter of introduction to the captain of the guards -- which he lost!
127536,491,221,928000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You know, I'm pretty excited about this far-out dinner. Maybe I'll like it."
127538,491,223,931000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I doubt it. You sit at communal tables, full of hipsters."
127539,491,224,935000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, actually, I've come around on hipsters. Takes a lot of guts to all wear the same hat."
127540,491,225,939000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"And the food will all be weird foams -- cooked with chemicals, or served in a test tube. It's too crazy for you."
127541,491,226,946000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So it's weird -- don't worry, I'll make it fun."
127542,491,227,949000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, you always do. Well, here's where to meet us..."
127543,491,228,953000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,1501 W-- East Oak Street.
127544,491,229,959000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"East Oak Street, is that it?"
127545,491,230,961000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Uhh... Yes! Yes! East Oak Street. That's where you should go. See ya there!
127546,491,231,967000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't you judge me.
127548,491,233,970000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Eh, save it for the sitter!"
127550,491,235,974000,Spanish Chef,El Chemistri,"Welcome to El Chemistri. Pease place these mints in your mouth. And when your table's ready, they will vibrate."
127553,491,238,989000,Homer Simpson,WRONG ADDRESS,Here it is: 1501 East Oak. No name on the door -- very trendy.
127554,491,239,996000,Thug,WRONG ADDRESS,What do you want?
127555,491,240,997000,Homer Simpson,WRONG ADDRESS,Is this the chemical kitchen place where you do the crazy cooking?
127556,491,241,1000000,Thug,WRONG ADDRESS,"Quiet, man!"
127557,491,242,1001000,Homer Simpson,WRONG ADDRESS,The experience begins!
127560,491,245,1005000,Bart Simpson,REAL EL CHEMISTRI,Where's Dad?
127561,491,246,1006000,Marge Simpson,REAL EL CHEMISTRI,Um... I don't know. Probably changed his mind and stopped off for donuts.
127562,491,247,1015000,Spanish Chef,REAL EL CHEMISTRI,"Before you is a deconstructed Caesar salad: romaine lettuce gel, egg yolk ice, crouton foam and anchovy air. You eat it like this: gel-ice-foam-air-foam-ice-gel-foam-air."
127564,491,249,1032000,Homer Simpson,WRONG ADDRESS,Just like Marge said -- chemicals and test tubes. The open kitchen is a nice touch.
127565,491,250,1037000,Homer Simpson,WRONG ADDRESS,"I guess I'll get started before my family gets here. How much for a taste, you know, just to get me going?"
127566,491,251,1042000,Thug,WRONG ADDRESS,Fifty bucks.
127567,491,252,1043000,Homer Simpson,WRONG ADDRESS,"Ouch, this place is fancy."
127569,491,254,1046000,Spanish Chef,REAL EL CHEMISTRI,"The next course is... ""Regret."""
127572,491,257,1059000,Homer Simpson,WRONG ADDRESS,Hipsters... Too cool for school...
127573,491,258,1062000,Thug,WRONG ADDRESS,You don't look like the kind of guy who does this.
127574,491,259,1065000,Homer Simpson,WRONG ADDRESS,"Well, my wife thinks it's too crazy for me, but I'm gonna prove her wrong."
127575,491,260,1070000,Homer Simpson,WRONG ADDRESS,I'm doing this for my family!
127577,491,262,1079000,Chief Wiggum,Meth Lab,"All right, breaking baddies, drop the meth!"
127578,491,263,1084000,Chief Wiggum,Meth Lab,Pick up the meth! Pick up the meth!
127579,491,264,1087000,Homer Simpson,Meth Lab,This better be dinner theater!
127581,491,266,1089000,Spanish Chef,El Chemistri,And now... pork chops one hundred ways!
127582,491,267,1092000,Bart Simpson,El Chemistri,A hundred pork chops!
127583,491,268,1097000,Lisa Simpson,El Chemistri,I can't believe Dad is missing this!
127584,491,269,1100000,Marge Simpson,El Chemistri,"Sure, your Dad's great, but I'm fun too -- look at me eat, huh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!"
127585,491,270,1109000,Marge Simpson,El Chemistri,Who am I kidding? I'm not enjoying this -- even the foam tastes like nothing. I'm calling Homer.
127586,491,271,1117000,Homer Simpson,El Chemistri,Marge! This isn't a food restaurant! It's a meth restaurant! A meth-taurant!
127588,491,273,1124000,Marge Simpson,El Chemistri,"Foodies, help me! My husband's in danger!"
127589,491,274,1128000,Amuse Bruce,El Chemistri,We can't leave now. We haven't had the root vegetables cooked in the perfect vacuum of outer space!
127590,491,275,1134000,Foie Greg,El Chemistri,They say you can't even understand parsnips until you've had zero-g parsnips!
127592,491,277,1140000,Spanish Chef,El Chemistri,How dare you walk out on me! Your dessert is in this doggie-bag woven from the silk of a blueberry-fed spider. Take it and go!
127594,491,279,1153000,Brandine Del Roy,Meth Lab,"Aw shucks, we get the family dressed up to go to our favorite meth lab, and it's all raided-out!"
127533,491,281,1160000,Cletus Spuckler,Meth Lab,"Oh honey, I always liked yer home-cooked better anyways."
127595,491,283,1166000,Chief Wiggum,Meth Lab,"Uh, where do you think you're going?"
127596,491,284,1168000,Marge Simpson,Meth Lab,A wife needs to tell her husband she was wrong!
127597,491,285,1171000,Chief Wiggum,Meth Lab,And in you go!
127599,491,287,1175000,Homer Simpson,Burning Meth Lab,Sorry!
127600,491,288,1176000,Thug,Burning Meth Lab,Everything you've done here has created problems!
127601,491,289,1184000,Marge Simpson,Burning Meth Lab,I've got to save him!
127602,491,290,1187000,Marge Simpson,Burning Meth Lab,My dessert!

127605,491,293,1201000,Young Thug,Burning Meth Lab,Merci Maman pour la tarte tatin à la mode...
127607,491,295,1215000,Thug,Burning Meth Lab,"Oh Marge, you saved me from the danger you put me in... I am so happy and angry."
127608,491,296,1222000,Thug,Burning Meth Lab,I'm sorry... I guess I just wanted the kids to look at me the way they look at you.
127610,491,298,1228000,Lisa Simpson,Burning Meth Lab,"Wow Mom, that was awesome!"
127611,491,299,1230000,Bart Simpson,Burning Meth Lab,We ate mad-scientist food and broke up a meth lab in the same day!
127612,491,300,1235000,Bart Simpson,Burning Meth Lab,Fun Mom! Fun Mom! Fun Mom!
127614,491,302,1242000,Homer Simpson,Krustyland,Now that's my kind of foam.
