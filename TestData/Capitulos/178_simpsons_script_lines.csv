147923,178,1,31000,KRABAPPEL,Springfield Police Station,Hello? Hello?... We're here for the field trip...
40265,178,2,39000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Sorry, sorry. Boy, it's getting harder and harder to make it here by ten."
40266,178,3,46000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,We'll start the tour in a second. I just gotta check the answering machine.
40267,178,4,51000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Aw, can't anybody in this town take the law into their own hands?"
40269,178,6,58000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Gather 'round kids. We're about to enter the museum...
40271,178,8,63000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,...of Crime!
40273,178,10,66000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Now, what I am about to show you next may shock and educate you. Hold on to your values as we step through the looking glass into a hippie pot party!"
40274,178,11,77000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"While Johnny Welfare plays acid rock on a stolen guitar, his old lady has a better idea."
40276,178,13,86000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"That's right, she's got the ""munchies"" for a ""California Cheeseburger."""
40278,178,15,94000,Narrator,Springfield Elementary School,"So the next time you're walking on the beach, enjoying an hourglass, or making cheap, low-grade windshields -- think where we'd be without... sand."
40279,178,16,106000,Chorus,Springfield Elementary School,SAND! SAND! SAND!!
40280,178,17,112000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, that was the sand movie. Now it'll just take me a second to set up our next movie."
40281,178,18,118000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, Miss Hoover, movies are a nice break, but couldn't we be doing something a little more challenging?"
40282,178,19,124000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,Probably.
40283,178,20,133000,Announcer,Springfield Elementary School,"The moon. For several years, she has fascinated many. But will man ever walk on her fertile surface? Democratic hopeful Adlai Stevenson says so."
40284,178,21,144000,Adlai Stevenson,Springfield Elementary School,I have no objection to man walking on the moon.
40285,178,22,149000,Announcer,Springfield Elementary School,"By 1964, experts say man will have established 12 colonies on the moon, ideal for family vacations."
40286,178,23,158000,Announcer,Springfield Elementary School,"Once there, you'll weigh only a small percentage of what you weigh on Earth."
40287,178,24,163000,Announcer,Springfield Elementary School,"Slow down, tubby! You're not on the moon yet."
40288,178,25,169000,Announcer,Springfield Elementary School,The moon belongs to America -- and anxiously awaits the arrival of our astromen. Will YOU be among them?
40289,178,26,182000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Miss Hoover, the movie's over."
40290,178,27,184000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Where's Miss Hoover?
40291,178,28,187000,JANEY,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, her car's gone."
40292,178,29,189000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Maybe she drove to the moon.
40294,178,30,193000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"It's not my nature to complain, but so far today we've had three movies, two film strips, and an hour and a half of ""magazine time."" I just don't feel challenged."
40295,178,31,202000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Of course we could make things more challenging, Lisa, but then the stupider students would be in here complaining... furrowing their brows in a vain attempt to understand the situation..."
40298,178,34,213000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"We're now in the Communications Room or the ""ComRoo"". Uh, this is a police radio, the single most important piece of equipment in the ComRoo. As you can see, some of the boys like to put their banana stickers all over it. Uh, there's Chiquita, there's Del Monte, there's a BananCo, Gorilla's Choice..."
40300,178,36,233000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Now, uh, everyone follow me to my chair, where I just need to get off my feet for a few minutes."
40301,178,37,242000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Ahhhhh... Ohhhhh... I won't be getting up soon.
40302,178,38,247000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Testing...
40303,178,39,251000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Testing...
40304,178,40,254000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Hmm. Hmm. Hey...
40307,178,43,277000,Bart Simpson,COMROO,Testing...
40308,178,44,282000,Parrots,COMROO,Testing! Testing!
40312,178,48,299000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You've really done it this time, Bart! You're in for the punishment of a lifetime!"
40313,178,49,304000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,When do you expect the ringing will stop?!
40314,178,50,307000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,In about ten to fifteen seconds!
40315,178,51,310000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I certainly hope so! That's better.
40316,178,52,315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, about your punishment, young man."
40317,178,53,318000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know, I'll go to my room and think about what I did."
40318,178,54,321000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no! Your room is full of toys. You're going to the, uh, garage!"
40319,178,55,326000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're the boss.
40320,178,56,328000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I tell you, Chief, I just don't know what we're going to do with him."
40322,178,57,331000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"You know, you do have options. For example, there are behavior modifying drugs. How wedded are you to the Bart you know?"
40323,178,58,340000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Not very.
40324,178,59,342000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No! No drugs. Bart just needs a little discipline.
40325,178,60,346000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Hey, what about military school? It set my brother straight. Now he owns and operates a famous cave."
40326,178,61,352000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, maybe Chief Wiggum is right. Military school is a good idea."
40327,178,62,374000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, I can't believe we're going to Disneyland! Hey, where's all your luggage?"
147924,178,64,383000,KRABAPPEL,Simpson Home,"You dream about this day for so long, then when it comes, you don't know what to say."
40329,178,65,390000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,"Edna, your tears say more than words ever could."
40331,178,67,394000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,Military school?! You lied to me!
40332,178,68,397000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Well, I'm sorry if you heard ""Disneyland"", but I distinctly said ""military school."""
40334,178,70,412000,Commandant,Rommelwood Military Academy,...And that's how we'll mold your boy into a productive member of society through an intensive program of push-ups and formation marching.
40335,178,71,420000,Marge Simpson,Rommelwood Military Academy,"Well, it certainly was nice of you to accept Bart in the middle of the semester."
40336,178,72,424000,Commandant,Rommelwood Military Academy,"Fortunately, we've had a couple of recent ""freak-outs,"" so that freed up a couple of bunks."
40337,178,73,428000,Bart Simpson,Rommelwood Military Academy,Freak-outs?
40338,178,74,429000,Homer Simpson,Rommelwood Military Academy,"If, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire semester?"
40340,178,76,433000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,Our high standards challenge students to reach their full potential.
40341,178,77,437000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Look at how disciplined they are. They're just like the Terra Cotta Warriors of Xian.
40342,178,78,442000,Homer Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,They sure are.
40343,178,79,444000,Cadet,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Ouch! Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow."
40344,178,80,448000,Homer Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,That's not so disciplined.
40345,178,81,450000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,"They're just children, Mr. Simpson."
40346,178,82,451000,Homer Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,I guess.
40347,178,83,453000,Cadet Larsen,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Truth is beauty, beauty truth, Sir!!"
40348,178,84,455000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,They're discussing poetry! Oh! We never do that at my school!
40321,178,85,460000,Teacher #1,MILITARY ACADEMY,But the truth can be harsh and disturbing. How can that be considered beautiful?
40349,178,86,464000,Marge Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Well, he sure sucked the fun out of that poem."
40350,178,87,467000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Please don't make me stay, Dad! I'll do anything you say! I'll find religion! I'll be good sometimes!"
40351,178,88,472000,Homer Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Leggo my leg.
40352,178,89,472000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,No!
40353,178,90,474000,Homer Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Son, for the last time, you're staying at military school."
40354,178,91,477000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,And so am I!
40355,178,92,481000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,This school has everything I ever wanted.
40356,178,93,483000,Marge Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Lisa, no! This place is just a jail for children."
40357,178,94,487000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,No jail can hold me!
40358,178,95,501000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,"All right, let's go over this one more time, just to make sure I understand the situation. You're a girl?"
40359,178,96,509000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Yes.
40360,178,97,510000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Gosh darn it, I just don't understand the situation. You're a girl?"
40361,178,98,517000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,All I want is a chance to prove myself.
40362,178,99,520000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Mmm, in our 185 years, we have never had a female cadet. But that seems to be the way the wind is blowing these days. After all, we have female singers, female motorists... Welcome aboard."
40363,178,100,540000,Marge Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Lisa, if you ever want to quit and come home, I'll be here in half a jiff."
40364,178,101,544000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,I want to quit and come home.
40365,178,102,547000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,I want to quit and come home.
40366,178,103,548000,Marge Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Oh, honey... I heard you the first time."
40367,178,104,562000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,Atten-hut!
40368,178,105,565000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Gentlemen, we now have a girl cadet among our ranks, so we're going to have to make a few changes. First of all, Franklin, you are no longer the girliest cadet here."
40369,178,106,574000,Cadet Franklin,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Well, we'll see about that!"
40370,178,107,577000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Second, this is now the girls' barracks. So pack your things. You're moving in with Company ""L""."
40371,178,108,580000,Cadet Larsen,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Company ""L""? But they smell!"
40372,178,109,584000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Yes, we've all heard the chant. Now fall out!"
40373,178,110,587000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Sorry. Sorry. I know we'll be friends. Talk about getting off on the wrong foot... heh heh.
40375,178,112,595000,Cadet Platt,Barracks,I can't believe they let a girl in.
40377,178,113,598000,Cadet Larsen,Barracks,Don't worry. We'll drive her out of the academy. That is why God created hazing.
40378,178,114,614000,Cadet Larsen,Barracks,What's the matter? Don't girls like doing push-ups in the mud?!
40379,178,115,617000,Lisa Simpson,Barracks,Is there any answer I can give that won't result in more push-ups?
40381,178,117,624000,Cadet Platt,Barracks,No.
40382,178,118,628000,Lisa Simpson,Barracks,"Hey, look, it's the school motto."
40383,178,119,631000,Bart Simpson,Barracks,"""I'll die before I surrender, Tim."" Who's Tim?"
40384,178,120,634000,Lisa Simpson,Barracks,Apparently Tim was someone who was with the general moments before he was shot right in the head.
40385,178,121,639000,Bart Simpson,Barracks,"Cleaning graffiti off a statue makes a mockery of everything I stand for. I don't think I can survive here, Lis."
40386,178,122,645000,Lisa Simpson,Barracks,"That's how they want you to feel. But if you just hang in there, they'll eventually accept you."
40387,178,123,650000,Cadet Larsen,Barracks,Get to work! I want to see my face in that horse's ass.
40389,178,125,658000,Cadet Larsen,Field,"Okay, that's long enough. Let's see how they're doing."
40390,178,126,666000,Cadet Larsen,Field,Had enough?
40392,178,128,670000,Cadet Platt,Field,"What say you, men? Has this lowly maggot passed the test?"
40393,178,129,674000,Cadets,Field,"Congratulations Bart! / You made it! / You're one of us, Bart!"
40394,178,130,678000,Lisa Simpson,Field,"Hey, what about me? I'm a lowly maggot!"
40396,178,132,687000,Instructor,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Since you attended public school, I'm going to assume that you're already proficient with small arms. So, we'll start you off with something a little more advanced."
40397,178,133,705000,Instructor,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Four out of five, Simpson. Impressive, but you missed your last target."
40398,178,134,709000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Did I?
40400,178,136,713000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw! Haw!
40402,178,138,714000,Cadet Larsen,BACK ON THE FIRING RANGE,"You're a born soldier, Simpson. Too bad it doesn't run in your family."
40403,178,139,720000,Lisa Simpson,BACK ON THE FIRING RANGE,"Could someone help me? It's stuck on ""Auto-fire""!"
40404,178,140,722000,Cadet Larsen,BACK ON THE FIRING RANGE,"Platt, do you hear anything?"
40405,178,141,726000,Cadet Platt,BACK ON THE FIRING RANGE,No!
40407,178,143,732000,Instructor,BACK ON THE FIRING RANGE,Maybe you should just learn to use this.
40408,178,144,734000,Instructor,BACK ON THE FIRING RANGE,"If there's a war, just blow on it and I'll come help you."
40410,178,146,741000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"I am just calling home, I am not asking to come home."
40412,178,148,749000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge? You got that? Marge?!
40413,178,149,754000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, go on, boy. Go get it! Answer the phone! Be a good boy!"
40414,178,150,760000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, there's gotta be something on this thing for that thing."
40417,178,153,769000,Orderly,Springfield Retirement Castle,Simpson.
40418,178,154,770000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Hot diggity! I don't care if it's bad news!
40419,178,155,774000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, Grampa, you're not busy are you?"
40420,178,156,776000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well, you're really asking two questions there. The first one takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just reached the Pole, only hours ahead of the Three Stooges...And I guess he won the argument, but I walked away with the turnips. The following morning, I resigned my commission in the coast guard. The next thing I heard, there was civil war in Spain."
40421,178,157,798000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,And that's everything that happened in my life right up to the time I got this phone call.
40422,178,158,804000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Uh-huh. So, anything else you want to talk about?"
40423,178,159,807000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"I'm afraid I'd just be repeating myself, honey. Anyway, other people need to use the phone."
40424,178,160,815000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,Mmm-mmm. I've already talked to her for twenty damn minutes.
40426,178,162,830000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,What is it?
40427,178,163,831000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Bart, I got a cassette from Mom and Dad! I thought we could listen to it together."
40428,178,164,835000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Gee, Lis, I'd love to, but this really isn't a good time..."
40429,178,165,839000,Cadet Larsen,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Bart, who you talking to?"
40430,178,166,839000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Uh...
40431,178,167,842000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Lisa. You're talking to Lisa.
40432,178,168,844000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,I'm talking to... no one.
40433,178,169,851000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,"All right, lights out!"
40434,178,170,855000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,Ow! Dammit! Lights on! Lights on!
40435,178,171,858000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,Lights out! Lights out!
40437,178,172,864000,Marge Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"...and don't worry, sweetie, it's very common to be homesick when you're so far away from the people who love you."
40438,178,173,873000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Okay. I'm not gonna give up. Solitude never hurt anyone. Emily Dickinson lived alone and she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry the world has ever known! And went crazy as a loon.
40439,178,174,890000,Marge Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"""YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE, MY ONLY SUNSHINE / YOU MAKE ME HAPPY, WHEN SKIES ARE GRAY / YOU'LL NEVER KNOW, DEAR / HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU / SO DON'T TAKE MY SUNSHINE AWAY..."""
40440,178,175,913000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"I'm sorry I froze you out, Lis. I--I just didn't want the guys to think I'd gone soft on the girl issue."
40441,178,176,918000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Ech, I'm tired of being an issue, Bart. Maybe everyone would be better off if I just quit."
40442,178,177,922000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"But if you quit, it'll be like an expert knot-tier quitting a knot-tying contest right in the middle of tying a knot!"
40443,178,178,928000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Why'd you say that?
40444,178,179,929000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"I dunno. I was just looking at my shoelaces. Look, the point is, you're going to make it, Lis. And I'm going to stick by you."
40445,178,180,935000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Don't do that. Why should we both be outcasts?
40446,178,181,938000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Then I'll just stick by you in secret. Like a sockmaker secretly working on a top secret sock that...
40447,178,182,942000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Will you stop looking at your feet?!
40448,178,183,944000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Well, cadets, it's been a great year. You've all worked very hard developing academic skills, and general killing skills."
40449,178,184,951000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,My killing teacher says I'm a natural.
40450,178,185,953000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,"But these skills are nothing without courage and stamina. Traditionally, the academy tested these virtues by pitting you against each other in a two-day Battle Royale."
40452,178,187,965000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,"That was prior to 1957, thank you very much, State Supreme Court. Consequently, now, no cadet can receive a passing grade for the academic year without first conquering this..."
40453,178,188,977000,Commandant,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Meet ""The Eliminator."" That's a 150 foot hand-over-hand crawl across a 60 gauge hemp-jute line with a blister factor of twelve. The rope is suspended a full forty feet over a solid British acre of old-growth Connecticut Valley thorn bushes. Gentlemen, welcome to flavor country."
40454,178,189,995000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,This wasn't in the brochure.
40376,178,190,1001000,Cadets,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Yo, Bart! Over here! Etc."
40455,178,191,1006000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"""Meet me at ""The Eliminator"" after lights out. P.S. The cadets are planning to throw their meatballs at you."
40456,178,192,1020000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"That's it, Lis. Now start crawling."
40457,178,193,1023000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Oh, it's too hard. My hand is slipping."
40459,178,195,1032000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,"I can't do this, Bart. I'm not strong enough."
40460,178,196,1035000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,I thought you came here looking for a challenge.
40461,178,197,1038000,Lisa Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Duh! A challenge I could do.
40462,178,198,1041000,Cadet Larsen,MILITARY ACADEMY,It was worth sneaking into town. That was some good corn.
40463,178,199,1045000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Uh-oh.
40464,178,200,1047000,CADET ANDERSEN,MILITARY ACADEMY,"Hey, Simpson, what are you doing out here?"
40465,178,201,1050000,Bart Simpson,MILITARY ACADEMY,Nothin'.
