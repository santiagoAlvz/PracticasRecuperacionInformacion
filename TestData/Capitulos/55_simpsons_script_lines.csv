7042,55,147,673000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,She's wonderful. I could feel her sweet country soul in every digitally-encoded bit.
7043,55,148,679000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Country music sucks. All it does is take precious air space away from shock DJ's whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all.
7044,55,149,686000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think?"
7045,55,150,689000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it's nice. But who is this woman?"
7046,55,151,692000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. But she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady."
7047,55,152,701000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress!
7048,55,153,704000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you make it sound so seamy. All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits."
7050,55,155,714000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well hi, Lurleen. We were just talking about you. Uh... I think I can come over. Let me ask my wife."

7054,55,159,727000,Lurleen Lumpkin,TRAILER PARK,"Oh Homer, everybody's been callin'! Mamma, Daddy, the triplets, Vonda Mae, Piney Jo... and I owe it all to you."
7055,55,160,738000,Homer Simpson,TRAILER PARK,"Don't thank me, Lurleen, you should be thanking your brain."
7056,55,161,741000,Lurleen Lumpkin,TRAILER PARK,"Oh Homer, no man has ever been this nice to me without... you know, wantin' somethin' in return."
7057,55,162,749000,Homer Simpson,TRAILER PARK,"Well, I was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now I feel kinda guilty about it."
7058,55,163,752000,Lurleen Lumpkin,TRAILER PARK,"Homer, you're just a big sack of sugar."
7059,55,164,756000,Homer Simpson,TRAILER PARK,"Thanks. You did say sugar, right?"
7060,55,165,759000,Lurleen Lumpkin,TRAILER PARK,"Uh-huh. Now, Homer, I want you to be my manager."
7061,55,166,763000,Homer Simpson,TRAILER PARK,"Really? Well, I should warn you... I'm not great with figures..."
7062,55,167,766000,Lurleen Lumpkin,TRAILER PARK,That's okay.
7063,55,168,767000,Homer Simpson,TRAILER PARK,I make a lot of stupid decisions...
7064,55,169,769000,Lurleen Lumpkin,TRAILER PARK,Nobody's perfect.
7065,55,170,770000,Homer Simpson,TRAILER PARK,I did bad in school.
7066,55,171,771000,Lurleen Lumpkin,TRAILER PARK,I didn't even go.
7067,55,172,772000,Homer Simpson,TRAILER PARK,My personal hygiene has been described as...
7068,55,173,773000,Lurleen Lumpkin,TRAILER PARK,"Homer, Homer, you'll be a great manager. There's only one thing you need."
7071,55,176,778000,Salesman,Store,Now this is made from a space-age fabric developed especially for Elvis. Sweat actually cleans this suit!
7073,55,178,794000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, look at me."
7074,55,179,796000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't want to. I'm mad at you.
7075,55,180,798000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sick of that waitress and all the time you've been spending with her, and this whole country music thing."
7076,55,181,802000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, then maybe you better not look at me."
7077,55,182,806000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer! Where did you get that suit?
7078,55,183,808000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A friend bought it for me.
7079,55,184,810000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Was it Lurleen?
7080,55,185,812000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No... I think it was Lenny.
7081,55,186,814000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't lie to me. Are you having an affair with this woman?
7082,55,187,817000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
7083,55,188,817000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Have you kissed her?
7084,55,189,818000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
7085,55,190,819000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Has she kissed you?
7086,55,191,819000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A coupla times.
7087,55,192,821000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I want you to stop seeing her.
7088,55,193,823000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't. I'm her manager.
7089,55,194,824000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Her manager? That's ridiculous. I won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
7090,55,195,829000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer."
7091,55,196,834000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. And you did it at the county fair last year. Remember?
7092,55,197,841000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, Lurleen's gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, I'm going to be there."
7093,55,198,844000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. See if I care.
7095,55,200,855000,Mr. Boylan,Recording Studio,"This studio has a lot of history. Buddy Holly stood on this spot in 1958 and said, ""There is no way in hell that I'm gonna record in this dump""."
7096,55,201,857000,Homer Simpson,Recording Studio,I'm sure Lurleen will love it.
7097,55,202,865000,Marge Simpson,Recording Studio,"Homer, how much did you just give that man?"
7098,55,203,867000,Homer Simpson,Recording Studio,"Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings. I'm not going to go into hock for this."
7099,55,204,872000,Lurleen Lumpkin,Recording Studio,"Hey, Colonel Homer. And you must be..."
7100,55,205,876000,Marge Simpson,Recording Studio,Mrs. Homer Simpson.
7101,55,206,878000,Lurleen Lumpkin,Recording Studio,Charmed.
7102,55,207,879000,Marge Simpson,Recording Studio,Hmmm. I thought you said she was overweight!
7103,55,208,882000,Homer Simpson,Recording Studio,"Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen."
7104,55,209,885000,Marge Simpson,Recording Studio,What does that mean?
7106,55,210,887000,Homer Simpson,Recording Studio,"I don't have time to answer all these questions. Uh, time is money. Come on, people!"
7107,55,211,891000,Lurleen Lumpkin,Recording Studio,"Well, c'mon boys. Let's break some hearts."
7108,55,212,898000,Lurleen Lumpkin,Recording Studio,"OH THE BASES WERE EMPTY ON THE DIAMOND OF MY HEART/ WHEN THE COACH CALLED ME UP TO THE PLATE/ I'D BEEN SWINGIN' AND MISSIN' AND LOVIN' AND KISSIN'/ MY AVERAGE WAS POINT DOUBLE AUGHT EIGHT/ SO I SPIT ON MY HANDS/ KNOCKED THE DIRT FROM MY SPIKES/ AND POINTED RIGHT TOWARD CENTER FIELD/ THIS TIME I'M HITTIN' A HOME RUN/ THIS TIME LOVE IS FOR REAL/ I'LL SLIDE, I'LL STEAL,"
7109,55,213,924000,Bart Simpson,Recording Studio,"Hey Dad, can I do a ham-bone solo?"
7110,55,214,928000,Homer Simpson,Recording Studio,Stop it.
