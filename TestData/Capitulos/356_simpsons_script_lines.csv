92128,356,1,32000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Good news, children."
92129,356,2,34000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"This Friday, we'll be holding a school-wide Medieval Festival."
92130,356,3,39000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Medieval? Like ""Lord of the Rings?"""
92131,356,4,41000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"No, not at all."
92133,356,6,43000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Can't we just keep going forward in our textbooks?
92134,356,7,46000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"No. Now, I've already assigned each of you a role in the Medieval Court. Martin, you shall be our king."
92135,356,8,51000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"I shall pattern my reign on Enguerrand the Seventh, Sire de Coucy! Tralloo trallay!"
92136,356,9,57000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Not so fast, Nelson. You're one of King Martin's guards! Haw haw!"
92137,356,10,62000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,You'll pay for this!
92138,356,11,64000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,My liege.
92139,356,12,65000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What'm I gonna be? Black knight? Court ninja? Bart the Impaler?
92140,356,13,69000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, you'll be playing the village cooper."
92141,356,14,71000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What kind of a knight is that?
92142,356,15,73000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,The kind of knight that makes barrels and isn't a knight. Ha!
92143,356,16,76000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Ay carumba.
92144,356,17,77000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, this stinks. But I bet Lisa got something even stupider."
92145,356,18,83000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,All hail the queen!
92146,356,19,89000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Now as queen, you shall be entitled to eat the same French Fries the teachers do."
92147,356,20,94000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,The ones made from potatoes?
92148,356,21,96000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,The very same.
92149,356,22,100000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,My coat of arms is a Spider-man couchant on a field vert.
92150,356,23,105000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,What's couchant mean?
92151,356,24,106000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Lying down.
92152,356,25,109000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"You mean like you? Now, what's ""vert"" mean? Say it means punching."
92154,356,26,115000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"So Willie, during the festival, you'll be wearing these urine-soaked rags. You're the village idiot!"
92155,356,27,121000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, allow me to apply this rubber cement to your face -- to represent the ravages of plague."
92156,356,28,129000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Ach! My face! What drunken call girl will have me now?
92157,356,29,140000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Now peasants, since the middle ages had no compact discs or Super Mario Men, people found entertainment in abusing the village idiot. So, let history come alive!"
92158,356,30,153000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Wait! Let me take out my contact lenses!
92160,356,32,157000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Pelt all you want, but revenge will be Willie's. Ow! That was a stapler!"
92161,356,33,164000,Otto Mann,Springfield Elementary School,"DRAGON IN THE DUNGEON, MAIDEN IN MY LAIR / THERE'S POTIONS IN MY WIZARD'S POT / NOW DRINK IT IF YOU DARE / LUTE SOLO!"
92162,356,34,186000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Cooper! More pink lemon-ale!
92163,356,35,192000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Cooper! Thy staves are not flush!
92164,356,36,197000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"You'll pay for this, my Queen."
92165,356,37,200000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Guards, take him to the tower!"
92166,356,38,207000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,Where is the tower?
92167,356,39,209000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,It's the backseat of my Merkur. There's thirty-seven cents in the coin caddy. And stay out of my diary!
92170,356,42,217000,Groundskeeper Willie,Gym,"Quiet, my pretties. Soon we'll have revenge on those who mocked me. Also on those who were kind to me. And on parents who took time from their busy schedules to make today such a success. Ooh, I hate them all!"
92171,356,43,232000,Lisa Simpson,Gym,Noble idiot! Bring in the pie!
92172,356,44,238000,Lisa Simpson,Gym,I dedicate this pie to the backbone of the feudal system: the serfs.
92174,356,46,249000,Groundskeeper Willie,Gym,"Scurry, me beasties... nibble and gnaw at their overstuffed buttocks!"
92175,356,47,254000,Bart Simpson,Gym,Milhouse! Don't open your mouth!
92176,356,48,256000,Milhouse Van Houten,Gym,Wha?
92178,356,50,263000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,This is no accident.
92179,356,51,266000,Bart Simpson,Gym,"Nice party, dink."
92180,356,52,268000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,"You're responsible for this, Simpson!"
92182,356,53,270000,Bart Simpson,Gym,"No way! I didn't do it! Unlike all the other stuff I told you I didn't do, which I did!"
92183,356,54,274000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,"Bart, I'm sick of playing the tomfool. You are hereby expelled from Springfield Elementary!"
92185,356,56,281000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boy, I can't believe you got expelled. Well, don't expect to spend all week lying around on the couch like a bum 'cause that's my thing!"
92186,356,57,290000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, a school-sponsored Medieval festival is supposed to be the best day of a young girl's life, and you ruined it. You deserve to be expelled."
92187,356,58,298000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I didn't do it! Mom, you believe me, don't you?"
92188,356,59,302000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, I love you. But sometimes I don't love your choices. Now we have to find another school for you."
92189,356,60,309000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And if you get kicked out of that one, you're going straight in the Army. Where you'll be sent straight to America's latest military quagmire. Where will it be? North Korea? Iran? Anything's possible with Commander Cuckoo Bananas in charge."
92190,356,61,323000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, this could be a good new school... Oakwood Academy! Huh?"
92191,356,62,329000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, that's a school for the blind."
92192,356,63,332000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Think of the leg up you'd have!
92193,356,64,333000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"How can we afford any of these private schools? They're all so expensive. If we want to throw good money after bad, why don't we just get Grampa that new pacemaker?"
92194,356,65,342000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I need two double A batteries. Now!
92195,356,66,346000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Get 'em from the smoke detector.
92196,356,67,347000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What if there's a fire?
92197,356,68,349000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The smoke will wake us up.
92198,356,69,351000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How 'bout this one -- St. Jerome's Catholic School?
92199,356,70,354000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Catholic schools are usually the most affordable private schools.
92200,356,71,358000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Catholic school, eh...?"
92201,356,72,360000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That'll straighten you out, boy. There, you don't just get bad grades -- you go to Hell!"
92203,356,74,369000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,My pacemaker!
92204,356,75,375000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Classic Grampa.
92207,356,78,382000,Sister Thomasina,ST. JEROME'S,"Class, we have a new student. Bart, would you like to introduce yourself?"
92208,356,79,386000,Bart Simpson,ST. JEROME'S,"I'm Bart Simpson, ay carumba, do the Bartman, etcetera, etcetera."
92209,356,80,394000,Sister Thomasina,ST. JEROME'S,In the old days we'd use a ruler to deal with incorrigibles like you...
92210,356,81,399000,Bart Simpson,ST. JEROME'S,"Thanks for the history lesson, sis."
92211,356,82,401000,Sister Thomasina,ST. JEROME'S,These days we use a yard stick!
92212,356,83,407000,Bart Simpson,ST. JEROME'S,"I'll show you, I'll move thirty-three inches away."
92213,356,84,410000,Sister Thomasina,ST. JEROME'S,A yard's thirty-six!
92214,356,85,414000,Bart Simpson,ST. JEROME'S,Now you tell me.
92216,356,87,420000,Sister Thomasina,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"I don't know what they taught you in public school, but at St. Jerome's we don't tolerate back sass! Stretch out your arms like our Lord on the cross."
92217,356,88,428000,Sister Thomasina,St. Jerome's Catholic School,Now hold these dictionaries.
92218,356,89,430000,Sister Thomasina,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Now, think what it would be like if you had nails in your hands."
92219,356,90,434000,Bart Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Well, I guess they'd help me hold the dictionaries up."
92220,356,91,437000,Sister Thomasina,St. Jerome's Catholic School,Wrong answer!
92221,356,92,440000,Bart Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,Stupid Catholic school. Suffering for my hip attitude... I'm the real Jesus here!
92222,356,93,447000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"So, it's sacrilege you're spoutin' then."
92223,356,94,449000,Bart Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"What's it to you, Irish?"
92224,356,95,451000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,The name's Father Sean. And I used to be an ornery wee cuss myself.
92225,356,96,454000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Until one day, after a drunken brawl with my Dad..."
92227,356,98,457000,Sean's Dad,Dublin Street,You're just like your mother: can't take a punch!
92228,356,99,460000,Young Sean,Dublin Street,Oof!
92229,356,100,464000,Father Sean,Dublin Street,"...I was laying in the gutter pickin' up me teeth, when Saint Peter himself appears before me."
92230,356,101,468000,Father Sean,Dublin Street,"""Sean, you wanker,"" he says. ""Repent of your wicked ways, or sod off."""
92231,356,102,472000,Father Sean,Dublin Street,Then he gobbed in me face and turned back into a streetlight.
92232,356,103,476000,Father Sean,Dublin Street,And that's how I came to the church.
92233,356,104,479000,Bart Simpson,Dublin Street,"Well, I'm only here because I got blamed for a prank I didn't do."
92234,356,105,483000,Father Sean,Dublin Street,"Call me crazy, but I believe you."
92235,356,106,485000,Bart Simpson,Dublin Street,You do?
92237,356,107,486000,Father Sean,Dublin Street,"Course I do. You know, lots of church-types started off as rotten little buggers. St. Augustine himself got his start stealing pears."
92238,356,108,493000,Bart Simpson,Dublin Street,Stealing pairs of what? Hubcaps? Reeboks? Human eyes?
92239,356,109,497000,Father Sean,Dublin Street,It's all in here -- see for yourself.
92240,356,110,499000,Bart Simpson,Dublin Street,Cool.
92242,356,112,503000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Sister Thomasina, I've taken the liberty of knockin' the vinegar out of him. He's all yours."
92243,356,113,510000,Sister Thomasina,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Yeah, whatever. Now class, open your math books to the word problems of our Lord. Billy and Joseph start their penance at the same time. If each swear word brings a thousand years in Hell..."
92244,356,114,521000,Bart Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,St. Sebastian was a pious Roman soldier...
92245,356,115,524000,Bart Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"For preaching Christianity to the Romans, the Emperor Diocletian sentenced him to death by hail of arrows."
92246,356,116,524000,St. Sebastian,St. Jerome's Catholic School,Now it's payback time!
92247,356,117,538000,Dying Soldier,St. Jerome's Catholic School,I wish I'd gone to more orgies!
92248,356,118,542000,Bart Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Whoa, this stuff is great! It's way better than the comics I get at the dentist."
92250,356,120,550000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"...Then Father Sean quoted Eminem in his sermon. And in art class, we painted Saint Joan burning at the stake, and mine was the grossest! Catholics rock!"
92251,356,121,558000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, I'm glad you had fun, but I wouldn't get too into that Catholic church. With all the sitting and standing and kneeling, it's like Simon Says without a winner!"
92252,356,122,569000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, that's blasphemy! I'll say a rosary for you."
92253,356,123,573000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't you touch bead one! Homer, maybe we should be concerned. Catholics can be a peculiar bunch -- no birth control, no meat on Friday..."
92254,356,124,582000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No meat?! What do they eat, light bulbs?"
92255,356,125,585000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Let's just change the subject. Bart, would you like to say grace?"
92256,356,126,589000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes'm. Anima Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto..."
92257,356,127,593000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! What the Hell are you saying?
92258,356,128,594000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's Latin, Dad. The language of Plutarch."
92259,356,129,597000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Mickey Mouse's dog?
92260,356,130,599000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Plutarch. He chronicled the lives of the Roman emperors."
92236,356,131,603000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I didn't need that new fact! Now I forgot who won Bud Bowl Eight. Boy, I'm pulling you outta that crazy school!"
92261,356,133,613000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Hey! I'm Bart Simpson's father, and I'm sick of you teaching my son your time-tested values! Hey, what's that smell?"
92262,356,134,621000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,We're having our monthly pancake dinner. Care to join us?
92263,356,135,624000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,You've transformed breakfast into dinner. It's a miracle!
92264,356,136,630000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Log Cabin full of taste, my stomach is with thee. Blessed art thou among syrups and..."
92265,356,137,635000,Sister Thomasina,St. Jerome's Catholic School,No praying to the condiments!
92266,356,138,637000,Bumblebee Man,St. Jerome's Catholic School,¡Que buenos cake-os de pan-o!
92267,356,139,648000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"All pancakes aside, I really came here to talk about my son."
92268,356,140,652000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,I understand. But can it wait 'til after Bingo?
92269,356,141,654000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,Bingo? That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
92270,356,142,659000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,Bingo.
92271,356,143,660000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
92272,356,144,664000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"How 'bout you just say ""Yay, I won."""
92273,356,145,666000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,Bingo!
92274,356,146,668000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"I've never seen such masterful bingo playing. What's your secret, Homer?"
92275,356,147,672000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,You have to cheat.
92276,356,148,675000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Uh, listen, is it true you priest guys can't ever... you know..."
92277,356,149,682000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,I'll admit the vow of celibacy is one of our sterner challenges.
92278,356,150,686000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Celibacy?! I was talking about the meat on Friday thing. Man, you guys got more crazy rules than Blockbuster Video."
92279,356,151,693000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Well that's true, but if you do break a rule, you can always find absolution in the sacrament of confession."
92280,356,152,698000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No matter what I did, no matter how many people lost their pensions, it's forgiven like that?"
92281,356,153,698000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"If you truly repent, then yes."
92282,356,154,708000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Okay, let's make some magic here. I wiped a booger on your shirt, I made a dog and a cat kiss, I swiped a bolted-down TV from a Holiday Inn..."
92286,356,156,717000,Homer Simpson,Confessional,"...I coveted the wife in ""Jaws 2,"" I lied to a waiter, I masturbated eight million times and I have no plans to stop masturbating in the future."
92287,356,157,723000,Homer Simpson,Confessional,"Woo hoo! I'm clean! In your face, Lord!"
92288,356,158,727000,Father Sean,Confessional,"Um, not quite, Mr. Simpson. I can only absolve you if you're a Catholic."
92289,356,159,731000,Homer Simpson,Confessional,Right. And how do I join? Do I whale on some Unitarians?
92290,356,160,735000,Father Sean,Confessional,Well it's a little harder than that. It begins by looking inside yourself...
92292,356,162,740000,Father Sean,Confessional,...but it ends with bread and wine.
92293,356,163,741000,Homer Simpson,Confessional,Woo hoo!
92295,356,165,747000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you've been out all night! And you look like you've accepted someone as your personal something. Were you at that Catholic Church?!"
92296,356,166,756000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, Marge, I know I was supposed to yell at that Priest, but he's so cool. He plays drums in a band with a bunch of other priests!"
92297,356,167,762000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I knew they'd try to convert you! That's what they do! Well I'm not having another twelve kids.
92298,356,168,768000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, no one is saying twelve. Nine, ten, tops. See..."
92299,356,169,774000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Forget it! And you know, I went to a Catholic wedding once. The incense ruined my pantsuit!"
92300,356,170,781000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, relax. I've never heard of anyone getting so upset about religion."
92302,356,172,804000,Church Women,First Church of Springfield,Marge is here all alone. / I heard her son is Catholic now. / Husband too.
92304,356,174,809000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Marge! All by yourself today?
92305,356,175,813000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Well, Homer and Bart are well, they're under the weather."
92306,356,176,817000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Um-hm. Under the weather? Or under the spell of a man in a pointy white hat?
92307,356,177,821000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"All right! I admit it -- they're both at the Catholic Church! Reverend, what should I do?"
92308,356,178,826000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Marge, this calls for an emergency meeting of the church's spiritual council. To Stuckey's!"
92312,356,180,832000,Ned Flanders,Restaurant,Bart and Homer can't go Catholic! The Romans have been separate from us since the Schism of Lourdes in 1573. And that was about our holy right to come to church with wet hair. Which we've since abolished.
92313,356,181,841000,Marge Simpson,Restaurant,I guess it's good that they're taking an interest in spirituality.
92314,356,182,845000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Restaurant,"Oh, spirituality's great, Marge. Hey, I'm Mr. Spiritual. But remember... a different faith means a different afterlife."
92315,356,183,855000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Restaurant,Marge rubs her chin thoughtfully as we see...
92316,356,184,858000,St. Peter,Restaurant,Marge Simpson. Welcome to Protestant Heaven.
92317,356,185,863000,Croquet Player #1,Restaurant,Through in one. Hoo-rah!
92318,356,186,866000,Croquet Player #2,Restaurant,"Poppy, have you seen Dash?"
92319,356,187,868000,Marge Simpson,Restaurant,where's Homer and Bart?
92320,356,188,883000,Homer Simpson,Restaurant,"Wow! Up here, that feels good!"
92321,356,189,889000,Irishman,Restaurant,"Now dance, you Heavenly gobs!"
92322,356,190,906000,Marge Simpson,Restaurant,I wish my family was with me.
92323,356,191,909000,Croquet Player #2,Restaurant,"Sorry, Marge. They're just not our sort."
92324,356,192,911000,Marge Simpson,Restaurant,"Well then, I'd like to speak with Jesus."
92325,356,193,914000,Croquet Player #2,Restaurant,I'm afraid he's gone native.
92326,356,194,919000,Jesus,Restaurant,"Stop it! Guys, I'm serious!"
92327,356,195,923000,Marge Simpson,Restaurant,Noooo!!!
92328,356,196,926000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Restaurant,"Don't worry, Marge. We'll get your boy back."
92329,356,197,929000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Restaurant,"Excuse me, that better be decaf."
92330,356,198,932000,Waitress,Restaurant,"The rim is orange, ain't it? Or does under-tipping make you colorblind?"
92331,356,199,937000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Restaurant,Her husband's sleeping with her sister. Who said that?
92333,356,201,941000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"So now, what do we call it when the communion wafer becomes the body of Christ?"
92334,356,202,947000,Kevin,St. Jerome's Catholic School,Hey!
92335,356,203,948000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Yes, Homer?"
92336,356,204,949000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,Transubstantiation!
92337,356,205,950000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,Very good.
92338,356,206,951000,Kevin,St. Jerome's Catholic School,He cheated. He's got it written on his arm!
92340,356,208,958000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Welcome to the jungle, Kevin!"
92341,356,209,961000,Marge Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,First Communion?!
92342,356,210,963000,Ned Flanders,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Oh, we've gotta stop 'em now! Once they seal the deal, there's no turning back. Like the Jews with their snippity-snip."
92181,356,211,969000,Marge Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Bart, get your things. You're leaving with me!"
92284,356,212,973000,Bart Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Sorry Mom, but this is the Catholic church. Chicks don't have any authority here."
92310,356,213,977000,Father Sean,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Mrs. Simpson, please! If there's a problem, I'm sure we can talk it over."
92311,356,214,980000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Back off, Popey LaPew!"
92343,356,215,982000,Homer Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Marge, what are you doing here?"
92344,356,216,984000,Marge Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,"Homer, you're physically an adult, and what you do in the privacy of your own soul is your business. But I didn't change Bart's diapers for five years to see him become a Catholic."
92345,356,217,995000,Bart Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,I thought there was a monster in the potty.
92346,356,218,998000,Marge Simpson,St. Jerome's Catholic School,Let's go!
92349,356,221,998000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Lovejoy's Van,I think we've lost them.
92350,356,222,1007000,Marge Simpson,Lovejoy's Van,They weren't following us.
92351,356,223,1009000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Lovejoy's Van,Then why did I drive through that barn?
92352,356,224,1011000,Bart Simpson,Lovejoy's Van,"Why did you guys have to take me away? You're always nagging me to go to church, and now that I am, it's the wrong one."
92353,356,225,1018000,Marge Simpson,Lovejoy's Van,I just don't think your father's the right person to pick out a religion for you.
92354,356,226,1022000,Bart Simpson,Lovejoy's Van,"Okay, I'll pick a religion for me. Judaism."
92355,356,227,1025000,Bart Simpson,Lovejoy's Van,DON'T HAVE... A COW MAN / DON'T HAVE... A COW MAN / DON'T HAVE... A COW MAN / HAVE A PIECE OF FISH! Oy!
92356,356,228,1032000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Lovejoy's Van,"Bart, we're here to bring you back to the one true faith -- the Western branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism."
92357,356,229,1044000,Marge Simpson,Lovejoy's Van,"Hello, Homer."
92359,356,231,1045000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you bring Bart home now! Once you go Vatican, you can't go back again."
92360,356,232,1049000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"It wasn't a fair fight! Your church suckered him in with gory stories, just like we were suckered into getting Cinemax."
92361,356,233,1056000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Face it, Marge -- Catholics rule. We've got Boston, South America, the good part of Ireland, and we're making serious inroads in Mozambique, baby!"
92362,356,234,1064000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm gonna show Bart that Protestants can be hip too. How do you like those croutons?"
92363,356,235,1070000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children? Shouldn't Bart and I be able to choose our own religion if we want to?
92364,356,236,1077000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Strange as it sounds, Dad, I agree with you."
92365,356,237,1080000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bwa?
92366,356,238,1081000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Everyone should be able to choose their faith -- just like I chose Buddhism.
92367,356,239,1084000,Father Sean,Simpson Home,"Buddhism? Well, I guess lots of kids have imaginary friends."
92368,356,240,1089000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll ignore that. In fact, I'm gonna help you. I have a pretty good idea where they are."
92369,356,241,1097000,Father Sean,Simpson Home,"We can't lose Bart, now that we're so close. If I do, I'll be the worst priest ever. Well, except for... you know."
92373,356,245,1111000,Marge Simpson,PROTESTANT YOUTH FEST,"Now Bart, isn't this the kind of religion you'd like to be a part of for all eternity?"
92374,356,246,1116000,Emcee,PROTESTANT YOUTH FEST,"Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome, hot off their conversion to Christianity, the band once known as ""Quiet Riot"": ""Pious Riot""."
92375,356,247,1129000,Pious Riot,PROTESTANT YOUTH FEST,"CUM ON FEEL THE LORD / HEAVEN'S YOUR REWARD / WE'LL GET SAVED, SAVED, SAVED..."
92376,356,248,1137000,Marge Simpson,PROTESTANT YOUTH FEST,"What's wrong, Bart? You love youth culture!"
92377,356,249,1141000,Bart Simpson,PROTESTANT YOUTH FEST,"Mom, a religion isn't cool just because they've glommed onto some crappy rock band from the nineteen forties."
92378,356,250,1147000,Band Member,PROTESTANT YOUTH FEST,"Hey, we've played more state fairs than the Beatles!"
92380,356,252,1151000,Bart Simpson,PROTESTANT YOUTH FEST,"You just don't get it. I've made a sacred commitment to the Catholic church, and... paintball! Awesome!"
92382,356,254,1169000,Bart Simpson,YOUTH FESTIVAL,Die! Die! Die!
92383,356,255,1171000,Marge Simpson,YOUTH FESTIVAL,"Oh Bart, I knew one of these dumb things would work!"

92385,356,257,1183000,Homer Simpson,YOUTH FESTIVAL,"Hop in, boy! We'll show your mother our god kicks her god's butt."

92387,356,259,1195000,Bart Simpson,YOUTH FESTIVAL,"Easy on the zeal, church-os! I've got something to say."
92388,356,260,1199000,Bart Simpson,YOUTH FESTIVAL,"Don't you get it -- it's all Christianity, people! The little stupid differences are nothing next to the big stupid similarities!"
92389,356,261,1208000,Ned Flanders,YOUTH FESTIVAL,He's right. Can't we all get together and concentrate on our real enemies: monogamous gays and stem cells?
92390,356,262,1214000,Father Sean,YOUTH FESTIVAL,"Well said, mate. Put 'er there."
92391,356,263,1217000,Ned Flanders,YOUTH FESTIVAL,My pleasure.
92392,356,264,1219000,Flanders's Thoughts,YOUTH FESTIVAL,Note to self: have hand re-blessed.
92393,356,265,1221000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,YOUTH FESTIVAL,"Bart, you've taught us all an important lesson. We Christians have been niggling over details for far too long."
92395,356,266,1228000,Father Sean,YOUTH FESTIVAL,"Amen. And I hope that from this day forward, we all learn to take Bart's message of tolerance and understanding to heart."
92397,356,268,1240000,1st Leader,POST-APOCALYPTIC BATTLEFIELD,"We believe that God's last prophet, Bart Simpson, preached a message of tolerance and love."
92398,356,269,1247000,2nd Leader,POST-APOCALYPTIC BATTLEFIELD,"We believe the holy Bartman preached a message of understanding and peace -- before he was betrayed by his follower, Milhouse, and pulled apart by snow-mobiles until he died."
