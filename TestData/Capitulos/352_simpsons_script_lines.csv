91147,352,13,76000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Really? I'm a Libra. There's a lot of compatibility there.
91148,352,14,79000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"Skinner, be gay on your own time. Today's the day we choose who gets the school's vending-machine contract! I anticipate quite the dog and pony show."
91149,352,15,88000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Sir, this school has a strict no-animal policy. I assume these are hypothetical dogs and poni?"
91152,352,18,94000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Skinner's Office,"Yarr. Everyone likes a gumball machine, so why not a gumbo machine? Yarr."

91155,352,21,108000,Gil Gunderson,Skinner's Office,"It couldn't be simpler! Kids write down what they want, put their money in the can and I take the bus to the supermarket, and bring the snacks the next day! Huh?"
91156,352,22,119000,Gil Gunderson,Skinner's Office,Is that a yes?
91157,352,23,121000,Lindsay Naegle,Skinner's Office,"Kids want a snack that skateboards, won't clean its room, and hates homework."
91158,352,24,125000,Male Executive,Skinner's Office,"That's why we created Scarf-ables by ""Scammer and Z-Dog!"""
91159,352,25,129000,Lindsay Naegle,Skinner's Office,These two spokes-rebels were invented by the marketing team that came up with Hip-Hopsicles... the urban Popsicle.

91163,352,29,147000,Male Executive,Skinner's Office,It's like a fundraising school bake sale -- with slang as the Saran wrap!
91164,352,30,151000,Lindsay Naegle,Skinner's Office,And a subsonic neuro-jammer to disrupt the child's judgment center.
91165,352,31,155000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Fair enough. I assume these snacks are nutritious?
91166,352,32,158000,Lindsay Naegle,Skinner's Office,"That's really none of our business. The bottom line is, half the profits go to your school or camp."

91190,352,56,281000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, no machine could ever replace you. Why you-- or could it?"
91191,352,57,289000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge-bot! I'm ready for some lovin'!
91192,352,58,300000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why did I give her a gun? But I repeat: no one is being replaced by a machine. Until all the kinks are worked out.
91193,352,59,307000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well until that day, I'm still Bart's mother, and I don't like him stuffing himself with junk."

91206,352,72,431000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you dance? Dance?!
91208,352,74,438000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Doctor, little kids aren't supposed to have heart attacks. They're supposed to skin their knees, and poke their eyes out, and be smothered by cats."
91209,352,75,446000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Well Bart had a heart attack, and it's his own damn fault."
91210,352,76,449000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,These dark spots in his pulmonary arteries are malted milk balls.

91226,352,92,552000,Bart Simpson,Cemetery,"Yeah, but what does not kill me makes me stronger. Wow, that was a lot of words -- I need some energy."
91228,352,94,563000,Krusty the Clown,KRUSTY SET,"Hey hey, kids! Heart disease can strike anyone, including heavy-drinking, chain-smoking clowns. That's why I had the doctor install a zipper!"

91236,352,102,613000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw honey, please take this seriously. When people used to ask me how you were doing, I said ""at least he's got his health."" Now you've got nothing! Nothing! For me, please try a healthy vegetable."
91237,352,103,622000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay Mom, for you, I'll try."
91240,352,106,630000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Okay, now we know you're allergic to cauliflower. But I made a special platter of vegetables that are good for you."
91241,352,107,637000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,It's graffiti you can eatie!
91242,352,108,639000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"You get better, son. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be going to the ""library."""

91256,352,122,728000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"I'm tellin' you, Bart, one vice leads to another. And then you wind up like me: so jaded, the only thing that gets you off is free-basing ground-up moon rocks."
91257,352,123,743000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,All this does is get me to normal.
91258,352,124,747000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thank you, Krusty. Once again you've delivered an important message wrapped in entertainment. And I'm so touched that all of you would take the time to eat my shorts, lame-o's!"

91272,352,138,816000,Marge Simpson,Serenity Ranch,"Don't you mean ""tough love?"""
91273,352,139,816000,Tab Spangler,Serenity Ranch,"Tough love? Of course, this has never made sense! The sign shop guy lied. Stanley! You didn't question the word ""luck?"" Now look what we've got. Thanks for the correction, that's part of the honesty."
91274,352,140,836000,Homer Simpson,Serenity Ranch,"Son, I just wanna leave you with a piece of advice -- become emotionally dead. Leave your body. Make lots of friends!"
91275,352,141,847000,Tab Spangler,Serenity Ranch,"Wake up, fatties! Stop dreaming about butter -- dream calories are real calories."

91317,352,179,1001000,Tab Spangler,Evergreen Terrace,"You see, son, every family has to make extra income when they send a child like you to a place like mine. You're lucky this is just a youth hostel. We had one family who had to take in dry cleaning. The chemicals killed their dog! Well that's what they told us in the lawsuit. I don't see a dog living past fourteen anyway, do you?"
91319,352,181,1021000,Bart Simpson,Front of Simpson Home,"They can't see or hear us, right?"
91320,352,182,1023000,Tab Spangler,Front of Simpson Home,"We're not the Ghost of Christmas Past, Bart. They can see us. If I were invisible, do you think I'd waste my time with this belt/shirt combination?"
91321,352,183,1031000,Tab Spangler,Front of Simpson Home,"Excuse me, we're looking for Mr. and Mrs. Simpson. I'm sorry to say, this is their son."
91322,352,184,1035000,Female German Backpacker,Front of Simpson Home,"Oh, so he's the strudel-sucking globbenheimer who has bankrupted them with his expensive treatments."
91323,352,185,1042000,Tab Spangler,Front of Simpson Home,Strudel-sucking globbenheimer. You need to think about that. That's what the human race thinks of you.
91325,352,187,1049000,German Student,LIVING ROOM,"Problem number thirty-five with America: no universal healthcare. Number thirty-six: no metric system. What is this, the time of Charlemagne? Answer me! Answer me now!"
