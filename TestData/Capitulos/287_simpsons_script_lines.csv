72757,287,1,27000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Welcome to Career Day. Here to tell you about his job is Bart's friend's Dad, Kirk Van Houten."
72758,287,2,34000,Kirk Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,How many of you children have gone out to your car and found a flyer on the windshield?
72759,287,3,39000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Are you the guy that puts them there?
72761,287,4,41000,Kirk Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"No, I-I'm his assistant. But one time he was sick, and, and he let me do it. I totally screwed it up."
72762,287,5,49000,Kirk Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, um, that, that's it."
72763,287,6,51000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I see. Well, we, uh, still have fifty-six minutes left. Any questions?"
72764,287,7,58000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Do you know Mom's getting re-married?
72765,287,8,61000,Kirk Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"What? But she... I-- Um, I think we should probably talk about that later, son."
72766,287,9,67000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"No, you might as well talk about it now."
72767,287,10,69000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,That was one lousy career day.
72768,287,11,71000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"If we can't get better speakers, we'll have to go back to teaching. And I can't stare at those lifeless fish eyes anymore!"

72770,287,13,79000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I was wondering what she was doing here.
72771,287,14,81000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,The speakers are poor because we're letting just anybody do it.
72772,287,15,85000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Groundskeeper Willie, Groundskeeper Willie's enemy Seamus..."
72773,287,16,88000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, Seamus. Ninety minutes of watching a man drink in a bathtub."
72774,287,17,94000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I think we should try the Springfield Speaker's Bureau."
72775,287,18,97000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Good idea.
72776,287,19,99000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Seamus, uh, we won't need you to speak any more."
72777,287,20,102000,Seamus,Springfield Elementary School,"WHUT? This is your doin', Willie. I'll turn your groin to puddin'."

72784,287,27,132000,Mr. Blackwell,SPEAKER'S BUREAU,"Oh, please. I've seen nicer chains on a set of snow tires."
72785,287,28,136000,Mr. T,SPEAKER'S BUREAU,I pity the fool who derives self esteem from mocking other people's clothes.
72786,287,29,140000,Mr. Blackwell,SPEAKER'S BUREAU,I hate myself.

72603,287,31,144000,Seymour Skinner,SPEAKER'S BUREAU,Who?

72789,287,33,150000,Seymour Skinner,SPEAKER'S BUREAU,"Yes, fine. He'll do. Anything to end this unstructured conversation."
72791,287,35,154000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"...and in a gutless act of political correctness, pizza day will now be known as ""Italian-American sauce bread day."""
72792,287,36,161000,Luigi,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, now that's-a sensitivity. Right, Giuseppe?"
72794,287,38,167000,Luigi,Springfield Elementary School,Giuseppe is such a happy monkey.
72795,287,39,169000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"And now today's guest speaker... the creator of ""Danger Dog,"" Geoff Jenkins!"

72802,287,46,194000,Danger Dog,Springfield Town Hall,I hope this is important. I've got a hot date tonight. With Sarah Jessica Barker.
72803,287,47,200000,MAYOR,Springfield Town Hall,"Nice. Anyway, your arch enemy, Molly Ringworm, has threatened to destroy the city with her puke ray. And--"
72804,287,48,212000,Danger Dog,Springfield Town Hall,The Mayor's barf is worse than his bite.
72805,287,49,216000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Town Hall,"Ah, le mot juste."
72807,287,51,234000,Jenkins,Springfield Town Hall,"If you freeze the frame, you can see that the chunks of barf are actually pictures of our animators and their friends."
72808,287,52,244000,Jenkins,Springfield Town Hall,Are there any questions?
72809,287,53,247000,Martin Prince,Springfield Town Hall,What state does Danger Dog live in?
72810,287,54,249000,Jenkins,Springfield Town Hall,Michigan.
72811,287,55,251000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Why does Danger Dog mean more to me than school or church?
72812,287,56,254000,Jenkins,Springfield Town Hall,Because those things suck.
72814,287,58,258000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Town Hall,"Uh... I have a question, Mr. Jenkins. Could you tell us about all the hard work and buckling down that you put into every cartoon?"
72815,287,59,267000,Jenkins,Springfield Town Hall,Are you kidding? This is the easiest job in the world. I spend most of my time eating candy and going to R-rated movies.
72816,287,60,273000,Kids,Springfield Town Hall,Wow! / Cool! / Great!
72817,287,61,277000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Town Hall,"Well then, eh, tell the children how hard you studied in school to get where you are today."
72818,287,62,282000,Jenkins,Springfield Town Hall,"Studied? Kids, all I ever did was sit in class and doodle. Like this one -- it's what your principal would look like as a woman."
72819,287,63,289000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Town Hall,/ Haw haw!
72820,287,64,295000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Town Hall,"Fire, children -- hurry outside! There's no time to let today's lecture sink in!"
72821,287,65,301000,Jenkins,Springfield Town Hall,Why'd you do that?
72822,287,66,302000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Town Hall,I won't stand by while you're glamorizing sass! Now those youngsters will throw their lives away... drawing things that never were.
72824,287,68,313000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I'm comin' up with my own cartoon character. He's called Danger Cat.

72829,287,73,333000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I'm my own toughest critic, but I think it's genius. Now to sell it for millions."
72831,287,75,340000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,This comic strip is lame and derivative.

73043,287,289,1093000,Todd Linux,BetterThanTV.com,"Bart, it's not about how much stock you have, it's about how much copper wire you can get out of the building with."

73045,287,291,1104000,Bart Simpson,BetterThanTV.com,"Yeah, but at least now that my show's cancelled, I don't need material, so there's no need to lure my Dad into the trap I set up for him. The trap!"

73080,287,326,1251000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,"You see, these boils on Homer's neck are pent-up rage. If Bart's trap hadn't set Homer off, the anger would have overwhelmed Homer's system."
73081,287,327,1260000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,You mean I shouldn't punish Bart at all?
