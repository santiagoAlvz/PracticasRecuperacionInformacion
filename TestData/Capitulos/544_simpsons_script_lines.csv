141490,544,12,115000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That man can't remember anything except our number!
141492,544,14,122000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Get in the car, dad."
141493,544,15,126000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield Retirement Castle,You do know I'm a doctor now.
141494,544,16,128000,Hibbert's Father,Springfield Retirement Castle,Yeah! M.D.! Major Dummy!
141495,544,17,131000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Grampa, what happened?"
141496,544,18,134000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,This place is unlivable.
141497,544,19,134000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"My contract clearly promised ""barely livable""!"
141498,544,20,134000,City Health Employee,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yeah, well, we're closin' down Codger Stadium here until they fix up their violations. And there are a lot of 'em."

141500,544,22,156000,City Health Employee,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Like I said, a lotta violations."
141501,544,23,159000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh... I guess Grampa's coming home with us. Unless... what about that nice dog boarding place? The really good one, where they each have their own dog ""partner."""
141502,544,24,169000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,No kennels!
141503,544,25,169000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"You're right. Bad idea, bad idea... Should we just, y'know... drive by and take a look at the place? Bad idea, bad."
141504,544,26,183000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,When are your relatives going to be here?
141505,544,27,186000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,Can I be honest with you? They're not.
141506,544,28,189000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,We're all alone in this world.
141507,544,29,191000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,All I have left is a phone message from my late wife.
141508,544,30,195000,Old Jewish Man's Late Wife,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Pick up the phone, big shot! I know you're there!"
141509,544,31,200000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,You're both coming home with us!

141512,544,34,209000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,Don't get fat!
141513,544,35,213000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Honey, Grampa is the closest thing I have to a father and I love him. But three octogenocerouses?"
141514,544,36,220000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Homie, Homie, we'll be old someday."
141515,544,37,224000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Speak for yourself. Glug-glug-glug. Chomp-chomp-chomp. Beeeeep. My lifestyle is my retirement plan.
141517,544,39,238000,Hibbert's Father,Springfield Retirement Castle,And don't forget my ripple!
141518,544,40,241000,Hibbert's Father,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Without ripple, I never would have had you! Ripple's your real daddy!"
141520,544,42,251000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is gonna be a swell flophouse, sister. So... where should we park our pills?"
141521,544,43,252000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What pills?
141523,544,45,262000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Marge. It's childproof."
141524,544,46,272000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, how are we doing with those cots?"
141525,544,47,275000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh... c'mon, boy. Your job is to guide me."
141526,544,48,279000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... I really think you should watch your temper.
141527,544,49,282000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I mean down the stairs, you stupid kid!"
141528,544,50,284000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Stupid kid."" Do you really think that's the way we should communicate?"
141529,544,51,287000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You just wanna see your old man trip and fall! Well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but, what the--"
141530,544,52,295000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not what I was hoping for, but it'll do."
141533,544,55,301000,Coach Krupt,BOYS LOCKER ROOM,"Okay, boys, shower up. And I'd better hear some towels snapping!"
141534,544,56,306000,Coach Krupt,BOYS LOCKER ROOM,"Muntz! What is wrong with you? Now, you get undressed in front of everyone who's staring at you!"
141536,544,58,313000,Milhouse Van Houten,BOYS LOCKER ROOM,Is that women's underwear?
141537,544,59,316000,Nelson Muntz,BOYS LOCKER ROOM,"My mom can't afford to buy me clothes, so I wear her hand-me-downs!"
141539,544,61,325000,Coach Krupt,BOYS LOCKER ROOM,Muntz! There's a kind of poverty that toughens you up! But this is sad.
141541,544,63,333000,Bart Simpson,BOYS LOCKER ROOM,Hey! Leave him alone. I too know the pain of hand-me-down underwear.
141543,544,64,337000,Bart Simpson,BOYS LOCKER ROOM,"My dad buys the underpants gorillas wear during monkey shows. So if you're gonna laugh at Nelson, laugh at me too."
141544,544,65,348000,Nelson Muntz,BOYS LOCKER ROOM,"Simpson, I won't forget this. From now on, you and I are as tight as whiteys."
141549,544,70,423000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've had it up to here with those freeloading wrinkle bags. They pee all night, they cry all day and every time they use the computer the font is huge!"
141551,544,72,433000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, did it ever occur to you that we're learning how to take care of you when you're older by watching the way you treat Grampa?"
141552,544,73,440000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Have you seen how he treats my Grampa? Never visits him. Never even acknowledges his existence.
141553,544,74,446000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Your Grampa's alive?
141554,544,75,448000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah!
141555,544,76,449000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"O-kay. Well, can you please be nicer to our Grampa? For me? I love Grampa. You may not realize it, but he's a treasure."
141556,544,77,460000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Keep it down in there, you jabbermouths! I'm trying to watch C-SPAN Two!"
141557,544,78,466000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Please.
141558,544,79,467000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay. You know, I love him too. In a manly way that never shows itself."
141560,544,81,474000,Old Jewish Man,Simpson Basement,Now we'll need three hearing aid batteries -- all different and hard to get.
141561,544,82,480000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Basement,"And this has to be in the fridge, next to the butter. And the butter has to be open."
141562,544,83,485000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Basement,Oh... I'll see what I can do.
141563,544,84,487000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Basement,"I can handle them from now on, Marge."
141564,544,85,489000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Basement,"Gentlemen, I've been thinking. My glorious youth and beauty won't last forever. Someday, when the leaves have turned, and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese, I will be old."
141565,544,86,500000,Old Jewish Man,Simpson Basement,"What's your point, pound cake?"
141566,544,87,507000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Basement,I'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.
141567,544,88,507000,Jasper Beardly,Simpson Basement,What did he say?
141568,544,89,507000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Basement,He wants us to see if ghosts exist.
141569,544,90,509000,Old Jewish Man,Simpson Basement,"Ooh... they do. My uncle Bill is here right now. Oh, Bill, Bill, I'm so sorry I wasn't a very good ladder holder."
141542,544,91,517000,Uncle Bill,Simpson Basement,"That's alright, enough about that. Did the clock ever get wound?"
141570,544,93,535000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,This can only be good.
141571,544,94,535000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,This family has had a lot of hoods put over their heads.
141572,544,95,535000,Lou,Simpson Home,"Chief, something about that looks fishy."
141573,544,96,537000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Lou, you've got a suspicious mind, you know? You remind me of that Elvis song. Uh, ""Clambake."" You know, 'cause you open your yap when things get hot. Clambake."
141574,544,97,556000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Where am I?
141575,544,98,559000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,"Now, enter the stolen bicycle graveyard."
141576,544,99,571000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,We've decided to make you an honorary bully.
141577,544,100,575000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,Bestow upon him the necklace of unknown retainers.
141578,544,101,581000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Um... thanks, but I'm not sure I want to be a bully."
141579,544,102,586000,DOLPH,Simpson Home,It's too late. You've seen our faces.
141582,544,105,592000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Wow, never had breakfast at six in the morning before."
141583,544,106,595000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Street,I love yakkin' at the manager while he's trying to unlock the door.
141584,544,107,595000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Street,Now we'll talk about dead people you never met while we get a little exercise!
141586,544,109,607000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Oh, when does the exercise start?"
141587,544,110,608000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Mall,This is it.
141588,544,111,608000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Mall,"Yeah, we're mall walking."
141589,544,112,610000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,Oh my God! This counts as exercise? I'm barely moving and I'm smelling Cinnebun. Sometimes you have to wait till you're thirty-eight to discover who you really are. I'm a seventy-nine-year-old man!
141590,544,113,625000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Son, welcome to the club."
141591,544,114,631000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Mall,Now say something pathetic.
141592,544,115,634000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Uh, okay! Um... I can't."
141593,544,116,638000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Mall,That's my boy.

141605,544,128,659000,Mildred,BINGO HALL,"Well, I'm not surprised -- the way he tears into corn on the cob."
141606,544,129,664000,Grampa Simpson,BINGO HALL,"Now Mildred, he's a married man! You can't see the ring because his finger's too fat!"
141607,544,130,670000,Mildred,BINGO HALL,"Join the party, Abe. There's plenty of room in my bed... once they take the railings down."
141608,544,131,678000,Grampa Simpson,BINGO HALL,I said beat it... for the time being!
141609,544,132,682000,Grampa Simpson,BINGO HALL,"Now Homer, you stay away from those red door hoochies. They're just trying to get a chicken dinner outta ya."
141611,544,134,689000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, thanks for the chicken dinner. How did you know I wanted one?"
141612,544,135,693000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All you gals like chicken dinners, Marge."
141613,544,136,697000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't call me a gal. Makes me feel like I'm your mother.
141614,544,137,700000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Better turn up the heat.
141615,544,138,704000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's eighty-two degrees!

141620,544,143,718000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You won't feel so bolloxed once my social security checks start coming.
141621,544,144,723000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,They're not coming for another twenty-nine years! Did your earlobes get longer?
141622,544,145,729000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Falsies.
141624,544,147,739000,DOLPH,Forest,Whoa! A tweet from Chester!

141639,544,162,773000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, Homer got up early to count and sort pills. Then he called the police when a Frisbee landed on our lawn. Then he went to the drugstore for an egg cream, but he only brought a nickel."
141640,544,163,785000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't mind that he grew bald... I didn't mind that he got fat... I didn't mind that he got fatter. But no one told me he'd get older than me.
141641,544,164,794000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Say it, honey. You're no longer attracted to him."
141642,544,165,805000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe.

141662,544,185,890000,Chester Lampwick,Amphitheater,They say the day of the bully is over. Popular music condemns us. Documentary filmmakers expose our craft. And cyber bullying has taken away the warmth of human contact. But I say to you the day of the bully has just begun!
141663,544,186,907000,Chester Lampwick,Amphitheater,Can you dig it?
141664,544,187,909000,Gang Member,Amphitheater,"Hey, why are you doing this?"
141665,544,188,911000,Wilbur,Amphitheater,'Cause I don't wanna sit around like Prince Charles waiting for the Queen to die.

141672,544,195,939000,Nelson Muntz,Amphitheater,How does everyone know?
141674,544,197,948000,FEMALE D. J.,Amusement Park,"To all you boppers out there, be on the lookout for a sling-daddy who took down our main man Chester. This is KBLY, your source for bully news, weather and sports. One hundred percent supported by money taken from nerds."
141675,544,198,960000,Jimbo Jones,Amusement Park,"I can't believe you did that, Bart. I don't even want to sit on the same side of this car with you. I'm just doin' it for balance."
141676,544,199,967000,Bart Simpson,Amusement Park,I didn't shoot him!
141677,544,200,968000,Jimbo Jones,Amusement Park,"Oh yeah? Well, why'd you bring your slingshot?"
141678,544,201,971000,Bart Simpson,Amusement Park,I don't know. I feel naked without it.
141679,544,202,973000,DOLPH,Amusement Park,"Yeah, I get that. That's how I feel about my eyebrow ring."
141680,544,203,978000,Jimbo Jones,Amusement Park,The only way back to Springfield is on the subway. Past everyone else's territory. We'll just have to wait it out here until...
141681,544,204,982000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Amusement Park,We're gonna have to jump for it!
141682,544,205,991000,DOLPH,Amusement Park,Noooo! I lost my flip-flop!
141683,544,206,994000,Jimbo Jones,Amusement Park,Just keep moving!
141684,544,207,1002000,Moe Szyslak,Amusement Park,"Oh. Well, well, well. Looks like youse and me may be up here for a while, eh? Yeah."

141688,544,211,1028000,S.a.t. Prepper #2,Amusement Park,I didn't say to begin!
