33333,152,28,183000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"And when I listen to a really good song, I start nodding my head, like I'm saying ""yes!"" to every beat. ""Yes, yes, yes this rocks!"" And then sometimes I switch it up like ""No, no, no, don't stop a-rockin'..."""
33334,152,29,199000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Dad, please. You're embarrassing us."
33335,152,30,201000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"No, I'm not. I'm teaching you about rock music."
33336,152,31,202000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Now -- Grand Funk Railroad paved the way for Jefferson Airplane, which cleared the way for Jefferson Starship. The stage was now set for the Alan Parsons Project, which I believe was some sort of Hovercraft..."
33337,152,32,215000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Dad! No one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! You have the worst, lamest taste in music ever!"
33338,152,33,223000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,I'm just trying to party with you guys.

33353,152,48,282000,Homer Simpson,Street,Why do you need new bands? Everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. It's a scientific fact.

33367,152,62,343000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Room,"You wouldn't understand, Dad. You're not with it."
33368,152,63,348000,Grampa Simpson,Homer's Room,"I used to be ""with it."" But then they changed what ""it"" was. Now what I'm with isn't ""it,"" and what's ""it"" seems weird and scary to me. It'll happen to you."

33373,152,68,372000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I went to the record store today, and they were playing all this music I'd never heard of. It was like the store had gone crazy."

33376,152,70,385000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's fine for you, Marge. But I used to rock and roll all night and party ev-a-ry day. Then it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. I've got to get out of this rut and back into the groove!"
33377,152,71,401000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, good. Try to include Bart and Lisa."
33379,152,73,405000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,"Dear Lord, if you keep Homer from embarrassing us today, we promise to build several churches in your honor."

33386,152,80,433000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Well... what have we here? Looks like your un-cool dad scored tickets to Hullabalooza.
33387,152,81,441000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,"Bart, these look real."
33388,152,82,443000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,Check the authenticator spot.

33403,152,101,555000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"Hey, I've been safari-in' since before you were born."
33404,152,102,558000,Lisa Simpson,Hullabaloooza,Wearing a Jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your connection to reggae music.
33405,152,103,563000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"Well, excuuuuuuse me!"
33406,152,104,568000,Bart Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"You know what, Dad? Maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a while."
33407,152,105,573000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"Well, Homer, this is it. Time to get back with the people. The young people."

33417,152,115,627000,Lisa Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"It may be bleak, but this music is really getting to the crowd."
33418,152,116,631000,Bart Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"Aw, making teenagers depressed is like shootin' fish in a barrel."
33420,152,118,634000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza Fairgrounds,"Oh, it makes no sense. I haven't changed since high school and suddenly I'm uncool. I've been kicked out of paradise."
33421,152,119,650000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza Fairgrounds,I'll never be part of the scene again!
33422,152,120,655000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza Fairgrounds,Uh-oh.
33423,152,121,663000,Roadie,Hullabaloooza Fairgrounds,"Oh man, there goes Peter Frampton's big finale. He's gonna be pissed off."
33424,152,122,668000,Peter Frampton,Hullabaloooza Fairgrounds,You're damn right I'm gonna be pissed off. I bought that pig at Pink Floyd's yard sale.
33425,152,123,673000,Lisa Simpson,Hullabaloooza Fairgrounds,"Dad, are you okay?"
33426,152,124,674000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza Fairgrounds,I'm fine.
33427,152,125,678000,Manager,Hullabaloooza Fairgrounds,"Sir, I run Hullabalooza's Pageant of the Trans-Mundane -- the freak show -- and I've been looking for a big fatso to shoot with a cannon. I'd like very much for you to be that fatso."
33429,152,127,692000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,So you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.
33430,152,128,696000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't think I have a choice, Marge."
33431,152,129,699000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Of course you have a choice.
33432,152,130,701000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How do you figure?
33433,152,131,702000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along.
33434,152,132,707000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, Marge, in some ways you and I are very different people..."
33436,152,134,716000,Manager,Hullabaloooza,"And now, get ready for the man...with the iron stomach!"
33437,152,135,727000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"Hi, everybody. Is everybody... good?"

33441,152,139,767000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"Homer Simpson, smiling politely. You know, my kids think you're the greatest. And thanks to your gloomy music they've finally stopped dreaming of a future I can't possibly provide."
33442,152,140,777000,Billy Corgan,Hullabaloooza,"Well, we try to make a difference."
33444,152,142,781000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Dear Bart and Lisa...
33445,152,143,781000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,All is well on tour with America's most popular alternative music festival...

33448,152,146,794000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,...and I like to think sometimes we get a message across as well.
33450,152,148,805000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"But the main thing is, I've finally tapped into that spirit of self-destruction that makes rock 'n' roll the king of musics."
33451,152,149,817000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Woo hoo!
33457,152,155,822000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza Stage,"Hello, ticket-holders!"

33461,152,159,842000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza Stage,"Thank you! And remember: Don't trust anyone over thirty. And now, Peter Frampton!"
33463,152,161,852000,Peter Frampton,Hullabaloooza Stage,"Thanks, Homer. Homer Simpson everyone!"
33464,152,162,858000,Billy Corgan,Hullabaloooza Stage,"Hey, Homer, looks like our next stop is your hometown, Springfield."
33465,152,163,861000,D'arcy,Hullabaloooza Stage,Is it true that we have to bring our own water?
33466,152,164,864000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza Stage,"We've got a little rule back home: if it's brown, drink it down; if it's black, send it back."
33467,152,165,869000,Jimmy Chamberlin,Hullabaloooza Stage,"The hometown show's the big one, Homer."
33468,152,166,871000,James Iha,Hullabaloooza Stage,"Yeah, people who called you a weirdo in high school get to see what a successful freak you've become."
33469,152,167,876000,D'arcy,Hullabaloooza Stage,Hey -- I wasn't a weirdo. I was in the Audio Visual Club.
33470,152,168,880000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza Stage,"Really? Me, too. But I got kicked out 'cause of my views on Vietnam. Also, I was stealing projectors."
33471,152,169,888000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza Stage,"Anyway, get ready, beer belly! We're gonna show Springfield what we're made of!"
33472,152,170,895000,Smashing Pumpkins,Hullabaloooza Stage,"Alright, Homer! / etc."
33473,152,171,898000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza Stage,That was odd.
33474,152,172,900000,Manager,Hullabaloooza Stage,Gee. I don't like the sound of that.
33475,152,173,904000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza Stage,No biggie. I'm cool.
33476,152,174,905000,Manager,Hullabaloooza Stage,"Homer, nothing's more important to me than the health and well-being of my freaks. I'm sending you to a vet."
33478,152,176,911000,Veterinarian,Veterinarian's Office,"My God. Those cannonballs have practically demolished your stomach. From now on, no cannonballs, no spicy foods, and when you lie in a hammock, please -- rest your beer on your head or your genitals."
33479,152,177,926000,Homer Simpson,Veterinarian's Office,Rules. I'm a rocker. I don't care for rules.
33480,152,178,929000,Veterinarian,Veterinarian's Office,"Mr. Simpson, this is serious. If you take one more cannonball to the gut... you will die!"
33481,152,179,937000,Homer Simpson,Veterinarian's Office,"Die? Well, you don't scare me, Doc. 'Cause dying would be a stone groove. Got any messages for Jimi Hendrix?"
33482,152,180,947000,Veterinarian,Veterinarian's Office,"Yes, pick up your puppy."
33484,152,182,958000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So what's it like being famous, Dad?"
33485,152,183,958000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"People know your name, but you don't know theirs. It's great."
33486,152,184,962000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, do you wear boxers or briefs?"
33487,152,185,965000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Nope.
33488,152,186,966000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What religion are you?
33489,152,187,967000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life -- Christianity."
33490,152,188,974000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What's with all the questions?
33491,152,189,976000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just some report I gotta do for school. Hey, you want some pie?"
33492,152,190,978000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure, we've got a lotta catchin' up to do."
33495,152,193,1002000,Security Guard,Hullabaloooza,Clear the way. Clear the way. Performer coming through.
33496,152,194,1006000,Marge Simpson,Hullabaloooza,This is so exciting. Last time I got to go backstage was when Bart ripped his pants at the Christmas play.
33497,152,195,1012000,Bart Simpson,Hullabaloooza,Mo-om!
33498,152,196,1012000,B-Real,Hullabaloooza,Haw-haw!
33499,152,197,1019000,Roadie,Hullabaloooza,"Hello, bands. Who is playing with the London Symphony Orchestra? C'mon, people, somebody ordered the London Symphony Orchestra... possibly while high. Cypress Hill, I'm looking in your direction."
33500,152,198,1034000,Cypress Hill,Hullabaloooza,"Hey, man, did we order an orchestra? Uh, I don't know... I think we gotta do somethin'."
33501,152,199,1043000,DJ Muggs,Hullabaloooza,"Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, we think we did. Uh, do you know ""Insane in the Brain""?"
33502,152,200,1049000,London Orchestra Guy,Hullabaloooza,We mostly know classical. But we could give it a shot.
33503,152,201,1062000,Marge Simpson,Hullabaloooza,Now this I like.
33504,152,202,1066000,FRAMPTON'S GUITAR,Hullabaloooza,Do you feel... like we do.
33505,152,203,1076000,Jimbo Jones,Hullabaloooza,"Man, that guy's guitar is talkin'!"
33506,152,204,1078000,Otto Mann,Hullabaloooza,"Hey! My shoes are talkin', too!"
33507,152,205,1081000,Otto's Left Shoe,Hullabaloooza,"Don't worry, we won't hurt you."
33508,152,206,1085000,Otto's Right Shoe,Hullabaloooza,We only want to have some fun.
33509,152,207,1090000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hullabaloooza,"And to think, Smithers -- you laughed when I bought Ticketmaster. ""Nobody's going to pay a 100% service charge."""
33510,152,208,1095000,Waylon Smithers,Hullabaloooza,"Well, it's a policy that ensures a healthy mix of the rich and the ignorant, Sir."
33511,152,209,1104000,Peter Frampton,Hullabaloooza,Do you feel like we do?! Springfield... Yeah!
33512,152,210,1109000,Peter Frampton,Hullabaloooza,"Do... wait... Do you... do you feel... do... do you feel...? oh, come on... Do you feel?"
33515,152,211,1120000,Peter Frampton,Hullabaloooza,"Ah, Homer Simpson wrecks my pig. Cypress Hill steals my orchestra. And Sonic Youth's in my cooler! Get outta there, you kids!"
33516,152,212,1128000,Thurston Moore,Hullabaloooza,"Aw c'mon, Mr. Frampton, you're not gonna eat all that watermelon."
33517,152,213,1133000,Peter Frampton,Hullabaloooza,"Please, I'm trying to perform."
33518,152,214,1136000,Steve Shelley,Hullabaloooza,Go ahead. We'll stay here and guard your cooler.
33520,152,216,1145000,Manager,Hullabaloooza,"And now, Springfield, this is the moment that you've been waiting for... The man who embodies everything about rock 'n' roll, except the music. Give it up for your very own homegrown hero -- Homer -- Simpson!"
33521,152,217,1162000,Milhouse Van Houten,Hullabaloooza,I used to carpool with that guy.
33522,152,218,1166000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"Oh, this is heavy. Okay, Homer, don't fear the Reaper."
33523,152,219,1173000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"Oh, I'm gonna die."
33524,152,220,1174000,Marge Simpson,Hullabaloooza,Cannons are designed to hurt. They're designed to hurt.
33525,152,221,1179000,Lisa Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"Shh, Mom. Dad needs our support."
33526,152,222,1185000,Bart Simpson,Hullabaloooza,You're the coolest dad alive!
33527,152,223,1215000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"Oh, Marge. I thought I had an appetite for destruction, but all I wanted was a club sandwich."
33528,152,224,1221000,Marge Simpson,Hullabaloooza,There might be one in this cooler.
33529,152,225,1223000,Marge Simpson,Hullabaloooza,Oh. Here we go.
33531,152,227,1226000,Lee Ranaldo,Hullabaloooza,"Aw, man. Homer wussed out. I'm so disillusioned."
33532,152,228,1230000,Kim Gordon,Hullabaloooza,"Hey, Hullabalooza isn't about freaks. It's about music and advertising and youth-oriented product positioning."
33533,152,229,1237000,Sen-Dog,Hullabaloooza,That and getting toasted. Nicely toasted.
33534,152,230,1240000,Manager,Hullabaloooza,"Homer, I'm sorry. There's nothing worse than a yellow-bellied freak, unless that's his act. I expect your letter of resignation on my desk."
33535,152,231,1250000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza,You have a desk?
33536,152,232,1251000,Manager,Hullabaloooza,I mean the hood of my car.
33537,152,233,1253000,Homer Simpson,Hullabaloooza,"I'll miss you Pumpkins, but I just can't share your bleak world view. I've got too much to live for."
33538,152,234,1258000,Billy Corgan,Hullabaloooza,"We envy you, Homer. All we have is our music, our legions of fans, our millions of dollars, and our youth."
33539,152,235,1266000,Billy Corgan,Hullabaloooza,Woo Hoo!
33540,152,236,1267000,James Iha,Hullabaloooza,Let's all go out and buy fur coats!
33541,152,237,1270000,Jimmy Chamberlin,Hullabaloooza,I want a walk-in humidor.
33513,152,239,1275000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,...so I realized that being with my family is more important than being cool.
33543,152,240,1280000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Dad, what you just said was powerfully un-cool."
33544,152,241,1284000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"You know what the song says, ""It's hip to be square."""
33545,152,242,1284000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,That song is so lame.
33546,152,243,1290000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,So lame that it's cool?
33547,152,244,1292000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,No.
33548,152,245,1293000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Am I cool, kids?"
33549,152,246,1294000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,No.
33550,152,247,1295000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Good. I'm glad. And that's what makes me cool -- not caring, right?"
33551,152,248,1300000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,No.
33552,152,249,1301000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Well, how the hell do you be cool? I feel like we've tried everything here."
33553,152,250,1305000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Wait, Marge. Maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to be told you're cool."
33554,152,251,1311000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Well, sure you do."
33555,152,252,1312000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,How else would you know?
