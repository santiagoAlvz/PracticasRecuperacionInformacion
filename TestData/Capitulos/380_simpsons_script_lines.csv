98657,380,34,185000,Marge Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Cymbals... snare... high hat... tom-tom... sticks, mallet and brushes... this is a drum kit!"
98658,380,35,192000,Dr. Brentano,Psychiatrist's Office,"Drumming demands energy and concentration -- one of which Bart has, and one of which Bart needs."

98667,380,44,294000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why couldn't he give up this like he gives up everything else?
98668,380,45,299000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I know -- I'll use that white-noise machine I got you when your father died.
98669,380,46,305000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Transport yourself to the shores of Nova Scotia, where cod and halibut frolic in--"
98670,380,47,312000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He's just drumming louder!
98671,380,48,315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So it's a noise war he wants, huh? Then I'll throw in some rush-hour traffic!"
98672,380,49,322000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And a circus fire!
98673,380,50,327000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sleep tight, my angel!"

98682,380,59,365000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Just make it happen!
98683,380,60,367000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boy, get dressed. You're going to a jazz brunch, as punishment for all the racket you're making!"
98684,380,61,374000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought you wanted me to drum!
98685,380,62,375000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm sending you mixed messages! Now get the Hell outta here!

98693,380,70,417000,Bart Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,Woo hoo! I'm a professional musician!
98694,380,71,438000,Lisa Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Not bad for a newbie, Bart! You just may be the second-best player up here. In case you're wondering who the best one is, it's me."
98695,380,72,449000,Database,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Crazy man, crazy. Oh, yeah!"
148716,380,73,461000,Lisa's Thoughts,Jazzy Goodtime's,"They're looking at me! All right, Lisa -- time to show these jazz legends how we swing in the suburbs."

98697,380,75,479000,Skinny,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Excuse me, are you Lisa Simpson?"
98698,380,76,483000,Lisa Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Yes, I am."

98706,380,84,499000,Lisa Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,Yes!
98707,380,85,501000,Marbles,Jazzy Goodtime's,...of sitting in -- that chair in the audience. We wanna jam with your brother!
98708,380,86,539000,Marge Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,Look! Bart's onstage... and he's contributing to the entertainment!
98710,380,87,549000,Bart Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,I was jamming with Skinny Turner and Marbles Le Marquez! And they want me to join their trio!
98711,380,88,554000,Homer Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Woo hoo! What's next? A contract with Groove-tone Records? Take the G-train, baby. Groove-tone!"
98712,380,89,562000,Lisa Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Oh, I can't believe..."
98713,380,90,565000,Marge Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Lisa, why aren't you smiling with us?"
98714,380,91,568000,Lisa Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,'Cause I've wanted to jam with jazz musicians all my life! How would Bart like it if I just hopped on his skateboard and instantly became great?
98716,380,93,586000,Lisa Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,Mild-mild-mild-mild-mild!
98717,380,94,593000,Bart Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Lisa, you've got to be more careful! I need you to teach me all about the world of juzz."
98718,380,95,598000,Lisa Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,It's jazz! Jazz! You don't even know the name of the thing you are stealing from me!
98719,380,96,606000,Skinny,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Bart, you're so steady on those skins, we're gonna call you Tic Tock!"
98720,380,97,606000,Lisa Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,I always wanted a jazz nickname!
98721,380,98,613000,Marbles,Jazzy Goodtime's,Fine. We'll call you uh... Downbeat. 'Cause you're bringin' us doooooown.
98722,380,99,617000,Lisa Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,That is the most unfair...
98723,380,100,621000,Marbles,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Downbeat, downbeat, please. We're shootin' the breeze with Tic Tock."
98724,380,101,624000,Bart Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Man, I am so juzzed."
98726,380,103,632000,Gil Gunderson,Springfield Street,"Bart, a rising star like you needs a manager, and Gil's your guy! Oh, I'm a jazz daddy from way back...with the skit-skat skittily boom-de-boom, and the ding-dong daddy... is that jazz? That's jazz, right? Cha-cha-cha with the curly fries!"
98727,380,104,652000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Oh, son. I like you more, now that other people like you."
98728,380,105,657000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"It's mergatronic, Daddy-Ho."
98729,380,106,660000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,"Bart, does that even mean anything?"
98730,380,107,662000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Xavier Cugat!
98731,380,108,671000,Cletus Spuckler,Springfield Street,"Bossie, the music business would chew you up and spit you out. You just keep your eyes on the prize, girl."
98733,380,110,681000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,"Mom, I'm gonna lose it! Bart's on the cover of both local jazz magazines: ""Blowin'"" and ""The Sugar Sheet""."
98734,380,111,688000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,Here's the only thing I've been on the cover of.
98737,380,113,696000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Look... uh... how 'bout we go to the pound, and get a puppy just for you?"
98738,380,114,703000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,That might work.
98740,380,116,707000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Animal Shelter,"Aww, they're all so cute."
98741,380,117,709000,Employee,Springfield Animal Shelter,You know what's even cuter? Picking one without talking to me.
98742,380,118,712000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Animal Shelter,"Well, I kind of like this guy..."
98744,380,120,720000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Animal Shelter,"Ooh, but this one is precious!"
98745,380,121,730000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Animal Shelter,"Okay, this little guy's coming home with me! Who's gonna get neutered tomorrow? You are! Oh, yes you are."
98747,380,123,744000,Mutt,Simpson Home,Lisa Simpson... you doomed me!
98748,380,124,747000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I did? How?
98749,380,125,749000,Mutt,Simpson Home,"By choosing the cuter puppy! You picked looks over personality, youth over experience, no history of rabies over unknown rabies status! And now I'm going to die!"
98750,380,126,759000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I never wanted that to happen!
98751,380,127,761000,Mutt,Simpson Home,You suuuuuck! You suuuuuck!
98752,380,128,767000,Mutt,Simpson Home,"Thanks, sweetie. You suuuuuck!"
98754,380,130,771000,Employee,Springfield Animal Shelter,"Well, if you want him, you can have him."
98755,380,131,775000,Employee,Springfield Animal Shelter,And if you get tired of him...
98756,380,132,777000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Animal Shelter,I won't get tired of him!
98757,380,133,778000,Employee,Springfield Animal Shelter,It's just too bad you can't take ol' Smiley here. He'll be in God's dumpster tomorrow.
98759,380,135,786000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Animal Shelter,I'll take him too!
98760,380,136,788000,Employee,Springfield Animal Shelter,And I'm gonna put ol' Henry here to sleep because he knows my darkest secret: I like putting animals to sleep.
98761,380,137,796000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Animal Shelter,I'll take him too.
98764,380,140,851000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, guys. No one knows you're here, so be quiet. And if you get hungry, there are rats living in the Christmas decorations."
98765,380,141,867000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And then today at lunch Lenny and I went to the park and rented a rowboat. Carl sketched us from the bank. Summer days.
98766,380,142,878000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What are those noises? They sounded zoological!
98768,380,143,885000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Shut up! I just said ""shut up."" I'll punish myself by going upstairs."
98769,380,144,894000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! What are you doing here?
98770,380,145,896000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Not smoking reefer!
98771,380,146,898000,Marbles,Simpson Home,That's right. We all not smoking reefer.
98772,380,147,907000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Buttercup! No!"
98773,380,148,909000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,My arm! It hurts where the tiger's biting it!
98775,380,150,920000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Bart, that was a nasty bite you got. You'll recover... but you'll never drum again."
98776,380,151,925000,Bart Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Says you!
98777,380,152,928000,Bart Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"I was a great drummer, and now I'm nothing! Just like Phil Collins."
98778,380,153,934000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,I feel so terrible. I just wanted to save those animals while Bart became a drummer... but I never thought the two stories would intersect.
98779,380,154,943000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,And what about my new job as a Mexican wrestler?
98780,380,155,946000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Beware of el Taco Belly!
98781,380,156,951000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,No mas! No mas!
98783,380,158,960000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,"Uh yes, I would like a bird because I'm often lonely in the lab. Birds help."
98784,380,159,968000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"See, Lisa. We're making progress."
98785,380,160,971000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Drop the marsupial!
98786,380,161,973000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"If those animals aren't gone by midnight tomorrow, Animal Control is gonna round 'em all up."
98787,380,162,979000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,And kill 'em.
98788,380,163,986000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Can I uh... can I borrow that ostrich?
98789,380,164,988000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Sure.
98790,380,165,993000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,How cool is this?
98791,380,166,996000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess that's it. These animals are all gonna die.
98792,380,167,1001000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not if I can help it, Lisa!"
98793,380,168,1003000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Do you have an idea?
98794,380,169,1004000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, no. sorry if it sounded like I did."
98796,380,171,1012000,Bart Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Hey guys, great news -- I can drum again!"
98797,380,172,1025000,Marbles,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Sorry, Tic Tock. Your tick is on... but your tock is gone!"
98798,380,173,1028000,Bart Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Well, I've got a confession to make. This right arm... it's not mine."
98799,380,174,1034000,Skinny,Jazzy Goodtime's,Whose is it?
98583,380,175,1035000,Bart Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,I don't know.
98800,380,176,1040000,Marbles,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Tic Tock, maybe you could get yourself some of that sweet, sweet... what do you call it?"
98801,380,177,1045000,Skinny,Jazzy Goodtime's,Arthroscopic micro-surgery to reattach the ulnar nerve?
98802,380,178,1049000,Marbles,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Yeah, that's the jingle."
98803,380,179,1050000,Bart Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,The doctor did say surgery might help... but it costs seventy-eight thousand dollars!
98804,380,180,1055000,Marbles,Jazzy Goodtime's,Well I bet we could raise it with a benefit concert. Huh? Huh?
98805,380,181,1059000,Skinny,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Outta sight! / In the pocket! / Groovay, groovay!"
98806,380,182,1062000,Waitress,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Now, you boys know you don't have the follow-through to put something like that together."
98807,380,183,1066000,Marbles,Jazzy Goodtime's,Somethin' like what together?
98808,380,184,1067000,Bart Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,The benefit concert!
98809,380,185,1068000,Skinny,Jazzy Goodtime's,Benefit concert!?
98810,380,186,1070000,Skinny,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Outta sight! / In the pocket! / Groovay, groovay!"
98812,380,188,1076000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,This benefit concert is gonna be Scooby Dooby.
98813,380,189,1080000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm very happy for you, Bart."
98814,380,190,1084000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why are you sad? Thinking about your marriage?
98815,380,191,1086000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"If we can't find a home for those animals, they'll be put to sleep. Your sister's very upset."
98816,380,192,1093000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I feel weird. It's like a potato chip full of shame, going down my throat sideways."
98817,380,193,1099000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, what you're feeling is called ""empathy."""
98818,380,194,1099000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Now I'm gonna learn a new word.
98819,380,195,1104000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Empathy means you're looking at Lisa, and feeling what she feels. Your sister poured her heart into rescuing those animals to forget the pain of being upstaged in jazz. And now..."
98820,380,196,1121000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,How can I end this torture?!
98821,380,197,1122000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You could do something nice for Lisa.
98822,380,198,1126000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're my mother! How can you say that?
98824,380,200,1149000,Krusty the Clown,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Hey, hey! We got more Jazz superstars on the way, folks!"

98833,380,203,1185000,Krusty the Clown,Jazzy Goodtime's,"Oh, right, the nerve damage. Here's the benefit money -- now I'm gonna go vomit to keep my weight down. That's right, that's how Krusty does it."
98834,380,204,1198000,Bart Simpson,Jazzy Goodtime's,"I wanna thank everyone for this special night. Jazz folk may have the smallest apartments, but they also have the biggest hearts."
