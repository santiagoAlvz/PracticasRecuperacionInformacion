93230,360,2,6000,Selma Bouvier,Spinster City Apartments,"Patty, is it you or me who likes grape jelly?"
93231,360,3,84000,Patty Bouvier,Spinster City Apartments,"For thirty-five cents off, I love it!"
93232,360,4,145000,Bart Simpson,Spinster City Apartments,"Hey Lis, I bet I could jump in the swimming pool from here."
93233,360,5,149000,Lisa Simpson,Spinster City Apartments,"Bart, that would be the stupidest thing you ever did."
93234,360,6,151000,Bart Simpson,Spinster City Apartments,"No, the stupidest thing would be doing it backwards."
93235,360,7,156000,Bart Simpson,Spinster City Apartments,Cowa--
93236,360,8,156000,Lisa Simpson,Spinster City Apartments,"Uh, Mom? Remember how you wished we would never grow up?"
93239,360,11,168000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,"I'm afraid your son is in a deep, deep coma from which he will never emerge."
93240,360,12,173000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,I guess we should count our blessings he's not dead.
93241,360,13,176000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,Don't I know it. This way I get to keep billing you.
93242,360,14,180000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,"Bart, wake up. I got that bike you wanted!"
93244,360,16,191000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,"Now, Marge, if you miss your boy that much, you could replace him with one of these."
93245,360,17,197000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,A robot?
93246,360,18,198000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,"Wow. A robot kid would be a blast. We can confuse him and make his head explode. ""This statement is a lie. But if it's a lie then it must be true. But if it's true, then it must be..."" Kaboom!"
93247,360,19,212000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,And a robot would take your mind off your dead son.
93248,360,20,214000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,I thought he was in a coma!
93249,360,21,217000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,They're pretty much the same thing... except this way I get to keep billing you.
93250,360,22,220000,Marge Simpson,Hospital Room,You already said that!
93251,360,23,221000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,"Well, you didn't laugh the first time."
93254,360,26,228000,Technician,Simpson Living Room,"Okay, your robot son is good to go. You want me to boot him up?"
93255,360,27,233000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Okay.
93256,360,28,235000,David,Simpson Living Room,"Ow! Mom, that hurt!"
93257,360,29,238000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, he knows how to push all my buttons."
93258,360,30,241000,Technician,Simpson Living Room,And here's how to push his.
93260,360,31,244000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Now, I'm a man who likes to strangle his kids. Do you think I could..."
93261,360,32,247000,Technician,Simpson Living Room,Sure. Let him have it.
93262,360,33,248000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Why you metal...!
93264,360,35,252000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Wow, the windpipe is incredibly responsive!"
93265,360,36,259000,Technician,Simpson Living Room,Yeah. That's the oh-sixes for ya.
93267,360,38,262000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,David is so helpful...
93268,360,39,264000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,And he's great with the neighbors.
93269,360,40,266000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Backyard,"Hi-diddly-ho! There's ""no bot"" like a robot!"
93270,360,41,270000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Backyard,Ow! My Flander-doodles!
93271,360,42,273000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Having a robot brother troubles me. The ethical implications are really tensing me up.
93272,360,43,281000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Goodbye, implications..."
93274,360,45,289000,Bart Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,--bunga! What the?
93277,360,48,299000,David,Simpson Home,"More waffles, Father?"
93278,360,49,300000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nice and hot-o, Mr. Robot-o!"
93279,360,50,304000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"David, you're by far the best son I've ever had. Uh-oh."
93280,360,51,308000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Did you replace me with this tinkertoy?
93281,360,52,311000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Replace is such an ugly word. We upgraded.
93282,360,53,314000,David,Simpson Home,"Bart, we can be friends."
93283,360,54,316000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Eat my shorts.
93284,360,55,318000,David,Simpson Home,I will comply.
93285,360,56,328000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here, make me a kitty!"
93288,360,59,378000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Zoo,I hate going to the zoo. I feel so sorry for the animals.
93289,360,60,381000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Zoo,"Lisa, the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals. In the wild they would never experience boredom, obesity, loss of purpose... you know, the American dream."
148676,360,61,393000,Bart's Thoughts,Springfield Zoo,Time to get rid of the competition.
93290,360,62,404000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Zoo,Thank God I landed in a bunch of fruity birds.
93291,360,63,414000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Zoo,This is where stem cell research led us!
93292,360,64,416000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Zoo,David and Bart just aren't working out. We have to do something.
93294,360,66,423000,Homer Simpson,Road,"I'm really sorry, but our family just can't handle both of you boys. I hope that somewhere deep in your data banks, you process fond memories of us."
93296,360,68,431000,Homer Simpson,Car,"The sad part is, there were times when I actually had feelings for you. I almost felt I was your father."
93297,360,69,437000,Bart Simpson,Car,What are you talking about?
93298,360,70,439000,Homer Simpson,Car,"David feels, and your mother will agree when I tell her, that it's best for our family if you're no longer in it."
93299,360,71,449000,Bart Simpson,Car,"We're still going to the toy store, right? And I can pick out as many toys as I want?"
93300,360,72,453000,Homer Simpson,Car,No toys!
93302,360,74,460000,Bart Simpson,Wooded Area,There should be a law against abandoning your child...
93303,360,75,463000,Old Robot,Wooded Area,Don't fear us. We're gentle robots who were cast off just like you.
93304,360,76,467000,Bart Simpson,Wooded Area,"I'm not a robot, I'm human."
93305,360,77,470000,Old Robot,Wooded Area,"Tell me, young man. What is it like to have... feelings?"
93306,360,78,473000,Bart Simpson,Wooded Area,"I said I'm a human, not a girl."
93308,360,80,482000,Old Robot,FOREST CLEARING,"Uh, I think it's about time we all powered down for the night."
93309,360,81,490000,Bart Simpson,FOREST CLEARING,Can I stay with you guys tonight?
93310,360,82,491000,Old Robot,FOREST CLEARING,"Of course. And maybe someday, you will teach us... to love."
93311,360,83,495000,Bart Simpson,FOREST CLEARING,"Yeah, maybe. What did you used to do?"
93312,360,84,497000,Old Robot,FOREST CLEARING,I was a lawnmower. I could cut grass at three different heights... but I could not love.
93313,360,85,502000,Bart Simpson,FOREST CLEARING,"I get it, I get it! Sucks to be you. Goodnight."
93314,360,86,504000,Old Robot,FOREST CLEARING,Good night.
93315,360,87,510000,Old Robot,FOREST CLEARING,What the F-prompt?
93316,360,88,514000,Old Robot,FOREST CLEARING,Our parts are gone! We've been harvested!
93317,360,89,516000,Female Robot,FOREST CLEARING,My servos are gone. That boy screwed us over!
93318,360,90,520000,Robot,FOREST CLEARING,He peed on me!
93319,360,91,521000,Old Robot,FOREST CLEARING,You are a urinal-bot.
93320,360,92,523000,Robot,FOREST CLEARING,Lava-tron.
93322,360,94,529000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Heyyy, it's Bart! Super!"
93324,360,96,535000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm ho-me!
93325,360,97,537000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You told me he was at culinary school!
93326,360,98,539000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You wanted to believe the lie!
93259,360,99,541000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Time to destroy the one who did this to me.
93327,360,100,546000,David,Simpson Home,"To get me, you'll have to go through your fa..."
93328,360,101,550000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Those were my good pants.
93329,360,102,554000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, the important thing is we're a family again."
93330,360,103,558000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This stinks! I've got stubby little robot legs and an ass that's not equipped for an adult diet.
93331,360,104,566000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad! Dad! Wake up! You're not a robot!
93332,360,105,570000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You're just possessed by the Devil.
93333,360,106,572000,Silver-haired Priest,Simpson Home,The power of Christ compels thee!
93336,360,109,579000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll call work and tell them he can't make it.
93337,360,110,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo!
93338,360,111,584000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Suckers.
93341,360,114,603000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Dear Homer Simpson -- Mr. Burns invites you to a hunting party at his private estate."" Parenthesis, sinister laugh, closed parenthesis."
93342,360,115,612000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Please don't accept this invitation, Dad. Hunting is cruel."
93343,360,116,616000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, animals don't feel death. That was proved by the scientists at Black Angus."
93344,360,117,622000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No fair! Dad gets to kill wild animals, but I shoot one bird and I have to go to a psychiatrist."
93345,360,118,629000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He still thinks that hobo was a bird.
93348,360,121,635000,Carl Carlson,Burns Dining Room,"This is a pretty sweet deal, Burns invitin' us over. What kind of motive do you think he has?"
93349,360,122,640000,Lenny Leonard,Burns Dining Room,Ulterior.
93350,360,123,643000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Dining Room,"Welcome, all! Now to explain why I summoned you here."
93351,360,124,647000,Moe Szyslak,Burns Dining Room,"Oh God, here it comes -- time-share pitch. Well I got bad credit, so the joke's on you!"
93352,360,125,655000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Dining Room,You're here to participate in a hunt for the world's most dangerous game.
93353,360,126,660000,Barney Gumble,Burns Dining Room,"""The most dangerous game?"" What could it be?"
93354,360,127,667000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Dining Room,The game I am hunting... is all of you.
93355,360,128,672000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Dining Room,"Now, because I am too kind, I will give you all a five-minute head start. You may commence running."
93356,360,129,677000,Comic Book Guy,Burns Dining Room,Five minutes of running? Shoot me now.
93357,360,130,681000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Dining Room,"Well, that broke the ice. Now, any man who lives till noon tomorrow shall win his freedom."
93358,360,131,687000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Burns Dining Room,Excuse me. What gives you the legal right to do this?
93359,360,132,689000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Dining Room,"You tell me, you're my lawyer."
93360,360,133,691000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Burns Dining Room,"Well, I guess you are zoned for hunting... and you have previously claimed killing people is part of your religion... I think I can draw something up..."
93361,360,134,702000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Burns Dining Room,There. This should hold up in just about any courtroom.
93362,360,135,705000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Dining Room,Excellent.
93364,360,137,711000,C. Montgomery Burns,BURNS ESTATE,The game is afoot! I smell fear... mixed with curry!
93365,360,138,718000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,BURNS ESTATE,Uh-oh.
93366,360,139,721000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,BURNS ESTATE,You got me... but I shall be reincarnated!
93367,360,140,725000,Bunny,BURNS ESTATE,"Ha, ha! You can't kill a Hindu!"
93368,360,141,729000,Bunny,BURNS ESTATE,Help me Jesus!
93370,360,143,734000,TV Announcer,Simpson Home,"You're watching ""The World Series of Manslaughter,"" the most violent television spectacle since the Hip Hop Image Awards."
93371,360,144,741000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, Mr. Burns is gonna kill Dad!"
93372,360,145,744000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I should've known something was wrong when we got this week's TV Guide.
93373,360,146,750000,TV Announcer,Simpson Home,"Now for his take on tonight's bloodthirsty action, here's guest analyst Terry Bradshaw. Terry?"
93374,360,147,756000,Terry Bradshaw,Simpson Home,"Well, conventional wisdom says good fleeing will always beat good chasing. But the stats say put your money on the guy with the gun."
93375,360,148,760000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Dying is just like golfing. Except in golf...
93376,360,149,772000,Terry Bradshaw,Simpson Home,"Oh, you hate to see that. That's the kind of showboating that'll turn people off this sport."
93378,360,151,782000,Moe Szyslak,Forest,"Hey, hey, Homer!"
93379,360,152,783000,Moe Szyslak,Forest,"Burns is coming, climb up!"
93380,360,153,788000,Moe Szyslak,Forest,Ya fat ass.
93381,360,154,794000,Moe Szyslak,Forest,"Nyah, nyah, ya missed me."
93382,360,155,798000,Moe Szyslak,Forest,"Well, before I die, I'll just scratch that lottery ticket I got in my pocket."
93383,360,156,803000,Moe Szyslak,Forest,"Instant Jackpot, one million dollars. If I make it out alive, I could..."
93386,360,158,812000,Carl Carlson,SECLUDED MOUNTAIN CLEARING,"Homer, Burns has only been chasing us for six hours, and you've already resorted to cannibalism."
93387,360,159,819000,Lenny Leonard,SECLUDED MOUNTAIN CLEARING,And there's bananas in that tree up there.
93388,360,160,821000,Homer Simpson,SECLUDED MOUNTAIN CLEARING,They look a little green.
93389,360,161,829000,Lenny Leonard,SECLUDED MOUNTAIN CLEARING,"Carl, I see Heaven!"
93390,360,162,832000,Carl Carlson,SECLUDED MOUNTAIN CLEARING,What does it look like?
93391,360,163,833000,Lenny Leonard,SECLUDED MOUNTAIN CLEARING,Uh...
93392,360,164,834000,Angels,SECLUDED MOUNTAIN CLEARING,"Hurry up, Lenny. We'll be late for work at the plant."
93394,360,166,843000,C. Montgomery Burns,Wooded Area,"You can't escape me, Simpson -- you're not smart enough!"
93395,360,167,846000,Homer Simpson,Wooded Area,Yes I am! I mean...
93396,360,168,854000,Homer Simpson,Wooded Area,Oh no! I've been killed!
93397,360,169,860000,Homer Simpson,Wooded Area,Outfoxed 'im with the corpse of my best friend. Hee-hee.
93398,360,170,868000,C. Montgomery Burns,Wooded Area,"Is there room in the head bag, Smithers?"
93399,360,171,872000,Waylon Smithers,Wooded Area,I can make room.
93400,360,172,874000,C. Montgomery Burns,Wooded Area,Excellent.
93401,360,173,882000,Marge Simpson,Wooded Area,Done and done!
93402,360,174,883000,Homer Simpson,Wooded Area,Marge! You saved me.
93403,360,175,887000,Homer Simpson,Wooded Area,What was that for?
93404,360,176,888000,Marge Simpson,Wooded Area,Staying out eighteen hours and not calling home once.
93405,360,177,892000,Homer Simpson,Wooded Area,"Aw, I can't stay mad at you when that pan smells like sausage and onions."
93406,360,178,897000,Marge Simpson,Wooded Area,And I am glad you're okay.
93407,360,179,905000,TV Announcer,Wooded Area,"All right and there you have it! Terry Bradshaw, your thoughts on what just transpired?"
93408,360,180,910000,Terry Bradshaw,Wooded Area,"Well, it's a disgrace, Roger. This network will show a dozen gruesome murders, but I bet they cut to commercial before these two begin the tender act of love."
93409,360,181,921000,Terry Bradshaw,Wooded Area,"I spoke too soon, huh? There they go!"
93410,360,182,924000,Terry Bradshaw,Wooded Area,"Whoa, that's goin' in my playbook!"
93412,360,184,940000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"Ooh, everyone's wearing such an interesting costume."
93413,360,185,944000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"Look! Grampa's a gorilla, Sideshow Mel is Spiderman, and Nelson's a raccoon..."
93414,360,186,950000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,"I'm not a raccoon, I'm the Lone Ranger! I'm too poor to afford the hat."
93415,360,187,954000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,That's not even a mask. It's axle grease!
93416,360,188,957000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,"Don't listen to him, Silver!"
93418,360,189,961000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield,"And now the finalists for Best Costume. First, we have Blackula..."
93419,360,190,965000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield,"Oh, because I'm black and I'm Dracula, that makes me Blackula! My wife said don't go as Dracula, but I said Bernice, we live in the twenty-first century..."
93420,360,191,970000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield,Send him the standard racist-remark apology. They're in the middle drawer. Our other finalist is this hideous witch.
93422,360,193,988000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield,Congratulations. You have won this twenty-five dollar Kwik-E-Mart certificate.
93423,360,194,993000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Springfield,"Sucker. Twenty-five bucks won't buy you a half a Balance Bar. I exaggerate, but really, my prices are very high."
93424,360,195,1000000,Witch,Springfield,Thank you.
93425,360,196,1001000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield,"Wait! Before you leave, we'd all like to know which of our beloved regulars you are, under that costume. Lindsay Naegle? Helen Lovejoy? Old Jewish Man?"
93426,360,197,1010000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield,"No, I'm right here -- dressed as my brother Irving! Every day I miss him."
93427,360,198,1018000,Witch,Springfield,"This is a little awkward, because... I'm not wearing a costume. I'm a real witch."
93429,360,200,1025000,Carl Carlson,Springfield,"Wait a minute, that's cheating!"
93430,360,201,1027000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield,Burn her... gift certificate!
93431,360,202,1030000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield,"Since you are not technically in costume, you cannot win this award."
93432,360,203,1034000,Witch,Springfield,"Rescind my award, will you?! You're all gonna pay!"
93433,360,204,1041000,Witch,Springfield,"Taint of newt and scum of pond, thou shalt become the guise thou donned!"
93435,360,206,1046000,Carl Carlson,Springfield,"Speak English, moron!"
93436,360,207,1049000,Witch,Springfield,I'm turning you into your costumes!
93437,360,208,1052000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Well, are you gonna talk about it, or are you gonna do it?"
93438,360,209,1071000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield,"I'm not a raccoon, I'm the Lone Ranger!"
93439,360,210,1076000,Disco Stu,Springfield,Disco Stu wishes he'd gone as Marilyn McCoo.
93440,360,211,1084000,Witch,Springfield,Good luck getting your deposits back on those costumes!
93442,360,213,1090000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield,Seymour! I told you not to go as G.I. Joe!
93443,360,214,1093000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield,"Mother, I'm fine. I..."
93444,360,215,1094000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield,Uh-oh.
93445,360,216,1097000,Hans Moleman,Springfield,"Oh, this isn't fair. I wasn't wearing a costume."
93385,360,217,1102000,Grampa Gorilla,Springfield,"Look at me! I'm a young, strappin' gorilla!"
93447,360,218,1107000,Grampa Gorilla,Springfield,My hip! It's shattered! Somebody help me!
