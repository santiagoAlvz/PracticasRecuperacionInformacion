139726,537,34,218000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ice cream sandwiches. Why?
139727,537,35,221000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What your mother is trying to say is we don't think you can be good that long.
139728,537,36,225000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, is that true?"
139729,537,37,227000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that's sort of what I was trying to say. But..."

139731,537,39,233000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, you're wrong! You're all wrong!"
139732,537,40,237000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't say anything.

139741,537,50,260000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, sweetie, this is an opportunity for you to turn things around, yet again. And I believe in you. Yet again."
139742,537,51,268000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, Mom. I'll start by taking my plate to the dishwasher...wherever that is."
139743,537,52,275000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I love Bart as much as you do but actually not. And that kid cannot go one week without getting in trouble. Now if you'd be so kind as to start my car for me, I'm going to Moe's."
139745,537,54,290000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ooh! Thank you.
139746,537,55,296000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you doing?
139747,537,56,303000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"To avoid temptation, I'm getting rid of all the things that could get me in trouble at school. I buried all my whoopee cushions in the back yard."
139749,537,58,316000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,What the?
139750,537,59,318000,Bart Simpson,Backyard,That's not where I buried them.

139755,537,64,332000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NEIGHBORHOOD,"Krusty, are you broke?"
139756,537,65,337000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD NEIGHBORHOOD,"Yeah. All it takes is some bad luck at the ponies, worse luck in the bitcoin market, heavy investment in a high-end bookmark company..."
139757,537,66,345000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NEIGHBORHOOD,"You could do what ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" did."
139758,537,67,347000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD NEIGHBORHOOD,"Go off the air while I'm still good? That horse has left the stable, gone to the glue factory, and has been used to make art projects."
139759,537,68,355000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NEIGHBORHOOD,I mean you could sell foreign rights to your show. Even SpongeBob did it.

139766,537,74,386000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NEIGHBORHOOD,"What I'm saying is, you could produce foreign versions of your TV show with actors from other countries..."
139767,537,75,392000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD NEIGHBORHOOD,"Okay, I'll do it!"
139768,537,76,394000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD NEIGHBORHOOD,Not my Shetland dolphin! Although I won't miss the constant yapping.
139769,537,77,399000,Dolphin,SPRINGFIELD NEIGHBORHOOD,Pa-pa!
139770,537,78,401000,Repo Man,SPRINGFIELD NEIGHBORHOOD,"Not anymore, he ain't."

139782,537,90,446000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,"Not bad, Simpson. Did you wash your knees?"
139783,537,91,449000,Bart Simpson,CAFETERIA,"Front and back, sir."

139797,537,106,528000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I've broken a ten-year-old's spirit. Time to celebrate... with a fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt.

139818,537,127,615000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Now there're many words for what I'm looking for... rubles, renminbi, baht... but they all mean money, which rhymes with funny, which you can be if you want. I don't care. Just do the Krusty show in your country and send me ten percent. Then send me another sixty percent. Then five percent more and you're good."
139822,537,129,640000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Nice job, Simpson. You even got my Suze Orman tape unstuck from the cassette player. She's the reason I was able to purchase a new watch band."
139823,537,130,647000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Always braggin' about his fancy watchband. If only I could tell time.
139824,537,131,653000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, I washed your car like you asked, I did your paper route, and I'm sorry. I really am. This could be the turning point of my life. Where you, as a school guy, made a difference. What do you think? Can I go on that sub?"

139843,537,150,755000,Krusty the Clown,Cartoon Beach,"And it's all thanks to you, kid. To show my appreciation I'm gonna bring you with me next time I entertain the troops. Warning, they're not American troops."
139845,537,152,773000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD DOCK,"Hello, boy. At times like this there's not much you can say... especially if you don't know what happened..."

139850,537,159,794000,Captain,SUBMARINE,It was just imaginary.
139851,537,160,796000,Bart Simpson,SUBMARINE,"I know a kid should never turn to his father for help, but I got screwed. Is there anything you can do?"
139852,537,161,805000,Homer Simpson,SUBMARINE,"As I always say, don't get mad, get dinner. Then get even. With Skinner."
139853,537,162,811000,Bart Simpson,SUBMARINE,You'll really help me get revenge?
139854,537,163,814000,Homer Simpson,SUBMARINE,Yes. What's Skinner's weakness?
139855,537,164,817000,Bart Simpson,SUBMARINE,Everything.

139867,537,176,877000,Bart Simpson,Skinner Home,I did everything for you and you stabbed me in the back.
139868,537,177,880000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,"Wait a minute... I knew you were a neat freak, Skinner. But you beat your rug till it bleeds?"
139869,537,178,889000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"All right, I'll come clean. I woke up and, surprisingly, mother wasn't there beside me. She was dead."
139870,537,179,898000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"Still, I can't be sure I killed her."
139871,537,180,901000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,"Well, I'm sure our town's police force will handle this competently."
139872,537,181,910000,Chief Wiggum,Skinner Home,"Now I could investigate further, but you don't want to sit in jail all weekend."
139873,537,182,915000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Skinner Home,"Chief, that was awfully arbitrary."
139874,537,183,918000,Chief Wiggum,Skinner Home,Not compared to this.
139875,537,184,924000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,Let me handle things. Just go upstairs and shut the door. There are some things only a boy should see.

139887,537,195,974000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,Well if you change your mind it'll be in my freezer. But only for a week. Got a lot of ice cream comin' in.

139889,537,197,982000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,"Now, I'm afraid it's time to start your new life. You'll be hunted... on the run... searching for the man who killed your mother, which is you. So avoid mirrors."
139892,537,200,996000,Ron Rabinowitz,RON RABINOWITZ'S OFFICE,Krusty... I have some very bad news. The foreign Krustys are all hotter than you. Irish Krusty's got a show on Broadway.

139894,537,202,1006000,Somber Irish Krusty,RON RABINOWITZ'S OFFICE,There never was a monkey! I was just tellin' stories to forget me consumption.
