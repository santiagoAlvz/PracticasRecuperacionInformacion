123323,475,187,917000,Moe Szyslak,MO'S TAVERN,Well who needs 'em? We can have your own parade.
123324,475,188,919000,Julio,MO'S TAVERN,We do. We have like twenty of them.
123325,475,189,922000,Grady,MO'S TAVERN,But we're sick of being second-class citizens! Things will never change until one of us is on the town council.
123326,475,190,928000,Grizzly Shawn,MO'S TAVERN,Moe should run! He's the heart of this town's gay community.
123327,475,191,934000,Grady,MO'S TAVERN,"Will you do it, Moe? Will you become Springfield's first openly-gay City Councilman?"
123328,475,192,939000,Moe Szyslak,MO'S TAVERN,"Well, I think if you guys can manage to go into the voting booth one at a time, then I can manage to win!"
123330,475,194,947000,Waylon Smithers,MO'S TAVERN,"Moe, can I discuss an inventory issue with you in the back room?"
123333,475,197,954000,Waylon Smithers,Back Room of Moe's,You can't be these people's leader if you're lying to them about who you are. You're not gay!
123334,475,198,960000,Moe Szyslak,Back Room of Moe's,"Whew! I thought it was an inventory issue. That's a big relief. Now don't worry, I'll let 'em down easy. In four years!"
123335,475,199,970000,Moe Szyslak,Back Room of Moe's,Yes! Your queen is back!
123337,475,201,977000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I'M WALKING ON SUNSHINE / NOT LITERALLY / IT MEANS THAT I'M HAPPY / POST-COITALLY / IT WAS ON A SCHOOL NIGHT!
123338,475,202,985000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Skin-ner! That song needed no lyrical improvement.
123339,475,203,989000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Gary... Gary, you know what you need?"
123340,475,204,993000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,A little... honey in your yogurt.
123341,475,205,995000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Skin-ner! You're a regular Casanova. Or in English, ""new house."""
123342,475,206,998000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Come on, come to life! I swear I'll be cool about it."
123343,475,207,1005000,Melody,Springfield Elementary School,Can I do a handstand against you?
123344,475,208,1007000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Sure.
123345,475,209,1011000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Melody, you're a great girl, but... I see you as more of a sister... and I don't like my sister."
123346,475,210,1018000,Melody,Springfield Elementary School,You're breaking up with me... upside down?!
123347,475,211,1022000,Melody,Springfield Elementary School,Raggedy Ann was so right about you!
123349,475,213,1027000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Thanks to you, Melody's mother is so upset, she's moving them out of town!"
123350,475,214,1031000,Ms. Juniper,Skinner's Office,"Goodbye, Seymour. Think of me whenever you see a tattoo you don't understand."
123351,475,215,1036000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Calliope, is there anything I can say to make you stay?"
123182,475,216,1039000,Ms. Juniper,Skinner's Office,No. But you can say you'll come with us.
123295,475,217,1042000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Leave with you? I'll have to check with mother.
123352,475,218,1045000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner's Office,Seymour! I found a ticket stub for a James Bond movie in your pants! Explain yourself!
123353,475,219,1051000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Well, it, it, uh... took place in a country we teach about."
123354,475,220,1054000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner's Office,Fibs break Jesus' ribs!
123355,475,221,1057000,Ms. Juniper,Skinner's Office,"Look, I don't know how long this will last. It could be a day. It could be the rest of our lives. But you'll never know unless you take this chance. Give yourself permission."
123357,475,223,1079000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Willie, you're principal now."
123358,475,224,1081000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Really? Who's the new groundskeeper?
123359,475,225,1084000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Also you, and you don't get more money."
123360,475,226,1086000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Ach.
123361,475,227,1086000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Yeah.
123363,475,229,1097000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"My name is Moe Szyslak, and I'm here to elect me!"
123365,475,231,1102000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Town Hall,"Hello, Moe."
123366,475,232,1103000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"Hey there, well... it's my business partner, Mr. Smithers. Nice of you to drop by and not say nothin' that costs nobody no election."
123367,475,233,1112000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Town Hall,"But Moe, how can you be their leader when you're not one of them?"
123369,475,235,1118000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"I am one of them! Hey, I only read Hustler to see the picture of Larry Flynt."
123370,475,236,1122000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Town Hall,"Sounds great. But first, answer me this: do you find me attractive?"
123371,475,237,1126000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"Oh yeah, yeah. Like all gays, I'm attracted to all men."
123372,475,238,1131000,Comic Book Gay,Springfield Town Hall,Most. Insidious. Stereotype. Ever.
123373,475,239,1134000,Julio,Springfield Town Hall,You're cute. You want to go out later?
123374,475,240,1137000,Comic Book Gay,Springfield Town Hall,"Whoever said that, yes."
123375,475,241,1139000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Town Hall,"All right, if you're attracted to me... then kiss me, Moe."
123376,475,242,1145000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"Okay, okay, uh... prepare to be kissed... here we go... giving in to my natural urges... okay, a few jumping jacks just to warm up..."
123377,475,243,1159000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"Okay, here comes the airplane..."
123378,475,244,1167000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"I'm sorry, everyone. Oh, this is the most embarrassing thing I ever had to say, but... I ain't gay."
123381,475,246,1175000,Grady,Springfield Town Hall,"Oh, Moe! How could you lie about who you are when who we are is all we are?"
123382,475,247,1181000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"I didn't mean to. At first, I was only gay for your money. And, and I had real, deep feelings for that money. But then I felt accepted by you in a way that I'd never been before. I just wish you people could know what it's like to want acceptance. Well, so who you gonna vote for? Me? Or a republican whose record is so anti-gay, he's clearly secretly super gay."
123383,475,248,1206000,Julio,Springfield Town Hall,"Now we don't know who to vote for, the liar or the denier!"
123384,475,249,1210000,Distinguished Older Gentleman,Springfield Town Hall,Once again the powers that be have spurned our request for basic human equality. Must not the heavens themselves cry with rage?!
123385,475,250,1222000,Julio,Springfield Town Hall,How did you do that?
123386,475,251,1224000,Distinguished Older Gentleman,Springfield Town Hall,Classical training!
123387,475,252,1230000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Town Hall,I'm very sorry. I... I had to do what I thought was right.
123388,475,253,1234000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"Well, long as I got nothin' to lose..."
123389,475,254,1239000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"Not bad. Like Frisbee golf, I'm glad I tried it once."
123391,475,256,1248000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What happened?
123392,475,257,1250000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, it could have been a day, it could have been the rest of my life."
123393,475,258,1253000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,And?
123394,475,259,1255000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,It was only a day.
123395,475,260,1257000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You've been gone for three months!
123396,475,261,1259000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Groovy.
