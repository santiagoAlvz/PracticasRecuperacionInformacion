55592,230,1,75000,Lisa Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,I still can't believe we escaped from those horrible vampires.
55593,230,2,78000,Homer Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,But it was worth it to get back our super Sugar Crisp cereal.
55594,230,3,83000,Homer Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,Can't get enough of that Sugar Crisp...
55595,230,4,86000,Marge Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,"I'm having a hard time seeing. Homer, did you remember to put the fog lights in?"
55596,230,5,91000,Homer Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...
55597,230,6,93000,Marge Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,I better pull over and play it safe.
55598,230,7,98000,Marge Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,Please be a dog.
55600,230,9,103000,Marge Simpson,Roadside,"Oh, no!"
55601,230,10,106000,Bart Simpson,Roadside,Ned Flanders!
55602,230,11,108000,Homer Simpson,Roadside,He's dead!
55603,230,12,111000,Homer Simpson,Roadside,He's definitely dead!
55604,230,13,114000,Marge Simpson,Roadside,"Oh my God, we killed Ned Flanders!"
55605,230,14,118000,Bart Simpson,Roadside,You mean you killed Ned Flanders.
55606,230,15,120000,Marge Simpson,Roadside,"Oh, it was an accident! An accident!"
55607,230,16,122000,Lisa Simpson,Roadside,We've got to go to the police.
55608,230,17,124000,Bart Simpson,Roadside,They'll never believe a Simpson killed a Flanders by accident. Even I have my doubts.
55609,230,18,129000,Homer Simpson,Roadside,"Don't worry. I've got a plan. Okay, Ned, the first thing we have to do is..."
55610,230,19,130000,Homer Simpson,Roadside,To make sure that no one knows that you're dead. And if anyone asks... you're not dead.
55612,230,21,141000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey Maude! Look who's helping me clean the chimney.
55613,230,22,148000,Maude Flanders,Simpson Home,Neddy? Where have you been?
55614,230,23,151000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hi, Maude. Diddily. I've been having fun with my pal Homer. Diddily."
55615,230,24,159000,Maude Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm so relieved. Whenever you go on one of your late night fog walks, I get so worried."
55616,230,25,166000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Relax, I'm fine. But when I do die, I don't want any autopsies."
55617,230,26,172000,Maude Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, come on down, you goofy roofy."
55618,230,27,175000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, it sure is slippery up here."
55619,230,28,178000,Maude Flanders,Simpson Home,My pies are done!
55620,230,29,181000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aww, she missed it."
55622,230,31,183000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Hey Maude, I'm home. Uh-oh. I think I'm having a heart attack."
55624,230,33,194000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,And that's the end of that chapter.
55626,230,35,206000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Try not to look too sad -- it'll seem suspicious.
55627,230,36,212000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,... And now Ned's best friend will say a few words. Homer?
55628,230,37,218000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"When I think about Ned, I can't help but remember the look on his face when Marge drove over..."
55629,230,38,224000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
55630,230,39,225000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, wait... What I'd like to say is, we're still looking for the real killers. Anyway, in conclusion, a man cannot be forced to testify against his wife."
55631,230,40,236000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Stop winking.
55632,230,41,238000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"We'll miss you, buddy."
55634,230,43,242000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, we just got away with murder. And it was so easy."
55635,230,44,246000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, I've never liked that little wiener Milhouse."
55636,230,45,251000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No more murders.
55637,230,46,253000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But you got to kill...
55638,230,47,254000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
55639,230,48,258000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Someone saw us.
55640,230,49,260000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But who?
55641,230,50,269000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer! Stop that!
55643,230,52,277000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Who could be calling at this hour?
55644,230,53,280000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Y'ello?
55645,230,54,282000,CREEPY VOICE,Simpson Home,I know you're alone.

55647,230,56,286000,CREEPY VOICE,Simpson Home,Is this Maude Flanders?
55648,230,57,288000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, it's Homer."
55649,230,58,290000,CREEPY VOICE,Simpson Home,"Oh, hey Homer, it's Moe. I must have dialed the wrong number."
55653,230,62,315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Dear God, it's Homer. If you really love me, you'll save my life now."
55655,230,64,324000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,He's getting closer!
55657,230,66,330000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Okay, Marge, you hide in the abandoned amusement park."

55660,230,69,338000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,And I'll go skinny dipping in that lake where the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago tonight.
55661,230,70,343000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Now, Flanders, I want you to..."
55663,230,72,348000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,It's impossible. I killed you.
55664,230,73,352000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Car,"You can't kill the undead, silly."
55665,230,74,355000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"He's undead, all right."
55666,230,75,356000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,Are you a zombie?
55667,230,76,357000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Car,"Oh, I wish. You see, that night when you hit me with your car..."

55670,230,79,367000,Ned Flanders,COASTAL ROAD,"Ooo, better pick up the pace."
55672,230,81,378000,Homer Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...
55673,230,82,381000,Marge Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,I better pull over and play it safe.
55675,230,84,388000,Lisa Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,So you were going to kill us.
55676,230,85,391000,Ned Flanders,COASTAL ROAD,Yeah...
55677,230,87,399000,Homer Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,"Hey, Foamy, I want the news, not the weather. Marge, did you hear me zing Werewolf Flanders?"
55681,230,91,420000,Homer Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,"Flanders, stop that."
55683,230,93,423000,Homer Simpson,COASTAL ROAD,"Eyes bigger than your stomach, eh, wolfie?"
55688,230,98,445000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"Well, well, well, if it isn't the cutest police officer in Springfield."
55689,230,99,450000,Lou,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"Hey, you know, we got feelin's too, Chief."

55693,230,103,466000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,I don't think the real Radioactive Man wears a plastic smock with a picture of himself on it.
55694,230,104,471000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Gym,He would on Halloween.

55725,230,134,576000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Bookstore,"Yes, over here. In episode BF12 you were battling barbarians while riding a wing-ed Appaloosa. Yet in the very next scene, my dear, you're clearly atop a wing-ed Arabian. Please to explain it."
55726,230,135,590000,Lucy Lawless,Bookstore,"Uhh, yeah, whenever you notice something like that, a wizard did it."

55756,230,165,750000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"You would think so, but no."
55757,230,166,751000,Lucy Lawless,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Really? Well, I mean, maybe we are meant for each other. Growing up, I was always tall for my age, and the other kids made fun of me. I... I always hoped for another misunderstood soul to share my pain and... you could be that soul, Collector."
