133471,514,2,69000,Baseball Announcer,BASEBALL STADIUM,"It's the World Series, two outs, bottom of the ninth. Yes, we're at the point where baseball becomes mildly interesting."
133472,514,3,76000,Baseball Announcer,BASEBALL STADIUM,"Can Homer Simpson, fresh off an anxiety dream about not studying for a high school test, come into this dream and knock one out of the park?"
133473,514,4,84000,Baseball Announcer,BASEBALL STADIUM,And who'da thunk it? We're food too!
133474,514,5,88000,Baseball Announcer,BASEBALL STADIUM,And apparently I'm married to a pork chop and have drumstick children. How did that happen?
133475,514,6,97000,Baseball Announcer,BASEBALL STADIUM,We're back...
133477,514,8,97000,Baseball Announcer,BASEBALL STADIUM,"The pitcher, Steroid Santa Claus...kicks and deals. It's a long fly ball! Going back! Back!"

133479,514,10,115000,Baseball Announcer,BASEBALL STADIUM,"The groundskeepers are trying to put on the tarp, but it turned into a manta ray and stung 'em all. Now we'll be right back after this word from oxygen, which Homer desperately needs to live."

133483,514,14,134000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Water's coming in the house, and we've got carpet mushrooms!"

133491,514,22,167000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"What's wrong, Homer? You've got an expression on your face I ain't never seen before. Like one of them Charlie Brown wiggle-frowns."
133492,514,23,173000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I'm in an abusive relationship with life. It keeps beating the hell out of me, and I'm too cowardly to leave it. Maybe I could drink myself to death."
133493,514,24,184000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Eh, well, you can't. Your tolerance is too high."
133494,514,25,188000,Dejected Barfly,Moe's Tavern,"Man, I've never seen Homer looking this bad."
133495,514,26,194000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,You're right. He needs some professional help...

133500,514,31,226000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Aw, come on Chief, I've had a rotten day. Can't you help me out?"
133501,514,32,231000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,"Sorry, I'm afraid the most I can do is pretend to drive you home. Okay, now hop on my imaginary motorcycle... arms around my belly..."
133502,514,33,242000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,"...um, I'm gonna need you to chip in for gas..."
133504,514,35,246000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,This is where the pretending ends.

133618,514,149,617000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie... it looks like you're putting all your eggs in one basket.
133619,514,150,621000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What would you have me do? One basket for each egg?
133620,514,151,624000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, I guess you're right. I guess I'll have to scratch that off the list of things I say."

133631,514,162,676000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Homer, you're gonna be fine. But there's no hope for the MyPad."
133632,514,163,681000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,It still had eighty-eight percent of its charge!
133633,514,164,685000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,This is the part of the job I hate most. Talking to crazy people.
133634,514,165,695000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Which of you is the YouTube of the kid high on dentist's gas? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
133635,514,166,706000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Oh Lord, when things looked darkest, you gave me light.

133642,514,172,737000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oh, I will! Till I go to bed and take 'em off under the covers! But come outside and see the miracle!"
133643,514,173,742000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Has the MyPad risen?
133644,514,174,743000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"No, it's still where you buried it."
133645,514,175,747000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Here it is. The Holy Ooze.
133646,514,176,750000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is your miracle? A tree? Ooh, look at me. I turn sunlight into complex sugars. Big whoop."
133647,514,177,757000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Look a little closer.
133648,514,178,758000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Huh. ""Hope."" Is this one of those coincidences like Jesus on a tortilla or George Washington on a dollar bill?"
133649,514,179,766000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... I like that its message is in sap and not in blood... like some miracles I could mention. Passover.
133650,514,180,773000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, this is how God would send me a message. In my back yard, hammock adjacent, in one short word in large print. What do you think he's trying to tell me, Flanders?"
133651,514,181,782000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, sir, if you ask me, somebody up there is trying to tell you that whatever flat tires you've got in your life, God's there, with His little spare, that enables you to drive real slow till you get to the next station."
133652,514,182,793000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Don't eat the miracle!
133653,514,183,795000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. I'll just go eat the body of God. That's not crazy.
133655,514,185,802000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Huh. Looks like you're really turning somethin' over in your mind there, Homer."
133656,514,186,806000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, I could believe this was a random occurrence, or I could believe some higher power reached down and squeezed the sap outta that tree. I'm choosin' hope! Moe, a bottle of your finest beer!"
133657,514,187,817000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Here you go. Duff Adequate.
133658,514,188,819000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,To hope!
133659,514,189,822000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Wow, no one's ever been happy in this place before. And when I started it was Moe's Ice Cream Carnival. Not good."
133662,514,192,829000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Of all the gifts the Lord gives us, perhaps the greatest is hope..."
133663,514,193,835000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Uh, excuse me, Reverend, but I'm here to talk about something a little more important: hope."
133664,514,194,842000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"But I was just... oh, fine. I can get an early start on mountain biking."
133666,514,195,847000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Hope is here, people, and it's real. It's not just inside the house of God, it's outside the house of me! So come and see the sticky brown truth!"
133667,514,196,866000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Hope is all around me!
133669,514,198,874000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,As promised: the miracle!

133671,514,200,883000,Brandine Del Roy,Simpson Home,Cletus! What does that tree say?
133672,514,201,885000,Cletus Spuckler,Simpson Home,"Now, now, let's spell it out like that social worker taught us."
133673,514,202,889000,Cletus Spuckler,Simpson Home,"Huckleberry, Overbite, Picklefoot, Edumacation. Oh! It says ""hope""!"
133674,514,203,895000,Brandine Del Roy,Simpson Home,"Just like in ""Hope Floats,"" that Sandra Bullock movie I wrote."
133675,514,204,902000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,This is newsman Kent Brockman vowing I will debunk this so-called miracle. The idiotic things people believe in. Now! Stay tuned for your lucky Lotto numbers! It's your turn for sure!
133678,514,207,922000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,A hundred dollar bill for anyone who will give me the truth behind this so-called miracle tree.
133679,514,208,928000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I'll take your money. The tree's a fraud.
133680,514,209,931000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"I just got a hundred! The tree is real! What you got against hope, anyway?"
133681,514,210,936000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,I bet something disillusioned you as a child.
133682,514,211,945000,7-Year-Old Brockman,Moe's Tavern,This is junior reporter Kenny Brockelstein investigating the stories that kids want to know...
