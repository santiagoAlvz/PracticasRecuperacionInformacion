110989,428,33,221000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Willie, I didn't know you were an apiarist."
110990,428,34,223000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"From context, I can tell that means ""beekeeper."" 'Tis a tragedy, Lisa -- no man should outlive his bees."

111020,428,65,333000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Flowers -- the painted whores of the plant world.
111021,428,66,337000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No bees means no honey...
111022,428,67,348000,Suburban Mother,Simpson Home,Synthetic honey. Just like you remember.

111033,428,78,392000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Field,"...in there. Close. See these red dots? This bee has been felled by bee measles -- or as I call it, ""beasles."""

111035,428,80,404000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Field,I'm going to talk to the girl from now on.
111036,428,81,404000,Homer Simpson,Field,You're the nerd.
111037,428,82,407000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Field,What we need to do now is find enough uninfected bees to start a healthy colony. This pheromone should attract them.
111038,428,83,416000,Beautiful Woman,Field,Marry me and I'll support you for life.
111039,428,84,419000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Field,You're not a bee! This thing is useless!
111041,428,86,424000,Homer Simpson,Field,There's one on Lisa!
111042,428,87,427000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Hold still, sweetie. Daddy will kill it. And this time no screw-ups."
111043,428,88,435000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Field,Stop! Stop! Stop! It's an uninfected queen!
111044,428,89,437000,Lisa Simpson,Field,How do we catch her without hurting her?
111045,428,90,440000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Field,"Unfortunately, the best method is to allow her to sting you..."
111047,428,92,444000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Field,"Yeah, much like that. Now squeeze around the stinger to keep her attached, and a colony of bees will soon form around your face."
111048,428,93,457000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Field,Now just keep them there until the colony is healthy and thriving.
111049,428,94,461000,Lisa Simpson,Field,How long is that?
111050,428,95,463000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Field,Long enough that you will be known as Springfield's crazy bee girl. -- She likes the stingers.
111053,428,98,470000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, remember when we were talking about our worst fears?"
111054,428,99,470000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-huh...
111055,428,100,474000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And mine was snakes and yours was...
111056,428,101,476000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Never being a grandmother?
111057,428,102,478000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Really? I thought it was Lisa with a beard of bees. Well whatever, brace yourself."
111058,428,103,488000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"President Lincoln! You've come back, and you got rid of that hat -- you've got my vote!"
111059,428,104,498000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, I don't like this at all."
111060,428,105,500000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's not for long. But until they find a suitable habitat, this beard is the only hope for these bees."
111061,428,106,506000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Relax, Mom. I'll mold them into a shape you know and love."
111062,428,107,513000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Stop Milhousing your sister!
111064,428,109,516000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Now take it off before they sting you!
111065,428,110,519000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, bees rarely sting when they're in a cluster. They only attack to defend their hive."
111066,428,111,524000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know. All it takes is one troubled loner.
111067,428,112,528000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Please let me keep them for just a little longer.
111068,428,113,533000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay. One night.
111071,428,116,539000,C. Montgomery Burns,Arena,"So, let's see how my burly-bottomed ball-handlers are faring. Smithers, we're leading two to nothing! Run out the clock, boys. Run out the clock..."
111072,428,117,553000,Mark Cuban,Arena,"Oh, yeah! Three points! Big three in the big D for the big C. Mark Cuban -- that's me!"
111073,428,118,559000,C. Montgomery Burns,Arena,"Who is that man, and why isn't his enthusiasm being punished?"
111074,428,119,563000,Waylon Smithers,Arena,"That's Mark Cuban, sir. He's the most flamboyant owner in the league."
111075,428,120,569000,Mark Cuban,Arena,I'm out of my mind!!!
111076,428,121,572000,C. Montgomery Burns,Arena,How odd. His money seems to have bought him happiness.
111077,428,122,580000,C. Montgomery Burns,Arena,"I'd like to meet him, Smithers!"
111079,428,124,582000,Mark Cuban,Burns's Box,"So, you made your money in Nuclear Power. I can't remember how I made my money!"
111081,428,125,586000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Box,"If you're really a billionaire, give me the secret billionaire's handshake. Smithers, turn away."
111083,428,127,611000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Box,"So tell me, why don't you recoil from the public like a normal billionaire?"
111084,428,128,615000,Mark Cuban,Burns's Box,"Hey, why own a basketball team if you're not gonna have any fun?"
111085,428,129,618000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Box,"""Fun?"" Is that how it's pronounced? I've only seen it written."
111086,428,130,622000,Mark Cuban,Burns's Box,Hold that thought... no one's paid attention to me for ten whole seconds.
111087,428,131,630000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Box,"It's time for this peacock to show his feathers. You know, the feathers with the big eye that trick them into thinking that's my front? Said feathers are what I'll flaunt!"
111089,428,133,640000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Um Mom, maybe you shouldn't have put so much syrup on the pancakes."
111090,428,134,646000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The secret is not to swallow the stingers.
111091,428,135,650000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, don't eat the bees!"
111092,428,136,652000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"They're just drones, Lisa. They only live for like five minutes anyway. And they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and Bart."
111093,428,137,659000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah!
111094,428,138,660000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen Lisa, I was trying to think of a way to help your bees and I remembered this abandoned greenhouse outside of town."
111095,428,139,668000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Which used to be a beautiful, thriving greenhouse 'til I was hired to run it."
111097,428,141,673000,Marge Simpson,Field,"Your bees will have plenty of room in this old greenhouse. Plus there are flowers, and it's near a prison so they'll have a place to sting people."
111098,428,142,681000,Lisa Simpson,Field,"Oh Mom, it's perfect!"
111099,428,143,684000,Lisa Simpson,Field,"Go, live your lives, get off my face!"
111100,428,144,688000,Lisa Simpson,Field,"Oh, I miss them."
111101,428,145,690000,Marge Simpson,Field,Now you know how I'll feel when you go to college.
111102,428,146,693000,Lisa Simpson,Field,You'll always have Bart. Always.
111103,428,147,695000,Marge Simpson,Field,But he'll be gone a lot repairing refrigerators.
111104,428,148,698000,Lisa Simpson,Field,Always.

111179,428,222,965000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"What's wrong with your bees, Lisa?"
111180,428,223,968000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Mr. Burns took away their sanctuary, and now they aren't strong enough to survive on their own."
111181,428,224,975000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I'm going home. Give me the keys to my bike lock.
111182,428,225,978000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Are you sure?

111187,428,230,992000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Listen Homer, in the back room I got these super-tough Africanized bees. I saw this ad in a gentleman's magazine for excited African honeys, and that's what they sent me. If we could combine them with Lisa's bees, it would make them strong enough to survive any environment."
111188,428,231,1006000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Huh? But how are we supposed to combine the DNA of two strains of the same species?
111189,428,232,1011000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Actually Homer...
111190,428,233,1016000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,You and me?

111196,428,239,1036000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Now, let's give them some privacy while they... get down to buzziness."
111197,428,240,1053000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,If they was me they'd be done by now.

111202,428,245,1068000,Lisa Simpson,Field,My bees?
111204,428,246,1071000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Your bees died days ago. These are their angry, mutant descendants. And they're tough enough to live in any environment."
111205,428,247,1080000,Lisa Simpson,Field,They sound awfully mad. Are they dangerous?
111206,428,248,1082000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Hm, I'm not sure. Let me check."
111207,428,249,1084000,Homer Simpson,Field,Are you guys dangerous?
111208,428,250,1086000,Homer Simpson,Field,"A simple ""yes"" would've sufficed."
111210,428,252,1091000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Don't worry, Lisa. Where else are they gonna go?"
111211,428,253,1095000,Lisa Simpson,Field,To that new stadium that looks exactly like a hive!
