51599,217,1,85000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And then the handsome prince realized he had to go to the bathroom really bad. But the evil ogre, Barney, had left the men's room in the most wicked condition. So the prince went out back to the enchanted alley..."
51600,217,2,100000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's not a fairy tale. It's just something that happened to you at Moe's.
51601,217,3,103000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sh-sh-sh. Anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years, until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon..."

51616,217,18,151000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Okay, papier-mâché mix... pipe cleaners... pig intestines... and sparkle paint."
51617,217,19,157000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"You're a lifesaver, Apu. All the other stores are closed."
51618,217,20,161000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,At eleven-thirty?! But this is the peak hour for stoned teenagers buying shiny things.
51619,217,21,168000,Jimbo Jones,Kwik-E-Mart,"Whoooa, it's a living mirror. Cool hat."
51620,217,22,174000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, I'm glad you're always here, but isn't it a little rough on your marriage?"
51621,217,23,178000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"You know, Manjula understands. I told her that endless toil is the only true path out of this jerkwater burg."
51622,217,24,184000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, when you have a free night, we'd love to have you two over for dinner."
51623,217,25,188000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh please, do not be insane, you hosted our wedding. The least we can do is have you over for dinner. It is payback time. And this time it's personal."
51625,217,27,202000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Annnd... now.
51626,217,28,202000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, that looks great, Mom. Some of your best work."

51628,217,30,210000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't turn it on yet.
51629,217,31,213000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm never eatin' chili again. Ooh, chili!"
51631,217,33,228000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Nelson, what are you doing?!"
51632,217,34,230000,Nelson Muntz,School Bus,I'm solving world hunger.
51633,217,35,233000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Hey, you're wrecking it!"
51634,217,36,236000,Otto Mann,School Bus,What the?... Look out! It's gonna blow!
51636,217,38,243000,Kids,School Bus,Eeeewwwwww!
51637,217,39,246000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"I hope you're happy, Nelson."
51638,217,40,248000,Nelson Muntz,School Bus,Very. But I can't help wondering where I go from here.
51640,217,42,252000,Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Stop worrying, Apu. The Kwik-E-Mart is in good hands."
51644,217,44,256000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"I'm not checking up on you, Sanjay. I am simply asking you how many pennies you have left. Seven?! I'll be right there."
51645,217,45,263000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"No, he won't. Apu's entertaining tonight. If you need pennies, take them from Jerry's Jar."
51646,217,46,272000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"This is why I married you. Oof, what an outfit. You are one Mahat-mama."
51647,217,47,278000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,You think so?
51648,217,48,279000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,Why I could not let you in the store like that -- because you are smoking.
51649,217,49,282000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Oh, Apu."
51650,217,50,287000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Maybe we should not answer it, huh?"
51651,217,51,290000,Homer Simpson,Apu's Apartment,Door's unlocked.
51652,217,52,292000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Oh! Marge, Homer, welcome!"

51655,217,55,298000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Oh, you are too kind, Marge. I am sure you have noticed the many small imperfections that fill me with shame."
51656,217,56,305000,Marge Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! If anything, your home makes me ashamed of my home!"
51657,217,57,312000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Well, let us just say we both feel bad."
51658,217,58,315000,Marge Simpson,Apu's Apartment,Deal!
51659,217,59,316000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,Who is your favorite Indian pop singer?
51660,217,60,318000,Homer Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"Oh, don't make me choose."
51662,217,62,326000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Oh, sorry."
51663,217,63,329000,Gulliver Dark,Apu's Apartment,YOU MAKE ME FEEL SO YOUNG / YOU MAKE ME FEEL SO SPRING HAS SPRUNG...
51664,217,64,340000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Good rice, good curry. Good Gandhi, let's hurry."
51665,217,65,345000,Marge Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"Mmm, oh, this is delicious. What's in it?"
51666,217,66,349000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Chick peas, lentils and rice."

51670,217,70,354000,Marge Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"Oh, I'm so glad we were able to get together."
51671,217,71,357000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Well, you know how hard it is to pry these two away from work."
51672,217,72,361000,Marge Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"Oh, yeah, Homer's a real go-getter."
51673,217,73,365000,Homer Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"Yeah, I'm going right to the top."
51642,217,74,370000,Homer Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"Hmm, what's an ""eltdown?"" Eh."
51674,217,75,375000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"I don't understand, Marge. Doesn't Homer work a standard eighteen-hour day?"
51675,217,76,380000,Marge Simpson,Apu's Apartment,Eighteen hours? Nobody works that hard.
51676,217,77,382000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
51677,217,78,384000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"But he does work every day, right?"
51678,217,79,387000,Marge Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"Well, pretty much. Except weekends."
51679,217,80,390000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,Wee... kends?
51680,217,81,393000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Uh, say, who's up for a game of Ganesh-Gnop?"
51681,217,82,396000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,You told me it was an American tradition to work all the time and never see your wife.
51682,217,83,401000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Yes, perhaps I stretched the truth a bit, but the Kwik-E-Mart, she is a harsh mistress."
51683,217,84,406000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,I think you just don't want to see me!
51684,217,85,409000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,Ah-- Maybe we should just close the door.
51685,217,86,422000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Kaminé, méri sumuj mé nahi ata ki tumné mujhsé jhooth kyokaha."
51686,217,87,422000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Manjula, toe isliyé ki mé tumharé liyé acchee cheezé khareed saku."
51687,217,88,422000,Marge Simpson,Apu's Apartment,Maybe we should leave.
51688,217,89,423000,Homer Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"Uh-uh, no way. I don't want to miss a word."
51689,217,90,426000,Marge Simpson,Apu's Apartment,You don't know what they're saying.
51690,217,91,427000,Homer Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"I'm picking it up. ""Sala"" seems to mean jerk. And I think ""Manjula"" means some kind of spaceship."
51691,217,92,435000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Uh, this could take a while, folks. Thank you, come again."
51692,217,93,439000,Marge Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"Oh, I hope we didn't get Apu in too much trouble."
51693,217,94,442000,Homer Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"Oh, they're newlyweds. They'll just talk things out and top it off with some lovin'."
51694,217,95,448000,Marge Simpson,Apu's Apartment,Oh dear.
51697,217,98,455000,Marge Simpson,Street,Either put that book down or let me drive.

51703,217,105,498000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Mornin', Apu. Still in hot water with the squaw?"
51704,217,106,501000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Worse than ever I am afraid. My shameful neglect has made her feel unloved. Now, I fear she will leave me."
51705,217,107,508000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, she's not gonna leave you right before Valentine's Day. That'd be like going to an air show and leaving before the plane crash."
51706,217,108,515000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Ooh, ooh, you are right, there's still seven days before Valentine's. Ah, seven chances to prove my love for sweet Manjula."
51707,217,109,523000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Sweet mint julep... I'll be at Moe's.
51709,217,111,535000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, boy. C'mon!"
51710,217,112,536000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, the vet says we shouldn't make him fetch the Sunday paper."
51711,217,113,541000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Goood dog! Good doggie! ""Tax Hike Approved""? Bad dog. Bad, bad dog."
51712,217,114,551000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now to trim away the fat.
51713,217,115,552000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Outlook."" ""Vista."" No. ""Spotlight."" ""Mosaic."" Nah."

51715,217,117,560000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, sorry, Marge, that's in my stockpile. You can have this."
51716,217,118,563000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This is about investment opportunities in Yemen.
51717,217,119,567000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Gimme that!

51723,217,125,586000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My darling bride Manjula / I hereby mend my ways / I'll shower you with Valentines / For seven love-filled days!
51724,217,126,590000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, how romantic!"
51725,217,127,597000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I used to take out ads like that when we were newlyweds.
51726,217,128,601000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The only ad you took out was to sell our lawnmower.
51727,217,129,604000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"We sold it, didn't we?"
51728,217,130,611000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Until last night, I never knew Apu could be so romantic."
51729,217,131,617000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe it. He covered your whole bed with wildflowers?
51730,217,132,621000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm sure Homer has done that for you."
51731,217,133,624000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmmm... sometimes I find pickle slices in the sheets.

51738,217,140,647000,MACAW,Simpson Home,Limo out front. Tickets to opera. Front row loge.
51739,217,141,651000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh... Just once, I'd like a parrot to say that to me."
51740,217,142,655000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Then the bird sang ""I Love The Night Life""... with clever new lyrics."
51741,217,143,659000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I hate that song."
51742,217,144,661000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I do too. But it was sweet. Women really like that sort of thing, Homie."

51765,217,166,759000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Homer, I've gone through seven years of receipts, and you've spent less on gifts for me than you have on temporary tattoos."
51766,217,167,767000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"But Marge, it's worth it. Look, the Taco Bell dog. Yo quiero Ta... Hey, where'd it go? Here boy!"

51793,217,198,858000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Car,Maybe he's run out of romantic ideas.
51794,217,199,861000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Car,"Nah, no, not our lover boy. If I know his MO, he saved the biggest one for today."
51795,217,200,867000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Car,"Aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. How can we sabotage his labor of love?"
51796,217,201,872000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,I'unno. Gasoline? Axes? I got some stuff in the trunk.

51806,217,211,904000,Chief Wiggum,Tiffany's,"A croissant? What the...? Oh, that's right. They have breakfast at Tiffany's now."
51807,217,212,909000,Homer Simpson,Tiffany's,Only till eleven.
51809,217,214,913000,Moe Szyslak,SPRINGFIELD WATERFRONT,So that's it. The crazy nut. He went and bought her a sloop.
51810,217,215,917000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD WATERFRONT,"Well, this is one Love Boat that won't delight and amuse..."
51811,217,216,921000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,SPRINGFIELD WATERFRONT,"Wait, Chief! He's not purchasing a boat..."

51817,217,222,942000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD WATERFRONT,Not entirely.
51819,217,224,950000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Car,"Aw geez, we been following him for hours."
51820,217,225,953000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Car,"You know, with all the energy we're puttin' into this sabotage thing, we coulda written sonnets for our wives, or learned to tango, or lovingly restored one of those antique..."
51822,217,227,964000,Ned Flanders,Road,"Whew, well, at least I got a hunk of Moe's hair."
51824,217,229,968000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Car,"Man, that smarts!"

51828,217,233,978000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Airport,I told you we shouldn't have gone for long-term parking.
51829,217,234,981000,Homer Simpson,Airport,"Hey, look! It's Elton John!"
51830,217,235,983000,Elton John,Airport,We had to make an emergency landing. It's that damn chandelier again.
51831,217,236,988000,Chief Wiggum,Airport,What's he doing in Springfield?
51832,217,237,991000,Moe Szyslak,Airport,I got it. I got it. Apu musta hired him to sing for Manjula.
51833,217,238,995000,Homer Simpson,Airport,Not if I can help it. And help it I might.
51834,217,239,1000000,Homer Simpson,Airport,Mr. John. I'm your biggest fan. I've tape recorded all your songs off the radio.
51835,217,240,1005000,Elton John,Airport,"Oh, that's very sweet. Have a Grammy."
51836,217,241,1008000,Homer Simpson,Airport,Uhhhh.
51837,217,242,1014000,Homer Simpson,Airport,"Sir Elton, my noble friends and I would like to dub you a Knight of the... Grand Concourse."
51838,217,243,1020000,Chief Wiggum,Airport,"Yeah, it's for all your charity work and, uh, for, ah, you know, teaching us um... to love again."
51839,217,244,1028000,Elton John,Airport,Really? I did that?
51840,217,245,1030000,Homer Simpson,Airport,How the hell should I know? Just get in this cage.
51841,217,246,1033000,Elton John,Airport,"Oh, hazing the new guy, eh? Hmp. You know, when I was dubbed Sir Elton, the Queen paddled me silly."
51842,217,247,1040000,Moe Szyslak,Airport,"Hey, Apu's talkin' to a skywriter!"
51843,217,248,1043000,Chief Wiggum,Airport,So that was his plan all along.
51844,217,249,1045000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Airport,"If he writes a message of love over Springfield, we're all screwed."
51845,217,250,1050000,Elton John,Airport,"Hello? Lads? Don't forget your old pal, Elton. Can anyone hear me? Skycap?"
51846,217,251,1059000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Airport,"Okay, here is the message, and please don't skimp on the... Sarin?!"
51847,217,252,1066000,Fantastic Dan,Airport,Don't be frightened. That tank's just Peace Corps surplus.
51848,217,253,1070000,Homer Simpson,Airport,"Not so fast, Apu!"
51849,217,254,1071000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Airport,Homer! What a delightful coincidence.
51850,217,255,1074000,Homer Simpson,Airport,"We're putting an end to your insane Valentine's rampage. Never again will good, lazy men have to... What the--?"
51851,217,256,1081000,Homer Simpson,Airport,Oh no you don't!
51853,217,258,1092000,Homer Simpson,Sky,"Hey, you with the scarf! Stop skywriting!"
51854,217,259,1094000,Fantastic Dan,Sky,I have to deliver a message! It's the skywriter's code.
51855,217,260,1098000,Homer Simpson,Sky,I am so sick of that damn code!
51857,217,262,1101000,Homer Simpson,Sky,"If you won't stop, then I'll stop you!"
51859,217,264,1106000,Fantastic Dan,Sky,What are you doing? Don't do that!
51861,217,266,1112000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,"Oh, isn't that sweet."
51862,217,267,1116000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield,That must be for Manjula.
51863,217,268,1119000,Bernice Hibbert,Springfield,Just once I'd like a love note in the sky.
51865,217,270,1125000,Homer Simpson,Sky,Lousy message.
51866,217,271,1127000,Fantastic Dan,Sky,"Stop, you crazy fool, you'll kill us all!"
51867,217,272,1129000,Homer Simpson,Sky,Correction. Kill us both.
51869,217,274,1136000,Maude Flanders,Springfield,"""I Love You..."" It's an angel! Ooh, that's Neddy's pet name for me!"
51870,217,275,1143000,Sarah Wiggum,Springfield,"""I Love You... Poppin' Fresh."" Oh, Clancy."
51872,217,277,1143000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield,"""I Love You... Edna K!"" It's a little run-together, but that's what it says!"
51873,217,278,1154000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,"""I Love You... Cactus? Blobby? Upsilon?"" Oh, who am I kidding? Homer would never surprise me like that."
51875,217,280,1167000,Fantastic Dan,Sky,Daggonit! You ruined my message.
51876,217,281,1170000,Fantastic Dan,Sky,What's the matter with you crazy old... / Get off me! / You're making me mad!
51878,217,283,1175000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Airport,Oh me. My humble love note is turning into a Valentine's Day massacre.
51879,217,284,1180000,Elton John,Airport,You think you've got problems. I just chewed my way out of a dog carrier. Whew.
51880,217,285,1185000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Airport,Elton John!
51881,217,286,1187000,Elton John,Airport,"That's my name. Well, not really."
51882,217,287,1190000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Airport,"I hate to sound like a screaming fan, but ."
51883,217,288,1194000,Elton John,Airport,That maniac nearly killed us!
51884,217,289,1196000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Airport,"Shall I ""take you to the pilot?"" Huh? You see? Because that is your song."
51885,217,290,1202000,Elton John,Airport,I heard you.
51886,217,291,1203000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Airport,"Yes, because ""someone saved your life tonight!"""
51887,217,292,1207000,Elton John,Airport,Cut it out!
51888,217,293,1208000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Airport,"Well, well, ""the bitch is back."""

51899,217,304,1243000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just when I think I have you figured out, you fall from the sky with roses."

51903,217,308,1258000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I think I have a collapsed lung, but okay!"
51905,217,310,1266000,Elton John,Kwik-E-Mart,"""If I was a sculptor, ha, but then again, nooo / Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show / I know it's not much but it's the best I can do / My gift is my song and, this one's from Apu."""
51906,217,311,1295000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, oh, I can't believe it. You closed the Kwik-E-Mart just for me."
