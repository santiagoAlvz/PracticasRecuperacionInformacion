96714,373,15,88000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"What a great film, and I think it makes a terrific point: effective immediately, I'm closing the plant and moving all operations to India."
96716,373,17,98000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Does this mean we're losing our jobs?

96797,373,97,420000,Homer Simpson,BANGALORE MARKET PLACE,"Uh-huh... Do I have to? Okay, okay, I'll show the cow I adore it."
96798,373,98,430000,Homer Simpson,BANGALORE MARKET PLACE,"Oh baby... ooo, did you lose weight?... oh c'mon, baby, don't play hard to milk..."
96801,373,101,441000,Homer Simpson,Bangalore,"Okay, Apu said his cousin Kavi could help me out."

96815,373,115,479000,Richard Dean Anderson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,I had to get out before another one of your bristly kisses. Then I remembered the blue contacts I wear to hide my Latino heritage...
96816,373,116,501000,Richard Dean Anderson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Now all I needed was a sling strong enough to support my two-hundred-pound frame.

96826,373,128,567000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,I'm a showman!
96827,373,129,570000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,"Welcome, new employees of the Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant."

96838,373,140,605000,Homer Simpson,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,Sorry I'm late. I was doing Carnak with my bodyguard.
96839,373,141,610000,Homer Simpson,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,Hindu. What do you call the moisture on your Hin?
96840,373,142,617000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,"Classic. Now, tell them how to run a nuclear plant!"
96841,373,143,623000,Homer Simpson,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh... duh... uh... um... uh... duh... Did I say ""um""?"

96843,373,146,645000,Homer Simpson,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,"Okay book, I didn't read you, and you didn't read me, but we're both in this together, so say something smart or get ready to run like hell. Um... ""In business as in breakfast, fried eggs have fragile yolks... huh, huh?"
96848,373,151,675000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,"He's got them eating out of his hand. And to think you doubted him, Smithers."
96849,373,152,680000,Waylon Smithers,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, can we talk about this ""arranged marriage"" of mine..."
96853,373,156,691000,Bart Simpson,Kavi's Apartment,"Dad, I've gotta write a report on the Great Lakes."
96854,373,157,694000,Homer Simpson,Kavi's Apartment,Just outsource it to Lisa. Outsourcing is the answer to everything.
96855,373,158,698000,Bart Simpson,Kavi's Apartment,"Also, I can't sleep at night 'cause there's this new bully who follows me home and..."

96861,373,164,741000,Patty Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,Next!
96862,373,165,743000,Richard Dean Anderson,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Okay, here's the plan. You lock me in the trunk of a car and park it under the pier at low tide. All I need are these everyday objects: a nail file, a farmer's almanac, a gun with no bullets, some bullets, and three of my MacGyver writers."
96863,373,166,756000,Patty Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,Sounds great. Can we do it during lunch?
96864,373,167,760000,Richard Dean Anderson,Department of Motor Vehicles,Nooowwwww!

96868,373,171,776000,Homer Simpson,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,...having only one pancake leaves room for more bacon.
96869,373,172,782000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,"I see what you're saying. We're crowding your plate. In fact, there's no need for us to be here at all. Let's go, Smithers."
96870,373,173,790000,Homer Simpson,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,You're giving me absolute power?!
96871,373,174,793000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,Mm-hm!
96872,373,175,794000,Waylon Smithers,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, doesn't that corrupt?"
96873,373,176,795000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,"Absolutely not! When it comes to running a nuclear power plant, this man's a god."
96875,373,177,803000,C. Montgomery Burns,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,"Now if you'll excuse me, I'm late for a dinner engagement. I don't want my scooped-out monkey head to get cold."
96876,373,178,812000,Homer Simpson,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,I'm not a God. God has a white beard and invented the Da Vinci Code.
96877,373,179,817000,Indian Assistant,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,"Actually, in our system of belief, there are many gods."
96878,373,180,821000,Homer Simpson,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,"Hmmm, let's see. You got the Elephant Man, Johnny Six-Arms, Papa Smurf... these guys are pretty cool. Maybe I am one of them. If only I had some kind of proof."
96879,373,181,835000,Homer Simpson,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,I won a free soda! I am a god!
96883,373,185,845000,Waylon Smithers,India,"Sir, I really don't think we should've left Simpson in charge."
96884,373,186,849000,C. Montgomery Burns,India,No office talk. I'm floating down the Ganges with my new chums.
96885,373,187,853000,Waylon Smithers,India,Those are corpses!
96886,373,188,854000,C. Montgomery Burns,India,You never like my friends.
96889,373,191,862000,Lenny Leonard,Bangalore Nuclear Power Plant,What's goin on? We flew all the way out here 'cause Homer sent us this crazy card.
96891,373,193,873000,Indian Bodyguard,WAITING AREA,"Behind one of these doors is Homer Simpson. Behind the other, a Bengal tiger. Choose wisely."

96898,373,200,905000,Richard Dean Anderson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Yeah, but you did have Slim Jims, a cheese grater, and rubber bands to hold it all together."
96899,373,201,914000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,We gotta get rid of this kook.
96900,373,202,916000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,I got an idea.
96901,373,203,918000,Richard Dean Anderson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Which episode are we watching tonight? 'L Is For 'Lake Tahoe' -- Part Two'... 'Bless Me MacGyver For I Have Sinned'?
96902,373,204,924000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,We thought maybe you would like to see some of our globetrotting adventures.
96874,373,205,931000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,This is Selma in line at the Luray Caverns.
96904,373,206,935000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,It turned out it was the line for the ladies room.
96905,373,207,937000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,This is the ladies' room.

96912,373,214,972000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Well, he's gone."
96913,373,215,973000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Yeah, and we'll always have what he wrote on our window shade."
96914,373,216,978000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,What did he write that in?
