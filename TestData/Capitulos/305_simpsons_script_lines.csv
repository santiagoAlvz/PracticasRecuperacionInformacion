78289,305,235,1030000,Bart Simpson,WASHINGTON BAR,This is not about me. Or how many times I voted.
78290,305,236,1033000,Lisa Simpson,WASHINGTON BAR,You said you were gonna get rid of the airplanes over our house. And now they're worse than ever.
78291,305,237,1038000,Homer Simpson,WASHINGTON BAR,"Krusty, you've let everyone down. And even worse, you've let down this sacred document."

78310,305,256,1116000,Lisa Simpson,House Of Representatives,"Oh, that's easy. First it's introduced, then it goes to committee, then..."
78311,305,257,1120000,Janitor,House Of Representatives,Wrong! That's wrong! Now I'll show you how things really work around here.
78312,305,258,1127000,Committee Chairman,House Of Representatives,"Sorry, Krusty. But there's no way I'm letting your Airline Rerouting Bill out of committee."
78313,305,259,1133000,Bart Simpson,House Of Representatives,"Congressman, I have a tape here of you using your free-mail privilege to send a get well card to your aunt."
78315,305,260,1142000,Committee Chairman,House Of Representatives,"If they hear about this in Modesto, I'm ruined. Maybe I wanted to be caught."
78317,305,262,1149000,Janitor,Bar,"Now Homer, that Southern Congressman is your biggest obstacle. Your job is to drink him under the table so he misses the vote. You think you can do it?"
78318,305,263,1159000,Homer Simpson,Bar,"Sir, I studied under Ed McMahon!"
78319,305,264,1162000,Southern Congressman,Bar,"How 'bout a drinkin' contest, boy? Right after I vote on the latest bill."

78321,305,266,1168000,Southern Congressman,Bar,Hah! You remind me of my high school drinking coach. Now enough talkin'. Let's drink!
78323,305,268,1175000,Janitor,House Of Representatives,Now your job is to attach Krusty's bill to a more popular bill. One that can't fail.
78324,305,269,1181000,Sgt. At Arms,House Of Representatives,"The House will now consider the ""Flags for Orphans"" bill."
78325,305,270,1186000,Lisa Simpson,House Of Representatives,"Okay, paperclip, do your stuff."
78326,305,271,1190000,Lisa Simpson,House Of Representatives,Now we just need a distraction.
78327,305,272,1194000,Homer Simpson,House Of Representatives,You call this a bicameral legislature?
78328,305,273,1205000,Homer Simpson,House Of Representatives,"I say, I say... my groin!"
78329,305,274,1210000,Speaker Of The House,House Of Representatives,"We will now vote on the Flags for Orphans... and Airline Rerouting Bill? Oh well, it's paper-clipped. Chairman Hayes, any objections?"
78330,305,275,1224000,Speaker Of The House,House Of Representatives,Congressman Beauregard?
78331,305,276,1227000,Southern Congressman,House Of Representatives,I don't wanna fight no Union.

78335,305,280,1234000,Krusty the Clown,House Of Representatives,The system works! I've become enchanted and illusioned with Washington.
78336,305,281,1241000,Janitor,House Of Representatives,And the reason it worked is because you all did your part.
78337,305,282,1245000,Marge Simpson,House Of Representatives,But I didn't do anything.
78338,305,283,1247000,Janitor,House Of Representatives,I just passed a bill in three hours... quit complaining.
78340,305,285,1253000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,At last those planes are flying where they belong.
78341,305,286,1256000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's right. Over the homes of poor people.
