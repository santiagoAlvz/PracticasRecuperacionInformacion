76413,299,61,285000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Hey, your kid is in the movie -- and the movie knows his name. Maybe Lisa will like this better than the diary. Stupid Flanders, you're a genius!"
76415,299,63,297000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"A laser pointer! Thanks, Bart."
76416,299,64,301000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's really cool. You can point a red dot at people's crotches from really far away.
76417,299,67,309000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"Hmm, there appears to be a red dot on my trouser fronts. I'd better lower them."
76418,299,68,315000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"The dot also appears to be on my underpants. Well, down they go."
76419,299,69,321000,Chief Wiggum,Skinner Home,Hey buddy. You'd better get that red dot checked out. My uncle died of crotch dot.

76422,299,72,331000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I wonder what this could be?
76423,299,73,335000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
76424,299,74,339000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Could it be some kind of book?

76426,299,76,345000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Mostly no.
76427,299,77,346000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh?
76428,299,78,347000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You were supposed to get her that stupid diary!
76429,299,79,351000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But it's a personalized video about my favorite little star -- Lisa Simpson.
76430,299,80,357000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... this could be fun. Let's watch it.
76431,299,81,365000,Sheriff Lisa,Simpson Home,"Howdy pardners, My name is Sheriff..."
76432,299,82,367000,Homer's Voice,Simpson Home,...Lisa Simpson.
76433,299,83,369000,Sheriff Lisa,Simpson Home,I sure am hungry for my favorite food...
76434,299,84,371000,Homer's Voice,Simpson Home,...McNuggets.
76435,299,85,372000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't like McNuggets, I'm a vegetarian!"
76436,299,86,375000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Still? Then you're not gonna like your other present.
76437,299,87,380000,Sheriff Lisa,Simpson Home,Why it's my best friend...
76438,299,88,381000,Homer's Voice,Simpson Home,Maggie.
76439,299,89,382000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh?
76440,299,90,384000,Prospector,Simpson Home,"Bad news, Sheriff..."
76441,299,91,385000,Homer's Voice,Simpson Home,...Lisa Simpson.
76442,299,92,387000,Prospector,Simpson Home,Some Indians took all the...
76443,299,93,389000,Homer's Voice,Simpson Home,"...McNuggets. Mmm, McNuggets."
76444,299,94,394000,Sheriff Lisa,Simpson Home,I'll get those no good Indians. Just as sure as my favorite book is...
76445,299,95,399000,Homer's Voice,Simpson Home,...magazines.
76446,299,96,402000,Bart's Voice,Simpson Home,"Wake up, Dad."
76448,299,98,406000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad! That information is all wrong! Maggie's a baby, not my best friend! You don't know anything about me!"
76449,299,99,418000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maggie, you're her best friend, go talk to her!"
76450,299,100,424000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, what have I done? Children don't remember bad birthdays, do they?"
76452,299,102,436000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good morning, honey. Did you cry out all your angries?"
76453,299,103,440000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think so.
76454,299,104,441000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Lisa's still mad at me."
76455,299,105,443000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe.
76456,299,106,446000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I did it for the insurance money.
76457,299,107,450000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look Lisa, I'm still trying to get to know you. Who's your favorite Traveling Wilbury? Is it Jeff Lynne?"
76458,299,108,457000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you've had eight years to get to know me. It's too late."
76459,299,109,463000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But I'm full of questions. What's your favorite cigar size? Is it Robusto? Is it?!
76461,299,111,472000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Gee Homer, you sure look sad."
76462,299,112,475000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, at least you ain't aging six years for every one 'cause of your cow heart."
76463,299,113,481000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, my daughter hates me because I don't know anything about her."
76464,299,114,485000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, well, whenever I gotta know something about a broad, I use this guy."
76465,299,115,490000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,This detective is unbelievable. He can learn more about a chick by digging through one garbage can than you could from years of intimacy.
76466,299,116,497000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,He found out who was cobbling shoes for me at night. Turns out I have severe schizophrenia.
76467,299,117,504000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well... if hiring this guy will make Lisa like me again, then I'll do it! Can I get this beer to go?"
76468,299,118,510000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Sure. Maybe some day I'll turn into a swan.
76469,299,119,518000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, God."
76473,299,123,530000,Homer Simpson,Art Deco Building,Drunk cop? Is that you?
76474,299,124,532000,Colt,Art Deco Building,"No, look lower."
76475,299,125,534000,Homer Simpson,Art Deco Building,"Ooh, pie."
76476,299,126,536000,Colt,Art Deco Building,What can I do for you?
76477,299,127,537000,Homer Simpson,Art Deco Building,My name is Homer Simpson. And I desperately need your help.
76478,299,128,540000,Colt,Art Deco Building,Let me guess. It's about a girl.
76479,299,129,542000,Homer Simpson,Art Deco Building,How did you know?
76480,299,130,544000,Colt,Art Deco Building,It's always a dame. Usually with gams that don't quit. Till they get to the shoes. And then they're only napping.
76481,299,131,554000,Homer Simpson,Art Deco Building,Priceless.
76482,299,132,556000,Homer Simpson,Art Deco Building,"I need you to find out everything about my daughter, so she'll think I'm a good Dad."
76483,299,133,561000,Colt,Art Deco Building,"Okay, I'll get a line on your kid. I charge fifty bucks a day. Plus expenses."
76484,299,134,566000,Homer Simpson,Art Deco Building,"Anything to trick my daughter into liking me. Now, if you need to reach me, my email is chunkylover53 at AOL."
76485,299,135,573000,Colt,Art Deco Building,Chunky... lover... 53?
76486,299,136,573000,Homer Simpson,Art Deco Building,It's one word.
76487,299,137,577000,Colt,Art Deco Building,One word.
76488,299,138,578000,Homer Simpson,Art Deco Building,Chunkylover53.
76489,299,139,579000,Colt,Art Deco Building,At AOL.
76490,299,140,580000,Homer Simpson,Art Deco Building,Dot com.
76492,299,142,594000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Hey! That's not your locker.
76493,299,143,596000,Colt,Springfield Elementary School,"You know, you are the spitting image of the Aberdeen Strangler."
76494,299,144,600000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Movin' on!
76495,299,145,604000,Colt,Springfield Elementary School,I need to see Lisa Simpson's permanent record.
76496,299,146,607000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I'm afraid that information is confidential.
76497,299,147,609000,Colt,Springfield Elementary School,These are some nice-looking papers on your desk. It'd be a shame if somebody shuffled them.
76498,299,148,615000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,You wouldn't dare.
76499,299,149,617000,Colt,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, wouldn't I?"
76500,299,150,620000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I could easily put them back in their original order.
76501,299,151,623000,Colt,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, really?"
76502,299,152,627000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Noooooo!
76504,299,154,636000,Colt,Alley,"You're late, Muntz."
76505,299,155,638000,Nelson Muntz,Alley,"Get bent, Shamus. I got what you're lookin' for."
76506,299,156,642000,Colt,Alley,Nice. Very nice.
76507,299,157,643000,Nelson Muntz,Alley,Now give me back what's mine.
76508,299,158,649000,Nelson Muntz,Alley,My picture with Snow White.
76509,299,159,652000,Colt,Alley,"You know, she's just an actress."
76510,299,160,654000,Nelson Muntz,Alley,Shut up! Some of us prefer illusion to despair.
76512,299,162,658000,Ralph Wiggum,Ice Cream Store,Lisa Simpson is a girl at my school.
76513,299,163,661000,Colt,Ice Cream Store,"Yes, yes, you said that already. What else do you know?"
76514,299,164,664000,Ralph Wiggum,Ice Cream Store,I once picked my nose till it bleeded.
76515,299,165,666000,Colt,Ice Cream Store,About Lisa!
76516,299,166,668000,Ralph Wiggum,Ice Cream Store,Lisa Simpson is a girl at my school.
76517,299,167,670000,Colt,Ice Cream Store,Someone's already worked this guy over.
76519,299,169,675000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ah, the information I've been waiting for."
76522,299,172,696000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Is that Miles Davis' ""Birth of The Cool?"""
76523,299,173,698000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You should know. It is your favorite album.
76524,299,174,701000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,So you know one thing about me. Big deal.
76525,299,175,707000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait, wait!"
76526,299,176,708000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought you might like to go to an animal rights protest today.
76527,299,177,712000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, maybe."
76528,299,178,713000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,On the way home we could stop and get your favorite treat: ice...cream!
76530,299,180,719000,HEAD PROTESTER,SCIENCE BUILDING,What do we want?
76531,299,181,721000,Protesters,SCIENCE BUILDING,The gradual phase out of animal testing over the next three years!
76532,299,182,726000,HEAD PROTESTER,SCIENCE BUILDING,When do we want it?
76533,299,183,727000,Protesters,SCIENCE BUILDING,Over the next three years!
76534,299,184,730000,Kent Brockman,SCIENCE BUILDING,"Uh, young lady, why are you protesting today?"
76535,299,185,732000,Lisa Simpson,SCIENCE BUILDING,Because this lab is cruelly testing consumer products on animals. Take a look for yourself.
76536,299,186,737000,Lisa Simpson,SCIENCE BUILDING,They're making monkeys smoke cigarettes...
76537,299,187,748000,Lisa Simpson,SCIENCE BUILDING,And look at the way they've slathered those pigs with cosmetics!
76538,299,188,752000,Homer Simpson,SCIENCE BUILDING,"So sad, yet so sexy, yet so delicious."
76540,299,190,760000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, today was so great. The animal rights protest, a visit to the Museum of Sadness and Oppression..."
76541,299,191,767000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we should get along. I mean after all, I am your... ...father."
76542,299,192,772000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How'd you think of such perfect things for us to do? Did Mom help you?
76543,299,193,776000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom? Don't you think I could read the report by myself?
76544,299,194,779000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What report?
76545,299,195,780000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, report is a daddy word that means ""loves his daughter."""
76546,299,196,780000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You read the ""loves his daughter"" by yourself?"
76547,299,197,791000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's right, honey."
76549,299,199,796000,Homer Simpson,'40s Building,"You did it! Lisa thinks I'm the greatest. I might even put you to work on Bart and Maggie, go superdad on all their asses."
76550,299,200,803000,Colt,'40s Building,I believe there's still the matter of my expenses.
76551,299,201,806000,Homer Simpson,'40s Building,"Oh yes. Well, let's take a look and see-- a thousand dollars! How did you spend a thousand dollars?"
76552,299,202,813000,Colt,'40s Building,It's itemized.
76553,299,203,814000,Homer Simpson,'40s Building,A forty dollar steak?!
76554,299,204,816000,Colt,'40s Building,"Yeah, but if I'd eaten the whole thing, it would've been free."
76555,299,205,819000,Homer Simpson,'40s Building,You've been living like a king on my dollar... Super unleaded gas... Silver bullets?
76556,299,206,824000,Colt,'40s Building,Early on I was working under the theory that your daughter was a werewolf. It didn't pan out.
76557,299,207,829000,Homer Simpson,'40s Building,I can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag.
76558,299,208,836000,Colt,'40s Building,"You better pay up, Simpson!"
76560,299,210,843000,Colt,'40s Building,You'll regret the day you crossed Dexter Colt.
76561,299,211,846000,Homer Simpson,'40s Building,You'll regret the day you went to the expensive coffee place!
76563,299,213,852000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"I'm here at the Screaming Monkey Research Labs, where hundreds of test animals have been freed by unknown activists."
76564,299,214,863000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Chief Wiggum, do you have a statement?"
76565,299,215,865000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Uh, yes. Yes I do, Kent. This is a horrible crime. One that-- Cut it out, Lou. He's makin' funny faces."
76566,299,216,874000,Lou,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Chief. One of these monkeys has the same name as my ex-wife."
76567,299,217,880000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Chief, do you have any suspects at this time?"
76568,299,218,882000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Well, we do have several promising clues. Uh, let's see, there's a Malibu Stacy scrunchy, a saxophone reed, and a book report on ""The Secret Garden"" by Lisa Simpson."
76569,299,219,894000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Well, what does this tell you, Chief?"
76570,299,220,895000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Well apparently, there's a secret garden in all of us. And that Lisa Simpson is guilty!"
76571,299,221,902000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I was framed! You believe me, don't you Dad?"
76572,299,222,905000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Of course I do. It's all my fault for refusing to pay...
76573,299,223,910000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"... pay attention to you, my sweet little father-loving pile of forgiveness. Yes."
76574,299,224,921000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,Can Lisa come out with her hands up?
76575,299,225,925000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Chief Wiggum, my daughter is innocent until proven guilty."
76576,299,226,933000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Would an innocent person flee? No, really. Tell me. I honestly don't know."
76577,299,227,939000,Lou,Simpson Home,"Chief, no."
76578,299,228,940000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,Even I knew that.
76579,299,229,941000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm not... I'm not good."
76582,299,232,946000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Heh, heh, they're trapped."
76583,299,233,960000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Oh, dammit!"
76585,299,235,963000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I can't stop worrying about Homer and Lisa."
76586,299,236,967000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, Mom... This'll take your mind off them."
76587,299,237,972000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh thank you, sweetie."
76590,299,240,978000,Radio,Simpson Car,Police are looking for a bald man in blue pants and a fair-haired girl in a red lampshade.
76591,299,241,984000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Blackening our hair was a great idea, Dad. I look just like a Powerpuff Girl."
76592,299,242,990000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,I look just like Elvis!
76596,299,246,998000,Clerk,Cabin Motel,"Names, please."
76597,299,247,999000,Lisa Simpson,Cabin Motel,Lady Penelope Ariel-Ponyweather.
76598,299,248,1002000,Homer Simpson,Cabin Motel,"Uh, Rock Strongo."
76599,299,249,1004000,Clerk,Cabin Motel,Your real name?

76602,299,252,1011000,Homer Simpson,Cabin Motel,Let me just put on my glasses.
76603,299,253,1020000,Homer Simpson,Cabin Motel,You're charging how much for a room?
76605,299,255,1024000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hello?
76606,299,256,1025000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, this is a phone survey. If the election were held today, would you vote for ""A"" the cops are there, or ""B"" you are free to talk?"
76607,299,257,1037000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, ""A."" And I'd like to add that proposition ""Hug Lisa For Me"" has my full support."
76608,299,258,1045000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Marge. You're not gettin' it, it's me. Homer. Simpson."

76610,299,260,1051000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Good work, Lou. We'll leave right after dinner."
76612,299,262,1055000,Homer Simpson,Cabin Motel,"Lisa, this is from your Mom."
76614,299,263,1059000,Lisa Simpson,Cabin Motel,"Aw... Life on the lam is really hard, but at least it's with you, Dad. I feel terrible for putting you through this, after what a wonderful father you've been."
76615,299,264,1070000,Homer Simpson,Cabin Motel,"Lisa, I can't lie to you any longer... this is all my fault. I'm the worst dad in the world."
76616,299,265,1077000,Lisa Simpson,Cabin Motel,What? Why?
76617,299,266,1078000,Homer Simpson,Cabin Motel,The man who framed you is a crooked detective. Who I hired!
76618,299,267,1082000,Lisa Simpson,Cabin Motel,Why did you do that?
76619,299,268,1083000,Homer Simpson,Cabin Motel,To find out everything about you so I'd seem like a good father.
76620,299,269,1087000,Lisa Simpson,Cabin Motel,How could you?
76621,299,270,1089000,Homer Simpson,Cabin Motel,"Well, all the childless drunks at Moe's thought it was a great idea."
76622,299,271,1092000,Lisa Simpson,Cabin Motel,Let's just get some sleep.
76624,299,273,1103000,Chief Wiggum,Cabin,"All right Simpsons, the jig is up! We know you're in there!"
76625,299,274,1107000,Homer Simpson,Cabin,"Okay, I'm coming right out the door. Dammit! These windows are so hard to squeeze through!"
76627,299,276,1121000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Cheer up, honey, we're living an all natural existence, the kind you like. Ooh, a trash can. We'll find breakfast in here."
76628,299,277,1128000,Lisa Simpson,Field,I don't wanna eat from the trash.
76629,299,278,1130000,Homer Simpson,Field,"Oh, a banana!"
76630,299,279,1135000,Homer Simpson,Field,It's full of cigarette butts. So is this one...
76631,299,280,1139000,Lisa Simpson,Field,They must have come from over there.
76632,299,281,1148000,Lisa Simpson,Field,Those are the test animals! The detective must have sold them to the circus.
76633,299,282,1152000,Homer Simpson,Field,We'll just tell the police and then I'm back to being plain old Rock Strongo.
76634,299,283,1156000,Colt,Field,You're not telling nobody nothing.
76635,299,284,1159000,Colt,Field,Make one move and you'll get a belly full of The Flying Giuseppe.
76636,299,285,1163000,Giuseppe,Field,How ya doin'.
76637,299,286,1165000,Homer Simpson,Field,Dexter Colt. The man who framed my daughter.
76638,299,287,1168000,Colt,Field,You should have paid the expenses.
76639,299,288,1170000,Homer Simpson,Field,"In retrospect, yes."
76640,299,289,1184000,Giuseppe,Field,"Ooh, I think that fixed my back. Oh no, no. It's much worse."
76642,299,291,1193000,Homer Simpson,Circus Grounds,I'll just hide here.
76646,299,295,1204000,Homer Simpson,Hall of Mirrors,Now what are you gonna do? You can't shoot all of us.
76647,299,296,1208000,Homer Simpson,Hall of Mirrors,Damn it!
76648,299,297,1211000,Colt,Hall of Mirrors,"You know Simpson, from the moment you walked into my office, I had a feeling I'd kill you in a hall of mirrors."
76649,299,298,1217000,Lisa Simpson,Hall of Mirrors,"Dad, are you in here?"
76650,299,299,1219000,Colt,Hall of Mirrors,How did she find us?
76651,299,300,1220000,Homer Simpson,Hall of Mirrors,"Oh, Lisa has excellent hearing. Once when she was three, I was quietly sobbing in the closet and she found me!"
76652,299,301,1227000,Lisa Simpson,Hall of Mirrors,"Oh Dad, you do remember something about me. Perhaps you also remember this laser Bart gave me earlier!"
76653,299,302,1235000,Colt,Hall of Mirrors,I can't see!
76654,299,303,1238000,Homer Simpson,Hall of Mirrors,How ironic. Now he's blind after a life of enjoying being able to see.
76656,299,305,1248000,Homer Simpson,Circus Grounds,"Well, it wasn't easy, honey, but I'm glad you love me again."
76657,299,306,1252000,Homer Simpson,Circus Grounds,Yeah. But what's gonna happen to the animals?
76658,299,307,1255000,Homer Simpson,Circus Grounds,"Don't worry, honey. I released them all into the wild."
76660,299,309,1260000,Brandine Del Roy,Cletus's Shack,"Cletus, if I find pig lipstick on your collar again, I'm not gonna let you sleep in the sty no more."
76661,299,310,1266000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,Duly noted.
76664,299,313,1296000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Dad, will you read me a bedtime story?"
76665,299,314,1298000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why certainly son, just hand me that book you've got there..."
