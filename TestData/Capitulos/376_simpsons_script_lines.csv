97611,376,85,405000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,You monster! What have you done to my face?!
97614,376,88,417000,Homer Simpson,Hallway Outside Marge's Hospital Room,When will Marge remember us?
97615,376,89,419000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hallway Outside Marge's Hospital Room,"It's hard to say. With retrograde amnesia such as this, the patient can forget years and years of her life. You just have to keep jogging her memory till it works."
97616,376,90,427000,Homer Simpson,Hallway Outside Marge's Hospital Room,Jogging?!
97617,376,91,429000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hallway Outside Marge's Hospital Room,I didn't say you should be jogging.

97624,376,98,449000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Hospital Room,"Oh, you're sweet. I'm lucky to have such a kind... Uncle?"
97625,376,99,454000,Homer Simpson,Marge's Hospital Room,I'm your husband!
97626,376,100,455000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Hospital Room,Wha--?!
97627,376,101,457000,Homer Simpson,Marge's Hospital Room,I am! We're the same age!
97628,376,102,459000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Hospital Room,But you're so much more... ravaged than I am.
97629,376,103,464000,Homer Simpson,Marge's Hospital Room,I do eat a lot of crap.
97631,376,105,466000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,"I'm Lisa, I'm eight years old, and this might sound presumptuous, but -- I'm your favorite."

97633,376,107,478000,Lisa Simpson,Hospital,"Well, talk to me in a week."
97634,376,108,480000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,"Hi, I'm Bart. I'm ten years old and a professional moto-cross jumper. Can you buy me a moto-cross bike?"
97635,376,109,487000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,"I may have lost my memory, but I'm not an idiot."
97636,376,110,491000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,"Great news, Marge -- we're goin' home."
97637,376,111,492000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Yes, the insurance company said you're as well as they're gonna pay for!"
97638,376,112,498000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,"Ooh, I can't wait to see what kind of home we live in."
97639,376,113,501000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,Oh it's great. Like somebody barfed a two-story pile of puke.
97640,376,114,505000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,Why you little...
97641,376,115,509000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,You strangle your child?
97642,376,116,511000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,"Yeah, but he's cool with it. Right?"
97643,376,117,515000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,It hurts when I swallow.
97644,376,118,517000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,Why you little...
97648,376,122,522000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Now the doctor said a tour of the town could help bring back your memory.
97649,376,123,528000,Sideshow Mel,Homer's Car,I say bing cherries are the most delicious!
97650,376,124,532000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Homer's Car,I say maraschino!
97651,376,125,535000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,Who are those freaks?
97652,376,126,538000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Those ""freaks,"" as you call them, are some of our closest friends."
97653,376,127,543000,Sideshow Mel,Homer's Car,Maraschino isn't even a kind of cherry! It's a way of preserving them!
97654,376,128,548000,Duffman,Homer's Car,Sounds like Duffman took the wrong side in this chicken fight! Oh yeah.
97655,376,129,554000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,Why is that drug addict driving a school bus?
97656,376,130,557000,Otto Mann,Homer's Car,"Whoa, I may be wasted, but I still care about the safety of these kids."
97658,376,132,567000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"See that ball of fire? That's the sun. It goes by many names: Apollo's Lantern, Day-moon, Old Blazey. The important thing is never to touch it."
97659,376,133,581000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,I know what the sun is.
97660,376,134,583000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Yes, now you do."
97663,376,137,589000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I know that sound!
97664,376,138,592000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Maggie! My sweet little angel!
97665,376,139,596000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,The sound of the baby must have triggered a primal mnemonic response in Mom's brain.
97666,376,140,601000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Lisa! My little know-it-all!
97667,376,141,604000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Kitchen,"Hey, guys. Guess who just became lactose-tolerant?"
97668,376,142,608000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Milhouse! You're Bart's best friend!
97669,376,143,613000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I remember Bart!
97670,376,144,616000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I can't believe you remembered me through Milhouse. He's not even my best friend.
97671,376,145,620000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Kitchen,"Who's got amnesia now, Bart?"
97672,376,146,626000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,It's so great to have my children back.
97673,376,147,628000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I'd better get ready -- I'm next!
97674,376,148,637000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"All right, Marge... time to remember Admiral Awesome!"
97675,376,149,644000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Nope. I'm sorry, Admiral, but you're still a stranger to me."
97676,376,150,647000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Why do you remember them and not me?
97677,376,151,650000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I don't know. Maybe there's something unpleasant blocking my memory of you.
97678,376,152,655000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Kitchen,"Hi-dilly ho, Simpsons!"
97679,376,153,657000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh, hey Ned! Isn't today your cat's birthday? I remember 'cause she shares the date with Patty LaBelle!"
97682,376,156,668000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay. All it'll take to unlock your memories of me is one of these blasts from the past.
97683,376,157,673000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here's me fighting with former President Bush, me fighting with current President Bush, and here's me showing a bag of apples who's boss."
97684,376,158,682000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry. You seem like... a colorful character, but I just don't remember you."
97685,376,159,688000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, maybe if we snuggle, it might rattle some memories loose."
97686,376,160,693000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's snuggling?
97687,376,161,694000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"When a man and a woman love each other very much, they--"
97688,376,162,701000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mr. Simpson, I don't even know you -- I'm not making love with you!"
97689,376,163,706000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But what if we...
97690,376,164,711000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're describing how to parallel park.
97691,376,165,716000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You used to love my non sequiturs!
97693,376,167,720000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC PARK,Why can I remember everyone in town except my husband?
97694,376,168,724000,Selma Bouvier,SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC PARK,Simple. Your brain is trying to save you from your backed-up toilet of a marriage.
97695,376,169,729000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC PARK,Have you been talking like this for my entire marriage?
97696,376,170,732000,Patty Bouvier,SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC PARK,"Oh no, no. We've always honored your choice."
97697,376,171,737000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC PARK,"I don't know. I should give Homer a chance... but on the other hand, I feel nothing for him."
97699,376,173,746000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC PARK,This is horrible.
97700,376,174,749000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC PARK,We've got to tell Dad!
97701,376,175,751000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC PARK,"Oh no, Bart and Lisa are gonna tell me something horrible!"
97703,376,177,755000,Lou,SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC PARK,What?
97704,376,178,757000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC PARK,"Buy the Police Department a hang-glider, you said. Fight crime from above, you said."
97705,376,179,761000,Lou,SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC PARK,"Yeah, and you said you were only a hundred and eighty pounds."
97706,376,180,764000,Chief Wiggum,SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC PARK,Shut up and look for crime.
97708,376,182,771000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Mr. Simpson?
97709,376,183,773000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, if I can't make you remember me, then I'll make you fall for me all over again."
97710,376,184,778000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The heart is the symbol for love.
97713,376,187,785000,Luigi,Luigi's,THAT HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S QUITE A GUY / HE PAID ME TEN BUCKS / SO I WOULD LIE / THE TRUTH IS / HE'S NOT SO GREAT / HE IS THE ONE MAN / I TRU-LY HATE...
97714,376,188,804000,Homer Simpson,Luigi's,So beautiful. I wish I could understand Italian.
97716,376,190,809000,Marge Simpson,Sidewalk,"I've had a lovely evening, Mr. Simpson."
97717,376,191,813000,Homer Simpson,Sidewalk,Just wait. We're coming to the site of our most romantic night ever!
97719,376,193,818000,Homer Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,"It was in that plywood castle that we first... well, you know..."
97720,376,194,824000,Marge Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,Know what?
97721,376,195,830000,Marge Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,No! I'm not the kind of girl who makes love on a putt-putt golf course!
97722,376,196,835000,Homer Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,Oh you loved it -- especially when the windmill came around and whacked your but.
97723,376,197,841000,Marge Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,That sounds horrible!
97724,376,198,844000,Homer Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,"No, it was the happiest night of my life! The warm Spring air, the swings I took in the batting cage afterwards... Don't you remember, darling?"
97725,376,199,853000,Marge Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,No! And I hope I never do! The best thing that ever happened to me was forgetting about you!
97726,376,200,862000,Seymour Skinner,MINI-GOLF COURSE,"You know, I still think about you all the time."
97727,376,201,866000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,MINI-GOLF COURSE,"Birthday's over, Seymour."
97728,376,202,873000,Marge Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,I'm sorry you have to leave. But I just can't think of another way.
97729,376,203,876000,Homer Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,"I know. Wait, I thought of another way: I stay!"
97518,376,204,880000,Marge Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,"Goodbye, Mr. Simpson."
97730,376,206,883000,Lisa Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,"Dad, we don't want you to leave!"
97731,376,207,885000,Bart Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,"My grades will suffer! In fact, they're already suffering."
97732,376,208,889000,Bart Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,Look at this garden of F's. You planted them all!
97733,376,209,892000,Homer Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,"Marge, I realize you've made up your mind, and I want you to know that I deeply respect your boo!"
97734,376,210,897000,Marge Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,"That works for hiccups, not amnesia."
97735,376,211,900000,Homer Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,I know. I just thought maybe... boo!
97737,376,213,913000,Homer Simpson,MINI-GOLF COURSE,Boo.
97740,376,216,916000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa's Room at Springfield Retirement Castle,"How long you gonna be bunking with me, son?"

97761,376,235,987000,Grumpy-looking Man,FUNCTION ROOM,"Yeah, hi. Hiya doin'? So, uh let's get right to it: I don't drive a Lexus, okay? I don't have a Lear jet or some big beach house in La La Land.

97762,376,236,1004000,Grumpy-looking Man,FUNCTION ROOM,"Oh, don't get quiet on me, please. I hate when they get quiet."

97766,376,240,1022000,Marge Simpson,FUNCTION ROOM,Me too. I can't believe anyone ever really finds anyone at these things.
97767,376,241,1028000,Good-looking Bachelor,FUNCTION ROOM,"Yeah, I was dragged here by my older brothers."
97768,376,242,1030000,Twin Guy #1,FUNCTION ROOM,"We used to be quintuplets, but three of us drowned."

97781,376,255,1082000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Homer, I don't want to alarm you, but right now we're lookin' at your wife yukkin' it up with a good-lookin' guy."
97782,376,256,1088000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"He just touched her arm, and now they're being quiet."
97783,376,257,1091000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yeah, but it's not an awkward silence."
97784,376,258,1094000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yeah, it's more like a ""nothing needs to be said"" kind of silence."
97787,376,261,1103000,Good-looking Bachelor,Seaside Caf√©,I just think the best thing a person can do for the world is to be clean and polite.
97759,376,262,1108000,Marge Simpson,Seaside Caf√©,"Wow, that's what I would've said. Well, I would've said ""polite and clean,"" but wow, still..."

97793,376,266,1134000,Marge Simpson,Seaside Caf√©,You really mean that?
97794,376,267,1135000,Good-looking Bachelor,Seaside Caf√©,I do.
97795,376,268,1136000,Marge Simpson,Seaside Caf√©,I've got amnesia and I have three kids.
97796,376,269,1142000,Good-looking Bachelor,Seaside Caf√©,"Wow, my first thought is ""respect"" -- both for your mental illness and your ability to get back into shape. My second thought is goodbye!"
97798,376,271,1154000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,You idiot!
97800,376,273,1154000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,Do you know what you just gave up?!

97804,376,277,1165000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,"You just walked away from the sweetest, most beautiful woman a guy could want. In ten years she never had the last slice of pizza and she's never complained. Every election, she wishes she could vote for both guys, because they both seem nice. And there's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better. And you blew her off."
97805,376,278,1185000,Good-looking Bachelor,Parking Lot,"Dude, she's got three kids."
97806,376,279,1187000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,Really? Well she's still great!

97808,376,281,1201000,Marge Simpson,Parking Lot,"I may not know much about you, but you sure know a lot of wonderful things about me. And that means a lot to a woman."
97809,376,282,1209000,Marge Simpson,Parking Lot,"I still don't remember you, but for the first time since this happened, I wish I did... Homer."
97812,376,285,1220000,Homer Simpson,Car,I'm so happy we're together again. Wanna get a drink?
97813,376,286,1223000,Marge Simpson,Car,You drink?
97814,376,287,1224000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Uh, yeah. I started when you were in the hospital. I was so worried. Recently I tried this thing called ""beer."" And..."
97815,376,288,1233000,Marge Simpson,Car,I remember everything -- you get drunk all the time!
97816,376,289,1237000,Homer Simpson,Car,But do you also remember that you're an enabler?
97817,376,290,1241000,Marge Simpson,Car,Oh of course I do! That's why we're such a great team!
97760,376,292,1250000,Marge Simpson,Highway,"You've been drinking today, haven't you?"
97789,376,293,1253000,Homer Simpson,Highway,"I sure have, pardner."
96506,376,294,1262000,Marge Simpson,Highway,I remember him.
96756,376,295,1263000,Homer Simpson,Highway,What about her.
97818,376,296,1263000,Marge Simpson,Highway,"Oh, I don't..."
97819,376,297,1265000,Homer Simpson,Highway,And her?
97820,376,298,1265000,Marge Simpson,Highway,"Oh, and her."
97821,376,299,1266000,Homer Simpson,Highway,And her.
97822,376,300,1266000,Marge Simpson,Highway,Uh-huh. And him.
97823,376,301,1268000,Homer Simpson,Highway,What about him?
97824,376,302,1269000,Marge Simpson,Highway,I don't recognize that name.
97825,376,303,1270000,Homer Simpson,Highway,"Yeah, I have their baseball cards."
97826,376,304,1272000,Marge Simpson,Highway,"Oh, I know all them!"
97827,376,305,1273000,Homer Simpson,Highway,Look at all those people. You know them?
97828,376,306,1275000,Marge Simpson,Highway,"Wow, she still works here?"
97829,376,307,1276000,Homer Simpson,Highway,"Yeah, she's over in post now."
97830,376,308,1278000,Marge Simpson,Highway,"Oh, I always liked that guy!"
97831,376,309,1281000,Homer Simpson,Highway,"Not me -- but we can't get rid of him, 'cause he's friends with Richard Sakai."
97832,376,310,1286000,Marge Simpson,Highway,"Oh, and there's a familiar name. And another one. Wait, what-what ever happened to that guy from the network? Did he get married?"
97833,376,311,1294000,Homer Simpson,Highway,"Oh, he ain't gettin' married. He has commitment issues!"
