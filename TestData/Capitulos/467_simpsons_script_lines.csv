120996,467,1,109000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Whoa! She's everything I want to be!
120997,467,2,140000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,What's a babe like her doing with a brown banana like Skinner?
120998,467,3,144000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Maybe she's one of those sexy school- supply company reps.
120999,467,4,147000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"If that's true, where's her suitcase with wheels, Bart? Where's her suitcase with wheels?!"
121001,467,6,155000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"Ah, if it isn't Eavesdrop Ernie and the Listen-In Bunch! I'd like you boys to meet Dahlia Brinkley."
121002,467,7,161000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,She's the only Springfield Elementary alum ever to advance to the Ivy League!
121003,467,8,165000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,There's a car in the parking lot with a Yale sticker on it! It's gotta be you.
121004,467,9,170000,Dahlia,Skinner's Office,"I just graduated from Yale, and thought I'd pay a visit -- from Yale -- to the little school where it all began."
121005,467,10,178000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,I plan to attend an Ivy League school myself. I do have a 4.0 GPA.
121006,467,11,182000,Nelson Muntz,Skinner's Office,"She can do the kind of math that has letters. Watch: what's ""x,"" Lisa?"
121007,467,12,187000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Well, that depends."
121008,467,13,189000,Nelson Muntz,Skinner's Office,"Sorry, she did it yesterday."
121009,467,14,191000,Dahlia,Skinner's Office,I believe you. What else have you got?
121010,467,15,193000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Um, I'm treasurer of the Jazz Club, and started the school's recycling society."
121011,467,16,201000,Dahlia,Skinner's Office,Nice. And?
121012,467,17,203000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Uh, that's it."
121013,467,18,204000,Dahlia,Skinner's Office,"Two clubs? Well that's a bridge bid, not an Ivy League application."
121014,467,19,209000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,But I'm only in second grade.
121015,467,20,211000,Dahlia,Skinner's Office,"By your age, I'd been the dominant force in dozens of extracurricular activities."
121016,467,21,215000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Quite so! Just take a look at her yearbook.
121017,467,22,230000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Wonderful year.
121018,467,23,232000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,Same year we got new playground sand.
121019,467,24,234000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Yes it was.
121020,467,25,234000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,Mmm-hm.
121022,467,27,240000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Thrust! Parry! Dodge! Poke!
121023,467,28,242000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, Maggie. I need to get good at fencing so I can put it on my resume and get into Yale. Don't be scared. I won't hurt my widdle sister."
121025,467,30,275000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetie, you could still go to McGill -- the Harvard of Canada."
121026,467,31,280000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Anything that's the something of the something isn't really the anything of anything!
121027,467,32,286000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, Flanders. Don't you have a neighbor on the other side?"
121028,467,33,290000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Indeedily-doodily I do, and I love him just as much as you! It's a Flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!"
121029,467,34,298000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Bart, call me Walter Matthau, 'cause I'm a bad-news bearer. I'm resigning as manager of your Little League team."
121030,467,35,304000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What? Why?
121031,467,36,306000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"In the last game, our shortstop hit a long foul ball, but the umpire called it a homerun... and I let it go without saying a word. I just don't like the monster I've become."
121032,467,37,320000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"But without a coach, we can't play!"
121033,467,38,323000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, maybe you could do it."
121034,467,39,325000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Marge. The last time I stepped on a baseball field, I got tased."
121035,467,40,329000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, someday these kids will be out of the house and you'll regret not spending more time with them."
121036,467,41,336000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's a problem for future Homer. Man, I don't envy that guy."
121038,467,43,348000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Can't play baseball... what am I gonna do?
121039,467,44,350000,Hobby Shop Owner,Springfield Street,"Son, how would you like to spend the summer building wooden boats by hand with master craftsmen?"
121040,467,45,357000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,How'd you like to kiss my ass?
121041,467,46,362000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Street,"Look at me, I'm Whitey Ford!"
121042,467,47,362000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Huh?
121043,467,48,366000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,What's goin' on?
121044,467,49,367000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Street,We got a new coach!
121045,467,50,369000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Awesome! Who is it?
121047,467,52,370000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,It's me!
121048,467,53,372000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Park,Lisa?!
121049,467,54,373000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,"What, you can't stand the idea of a girl coaching a boys' baseball team?"
121050,467,55,378000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Park,"No, we can't stand the idea of someone who knows nothing about baseball coaching a baseball team."
121051,467,56,383000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,"Hey, there have been plenty of female managers in baseball! Connie Mack, Sandy Alomar, Terry Francona, Pinky Higgins--"
121052,467,57,392000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Park,Those are dudes!
121053,467,58,394000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,"Really?... They sound like... I mean... well, the thing..."
121054,467,59,398000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,"Okay, bottom line: I need an extra-curricular activity, and no one else will coach you loveable losers."
121055,467,60,414000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Park,We're not losers. Last year we finished six and five.
121056,467,61,417000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Park,And we're not loveable. We had a tall freckled-faced kid on the team that we picked on till he quit.
121057,467,62,423000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Park,Hey Splatter-face! How's the weather up there?
121058,467,63,427000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Park,"It's too bad 'cause he's a great hitter, but it's worth it."
121059,467,64,431000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,"Look, if you want to play liability-insured baseball, I'm your only shot."
121060,467,65,437000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Park,"Fine, you can be our coach."
121061,467,66,439000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,Thanks. You can be the free safety.
121062,467,67,441000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Park,Wrong sport.
121063,467,68,441000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,I mean the point guard.
121064,467,69,444000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Park,Also wrong.
121065,467,70,444000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,I'm gonna do a little research.
121066,467,71,446000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Park,"A little's not gonna be enough, honey pie."
121067,467,72,448000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,Don't call me honey pie.
121068,467,73,449000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Park,"You got it, tootsie pop."
121070,467,75,452000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Park,"Get a room, you two."
121071,467,76,453000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,We're brother and sister.
121072,467,77,455000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Park,"So are my parents, I think."
121074,467,79,460000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, Dad."
121075,467,80,462000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey pal, howya doin'?"
121076,467,81,463000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Fine. I was hoping you and your friends could tell me something about baseball strategy.
121077,467,82,468000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"The only thing I know about strategy is that whatever the manager does, it's wrong, unless it works, in which case he's a button-pusher."
121078,467,83,475000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,I hate guys that just push buttons all day.
121079,467,84,477000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,You just push buttons all day.
121080,467,85,479000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"You know, ever since Obama came in, you've got all the answers, don't you?"
121081,467,86,483000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Does anyone here actually know anything about baseball?
121082,467,87,486000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, the guys in that booth down there."
121083,467,88,492000,Gary,Moe's Tavern,"As a pitcher, Cliff Lee is clearly superior to Zack Grienke."
121084,467,89,496000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Moe's Tavern,"Uh yes, I completely agree, with the following colossal exception: before the fourth inning after a road loss in a domed stadium. Then it's good to be Grienke. Unless he's got a bunion, in which case he is notably ineffective."
121085,467,90,507000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Wow, I'm surprised you guys know so much about a sport."
121088,467,91,516000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Moe's Tavern,"Oh Lisa, baseball is a game played by the dexterous but only understood by the Poin-dexterous. Do you understand what I laid out there?"
121089,467,92,525000,Doug,Moe's Tavern,The key to understanding the game is sabermetrics.
121090,467,93,528000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Huh?
121091,467,94,529000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Moe's Tavern,The field was developed by statistician Bill James...
121092,467,95,533000,Bill James,Moe's Tavern,I made baseball as fun as doing your taxes!
121093,467,96,537000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Moe's Tavern,"Using sabermetrics, even an eight-year-old girl can run a ballclub with the sagacity of a Stengel and the single-mindedness of a Steinbrenner. I call it a Stein-stengel-."
121094,467,97,545000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Thanks, guys."
121095,467,98,552000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, speaking of stats, I'm none too pleased about your ratio of ""seats occupied"" to ""beers ordered."""
121096,467,99,558000,Gary,Moe's Tavern,You mean our SOBO? Let's calculate it now!
121098,467,101,564000,Doug,Moe's Tavern,What's the conversion factor for ginger beer?
121099,467,102,567000,Gary,Moe's Tavern,Refreshingness over effervescence.
121100,467,103,570000,Benjamin,Moe's Tavern,Plus or minus tang.
121101,467,104,571000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Why did I advertise my drink specials in Scientific American?
121102,467,105,576000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Moe's Tavern,I can think of three reasons. First of all you...
121103,467,106,577000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Shut up.
121105,467,108,579000,Baseball Announcer,ISOTOTS STADIUM,"So we're one-one in the third, and Isotot manager Lisa Simpson rearranges her defense one more time. I haven't see this many books in a dugout since Albert Einstein went canoeing."
121106,467,109,593000,Lisa Simpson,ISOTOTS STADIUM,Everyone shift towards right!
121108,467,111,601000,Ralph Wiggum,ISOTOTS STADIUM,I caught a white apple!
121109,467,112,636000,Lisa Simpson,ISOTOTS STADIUM,"Okay, everyone study two-out situations, count management, and I'll be back with some gluten-free crackers."
121110,467,113,644000,Milhouse Van Houten,ISOTOTS STADIUM,Your spreadsheets!
121111,467,114,646000,Bart Simpson,ISOTOTS STADIUM,"My stupid sister's taken the fun out of baseball. What happened to stealing bases, the suicide squeeze, throwin' a little chin music?"
121112,467,115,653000,Nelson Muntz,ISOTOTS STADIUM,"We're no longer cellar dwellers. Well, the team isn't."
121113,467,116,658000,Bart Simpson,ISOTOTS STADIUM,"This isn't the game I grew up with, the game played in the misty ballparks of Enron Field, or Pac Bell, then S.B.C., now A. T. and T. Park. And from now on, I'm gonna play my game."
120856,467,117,669000,Bart Simpson,ISOTOTS STADIUM,Dummyball.
121114,467,119,671000,Baseball Announcer,PRESS BOOTH,"Bart Simpson on deck, his bat's just hungering for a homer like Chronos for his children. Speaking of Homer, Bart's father's name is, you guessed it, not on my fact sheet."
121116,467,121,684000,Lisa Simpson,ON DECK CIRCLE,"Bart, this guy's walked the last two batters, and if he walks you, we win the game. Don't swing at anything!"
121117,467,122,691000,Bart Simpson,ON DECK CIRCLE,But I'm on a hot streak.
121118,467,123,694000,Lisa Simpson,ON DECK CIRCLE,Hot streaks are a statistical illusion.
121119,467,124,696000,Bart Simpson,ON DECK CIRCLE,I wish you were a statistical illusion.
121120,467,125,698000,Lisa Simpson,ON DECK CIRCLE,"Well, there's a ninety-seven percent chance I'm not, so do what I say."
121121,467,126,708000,Umpire,ON DECK CIRCLE,Ball one!
121122,467,127,712000,Umpire,ON DECK CIRCLE,Ball two!
121123,467,128,713000,Lisa Simpson,ON DECK CIRCLE,Don't swing.
121125,467,130,717000,Ball,Field,I've ruined your favorite thing!
121128,467,133,719000,Teammates,Field,Bart! Bart! Bart!
121129,467,134,740000,Lisa Simpson,Field,You disobeyed your manager!
121130,467,135,742000,Bart Simpson,Field,So what? We won.
121131,467,136,744000,Teammates,Field,Bart! Bart! Bart!
121132,467,137,746000,Lisa Simpson,Field,"Here's what: you're off the team! Get him outta here, boys."
121133,467,138,751000,Teammates,Field,"Conflicted, conflicted, conflicted."
121135,467,140,767000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,"C'mon, guys. I had to get rid of Bart."
121136,467,141,770000,Nelson Muntz,Luigi's,But he socked a walk-off dinger!
121137,467,142,772000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,That dinger was a fluke! Not that I have to defend myself to you. Managers manage and players play.
121138,467,143,778000,Ralph Wiggum,Luigi's,Do alligators alligate?
121139,467,144,780000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,I don't know... yes.
121140,467,145,781000,Ralph Wiggum,Luigi's,I'm scared.
121142,467,147,786000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here's my uniform, since I won't be needing it any more!"
121143,467,148,790000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo! Underpants dinner!
121144,467,149,791000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No it's not!
121146,467,151,795000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, Lis, I'm glad I'm not playing baseball anymore. I think I'm more interested in soccer!"
121148,467,153,806000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Cut it out! You're upsetting the gravy boat!
121149,467,154,809000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll put a stop to this nonsense!
121151,467,155,813000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, can't you let your brother back on the team? Fly balls and fungoes come and go, but family is forever."
121152,467,156,821000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry Marge, I gotta call bullcrap on that. The '69 Mets will live on forever, but you think anyone cares about Ron Swoboda's wife and kids? Not me -- and, I assume, not Ron Swoboda!"
121153,467,157,832000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What about Bart's feelings?
121154,467,158,834000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boys don't have feelings, they have muscles."
121155,467,159,836000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why do you say such ridiculous things?
121156,467,160,839000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"They sound good in my brain, then my tongue makes not the words sound very good, formally."
121157,467,161,856000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Mama Bear said 'I'm sure Sister Bear will come to her senses.'
121159,467,163,856000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,...Then Pete Rose plowed into his friend Ray Fosse...
121160,467,164,856000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Brother Bear said ""Sister Bear is inconsiderate."""
121161,467,165,856000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,...dislocating Fosse's shoulder in a meaningless game...
121162,467,166,856000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"...He had earned the nickname ""Charlie Hustle..."""
121163,467,167,856000,Ned Flanders,Lisa's Bedroom,"Excuse me! With all this racket, my boys can't get their sixteen hours sleep."
121165,467,169,888000,Lisa Simpson,Little League Field,"...So because of your on-base percentage, Nelson, you're the new leadoff hitter. Questions?"
121166,467,170,892000,Ralph Wiggum,Little League Field,When's Bart coming back?
121167,467,171,894000,Lisa Simpson,Little League Field,He's not! He thought he was better than the laws of probability. Anyone else think he's better than the laws of probability?
121168,467,172,902000,Lisa Simpson,Little League Field,"Well, you're not!"
121170,467,174,904000,Baseball Announcer,BROADCASTERS' BOOTH,"With me here in the booth is brand new color commentator and former Isotots great, Bart Simpson! Bart, do you miss the game?"
121171,467,175,912000,Bart Simpson,BROADCASTERS' BOOTH,"No, no, no, no. I got a lot goin' on."
121172,467,176,915000,Baseball Announcer,BROADCASTERS' BOOTH,I'm sure you do.
121173,467,177,917000,Baseball Announcer,BROADCASTERS' BOOTH,Milhouse hits a frozen rope just past the diving shortstop...
121174,467,178,921000,Baseball Announcer,BROADCASTERS' BOOTH,There's a play at the plate! He's... safe! And that's all she wrote! It's a triumph of number-crunching over the human spirit! And it's about time!
121177,467,181,948000,Lisa Simpson,STADIUM,"Look, Dad! ""Players and Coaches' Entrance!"""
121087,467,182,950000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Hey, let's hold hands and skip inside!"
121178,467,183,956000,Bart Simpson,STADIUM,"Well, let's go to the bleachers. I brought an air horn and a megaphone."
121179,467,184,961000,Bart Simpson,STADIUM,Testing...
121180,467,185,965000,Marge Simpson,STADIUM,"Actually, I'm taking you on a ""special little guy super happy fun"" day!"
121181,467,186,970000,Bart Simpson,STADIUM,Are you taking me to the dentist?
121182,467,187,972000,Marge Simpson,STADIUM,You're not going to the dentist!
121185,467,190,978000,Bart Simpson,Amusement Park,"Y'know Mom, after only seven hours in this amusement park, I'm finally enjoying myself. I'm actually starting to forget about..."
121186,467,191,985000,Marge Simpson,Amusement Park,Lisa? She wants to talk to you.
121187,467,192,988000,Bart Simpson,Amusement Park,Hey Lis.
121188,467,193,989000,Lisa Simpson,Amusement Park,I need you! Ralph can't play 'cause he's too juiced.
121189,467,194,994000,Ralph Wiggum,Amusement Park,I didn't know what I was putting into my body.
121190,467,195,999000,Bart Simpson,Amusement Park,"Sorry sis, I've moved on, and my days of listening to my manager are over."
121191,467,196,1003000,Mike Scioscia,Amusement Park,"Son, you should always listen to your manager."
121192,467,197,1006000,Marge Simpson,Amusement Park,Mike Scioscia! Didn't you get radiation poisoning working at the Springfield Nuclear Plant?
121193,467,198,1012000,Mike Scioscia,Amusement Park,I sure did -- and it gave me super-managing powers! I also demagnetize credit cards.
121194,467,199,1018000,Mike Scioscia,Amusement Park,"Bart, I have two pieces of advice. First, keep your arms in the damn car."
121195,467,200,1024000,Mike Scioscia,Amusement Park,"Secondly, I don't care if your manager is your sister, Dick Drago's mustache, or Oscar Gamble's afro! A player should always listen to his skipper -- that's how I got these three World Series rings."
121196,467,201,1037000,Mike Scioscia,Amusement Park,"Never mind that -- I'll win more. But you owe it to your sister, and the great game of baseball-- wacky face for the camera!"
121197,467,202,1044000,Mike Scioscia,Amusement Park,"...to go back and help your team. Now, who wants funnel cake?"
121198,467,203,1049000,Mike Scioscia,Amusement Park,"You got some great raw ingredients, kid. Open up your stance a little. Wrong, wrong, wrong!"
121199,467,204,1056000,Mike Scioscia,Amusement Park,That's okay. You just didn't have it today.
121200,467,205,1059000,Funnel Cake Man,Amusement Park,Not everything's baseball.
121201,467,206,1061000,Mike Scioscia,Amusement Park,Yes it is.
121203,467,208,1065000,Lisa Simpson,Capital City Stadium,What am I gonna do? I need a pinch-runner with speed!
121204,467,209,1070000,Milhouse Van Houten,Capital City Stadium,How about a benchwarmer who's afraid of puppets?
121205,467,210,1073000,Bart Simpson,Capital City Stadium,Did someone order a happy ending?
121206,467,211,1076000,Lisa Simpson,Capital City Stadium,Bart!
121207,467,212,1078000,Lisa Simpson,Capital City Stadium,Now get out there a kick a field goal! Kidding!
121209,467,214,1085000,Baseball Announcer,Capital City,"...and that's why anyone who invested with Lenny Dykstra really should call that number. Lawyers are standing by. Simpson on first... taking a big lead... oh, looks like he's gonna swipe the bag."
121210,467,215,1096000,Lisa Simpson,Capital City,"No! No, don't steal!"
121212,467,217,1110000,Baseball Announcer,Capital City,And there he goes!
121213,467,218,1119000,Baseball Announcer,Capital City,He's stealing third!...
121214,467,219,1122000,Lisa Simpson,Capital City,"Okay, okay, he's stolen third. But surely that's the limit of his cockiness..."
121215,467,220,1127000,Bart Simpson,Capital City,I'm stealing home!
121216,467,221,1129000,Lisa Simpson,Capital City,No! The computer says it's statistically impossible!
121217,467,222,1134000,C. Montgomery Burns,Capital City,Bah! Computers! They'll never replace my Huffnagle autocollator!
121218,467,223,1138000,C. Montgomery Burns,Capital City,"Crank it, Smithers! Crank it!"
121219,467,224,1139000,Waylon Smithers,Capital City,"It's, uh, seizing up, sir."
121220,467,225,1141000,C. Montgomery Burns,Capital City,"Yes, well apply more goose grease!"
121221,467,226,1146000,Lisa Simpson,Capital City,"Stealing home. It's so impossible. It's against every sensible instinct... it's, it's..."
121222,467,227,1160000,Lisa Simpson,Capital City,"It's the most exciting play in baseball! Go, Bart!"
121223,467,228,1167000,Homer Simpson,Capital City,"If he makes it, that's my son!"
121224,467,229,1176000,Umpire,Capital City,Yer out!
121226,467,231,1176000,Baseball Announcer,Capital City,"The Isotots lose! Now to begin my off-season job: follow-home robberies. I'll see you in the parking lot, but you won't see me, until it's too late."
121227,467,232,1191000,Homer Simpson,Capital City,You stink!
121228,467,233,1191000,Bart Simpson,Capital City,Did I make it?
121229,467,234,1197000,Lisa Simpson,Capital City,"No. But you did do something. You made me love baseball. Not as a collection of numbers, but as an unpredictable, passionate game beaten in excitement only by every other sport."
121230,467,235,1211000,Bart Simpson,Capital City,I guess your computer was right.
121231,467,236,1213000,Lisa Simpson,Capital City,"Maybe it was, but according to my calculations, you're a great brother fifty-one percent of the time."
121232,467,237,1219000,Bart Simpson,Capital City,"And according to my gut, you're okay too."
121233,467,238,1222000,Lisa Simpson,Capital City,Can you put a number on it?
121234,467,239,1227000,Lisa Simpson,Capital City,Awww...
121235,467,240,1232000,Teammates,Capital City,Conflict resolved! Conflict resolved! Conflict resolved!
