80903,315,51,259000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't tell me you're actually going.
80905,315,52,261000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I don't know what this is, but sometimes you've just gotta go with your gut."
80906,315,53,265000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You always go with your gut. This time, why don't you listen to your brain?"
80907,315,54,269000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, I will."
80908,315,55,274000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's why I don't listen to my brain. And away we go!

80911,315,58,289000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
80912,315,59,290000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You have no choice.
80914,315,61,291000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,There's coffee in the thermos.
80916,315,63,299000,Bart Simpson,Overpass,This is boring. Can't we go home? This overpass smells like urine.

80931,315,78,332000,Homer Simpson,Overpass,"Mom? You're back. Just like you were back before, then you left me again. I love you so much, but it's so hard for me to trust you. Oh, what the heck."
80932,315,79,344000,Homer Simpson,Overpass,"Give me a hug, you."
80933,315,80,345000,Mona Simpson,Overpass,"Homer, you're hugging a bum."
80934,315,81,347000,Homer Simpson,Overpass,I know! I'm working my way up to you.
80935,315,82,349000,Bum,Overpass,Hey! Give me back my wine!
80937,315,84,357000,Mona Simpson,Diner,"Sorry about all the cloak and dagger Homer, but the government is still after me for what I did in the sixties. They're probably tapping your phones and reading your mail."
80938,315,85,368000,Homer Simpson,Diner,I think the government has better things to do than to read my mail.
80942,315,87,371000,Fbi Agent,F.B.I. Headquarters,"Most people write letters to movie stars. This Simpson guy writes to movies. ""Dear Die Hard, you rock. Especially when that guy was on the roof. P.S. Do you know Mad Max?"""

80945,315,90,392000,Homer Simpson,Diner,"You sure know me, Mom."
80946,315,91,394000,Mona Simpson,Diner,Pizza was the first food he choked on.
80947,315,92,397000,Bart Simpson,Diner,"Aww. So, why are you back in town?"
80948,315,93,400000,Mona Simpson,Diner,"I saw this macaroni pencil-holder Homer made me, and I realized how much I missed him."
80949,315,94,406000,Homer Simpson,Diner,I made this when I was five. I had to do something -- your pencils were all over the place.
80950,315,95,412000,Mona Simpson,Diner,"Hey, it was the sixties."
80952,315,97,417000,Lou,Diner,Is that fugitive radical Mona Simpson?
80953,315,98,420000,Chief Wiggum,Diner,"Yeah, and that's Tokyo Rose moppin' the floor."
80954,315,99,422000,Asian Woman,Diner,"Hey Joe, your girlfriend sleeps with Tyrone Power."
80955,315,100,427000,Eddie,Diner,"Chief, I think we've got a match here."
80956,315,101,430000,Chief Wiggum,Diner,"All right, let's check it out. But if you're wrong, you and Lou have to kiss each other."
80957,315,102,434000,Lou,Diner,"Chief, I checked with the union. You can only do that once."
80958,315,103,436000,Chief Wiggum,Diner,Oh.
80959,315,104,440000,Homer Simpson,Diner,"Cora, is there a back way outta here?"
80960,315,105,442000,Cora,Diner,Not for someone who tips nine per cent.
80961,315,106,445000,Homer Simpson,Diner,Fine.
80962,315,107,446000,Cora,Diner,"Right through there, Santa Claus."
80964,315,109,454000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Mom, I swear on your eventual grave I will never, ever, let the police get their hands on you. Uh-oh."
80967,315,112,465000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"You guys are damn lucky. All you destroyed were bricks, mortar and attorneys."
80968,315,113,470000,Attorney,Springfield Police Station,Remember me... as a drain on society.
80969,315,114,484000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Police Station,"Captured '60s radical Mona J. Simpson goes on trial today on decades-old charges of sabotaging the C. Montgomery Burns Germ Warfare Lab. For those of you too young to remember the sixties, here's our stock montage."
80970,315,115,514000,John Wayne,Springfield Police Station,You bet your sweet bippy.
80940,315,116,518000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Police Station,"What a shrill, pointless decade."
80972,315,117,520000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Police Station,"During her years on the lam, Simpson led an exemplary life, working as a crossing guard, oral historian, reader for the blind, listener for the deaf, and reacher for the short."
80973,315,118,531000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Police Station,"Yet, local villain Montgomery Burns -- seen here terrorizing children in a nineteenth-century woodcut--"
80974,315,119,536000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Police Station,--insists that she stand trial.
80975,315,120,538000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Police Station,"Kent, I want everyone in your radio picture audience to know that this woman is a menace to decent people and germ warriors everywhere."
80976,315,121,548000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Police Station,End communication.
80979,315,124,550000,Gil Gunderson,Courtroom,"Now Lisa, would you agree that your grandmother is a sweet, harmless woman who could hardly be considered a menace to society?"
80980,315,125,558000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,"Oh, definitely. If you ask me, she's far less dangerous than Bart."
80981,315,126,562000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,"If it please the court, I would like to go ape on my sister."
80982,315,127,565000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,I object!
80983,315,128,566000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,"Judge, sidebar?"
80984,315,129,567000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,Very well.
80985,315,130,568000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,"Judge, do you have a little sister?"
80986,315,131,570000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,Yes. She used to call me Fatty-boomalatty. I'll allow an Indian burn.
80987,315,132,576000,Bart Simpson,Courtroom,"Thank you, your honor."
80988,315,133,578000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,Ow!
80989,315,134,579000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"Your honor, can you please focus on the case at hand?"
80990,315,135,582000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"I'm sorry, my wife left me this morning."
80991,315,136,584000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Now, I'm not a man who's good with words..."
80992,315,137,597000,Gil Gunderson,Courtroom,"You gotta say somethin', she's lookin' at twenty years. And my legal license expires in fifteen minutes."
80993,315,138,603000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"I barely know my mother. And every time I see her, she's taken away again. And when a man doesn't have his mother, he winds up like me."
80994,315,139,614000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"I mean, I'm due back in this same courtroom three times today. Hell, I torched a blood bank. One cookie my ass! Please, please, give me back my mommy."
80995,315,140,629000,Sideshow Mel,Courtroom,"Your honor, there is no way we can find this defendant guilty."
80996,315,141,635000,Sideshow Mel,Courtroom,Although I will miss the jury room cold cuts. And the Quality Inn more than lived up to its name.
80997,315,142,641000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,Case dismissed!
80998,315,144,643000,Sideshow Mel,Courtroom,"Business center, workout room, an honor bar I was honored to use..."
80999,315,145,648000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,That's enough.
81000,315,146,649000,Sideshow Mel,Courtroom,"And Peggy in the coffee shop, what a pistol. A mere nod in her direction and the refill was in the mug."
81001,315,147,657000,Sideshow Mel,Courtroom,The jets in the whirlpool anticipated my every move. When it was working. And three dollars for a local call? They should be the ones on trial!
81002,315,148,673000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Oh Mom, I'm so happy! I never want to let you go!"
81003,315,149,678000,Snake Jailbird,Courtroom,"Mom, I never want to let you go."
81004,315,150,681000,Elderly Woman,Courtroom,I'm not your mother.
81005,315,151,683000,Snake Jailbird,Courtroom,"Look, lady. Just keep hugging 'til we get to Mexico."
81006,315,152,687000,Seymour Skinner,Courtroom,Mother...
81007,315,153,688000,Agnes Skinner,Courtroom,Go hug your floozy.
81008,315,154,690000,Seymour Skinner,Courtroom,"Mother, she's right here."
81009,315,155,692000,Agnes Skinner,Courtroom,She knows I'm kidding. I'm not kidding.
81010,315,156,697000,C. Montgomery Burns,Courtroom,"Curse that ""Groovy Granny""! This is America. Justice should favor the rich!"
81011,315,157,701000,Waylon Smithers,Courtroom,"Uh, Sir maybe you could use a few huffs from your ether bottle."
81012,315,158,707000,C. Montgomery Burns,Courtroom,"Oh man, that's good ""E."""
81013,315,159,707000,Mona Simpson,Courtroom,"Well, now that I'm free, I intend to be a better mother to my son."
81014,315,160,714000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Woo hoo! I can be a little boy again!
81015,315,161,718000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,A boy who gets some on the side.
81016,315,162,720000,Grampa Simpson,Courtroom,"Oh, baby! Now you're free to come back to me!"
81017,315,163,725000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Dad, you testified against her!"
81018,315,164,727000,Grampa Simpson,Courtroom,I read a book that said women like jerks.
81019,315,165,751000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Look Mom, look! I'm riding by myself!"
81023,315,169,767000,Mona Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, this really isn't necessary."
81024,315,170,769000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You weren't around for the birth of your grandson, and I want you to see it."
81025,315,171,774000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wah, wah, wah. Ain't I cute? You owe me a dirt bike."
81027,315,173,778000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey guys, I brought my Mom."
81028,315,174,781000,Mona Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Lenny Leonard? I haven't seen you since you were this high.
81029,315,175,785000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,I can jump off the high dive!
81030,315,176,786000,Mona Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Carl Carlson, I remember when you, Lenny and Stevie MacGregor were like the Three Musketeers."
81031,315,177,794000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, poor Stevie. They never found his head."
81032,315,178,797000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Mrs. Simpson, when you took off, you left a hole in Homer's heart that he's been trying to fill with alcohol for twenty years... God bless ya."
81035,315,181,808000,Homer Simpson,OTHER ROOM,"Welcome to your room, Mom. I want you to stay here forever."
81036,315,182,812000,Mona Simpson,OTHER ROOM,"Homer, it's perfect."
81037,315,183,814000,Lisa Simpson,OTHER ROOM,Doesn't this armoire belong to Mr. Flanders?
81038,315,184,819000,Marge Simpson,OTHER ROOM,You stole this entire room from Ned Flanders' house!
81039,315,185,823000,Ned Flanders,OTHER ROOM,"Oh well, you snooze you lose. But uh, can I have my photo albums back?"
81040,315,186,828000,Homer Simpson,OTHER ROOM,Now get out of my house.
81042,315,188,831000,C. Montgomery Burns,STATE COLLEGE,"And so in the spirit of fence-mending and grudge-not-bearing, I hereby rename the Burns Germ Warfare Lab The Grandma Simpson Peace Museum and Kid-teractive Learnatorium."
81044,315,190,848000,C. Montgomery Burns,STATE COLLEGE,"Grandma Simpson, will you be the first to sign the museum's guest book?"
81045,315,191,853000,Mona Simpson,STATE COLLEGE,"It'd be a real pleasure. You know, when I was on the run, I always had to sign a fake name, like when I visited a state park..."
81046,315,192,862000,C. Montgomery Burns,STATE COLLEGE,Indeed. How about a national park?
81047,315,193,865000,Mona Simpson,STATE COLLEGE,Why yes.
81048,315,194,867000,C. Montgomery Burns,STATE COLLEGE,"I've got it all on this dictabelt. Move in, boys!"
81049,315,195,874000,Mona Simpson,STATE COLLEGE,What's going on?
81050,315,196,875000,C. Montgomery Burns,STATE COLLEGE,Supplying false information on a national park register is a federal offense...
81051,315,197,875000,C. Montgomery Burns,STATE COLLEGE,"Which you've committed at every national park, from Acadia to Zion. You're going away for a long time, Mrs. Simpson. Or should I call you..."
81052,315,198,890000,C. Montgomery Burns,STATE COLLEGE,Anita Bong-hitt?
81053,315,199,893000,Homer Simpson,STATE COLLEGE,No! I can't lose my mother again! Don't take her away!
81055,315,201,907000,Federal Agent,FEDERAL AGENTS' CAR,"Stop messing with him, the man lost his mother."
81056,315,202,910000,Federal Agent,FEDERAL AGENTS' CAR,Just one more time.
81057,315,203,911000,Federal Agent,FEDERAL AGENTS' CAR,Okay. It is pretty funny.
81059,315,208,949000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I'm just as sad as you are. What happened to Grandma is an outrage."
81060,315,209,953000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How do you figure?
81061,315,210,954000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,She was acquitted. Then they put her back in jail on a technicality.
81062,315,211,958000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're right. People should only be let out of jail on technicalities.
81063,315,212,962000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, they're transferring Grandma to a federal prison tomorrow. I say we hit 'em where they live... with a candlelight vigil!"
81064,315,213,969000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Candlepin bowling? That's a great idea. We'll play right after I break your grandmother out of prison.
81066,315,215,979000,Mona Simpson,Prison Bus,I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON...
81067,315,216,982000,Mona Simpson,Prison Bus,Now just the innocent!
81068,315,217,984000,Female Prisoners,Prison Bus,I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON...
81069,315,218,987000,Mona Simpson,Prison Bus,Now just the really innocent!
81072,315,221,996000,Second Prisoner,Prison Bus,I hope this bus ride never ends. 'Cause I'm gettin' executed when I get off.
81074,315,223,1002000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,"Okay, boy. Flip through those highway warnings 'til we find one that'll stop that bus."
81075,315,224,1009000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,Next.
81076,315,225,1011000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,Pass.
