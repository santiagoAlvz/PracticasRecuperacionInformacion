34116,155,44,255000,Homer Simpson,MODEL HOME,Thank you! Come again!
34118,155,46,257000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We'll never sell this rotten dump.

34163,155,93,387000,Man,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,"I am here to welcome you on behalf of the President of the Globex Corporation, me. Try the papayas. They're juicy and full of papayine. Makes you strong.

34164,155,94,403000,Homer Simpson,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,Wow! My boss!
34165,155,95,405000,Hank Scorpio,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,Don't call me that word. I don't like things that elevate me above the other people. I'm just like you.
34166,155,96,410000,Hank Scorpio,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,"Aw sure, I come later in the day, I get paid a lot more and I take longer vacations. But I don't like the word ""boss"". Hey, look at my feet."
34167,155,97,410000,Homer Simpson,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,Okay...
34168,155,98,410000,Hank Scorpio,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,You like those moccasins? Look in your closet -- there's a pair for you. Don't like 'em? Then neither do I! Get the hell outta here!

34170,155,100,425000,Homer Simpson,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,"Yes, once."
34171,155,101,426000,Marge Simpson,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,"Mr. Scorpio, this house is almost too good for us. I keep expecting to get the bum's rush."
34172,155,102,432000,Hank Scorpio,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,"We don't have bums in our town, Marge. And if we did, they wouldn't rush; they'd be allowed to go at their own pace. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of a Fun Run."
34173,155,103,439000,Hank Scorpio,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,"See you at work tomorrow! Although I don't really like to call it ""work""!"
34174,155,104,446000,Homer Simpson,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,Wowww.
34175,155,105,451000,Marge Simpson,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,"Okay, the oven is cleaning itself, the autovac's on dirt patrol... Annnd Maggie's enjoying her Swingamajig..."
34176,155,106,470000,Marge Simpson,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,"I can't believe it! I've done all my housework and it's only 9:30! Well, better go upstairs and make sure the beds are still made."
34178,155,108,486000,Hank Scorpio,Globex Corporation,"You will notice, my new best friend, that we are pretty casual around here."
34179,155,109,490000,Homer Simpson,Globex Corporation,"Yes sir, I will notice that. Very casual, Mr. Scorpion."
34180,155,110,494000,Hank Scorpio,Globex Corporation,"Don't call me Mr. Scorpion. It's Mr. Scorpi-o. But don't call me that, either. Call me Hank. Uh, say, before we continue our tour, would you mind hanging my coat up on the wall, please?"
34182,155,112,508000,Hank Scorpio,Globex Corporation,"Relax, Homer. At Globex, we don't believe in walls. Matter of fact, I didn't even give you my coat."
34183,155,113,517000,Homer Simpson,Globex Corporation,Wow.
34185,155,115,519000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"Having a place like this has always been my dream, Homer. What's your dream?"
34186,155,116,523000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Uh... to work for you?
34187,155,117,524000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"Don't do that. My butt is for sitting, not for kissing. Now you tell me the truth -- What's your real dream? Your real dream?"
34188,155,118,531000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Um... Someday I'd like to own the Dallas Cowboys.
34189,155,119,535000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,I bet people laughed at you when you told them that dream.
34190,155,120,537000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Yeah.
34191,155,121,537000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"Homer, don't give up. They laughed at me the first time I wore jeans with a sport coat. I was the first wealthy man in America to ever do that. Now they all do it!... Didja ever hear of Mike Milken?"
34192,155,122,548000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Ye... No.
34194,155,124,552000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"Now Homer, these gentlemen here will be your eyes and your ears and, should the need arise, they'll fill in for any other part of your body. Your job will be to manage and motivate them. Give them the benefit of your years of experience."
34195,155,125,562000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Don't worry. That won't take long.
34196,155,126,564000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,The key to motivation is trust. Lemme show you what I mean.
34197,155,127,568000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,I want you to close your eyes and fall backwards and I'll catch you. That's gonna show you what trust is all about. Ready?
34198,155,128,572000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,All right.
34199,155,129,572000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,3... 2....
34200,155,130,575000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,One second... Hello?
34201,155,131,576000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Doh!
34202,155,132,577000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"Oh my God, that guy's on the floor. Uh, that was a phone call. Don't chalk that up to mistrust, now."
34206,155,133,581000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"Yes? What happened?... When did that happen?... How much of it?... Oh, my goodness, I'll be right up! Homer, I've got to go upstairs, there's a problem. Somebody ate part of my lunch. I'm gonna leave everything to you. We're on a tight schedule; you keep them motivated."
34207,155,134,598000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Are you guys working?
34208,155,135,600000,Worker #1,GLOBEX,"Yes sir, Mr. Simpson."
34209,155,136,602000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,"Could you, um... work any harder than this?"
34210,155,137,605000,Worker #1,GLOBEX,"Sure thing, boss."
34211,155,138,608000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,"Hey, call me Homer."
34215,155,142,620000,Student In Sunglasses,Cypress Creek Elementary School,You got a fresh sound. It'll play well at this school.
34216,155,143,624000,Milhouse,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"Hey, Bart, do you have a best friend yet? 'Cause I've been looking for someone to boss me around..."
34217,155,144,631000,Mr. Doyle,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"Okay, folks, let's do it to it. Grammar, that is. Uh, everybody write down this sentence and circle the nouns."
34218,155,145,642000,Mr. Doyle,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"Bart, as the newest addition to our menagerie, you have the honors."
34219,155,146,646000,Bart Simpson,Cypress Creek Elementary School,Um... Uh...
34220,155,147,648000,Mr. Doyle,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"Well, let's start by reading the sentence..."
34221,155,148,651000,Bart Simpson,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"Two, wintim amd Jawwy wirt..."
34223,155,150,651000,Mr. Doyle,Hallway Outside the Classroom,"So, you never learned cursive?"
34224,155,151,665000,Bart Simpson,Hallway Outside the Classroom,"Um, well, I know hell and damn and bi--"
34225,155,152,668000,Mr. Doyle,Hallway Outside the Classroom,Cursive handwriting. Script. Do you know the multiplication tables? Long division?
34226,155,153,673000,Bart Simpson,Hallway Outside the Classroom,I know of them.
34227,155,154,676000,Mr. Doyle,Hallway Outside the Classroom,"You know, Bart, I think you'd profit from a more remedial environment. I'm sure you'll feel right at home in... The ""Leg-Up"" Program."
34230,155,157,704000,Marge Simpson,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,Guess I can't complain. Everything's perfect here.
34232,155,159,718000,Bart Simpson,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"So, what are you in for?"
34233,155,160,720000,Leg-up Kid,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"I moved here from Canada and they think I'm slow, eh?"
34203,155,161,726000,2nd Leg-up Kid,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"I fell off the jungle gym, and when I woke up, I was in here."
34204,155,162,730000,3RD LEG-UP KID,Cypress Creek Elementary School,I start fires!
34235,155,163,733000,Leg-up Teacher,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"Okay. Now everyone take out your safety pencil and a circle of paper. This week I hope we can finish our work on the letter ""A."""
34236,155,164,738000,Bart Simpson,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"Let me get this straight. We're behind the rest of our class, and we're going to catch up to them by going slower than they are?"
34238,155,166,752000,Leg-up Teacher,Cypress Creek Elementary School,Stop it! Stop it! Warren! Melvin! Gary! Dot! Gordy!
34239,155,167,755000,Bart Simpson,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"Look, lady, I'm s'posed to be in the fourth grade."
34240,155,168,758000,Leg-up Teacher,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"Sounds to me like someone's got a case of the ""spose'das."""
34242,155,170,758000,Leg-up Teacher,Cypress Creek Elementary School,Warren!
34243,155,171,773000,Lisa Simpson,Cypress Creek Elementary School,Wildflowers! We don't have you in Springfield!
34244,155,172,779000,Lisa Simpson,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"Hello, Mr. Chipmunk! You're a Northern Reticulated Chipmunk! Yes, you are! You are so reticulated!"
34245,155,173,788000,Lisa Simpson,Cypress Creek Elementary School,"Hi, Mrs. Owl! You're out kind of early!"
34248,155,176,799000,Homer Simpson,Cypress Creek,"Mr. Scorpio says productivity is up 2%, and it's all because of my motivational techniques, like donuts and the possibility of more donuts to come."
34249,155,177,810000,Marge Simpson,Cypress Creek,"I knew you'd do well, Homer."
34250,155,178,812000,Bart Simpson,Cypress Creek,"Sports collectibles! Wow, a baseball made out of Secretariat!"
34251,155,179,820000,Homer Simpson,Cypress Creek,"Tom Landry's hat! And it's autographed! ""To Berman's Dry Cleaning, Best Wishes, Tom Landry."""
34252,155,180,825000,Bart Simpson,Cypress Creek,Why don't you buy it?
34253,155,181,830000,Homer Simpson,Cypress Creek,I can't buy that. Only management type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. Guys like me? I'm a guy like me!
34255,155,183,839000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,"All right, team, it's the fourth quarter. The Lord gave us the atoms, and it's up to us to make 'em dance!"
34256,155,184,847000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,"Hey, if Tom Landry's hat doesn't motivate you, then I should just quit right now."
34257,155,185,852000,Worker #2,GLOBEX,"I'm sorry, we're just a little tired, sir. We've been pushing ourselves real hard to get the reactor on-line."
34258,155,186,856000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,"Tired, eh? What you guys need... is hammocks."
34259,155,187,865000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"Oh, hi, Homer! What can I do for you?"
34261,155,188,868000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,"Sir, I need to know where I can get some business hammocks."
34262,155,189,870000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"Hammocks? My goodness, what an idea. Why didn't I think of that? Hammocks! Homer, there are four places: There's the ""Hammock Hut""; that's on Third..."
34263,155,190,877000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Uh-huh.
34264,155,191,879000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"There's ""Hammocks-R-Us""..."
34265,155,192,879000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Got it...

34267,155,194,881000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Umm-hmmm...
34268,155,195,883000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,That's on Third.
34269,155,196,883000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Yes...
34270,155,197,884000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot""..."
34271,155,198,884000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Right...
34272,155,199,886000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"That might... Matter of fact, they're all in the same complex. It's the Hammock Complex, down on Third?"
34273,155,200,890000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,"Oh, the Hammock District."
34274,155,201,891000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,That's right.

34337,155,263,1149000,Homer Simpson,NEW SIMPSON HOUSE,"What?! We've got it great here. And for the first time in my life, I'm actually good at my job. My team is way ahead of the weather machine and germ warfare divisions."

34352,155,278,1215000,Homer Simpson,GLOBEX,Nothing big. It's just a lot of little things.
34353,155,279,1217000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"Well, you can't argue with the little things. It's the little things that make up life."

34358,155,285,1235000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"I've never had to call my own company. Someone will tell you upstairs. But Homer, on your way out, if you want to kill somebody, it would help me a lot."
34359,155,286,1252000,Hank Scorpio,GLOBEX,"Hey Homer, you're missing out on some fun!"
