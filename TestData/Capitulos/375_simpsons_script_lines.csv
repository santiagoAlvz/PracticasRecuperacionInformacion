97300,375,43,278000,Seymour Skinner,Theater,"Well, of course you did. You are a girl."
97302,375,45,282000,Seymour Skinner,Theater,"No, all I meant was, from what I've seen, boys are better at math, science... the real subjects. There, that should put the matter behind us."
97304,375,47,293000,Juliana Krellner,Theater,"Calm down, calm down. I'm sure Principal Skinner didn't mean girls are inherently inferior."

97326,375,68,381000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, no... of course not! Women are unique in every way!"
97327,375,69,384000,Lindsay Naegle,Springfield Elementary School,Now he's saying women and men aren't equal!
97328,375,70,386000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"No, no, no. It's the differences -- of which there are none -- that make the sameness... exceptional. Just tell me what to say!"
97329,375,71,399000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh dear. Attention, students. Due to nervous exhaustion and diarrhea of the mouth..."

97333,375,75,421000,Principal Upfoot,Springfield Elementary School,"For too long, there's been an anti-woman bias in math. Boys are aggressive, obnoxious, and never let us be heard. From now on, I am splitting the school in two -- separating the boys and the girls forever!"
97334,375,77,436000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"You heard your principal. Girls on the left, boys on the right."

97340,375,83,468000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,They're gonna divide the school in two?
97341,375,84,470000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, one for boys and one for girls."
97342,375,85,472000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"It is gonna be awesome! Now I can walk down the hall with ""Bart Junior"" hangin' out. Isn't that right, Bart Junior?"
97344,375,87,482000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,All this hoo-haw about girls and math is silly. Women are as smart as men.
97345,375,88,487000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why, a woman invented liquid paper."
97346,375,89,490000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you know what a man invented? Actual paper."
97347,375,90,493000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, a woman also invented the windshield wiper."

97349,375,92,500000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Um... I-I think a woman came up with nylon stockings. I mean, probably. We certainly use them."

97352,375,95,516000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Pinball machines, the Renaissance..."
97354,375,97,518000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, why did women invent sleeping on the couch?"
97356,375,99,527000,Otto Mann,Springfield Elementary School,"Girls' entrance. Have an empowering day, my pony-loving leaders of tomorrow."
97357,375,100,536000,Otto Mann,Springfield Elementary School,"All right, I'm going to open this cage, but no biting."
97358,375,101,540000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,You're not the boss of my teeth!
97360,375,103,548000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY GIRLS' SIDE,"It's so beautiful. Ooh, paintings by female artists! Frida Kahlo, Georgia O'Keefe..."

97365,375,109,576000,Lisa Simpson,CLASSROOM,Yes.
97366,375,110,579000,Principal Upfoot,CLASSROOM,"How do numbers make you feel? What does a plus sign smell like? Is the number seven odd, or just different?"
97367,375,111,589000,Lisa Simpson,CLASSROOM,Are we gonna do any actual math problems?
97368,375,112,592000,Principal Upfoot,CLASSROOM,"""Problems."" That's how men see math, something to be attacked, to be ""figured out."""
97369,375,113,595000,Lisa Simpson,CLASSROOM,"But... isn't it? I mean, confidence building can't replace real learning!"
97370,375,114,603000,Principal Upfoot,CLASSROOM,"Uh oh, Lisa. Sounds like you're trying to derail our ""self-esteem engine."" Let's sing it back on the tracks!"
97371,375,115,611000,Girls,CLASSROOM,THE BEST THING I CAN EVER BE / IS TO BE OKAY WITH ME! / ME!
97373,375,117,629000,Lisa Simpson,GIRLS' SCHOOL,"Okay, boys' school -- I need a challenge!"
97375,375,119,636000,Lisa Simpson,BOYS' SCHOOL,A mental challenge.
97376,375,120,651000,Mr. Pierce,BOYS' SCHOOL,"Now boys, who can tell me the volume of this snowman? Anyone?"
97377,375,121,656000,Martin Prince,BOYS' SCHOOL,Just add the volume of the spheres. We know the radii.
97378,375,122,661000,Lisa Simpson,BOYS' SCHOOL,"He forgot the volume of the carrot nose -- one-third base times height! Oh math, I have missed you!"
97379,375,123,668000,Seymour Skinner,BOYS' SCHOOL,No girls allowed!
97380,375,124,670000,Lisa Simpson,BOYS' SCHOOL,Principal Skinner?
97381,375,125,671000,Seymour Skinner,BOYS' SCHOOL,It's Groundskeeper Skinner now.
97382,375,126,673000,Groundskeeper Willie,BOYS' SCHOOL,"Assistant Groundskeeper, ya puke!"
97383,375,127,676000,Lisa Simpson,BOYS' SCHOOL,"Assistant Groundskeeper Skinner, don't you think it's wrong that I can't get the best math education because I'm a girl?"
97384,375,128,683000,Assistant G.K. Skinner,BOYS' SCHOOL,I don't have any opinions anymore. All I know is that no one is better than anyone else and everyone is the best at everything.
97385,375,129,689000,Groundskeeper Willie,BOYS' SCHOOL,"Not you, you're the worst! Now get poisonin' those squirrels!"
97386,375,130,700000,Assistant G.K. Skinner,BOYS' SCHOOL,"Please, be reasonable. I'm sure we can..."
97388,375,132,704000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, the girls' school is a joke and I'm not allowed to take the boys' math."
97389,375,133,709000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"When I was in school, I loved math. Until..."
148284,375,134,716000,Teenage Homer,Simpson Home,"Hey, Professor Von Hubba-hubba! Wanna hop in my dune bug and erode some beach?"
97421,375,135,721000,Teenage Marge,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'd love to, but I've got my calculus final tomorrow."
148285,375,136,725000,Teenage Homer,Simpson Home,"Come on, baby. The only math you need is you plus me equals forever."
148315,375,137,730000,Teenage Marge,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie."
97391,375,138,734000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Since then I haven't been able to do any of the calculus I've encountered in my daily life. But that's not going to happen to you.
97392,375,139,742000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, what can I do? They won't let me in the boys' school."
97393,375,140,745000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, unless..."
97394,375,141,752000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,There. You're the perfect little he-she.
97395,375,142,756000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I don't think this will fool anybody."
97396,375,143,759000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, who's the rude dude with the attitude?"
97397,375,144,761000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He's one of Bart's friends.
97398,375,145,763000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You seem cool. Wanna catch a movie?
97399,375,146,765000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You never take our kids to the movies.
97400,375,147,768000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Let's not fight in front of my cool new friend.
97402,375,149,787000,Lisa Simpson,BOYS' SCHOOL,What're you playing?
97403,375,150,788000,Bart Simpson,BOYS' SCHOOL,Punch for a punch.

97443,375,190,930000,Lisa Simpson,BOYS' SCHOOL,"Nelson, you're not really angry at me. You're full of rage 'cause your father abandoned you."
97444,375,191,937000,Lisa Simpson,BOYS' SCHOOL,"And because you're poor, so you don't feel like you're good enough."
97445,375,192,941000,Lisa Simpson,BOYS' SCHOOL,"You just want somebody to say ""I love you"". I love you."

97451,375,198,964000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Lis, you missed it. While you were at girls' school, Nelson totally whaled on this dork."
97452,375,199,975000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh my God...
97390,375,200,978000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's right. I'm Toilet.

97454,375,203,988000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not yet. If I do, she'll never let me go to the boys' math class again."
97455,375,204,994000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, no one with a choice should ever have to be a girl. I'll teach you how to be a boy."
97456,375,205,999000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You'd do that for me? That is so sweet.
97457,375,206,1003000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're a boy -- nothing is sweet.
