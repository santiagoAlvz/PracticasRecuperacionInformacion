53992,225,44,281000,Homer Simpson,KBBL,Judges can't win the contest! Booooo!
53993,225,45,284000,Lenny Leonard,KBBL,You have robbed us of our dignity!

54028,225,79,420000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Yeah, I need to housebreak our new police dog. Plus, it couldn't hurt Ralphie to brush up on the fundamentals."
54029,225,80,426000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield,Daddy says I'm this close to living in the yard!
54030,225,81,429000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,Doesn't anybody in this town read?

54042,225,93,477000,Lisa Simpson,Euclid Street,I think so.
54043,225,94,479000,Voice,Euclid Street,"Is that a pie, or a quiche?"
53975,225,95,482000,Lisa Simpson,Euclid Street,A pie.
54013,225,96,485000,Voice,Euclid Street,You may enter.
53809,225,98,489000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,House,"Welcome to Mensa, Lisa."
54044,225,99,491000,Seymour Skinner,House,It's the organization for people with high I.Q.'s.
54045,225,100,494000,Lisa Simpson,House,I know that. It's also a constellation visible only from the southern hemisphere.
54046,225,101,498000,Professor Jonathan Frink,House,She's good. She's very good. ... and she brought a cream pie.
54048,225,103,507000,Lisa Simpson,MENSA HOUSE,"You want me to join Mensa? Oh, that's wonderful. But don't I have to take some sort of I.Q. test?"
54049,225,104,513000,Seymour Skinner,MENSA HOUSE,"No Lisa, you're more than qualified. I've shared all your standardized test scores with the other members."
54050,225,105,518000,Lisa Simpson,MENSA HOUSE,Aren't those supposed to be confidential?
54051,225,106,520000,Seymour Skinner,MENSA HOUSE,"Welcome to Mensa! You've joined such luminaries as cartoonist Mell Lazarus, Geena Davis, and Parade Magazine's Marilyn vos Savant."

54053,225,108,532000,Lisa Simpson,MENSA HOUSE,Wow! I'm so honored you wanted me.
54054,225,109,534000,Female Executive,MENSA HOUSE,"Well, it was your delightfully condescending letter that put you over the top. Lindsey Naegle, Advanced Capital Ventures."
54055,225,110,540000,Lisa Simpson,MENSA HOUSE,Oh. What do you produce?
54056,225,111,542000,Female Executive,MENSA HOUSE,Synergy. And books on how to cheat at bridge.
54057,225,112,544000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,MENSA HOUSE,"Lisa, I think you'll really enjoy it here. Now let's get down to business. Any new palindromes?"
54058,225,113,551000,Comic Book Guy,MENSA HOUSE,"Rise to vote, sir."
54059,225,114,552000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,MENSA HOUSE,"Now, you know the agenda. Palindromes, anagrams, eat Lisa's pie, then voting."
54060,225,115,557000,Lisa Simpson,MENSA HOUSE,"But ""rise to vote sir"" is a palindrome."
54061,225,116,561000,Professor Jonathan Frink,MENSA HOUSE,Well...
54062,225,117,561000,Comic Book Guy,MENSA HOUSE,She's right.
54063,225,118,561000,Female Executive,MENSA HOUSE,Impressive.
54064,225,119,561000,Seymour Skinner,MENSA HOUSE,"Lisa, I think you're going to fit in just fine around here."
54065,225,120,565000,Lisa Simpson,MENSA HOUSE,Wow. Me... fit in.
54067,225,122,577000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, I have a certificate for a free erotic photo session."
54068,225,123,581000,Photographer,Simpson Home,"Oh, yes. Your name?"
54069,225,124,583000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... Geraldo... Simpson.
54070,225,125,586000,Photographer,Simpson Home,"All right, Mr. Simpson..."
54071,225,126,587000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who told you?
54072,225,127,588000,Photographer,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, these photos are perfectly legal. Many husbands use them as a romantic gift for their wives."
54073,225,128,594000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, you're not gonna ask me to pose nude, are ya?"
54074,225,129,597000,Photographer,Simpson Home,"Well, yes, unless you have some issues with revealing your body."
54075,225,130,601000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I don't, but the Block Association seems to. They wanted a ""traditional"" Santa Claus."
54077,225,132,608000,Female Executive,MENSA HOUSE,I can't believe how they're dumbing down the Springfield Library. They've gotten rid of the English literature section and replaced it with a make-your-own-sundae bar.
54078,225,133,617000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,MENSA HOUSE,I heard they got rid of the reference desk to make room for an air hockey table.
54079,225,134,621000,Seymour Skinner,MENSA HOUSE,Even the microfilm?
54080,225,135,622000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,MENSA HOUSE,Even the microfiche.
54081,225,136,625000,Professor Jonathan Frink,MENSA HOUSE,"Oh, God."
54082,225,137,625000,Lisa Simpson,MENSA HOUSE,"My family never talks about library standards. And every time I try to steer the conversation that way, they make me feel like a nerd."
54083,225,138,632000,Comic Book Guy,MENSA HOUSE,We are hardly nerds. Would a nerd wear such an irreverent sweatshirt?
54084,225,139,641000,Lisa Simpson,MENSA HOUSE,"""See DOS. See DOS run. Run DOS run."" Only one person in a million would find that funny."
54085,225,140,644000,Professor Jonathan Frink,MENSA HOUSE,Yes. We call that the Dennis Miller ratio.
54087,225,142,651000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Dad, I just spent the day with the most wonderful people."
54088,225,143,654000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that's great, honey. You tell me everything you can before the commercial's over."
54089,225,144,659000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, for the first time in my life I feel that someone understands..."
54090,225,145,659000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Up-bup-bup-bup.
54091,225,146,665000,Photographer,Simpson Home,"Are you ready in there, Mr. Simpson?"
54092,225,147,666000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you sure you're a fully accredited and bonded pornographer?
54093,225,148,670000,Photographer,Simpson Home,Just come out.
54094,225,149,672000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Please be kind.
54095,225,150,674000,Photographer,Simpson Home,You look fantastic. Let me just adjust my lens here.
54096,225,151,680000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now you're sure this will save my marriage?
54097,225,152,683000,Photographer,Simpson Home,Try not to speak. It's making your body ripple.
54098,225,153,690000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad? Dad? Are you home?
54100,225,155,697000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. I don't care what you're doin'.
54102,225,156,703000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!
54103,225,157,706000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, I think he's gone."
54104,225,158,710000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Let's reschedule.
54106,225,160,713000,Lisa Simpson,Park,This is so cool. I feel like I'm back in the Renaissance.
54107,225,161,716000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Park,"Please stay in character, gentle wench."
54108,225,162,718000,Comic Book Guy,Park,Verily I declare that the Earth revolves around the Sun and not t'other way round.
54109,225,163,723000,Female Executive,Park,"Stop looking down my blouse, Copernicus."
54110,225,164,726000,Comic Book Guy,Park,"Forsooth, mine eyes doth rove of their own accord."
54111,225,165,729000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Park,Zounds! Someone took our gazebo.
54112,225,166,733000,Seymour Skinner,Park,"No, no, that's impossible. We reserved it months ago."
54113,225,167,736000,Lisa Simpson,Park,Someone should stand up to them.
54114,225,168,739000,Seymour Skinner,Park,"Oh, I'll do it."
54115,225,169,742000,Seymour Skinner,Park,"Excuse me, gentlemen. Might I take a peek at your gazebo reservation form?"
54116,225,170,746000,Lenny Leonard,Park,Beat it.
54117,225,171,746000,Seymour Skinner,Park,"Yes, well, we each have a good case..."
54118,225,172,750000,Carl Carlson,Park,"What part of ""beat it"" didn't you understand?"
54119,225,173,751000,Seymour Skinner,Park,"Mmm... I guess it would be the ""it."" I'm not exactly sure to what that refers, it's a..."
54120,225,174,757000,Seymour Skinner,Park,Ow!
54121,225,175,758000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Park,"Ahh, it's hopeless. There are some she-males in gazebo three, a nasty-looking spider in gazebo six, and the less said about gazebo eight, the better."
54122,225,176,768000,Seymour Skinner,Park,"Ah, Chief, thank God you're here. We reserved gazebo seven, and look!"
54123,225,177,772000,Chief Wiggum,Park,"Geez, how many gazebos do you she-males need?"
54124,225,178,777000,Chief Wiggum,Park,"Beer me, boys."
54125,225,179,779000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Park,Why do we live in a town where the smartest have no power and the stupidest run everything? Maybe I should just move back to Alabama.
54126,225,180,786000,Lisa Simpson,Park,"No, we should fix things here. If we put our minds to it, there's no limit to what we can accomplish."
54127,225,181,791000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Park,I think the girl's right.
54128,225,182,799000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Park,It's a good point.
54131,225,185,799000,Seymour Skinner,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"The jig is up, Quimby."
54132,225,186,800000,Mayor Joe Quimby,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Oh God!
54134,225,187,801000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"When you see what's in this report, things are going to change in this town."
54135,225,188,805000,Mayor Joe Quimby,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,I earned that lotto money. I swear.
54136,225,189,816000,Mayor Joe Quimby,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"Faster, you moron!"
54138,225,191,824000,Seymour Skinner,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"Huh. Well, that was unexpected."
54139,225,192,827000,Chief Wiggum,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,What's goin' on? Where's the Mayor?
54140,225,193,829000,Seymour Skinner,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,He skipped town.
54141,225,194,830000,Chief Wiggum,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Really? So who's in charge?
54142,225,195,833000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"Well... that's a good question. Let's, uh, take a quick look at the town charter."
54143,225,196,840000,Female Executive,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Done!
54144,225,197,840000,Comic Book Guy,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Done!

54149,225,202,843000,Seymour Skinner,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"According to the charter, should the Mayor abdicate, a council of learned citizens may rule in his stead."
54150,225,203,849000,Lisa Simpson,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"Well, there's no one more learned than us..."
54151,225,204,851000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,... So I guess we're in charge.
54152,225,205,854000,Chief Wiggum,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Whaaa?! Let me see that.
54153,225,206,857000,Chief Wiggum,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"Let's see here. ""We the people... cruel and unusual... blah, blah, blah... ritual circumcision... yak, yak, yak..."" Aw geez, I'll take your word for it. I guess you are in charge."
54154,225,207,869000,Lisa Simpson,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"With our superior intellects, we could rebuild this city on a foundation of reason and enlightenment. We could turn Springfield into a utopia!"
54155,225,208,876000,Seymour Skinner,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,A new Athens!
54156,225,209,878000,Female Executive,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Or Walden Two!
54157,225,210,879000,Chief Wiggum,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,"Yeah, a real Candyland! Of the mind, the mind. I'll just go now."
54158,225,211,886000,Chief Wiggum,QUIMBY'S OFFICE,Buncha dorks.
