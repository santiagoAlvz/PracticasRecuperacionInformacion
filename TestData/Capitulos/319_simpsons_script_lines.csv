82048,319,93,426000,Krusty the Clown,WALK OF FAME HEADQUARTERS,I just found out I'm not Jewish. I was turned down by all those country clubs for nothing.
82049,319,94,432000,Bart Simpson,WALK OF FAME HEADQUARTERS,"Well, you're still my hero."
82050,319,95,433000,Krusty the Clown,WALK OF FAME HEADQUARTERS,"So what? Everything's changed. I thought I was a self-hating Jew, but it turns out I'm just a plain old anti-Semite!"

82054,319,99,450000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Street,Now I know the reason my life is so empty. I never had a Bar Mitzvah.
82055,319,100,456000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"Cheer up, Krusty. You're a clue in the People Magazine crossword puzzle. What more can a man want?"
82056,319,101,462000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,"Bart, the Bar Mitzvah is the most important event in a Jewish boy's life. It's when he reads from the Torah and becomes a man."
82057,319,102,468000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Street,"The sweet little shiksa's right. Without a Bar Mitzvah, I'm just a boy... with a prostate the size of a goat's head."
82058,319,103,475000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,"Krusty, your dad's a rabbi -- how could you not have had a Bar Mitzvah?"
82061,319,104,479000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Street,"Who knows? I've lived so hard, there's big gaps in my memory. I remember learning to ride a bike, then pretty much nothing 'til right now."
82062,319,105,487000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Why don't we ask your dad?
82063,319,106,488000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Street,"Yeah right, my father will put this in a spiritual-philosophical context."
82064,319,107,494000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Springfield Street,I'll tell you why you didn't have a Bar Mitzvah. It's because you were a putz!
82065,319,108,497000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Springfield Street,Everything is a joke to you. I was afraid you'd make a mockery out of the whole ceremony -- like you're making a mockery outta me right now!
82066,319,109,502000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Street,Maybe I am. But you can't argue with the laughs.
82067,319,110,507000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Street,"Eh, so what? It's not my job to make kids laugh."
82068,319,111,510000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"Yes it is, you're a clown."
82069,319,112,511000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Street,"Without a Bar Mitzvah, I'm nothing!"
82070,319,113,517000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,"Krusty, you can still have your Bar Mitzvah as an adult."
82071,319,114,520000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Street,That'd be great! Are you sure that's Kah-sher?
82072,319,115,524000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,There's nothing in the Talmud that forbids it.
82073,319,116,527000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,How do you know all this stuff?
82074,319,117,528000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,I have a Jewish imaginary friend. Her name is Rachel Cohen and she just got into Brandeis.
82075,319,118,532000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Springfield Street,Wonderful!
82077,319,120,539000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Hey hey kids! I've got a confession to make. Underneath all this plastic surgery, I'm actually a Jew. And from now on I'm embracing my faith."
82079,319,122,551000,Nelson Muntz,Krustylu Studios,What's not to like?
82080,319,123,552000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,And now I'll teach you my traditions the way my people have passed them down for centuries... through animation.
82083,319,126,590000,Itchy,Krustylu Studios,Mouse-l Tov!
82084,319,127,592000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,And that's what I believe in now.

82087,319,130,603000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Dressing Room,"Hey, that's great, but I got a problem."
82088,319,131,604000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Dressing Room,This schedule has me working on Saturdays. That's the Sabbath!
82059,319,132,608000,Freddy,Krusty's Dressing Room,"Well, we could tape two shows on Friday."
82089,319,133,609000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Dressing Room,"Are you nuts?! I can barely get through one show on Friday, even with the ."
82090,319,134,617000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Dressing Room,"Uh, you know. Smelling flowers. Such expensive flowers. Filled with remorse. Anyway, we gotta book a guest host."
82091,319,135,624000,Marge Simpson,Krusty's Dressing Room,"How about Jon Stewart? He's a son, a lover and a pundit rolled into one sexy package."
82092,319,136,632000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Dressing Room,He'd be perfect -- so forget it! I need a guest host so bad he can never replace me. I need someone who's not intelligent...
82094,319,138,639000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Dressing Room,...not good-looking...
82096,319,140,641000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Dressing Room,...and so utterly repellant he...
