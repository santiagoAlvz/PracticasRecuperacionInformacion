141240,543,40,209000,Ned Flanders,CHURCH LOBBY,Not this month! Edna signed us up for a tango class. It was the only way I could avert wine tasting.

141257,543,56,273000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Our school cafeteria is serving G.M.O.s -- genetically-modified organisms.
141258,543,57,280000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"And now in order to thoroughly explore the issue, I'd like to play the first video that came up in my web browser when I typed in ""G.M.O."" plus ""danger"" plus ""question mark""."

141261,543,60,302000,Alarmist Narrator,Springfield Elementary School,"We need look no further back than the ancient Mayans, who cross-bred plants and animals in an unholy experiment in what is now a resort that charges thirty dollars a night to valet park."
141262,543,61,312000,Alarmist Narrator,Springfield Elementary School,"Once you're there, they've gotcha."
141264,543,63,316000,Alarmist Narrator,Springfield Elementary School,The Mayans didn't listen... to themselves.
141265,543,64,319000,Alarmist Narrator,Springfield Elementary School,"Yet, today, we toy with our fate by using retroviruses to create these so-called ""super foods"". Are we doomed to repeat an event that destroyed all human life? The answer is in your mouth."

141268,543,67,345000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Oh my God! It's worse than I thought. Everybody wait here while I do some actual research. Nobody form any opinions while I'm gone.
141269,543,68,353000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, hurry! We have no minds of our own!"
141271,543,70,357000,Lisa Simpson,Auditorium,I say we do not categorically ban genetically modified organisms.
141273,543,72,364000,Crowd,Auditorium,"Well, G.M.O.s are resistant to pests, disease, and drought. It's just possible that G.M.O.s can actually end world hunger!"

141285,543,84,412000,Marge Simpson,MONSARNO LAB,Sounds like that would take a while.
141286,543,85,414000,Monsarno Rep,MONSARNO LAB,"Oh, you're right. Everyone, three molecules at a time."

141294,543,93,449000,Monsarno Rep,MONSARNO LAB,All right. I'll leave you and Bob in this locked room to get reacquainted.
141295,543,94,453000,Monsarno Rep,MONSARNO LAB,"Simpsons, there's no need for alarm."
141296,543,95,459000,Sideshow Bob,MONSARNO LAB,That's not for you to suck!
141298,543,96,462000,Sideshow Bob,MONSARNO LAB,"Now, where was I? Right, no need to worry. I'm still technically shawshanking it at Springfield Penitentiary."
141299,543,97,470000,Bart Simpson,MONSARNO LAB,This is getting boring. Either murder us or tell us how you got here.
141300,543,98,473000,Sideshow Bob,MONSARNO LAB,Very well.
141302,543,100,476000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,The inanity of the vanity license plate puns was slowly driving me mad.
141303,543,101,482000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Penitentiary,"So when Monsarno Labs asked for experimental subjects, I gladly volunteered."
141305,543,103,497000,Sideshow Bob,MONSARNO LABS,My job was to make sure the experiments wouldn't be too painful for the test monkeys.
141308,543,106,507000,Scientist,MONSARNO LABS,I don't know what we're doin' here. We'll pick it up after lunch.
141311,543,109,519000,Sideshow Bob,SEMINAR ROOM,I wrote up my results and went from subject to scientist.
141312,543,110,525000,Bart Simpson,SEMINAR ROOM,Look at me! I'm Sideshow Bob!
141313,543,111,529000,Homer Simpson,SEMINAR ROOM,Sideshow Bob!
141314,543,112,531000,Sideshow Bob,SEMINAR ROOM,Foolish boy! That's phosphoric acid!
141315,543,113,534000,Sideshow Bob,SEMINAR ROOM,A mere sip would've dissolved a hole in your stomach the size of a silver dollar!
141316,543,114,538000,Bart Simpson,SEMINAR ROOM,"Yakety, yakety, yak."
141317,543,115,539000,Bart Simpson,SEMINAR ROOM,"""The spotted hawk accuses me, he complains of my gab."""
141318,543,116,539000,Bart Simpson,SEMINAR ROOM,"""I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable""... Walt Whitman, ""Leaves of Grass""."
141319,543,117,549000,Bart Simpson,SEMINAR ROOM,"Very good. Lisa, you always were the one rose petal floating atop the cesspool that is the Simpsons."
141320,543,118,557000,Bart Simpson,SEMINAR ROOM,/ That's mean.
141322,543,120,560000,Monsarno Rep,SEMINAR ROOM,"If you're done, our chief scientist has to get back to work. Our corn on the cob has become self-aware."
141323,543,121,567000,Sideshow Bob,SEMINAR ROOM,"Wait! Wait! Won't you visit me again? Let me show you I really am trying to make a better world. Lisa, we can talk Walt Whitman... And Homer, I think you'd enjoy the company of the campus's lazy overfed squirrels."
141324,543,122,579000,Homer Simpson,SEMINAR ROOM,"""Overfed?"" I don't know this word."
141327,543,125,590000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Kitchen,"Visit me, Lisa. We can discuss poetry, fine art, and if we must, jazz."
141243,543,126,596000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Mom... can I visit Bob?
141328,543,127,599000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Why would you want to do that? He's tried to kill us.
141329,543,128,602000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"You. He's tried to kill you. Me, I think he likes."
141330,543,129,605000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,And I refuse to concede a mind that thinks so much like mine can be all bad. Mom?
141331,543,130,609000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Don't you think the parts that aren't evil are a little pretentious?
141332,543,131,614000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Absolutely. We're talking about Lisa, right?"
141333,543,132,616000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Shut up!
141334,543,133,616000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,You shut up!
141335,543,134,618000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,This is the pinnacle of conversation around here.
141336,543,135,621000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Fine. I'll take you. They have this cool psych class at the campus I sat in on.
141337,543,136,626000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,That was a sexual harassment seminar!
141338,543,137,629000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,It doesn't matter. I'm taking it pass-fail.
141341,543,140,635000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,CHURCH MEETING ROOM,"Blowing off steam in the crafts room, Marge?"
141342,543,141,637000,Marge Simpson,CHURCH MEETING ROOM,"No! I'm not giving up on reaching those kids, and I might just have a secret weapon."
141343,543,142,643000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,CHURCH MEETING ROOM,Mm hmm. Is it finger puppets?
141344,543,143,645000,Marge Simpson,CHURCH MEETING ROOM,Maybe!
141345,543,144,646000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,CHURCH MEETING ROOM,"Well, we haven't had finger puppets in this church since Reverend Brogan was arrested."
141346,543,145,651000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,CHURCH MEETING ROOM,But I suppose enough time has passed.
141348,543,147,654000,Marge Simpson,CHURCH SEMINAR ROOM,And that's why Nancy No is the most popular girl in Promiseville High.
141349,543,148,660000,DOLPH,CHURCH SEMINAR ROOM,I prefer the modern thinking of Yolanda Yes.
141350,543,149,663000,Jimbo Jones,CHURCH SEMINAR ROOM,And I think I'd have a shot with Mabel Maybe.
141352,543,151,669000,Marge Simpson,CHURCH SEMINAR ROOM,I am so tired of those kids sniggering.
141353,543,152,673000,Marge Simpson,CHURCH SEMINAR ROOM,"Uh-oh. It's Horndog Hank. Well, Nancy knows how to keep him away."
141354,543,153,680000,Marge Simpson,CHURCH SEMINAR ROOM,"Darn it, they're stuck."
141357,543,156,688000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,CHURCH SEMINAR ROOM,"Um, can I take one of those girl puppets home? I won't do nothin' to it."
141361,543,160,697000,Sideshow Bob,BOB'S LAB,YOU SAY MODIFIED TO-MAY-TO / I SAY MODIFIED TO-MAH-TO...
141362,543,161,701000,Lisa Simpson,BOB'S LAB,I SAY ENGINEERED PO-TAY-TO / YOU SAY ENGINEERED PO-TAH-TO... POTATO!

141366,543,165,708000,Lisa Simpson,BOB'S LAB,LET'S SPLICE SOME D.N.A.!
141367,543,166,717000,Sideshow Bob,BOB'S LAB,That is my first non-evil laugh in years.
141368,543,167,720000,Lisa Simpson,BOB'S LAB,"Bob, there's one thing I've gotta know: are you plotting revenge?"
141369,543,168,726000,Sideshow Bob,BOB'S LAB,"I don't plot revenge anymore. It's like love: if it happens, it happens. Now, how 'bout those s'mores?"
141370,543,169,736000,Lisa Simpson,BOB'S LAB,Dad!
141371,543,170,736000,Lisa Simpson,BOB'S LAB,You already ate all the chocolate bars.
141372,543,171,739000,Homer Simpson,BOB'S LAB,That's why I've got to get the marshmallows down fast.
141374,543,173,744000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I like how they cut them down from a hundred and forty characters to a more manageable twenty characters.
141375,543,174,750000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Another seminar tomorrow. I just wish I could connect with those teenagers, since it seems like we'll never have any."
141376,543,175,758000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, teens can't control their urges. It's why there's never been a teenage President."
141377,543,176,765000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you saying I'm wasting my time?
141378,543,177,767000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No. I'm saying you're wasting everyone's time. But it's a church thing, so that's a given."
141379,543,178,772000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well then maybe I need to give those kids a better example. Goodnight!
141380,543,179,778000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Shut your eyes, they're too bright."
141381,543,180,781000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sorry.
141384,543,183,783000,Marge Simpson,Meeting Room,"Kids, today we have a very special guest -- my husband."
141385,543,184,789000,Marge Simpson,Meeting Room,"I brought Homer here to show that we can, and have, abstained for two whole days."
141386,543,185,796000,Shauna Chalmers,Meeting Room,Two days? That's all?
141387,543,186,798000,Jimbo Jones,Meeting Room,"That means, three days ago... the two of you... made the blob with two backs!"
141388,543,187,803000,Homer Simpson,Meeting Room,"Listen, you punks. If you can't handle the image of our naked bodies in the tender act of a-oo-ga, you should never have come to the basement of this holy place."
141389,543,188,814000,DOLPH,Meeting Room,He's touching her!
141391,543,189,816000,Jimbo Jones,Meeting Room,They're practically doin' it here!
141393,543,191,824000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Meeting Room,I'll sign the pledge! Just get your fat heaving buttocks out of my head!

141397,543,195,843000,Docent,SPRINGFIELD METROPOLITAN MUSEUM,That block's gonna need its own ticket.
141398,543,196,846000,Sideshow Bob,SPRINGFIELD METROPOLITAN MUSEUM,I have a family membership.
141399,543,197,848000,Docent,SPRINGFIELD METROPOLITAN MUSEUM,"Well, if that's your kid, kiss it."
141402,543,200,855000,Sideshow Bob,Museum,"What next? Proto-Cubists? The Pointillists? The alleged ""Art of Itchy and Scratchy?"""
141403,543,201,863000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,I like the Impressionists.
141404,543,202,866000,Sideshow Bob,Museum,"The boy bands of the art world. But for you, Lisa, I shall face the Renoir with sangfroid."
141405,543,203,873000,Worker On Ground,Museum,Warmer. Calder. Warmer. Warmer. Calder. Calder. Calder.
141406,543,204,877000,Worker On Ladder,Museum,That's using your three hundred thousand dollar M.F.A.
141407,543,205,888000,Worker On Ground,Museum,To the Calder mobile!
141409,543,207,891000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,Bob! You saved me! But how did you get the strength? Calder's work in this period was marked by heavy use of sheet metal painted to look deceptively airy.
141410,543,208,901000,Sideshow Bob,Museum,Well put.
141411,543,209,901000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,Thank you. Answer the question.
141412,543,210,904000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,"Well... there is something I should have told you. You see, it occurred to me that if I can genetically modify fruits and vegetables, why can't I modify... me!"
141413,543,211,914000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,You've been changing your DNA?!
141414,543,212,917000,Sideshow Bob,Museum,"At first, just a peptide here and there. Carrot for my presbyopia, brahma bull for strength... And a touch of corn for highlights on my hair."
141415,543,213,927000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,So... how strong are you?
141416,543,214,935000,Hans Moleman,Museum,Figurines! Get your porcelain figurines!
141417,543,215,940000,Sideshow Bob,Museum,Now how 'bout those impressionists?
141418,543,216,947000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,But... but we sang Gershwin together!
141419,543,217,949000,Sideshow Bob,Museum,Well rhapsody in boo-hoo. Do you know why we came to the museum today?
141420,543,218,955000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,"Well, I thought it was because it was Tote Bag day."
141421,543,219,958000,Sideshow Bob,Museum,Well that was part of it!
141422,543,220,958000,Sideshow Bob,Museum,But the biggest part was that!
141423,543,221,963000,Sideshow Bob,Museum,"Washington's backbone... Einstein's eyebrows... Florence Nightingale's tenacity, though I'll have to clip around her moral fiber."
141424,543,222,970000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,You're going to take DNA from these historical figures and add it to your own?
