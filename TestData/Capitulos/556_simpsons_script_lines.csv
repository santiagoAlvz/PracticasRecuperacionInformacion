144390,556,64,320000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Keep your pants on, Marge. It's probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year -- and then they squeeze you for extra money through ""book fairs"" and ""silent auctions."" And parents get twenty emails a day from the school, and everyone hits ""reply all"" to everything!"
144391,556,65,335000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, it's not a private school. It's free."
144392,556,66,338000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that's fine then."

144398,556,72,358000,PRINCIPAL HEAD #2,HELL,"Look, as educators, our job is to gently nurture your child's passion."
144399,556,73,364000,Homer Simpson,HELL,Hm. That is the kind of nonsense you're always falling for.
144400,556,74,367000,Bart Simpson,HELL,"Mom, please tell me I can go to Hell."
144401,556,75,370000,Marge Simpson,HELL,"Well, I guess we could try it for a semester."

144409,556,83,432000,DEMON TEACHER,DEMON SCHOOL,"Beelzebart, you're first. And you're going to torment a very special sinner we've prepared just for you."
144410,556,84,441000,Bart Simpson,DEMON SCHOOL,Homer? That-that's my dad. I can't hurt him.
144411,556,85,446000,Homer Simpson,DEMON SCHOOL,"No, boy. I want you to do it."
144412,556,86,448000,Bart Simpson,DEMON SCHOOL,What? Why?
144413,556,87,449000,Homer Simpson,DEMON SCHOOL,"Bart, you went to Hell and came back a winner, like Jesus. Now come on, boy! Pull me apart like string cheese."
144416,556,90,459000,PRINCIPAL HEAD #1,DEMONIC AMPHITHEATER,Webster defines success as the action of achieving one's goals.

144425,556,99,499000,MOOG,FUTURISTIC BAR,"That was me, when I was a young hoodlink, with me three bestest Glugs, Leonard, Carlton and Dum. We was narsty tastards we were, even though we dressed like Carol Channing's backup dancers."
144426,556,100,510000,MOOG,FUTURISTIC BAR,Some days we'd employ a bit of the bash while having a go at the West End Wiseguys...
144427,556,101,515000,WISEGUYS,FUTURISTIC BAR,Stop it! / Hey! / What's wrong with youse? / I was told this would be a verbal debate!
144428,556,102,520000,MOOG,FUTURISTIC BAR,...and cap off the night with a little of the ol' in-out.

144430,556,104,524000,MOOG,FUTURISTIC BAR,Everything was all fish and chippy... until Dum collected himself a twiggy-wick.
144432,556,106,537000,DUM,RECORD SHOP,"'Allo, little lamb. What say we go back to my place for a little of the Luther Van?"
144435,556,109,569000,DUM,MILK BAR,Oy! I'm getting hitched to this bluebird and she wants me to give up the glug life.
144436,556,110,575000,MOOG,MILK BAR,"Welly, welly, well, well, well. What sorry future would you have without your truest lunos by your side?"
144437,556,111,582000,Marge Simpson,MILK BAR,Dum got a job at the Tower of London... as a Beefeater!
144438,556,112,586000,DUM,MILK BAR,I hope it's what I think it is.
144439,556,113,588000,MOOG,MILK BAR,"Who knew, my brothers, that when Dum found his Dumpling that was the end of our band of glugs? Leonard and Carlton informed me my leadership was no longer needed."
144440,556,114,602000,MOOG,MILK BAR,Not the Shard! Not the Shard!
144442,556,116,606000,MOOG,MILK BAR,So I took up the respectable life of a sleazy barkeep.
144445,556,119,619000,MOOG,MOOG'S APARTMENT,These eye clamps are the only way I can tolerate today's TV.

144449,556,123,638000,MOOG,MOOG'S APARTMENT,Are you kidding me? I invented that gag.
144450,556,124,641000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,MOOG'S APARTMENT,"Please, sir! Certainly a Christian is required to completely unbolt his door!"
144451,556,125,646000,MOOG,MOOG'S APARTMENT,"C'mon, you can't pull the wooly bull over my viddyballs!"
144453,556,127,651000,Nelson Muntz,MOOG'S APARTMENT,That's a bit of the old haw haw!
144454,556,128,662000,MOOG,MOOG'S APARTMENT,"Not my ""Shmoo""! My Shmoooooo!"
144456,556,130,669000,MOOG,FUTURISTIC SIMPSON HOUSE,Those punks got no respect for them what come before. They didn't even wear no codpieces!
144457,556,131,674000,DUM,FUTURISTIC SIMPSON HOUSE,How do they expect to draw the eye to their chunky-wunks?
144458,556,132,678000,MOOG,FUTURISTIC SIMPSON HOUSE,I need me Glugs back for one last bit of barmy.
144459,556,133,681000,Marge Simpson,FUTURISTIC SIMPSON HOUSE,"No. You should not be out glugging, shin-slicing, or eye groining! We've got a sweet little toddle to take care of!"
144460,556,134,694000,DUM,FUTURISTIC SIMPSON HOUSE,Enough of the quiet home life. It's time to be a man again.
144462,556,136,702000,DUM,Springfield Streets,"After all these month-os, I hope we don't disremember how to dash and bash."
144463,556,137,707000,MOOG,Springfield Streets,Let's start easy with a little walking of the jay.
144464,556,138,712000,MOOG,Springfield Streets,Wait! I recognize those cops what's be-whacking my gob-topper. It's Leonard and Carlton!
144466,556,140,720000,MOOG,Springfield Streets,You blokes wanna join me for one last bit o' noggin' boggin'? I saved your bowlers.

144474,556,148,768000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"Sir, are you done with my bird mask?"
144475,556,149,770000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,I don't think you want to wear it now.
144476,556,150,773000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,I'll be the judge of that.

144500,556,175,908000,Grampa Simpson,Master Bedroom,I was sleeping in your dryer and got caught in your sheets.
144501,556,176,912000,Marge Simpson,Master Bedroom,I'll go make up the couch for you.
144503,556,178,912000,Homer Simpson,Master Bedroom,"Ooh Marge, that was fast. Yeah, that's it, baby. Grab my chest with your cold icy hands."
144504,556,179,926000,Homer Simpson,Master Bedroom,The bed is lifting me! The elevator at work can't even do that! I demand you put me down right after the sex!
