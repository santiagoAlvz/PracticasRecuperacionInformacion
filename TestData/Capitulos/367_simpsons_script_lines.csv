95149,367,18,155000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,I don't mind! Trouble's a form of attention.
95151,367,20,160000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Gentlemen, the moment has finally arrived."
95152,367,21,163000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I'm rentin' a party bus and takin' all you regulars to Las Vegas.
95153,367,22,166000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Nevada?!

95157,367,25,170000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, why you bein' so generous? You're usually so stingy and rat-like."
95158,367,26,174000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, well, ya remember that time I tried to hang myself and the rope broke? Well, I sued the rope company and got a huge settlement... and a new rope!"

95163,367,31,186000,Milhouse Van Houten,STEAM TUNNEL,These steam tunnels are awesome. It's like we're in the school's lymphatic system -- and we're the lymph.

95169,367,37,209000,Milhouse Van Houten,Boiler Room,"Well, we made it to the valve room. Now we can leave without touching a valve. What a tale that'll be."
95170,367,38,215000,Bart Simpson,Boiler Room,"Hey, we can't leave here without turning one little valve."
95171,367,39,219000,Milhouse Van Houten,Boiler Room,"Yeah, it'd be like going to Amsterdam and not taking a walking tour of famous doors."
95173,367,41,238000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Hmm, that's odd -- we only turn the heat on for parents' night."
95174,367,42,242000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,What the F-minus?
95175,367,43,251000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,Steeeaam!
95177,367,45,253000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Grover Cleveland's second term was, if anything, more uneventful--"

95156,367,59,316000,Groundskeeper Willie,Hallway,Maybe I'll just have a soda.
95191,367,62,326000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,This wood is more buckled than a pilgrim's hat. But who's responsible?
95192,367,63,334000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Don't bother struggling -- I've got your scruff.
95193,367,64,338000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Can I cut a deal? I'll give you Milhouse.
95194,367,65,340000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I don't want Milhouse.
95195,367,66,343000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Sounds like my parents' custody hearing.
95198,367,69,349000,Bart Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Myra, can ya help me out here?"
95199,367,70,351000,Myra,Skinner's Office,Forget it. This used to be a Croissandwich. Now it's a ham and cheese car crash.
95200,367,71,357000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Yes, thank you, Myra. To highlight the seriousness of Bart's offense, Superintendent Chalmers will be joining us by video uplink."

95202,367,73,369000,State Comptroller Atkins,Skinner's Office,Can we move this along? I'm attending an important conference here in Scottsdale.
95203,367,74,373000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,You're in Scottsdale? I'm in Scottsdale! At the Hyatt -- room three eighty-one!

95208,367,79,389000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,You made that TV show really mad.
95209,367,80,391000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Yes, well you won't think it's so funny when we send Bart here."
95210,367,81,395000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,Upward Bound: The toughest behavioral modification camp in Northwest Oregon.
95211,367,82,395000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"It's the only place cruel enough to straighten Bart out. They use a proven concept, ""tough hate"", to turn around foul-mouthed hooligans. Then they send them home, quietly ticking away."
95212,367,83,413000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Hmm, this camp's got it all -- climbing some kind of rope thing, wearing a backpack, high-fiving the black kid. It's the perfect thing to straighten you out."
95214,367,85,425000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Got it!
95215,367,86,429000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Now I have a ring tone for my brand new cell phone.

95217,367,89,442000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, check it out -- I made it partially risqu√©."
95218,367,90,446000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey guys, I have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp, then I'll be back to go to Vegas!"
95219,367,91,452000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Dad, if you take me to Vegas, I'll teach you how to cheat at blackjack."
95220,367,92,455000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Boy, you don't need to cheat when you got a system."
95221,367,93,458000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,What's your system?
95222,367,94,459000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I don't tell your mother how much I've lost.
95224,367,96,466000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Airport,One child to Portland! He's your problem now.
95225,367,97,471000,Desk Agent,Springfield Airport,It seems he was our problem before. Your son's on the no-fly list.
95226,367,98,477000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Airport,"Why, there must be some mistake."
95227,367,99,480000,Desk Agent,Springfield Airport,There's no mistake. It seems the last time he flew unescorted...
95229,367,101,484000,Pilot,Airport,Welcome to Atlanta.
95231,367,103,486000,Pilot,Plane,Please keep your seatbelt fastened until we have come to a complete stop.
95232,367,104,490000,Bart Simpson,Plane,Nobody tells Bart Simpson what to do.
95233,367,105,495000,Pilot,Plane,"Thanks a lot, thirty-three ""C"". Now we all have to go back to Minneapolis. And I'm very tired."
95236,367,108,505000,Bart Simpson,Airport,"Well Homer, looks like I can't go to discipline camp. Which is too bad, 'cause I think this was the thing that would finally straighten me out."
95237,367,109,513000,Homer Simpson,Airport,"Oh yeah?! You're going to that camp, 'cause I'm gonna drive you there."
95238,367,110,519000,Bart Simpson,Airport,"Yeah, that'll be way more fun than Vegas."
95242,367,114,526000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Aw dang, Homer ain't comin'."
95243,367,115,528000,Nelson Muntz,Moe's Tavern,Haw haw!
95244,367,116,529000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,And Nelson saw somethin' funny.
95247,367,119,544000,Homer Simpson,Car,Stupid Bart... makes me drive to Oregon... home of unspoiled forests... birthplace of Matt Groening ...
95248,367,120,550000,Bart Simpson,Car,"Dad, neither of us wanna go. Why are you doing this? Where's the old carefree Homer who likes to cut loose?"
95249,367,121,557000,Homer Simpson,Car,You mean Fun Homer? I'm afraid Serious Homer has him locked up till you're at your snooty torture camp.
95250,367,122,563000,Bart Simpson,Car,"Fight back, fun Homer! Together we can win!"
95251,367,123,566000,Homer Simpson,Car,It's no use.
95252,367,124,569000,Fun Homer,Car,"Aw c'mon, Serious Homer, let me out! We'll get a monkey drunk and push him down the stairs."
95253,367,125,576000,Serious Homer,Car,I'll kill you the way I killed intellectual Homer!
95256,367,128,586000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"While the boys are gone, we'll sell all their useless junk and replace it with knickknacks and curios."
95257,367,129,593000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I already made up a yard-sale sign!
95258,367,130,596000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"You know, your father saved every book report he ever wrote. And every one was Stuart Little!"
95259,367,131,605000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Not to mention this Power Point demonstration he did just last week.
95260,367,132,616000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,My Malibu Stacy heads!
95261,367,133,619000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Oh no, Bart blamed this on the dog! I didn't pet him for weeks! Oh, I'm sorry I doubted you, boy."
95264,367,136,634000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Eh.
95265,367,137,635000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,"C'mon, Dad, we got a long way to go. You can't stay mad at me the whole time."
95266,367,138,638000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Boy, if you were half as smart as you think you are, you'd clean up your act."
95267,367,139,642000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,Well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing I'm good at.
95268,367,140,645000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"At least you have something you're good at. I'm thirty-eight years old, drivin' a crappy car, with a son who doesn't respect me, and I'm one Snickers pie away from losing my foot to diabetes. Mmm, Snickers pie."
95271,367,143,670000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE DINER,"So, I see you're also traveling with your son. What boy prison are you taking him to?"
95272,367,144,674000,Father,ROADSIDE DINER,"Actually, Justin and I are going to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Sir Peter Hall himself is directing."
95273,367,145,680000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE DINER,"See Bart, I told you things could be worse."
95274,367,146,683000,Son,ROADSIDE DINER,I'm getting a sweatshirt with Shakespeare's face on it!
95275,367,147,686000,Father,ROADSIDE DINER,"Well, we'd better get back to the Prius, son. Don't forget the menu for our scrapbook."
95277,367,149,696000,Bart Simpson,ROADSIDE DINER,Did you see that? They were eating melon for breakfast!
95278,367,150,700000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE DINER,"Look at me, I use a napkin."
95279,367,151,709000,Bart Simpson,ROADSIDE DINER,"Well Dad, we may not always get along, but we'll never be that lame."
95280,367,152,714000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE DINER,"I bet they're from Massachusetts. You know, it's legal there for a guy to marry his son."
95281,367,153,721000,Bart Simpson,ROADSIDE DINER,"Well, I guess it's tinkle time."
95282,367,154,723000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE DINER,"Don't forget to wash your hands, Shakespeare."
95284,367,156,730000,Cora,ROADSIDE DINER,"So, here for a snack before they roll you back into the ocean?"
95285,367,157,733000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE DINER,"Yeah, I'll have the smiley-face breakfast special."
95286,367,158,737000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE DINER,"Uh, but could you add a bacon nose? Plus bacon hair, bacon mustache, five o'clock shadow made of bacon bits... and a bacon body."
95287,367,159,745000,Cora,ROADSIDE DINER,How 'bout if I just shoved a pig down your throat?
95288,367,160,747000,Cora,ROADSIDE DINER,I'm kidding.
95289,367,161,749000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE DINER,Fine. But the bacon man lives in a bacon house!
95290,367,162,752000,Cora,ROADSIDE DINER,No he doesn't!
95292,367,164,758000,Homer Simpson,Diner,You know who would really like this place? Bart. Wait a minute... where the hell is Bart?
95294,367,166,767000,Homer Simpson,Men's Room,You little monster! Show your face this minute!
95296,367,168,776000,Homer Simpson,Bathroom Stall,"Bart, where are you?!"
95298,367,170,780000,Bart Simpson,Diner,"Hey Stavros, there's a guy in your bathroom tryin' to dine-and-dash."
95299,367,171,784000,Fry Cook,Diner,What?! No one dashie-dine on Stavros!
95300,367,172,789000,Homer Simpson,Diner,Why you little...
95301,367,173,791000,Homer Simpson,Diner,I'm stuck!
95302,367,174,792000,Homer Simpson,Diner,Ow! Someone's hitting my butt with something!

95307,367,179,800000,Homer Simpson,Restaurant,"Leave your ass, Homer. Leave your ass."
95312,367,181,805000,Comic Book Guy,Simpson Home,"Hmm, lemme get this straight. I get all of Bart's action figures, Homer's treasured Mr. Plow jacket , and these Power Rangers Underoos, which I am already wearing...for only three ninety-five?"
95313,367,182,816000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's right.
95314,367,183,817000,Comic Book Guy,Simpson Home,Give me five minutes alone with your fridge and you have a deal.
95315,367,184,820000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine.
95316,367,185,822000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We've only brought in five dollars. And that came from Mr. Flanders buying back his own stuff.

95323,367,192,873000,Otto Mann,Simpson Home,Dexonumb? Somnodoze? Percolax? Are these for sale?
95324,367,193,879000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess -- they're Homer's expired pain medications.
