86753,336,3,18000,Kodos,Spaceship,Ugh! This one keeps eating himself.
86754,336,4,22000,Marge Simpson,Spaceship,Hello? Octopuses? I'm done.
86755,336,5,27000,Bart Simpson,Spaceship,Am I the only one here who's in horrible pain?
86756,336,6,29000,Homer Simpson,Spaceship,You're the only one who won't shut up about it.
86757,336,7,34000,Alien Boss,Spaceship,What a delicious meal! I feel like I'm going to burst.
86758,336,8,40000,Bart Simpson,Spaceship,Cool! I'm vomit.
86759,336,9,42000,Alien Boss,Spaceship,"Well, a fine meal like that deserves a hyper-galactic promotion."
86760,336,10,48000,Kodos,Spaceship,Hyper-galactic!
86761,336,11,50000,Bart Simpson,Spaceship,Wait a minute. I don't have a family anymore!
86762,336,12,52000,Kang,Spaceship,"You do now, son. You do now."
86764,336,14,84000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, what are you doing?"
86765,336,15,86000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Trying to get a Frisbee off the roof.
86767,336,17,90000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, there's the Frisbee."
86769,336,19,96000,Ned Flanders,Springfield General Hospital,Concussion... diddily... hemorrhage... doodily... injury... bodily...
86770,336,20,103000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Ned, you nearly died... of a brain tumor. Thank goodness that bowling ball knocked it out of your head. Welcome back, dog!"
86772,336,22,117000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"My, you look awfully pale. Let's get you some fresh air."
86773,336,23,121000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"And while you're there, can you get my Frisbee off the ledge?"
86774,336,24,124000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,All right. But I swear to God this is the very last time.
86776,336,26,130000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Oh man, is this gonna hurt."
86777,336,27,134000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Ah, that's better."
86779,336,29,140000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Street,"Come on, Ned. Just because you foresaw Dr. Hibbert's death doesn't mean you can see into the future. It was just a sinister co-inky-dink."
86780,336,30,149000,Hans Moleman,Springfield Street,Help me! Some bullies threw my shoes over a telephone wire.
86781,336,31,154000,Hans Moleman,Springfield Street,With me in them.
86782,336,32,156000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Street,"Just wriggle loose. I'll catch ya, li'l critter!"

86783,336,35,170000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Street,What the Family Circus? A second premonition came to fruition.
86784,336,36,175000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Street,"Lord, why have you given me these unholy visions of doom?"
86785,336,37,186000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Street,Well I didn't need any special power to know that was comin'.
86786,336,38,189000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Hey Flanders, have you seen my Frisbee?"
86787,336,39,191000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Street,"Homer, I can foretell people's deaths!"
86788,336,40,194000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"People's deaths, eh?"
86789,336,41,205000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Do me! Do me!
86791,336,43,214000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"So, what'd I die of? Too much happiness? Naked girl avalanche?"
86792,336,44,219000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Street,"Uh, you die eating a submarine sandwich."
86793,336,45,222000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,What kind of bread?
86794,336,46,223000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Street,Country parmesan.
86795,336,47,224000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Woo hoo!
86797,336,49,226000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,"Mr. Flanders, why are you moving?"
86798,336,50,228000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,'Cause I had a vision of myself... shooting your father.
86799,336,51,232000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,"In this neighborhood, who hasn't?"
86800,336,52,234000,Lisa Simpson,Flanders Home,"Well, you can't fight fate, but if you must shoot our father, please remember our family motto: ""Not in the face."""
86801,336,53,234000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Don't worry, sweetie. I am not going to kill your father."
86802,336,54,244000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,Flanders? Kill me? You never killed anybody... and you're gonna start with the big dog?
86803,336,55,254000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Homer, please, don't tempt the gods. I-I mean God! There's-there's one God! Only one! Well, sometimes there's three."
86804,336,56,262000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Hey Chief, throw me your piece."
86805,336,57,263000,Chief Wiggum,Flanders Home,"Uh, sure thing, citizen."
86806,336,58,267000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"C'mon, shoot me a new one!"
86807,336,59,268000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Oh, I'm so scared. Ned Flanders is pointing a gun at me. You couldn't even shoot me by accident, even if I whacked the barrel like this."
86808,336,60,281000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Quit whackin' my barrel!
86809,336,61,283000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,Never!
86810,336,62,285000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,You leave me no choice!
86811,336,63,293000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"I was supposed to shoot you, but I didn't! I changed the future!"
86812,336,64,305000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,What have I done? I've changed the future for the worse.
86814,336,65,308000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Homer, stay away from the nuclear plant."
86815,336,66,312000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Fine, I'll never go back. Starting tomorrow. Today is Lenny's birthday and they're having ice cream cake."
86816,336,67,317000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,But you're gonna kill us all...
86817,336,68,319000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,But ice cream cake...
86819,336,70,325000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I gotta find Homer -- he's gonna blow up the whole town!
86820,336,71,328000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, well, you know. You've gotta take the bitter with the sweet."
86822,336,73,334000,Ned Flanders,BOOTH,Homer! Homer!
86823,336,74,338000,Ned Flanders,BOOTH,Homer! Do not press the core destruct button!
86825,336,76,342000,Ned Flanders,CORE,Press... destruct... button.
86826,336,77,350000,Ned Flanders,CORE,Don't do it! Don't do it! You'll kill everyone!
86827,336,78,352000,Ned Flanders,CORE,Do it! Do it! Kill everyone!
86828,336,79,356000,Homer Simpson,CORE,It sure is taking me a long time to reach this button.
86829,336,80,363000,Ned Flanders,CORE,Must... kill... best friend.
86830,336,81,371000,Ned Flanders,CORE,"Homer, fall backward!"
86832,336,83,391000,Ned Flanders,CORE,"Oh, you stupid son-of-a..."
86835,336,86,399000,Marge Simpson,HEAVEN,"Homer, I am so mad at you! I'll bet you blew up the town just to get out of cleaning the garage!"
86836,336,87,407000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,Everything's comin' up Homer.
86837,336,88,409000,Marge Simpson,HEAVEN,"Yeah, well, the joke's on you, smart guy. The garage made it to Heaven too!"
86838,336,89,416000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,"Hmmm, I wonder if I could blow up Heaven?"
86839,336,90,420000,God,HEAVEN,"Homer Simpson, it's time you got what's coming to you."
86840,336,91,425000,God,HEAVEN,Your Frisbee.
86841,336,92,426000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,Cool. You guys got a good buffet up here?
86842,336,93,429000,God,HEAVEN,Oh yeah. Just stay away from the three bean salad.
86843,336,94,434000,Homer Simpson,HEAVEN,You're not the boss of me.
86846,336,97,450000,Harlot,VICTORIAN LONDON,"Hello, Ducky."
86847,336,98,459000,Harlot,VICTORIAN LONDON,"You gave me quite a fright, you did. Say, you don't need no fancy knife to get me attention, not with those handsome muttonchops. C'mon, give us a snog."
86848,336,99,472000,Harlot,VICTORIAN LONDON,That's not a snog!
86849,336,101,480000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,Looks like the muttonchop murderer has struck again.
86850,336,102,483000,Lou,SCOTLAND YARD,What should we do with the body?
86851,336,103,485000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,I want you to dust her for prints.
86852,336,104,487000,Eddie,SCOTLAND YARD,What does that mean?
86853,336,105,488000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,The Prince is coming by. And I want her clean when he looks her over.
86854,336,106,492000,Eliza,SCOTLAND YARD,"Perhaps we can be of assistance, Inspector."
86855,336,107,496000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,"Well, well, well, look who's here. Master detective Eliza Simpson and her easily amazed sidekick, Dr. Bartley."
86856,336,108,503000,Dr. Bartley,SCOTLAND YARD,What's this? A doorknob! Good show!
86857,336,109,507000,Eliza,SCOTLAND YARD,"So, what clues has the body shewn?"
86858,336,110,510000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,We don't need clues -- we've already caught the killer.
86859,336,111,513000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,SCOTLAND YARD,Please.
86860,336,112,516000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,"This mysterious Hindu is clearly responsible for the murder. Lock him up till we find someone darker, boys."
86861,336,113,523000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,SCOTLAND YARD,I am not a killer! I am but a humble purveyor of disgusting British food.
86862,336,114,528000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,SCOTLAND YARD,"Lark tongues, head pudding, eel pies..."
86863,336,115,531000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,Eel pie?! My favorite!
86864,336,116,534000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,"Mmm, we British sure eat crap!"
86865,336,117,539000,Cockney Woman,SCOTLAND YARD,"Inspector, might I have a word wit' you?"
86866,336,118,542000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,Absolutely.
86867,336,119,545000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,"Get back down there, you!"
86868,336,120,545000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,You were saying?
86869,336,121,551000,Cockney Woman,SCOTLAND YARD,"Well, it's like this. I'm a proper Cockney flower girl, I am, and I sees this real strange bloke. Out of sorts. Mad in the eyes. All kettles and biscuits. Well, he seen I was lookin' at him and he drops this and runs. Cor, blimey, skip to me loo!"
86870,336,122,565000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,"Good Lord! I'm afraid this case is beyond even your powers, little girl."
86871,336,123,571000,Eliza,SCOTLAND YARD,"I'll take that challenge, Inspector."
86872,336,124,573000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,"Yeah, well, good luck. Uh, now boys, let's see the suspect in that child abduction case."
86873,336,125,578000,Peter Pan,SCOTLAND YARD,I shall never grow up!
86874,336,126,580000,Inspector Wiggum,SCOTLAND YARD,"Uh, in jail you will."
86876,336,128,582000,Purveyor,EMPORIUM OF EXOTICA,"Yes, I recognize this blade. I sold it as part of a set -- the famed Seven Swords of Osiris! Now would you be interested in an illustrated novelette?"
86877,336,129,592000,Purveyor,EMPORIUM OF EXOTICA,"It also includes a ""Young David Diligent"" adventure."
86878,336,130,595000,Eliza,EMPORIUM OF EXOTICA,"Confound it, man, I need to know who bought those swords!"
86879,336,131,600000,Purveyor,EMPORIUM OF EXOTICA,Very well. I will check my records. You may examine my curios... but do not touch my oddities. Use your judgment with my gewgaws.
86880,336,132,609000,Dr. Bartley,EMPORIUM OF EXOTICA,"Well, I'll be blazed!"
86881,336,133,611000,Dr. Bartley,EMPORIUM OF EXOTICA,I know these missionaries.
86882,336,134,613000,Ned Flanders,EMPORIUM OF EXOTICA,I just told the natives they were havin' sex the wrong way!
86883,336,135,616000,Purveyor,EMPORIUM OF EXOTICA,Help! Help!
86884,336,136,617000,Purveyor,EMPORIUM OF EXOTICA,Murther!
86885,336,137,621000,Eliza,EMPORIUM OF EXOTICA,The Muttonchop Murderer is long gone. But this ledger will lead us to him!
86886,336,138,628000,Purveyor,EMPORIUM OF EXOTICA,This potion will give me new life.
86887,336,139,634000,Stool,EMPORIUM OF EXOTICA,I'm alive! I'm gonna go to America! I'll be in pictures! You'll see! The whole world is gonna know the name Simon Stoolowitz.
86889,336,141,651000,Eliza,London,It says here the swords were sold to C. Ebenezer Burns.
86890,336,142,655000,Dr. Bartley,London,Burns? The evil industrialist who makes coal out of babies? I know just where to find him.
86892,336,144,669000,Mao,OPIUM DEN,"Ebenezer Burns? Yeah, he's over here."
86893,336,145,672000,Mao,OPIUM DEN,"How ya doin', there? Fresh'n your pipe? Anybody need a let-me-down? Whoa, whoa, heads up there, buddy. A rat's gnawin' off your toe."
86894,336,146,683000,Ebenezer Burns,OPIUM DEN,"The sword of Osiris! I once possessed the entire collection. Then I sold them all for opium. Oh, how I wish I had them back... to sell for more opium."
86895,336,147,693000,Eliza,OPIUM DEN,Who did you sell the swords to?
86896,336,148,695000,Ebenezer Burns,OPIUM DEN,A fat man with sideburns... like that one over there!
86897,336,149,701000,Eliza,OPIUM DEN,"There's your muttonchop murderer! Stop, fiend!"
86899,336,151,714000,Otto Mann,OPIUM DEN,Opium rules!
86900,336,152,716000,Mao,OPIUM DEN,Hey! Hey! Read the sign!
86901,336,153,719000,Inspector Wiggum,OPIUM DEN,"Well, well, what have we here?"
86902,336,154,722000,Eliza,OPIUM DEN,Inspector! You've caught the villain! But what are you doing in an opium den?
86903,336,155,726000,Inspector Wiggum,OPIUM DEN,"Well, it's the only way I can get Ralphie to go sleep."
86904,336,156,728000,Ralph Wiggum,OPIUM DEN,I can make Opi-ohs!
86906,336,158,728000,Eliza,London,"Well, Dr. Bartley, another mystery well solved."
86908,336,159,737000,Dr. Bartley,London,"Yes, with the murderer behind bars, London's working girls are free to follow their merry calling."
86910,336,161,746000,Eliza,London,Yet another sword of Osiris! But that must mean... the murderer is still at large!
86911,336,162,753000,Dr. Bartley,London,He could have killed this one days ago -- the body is bloated and the face is rotten.
86912,336,163,759000,Selma Bouvier,London,"It was five minutes ago, you twit."
86913,336,164,767000,Lisa Simpson,London,Hmmm.
86915,336,166,772000,Homer Simpson,PUBLIC YARD,"Please spare me. I'm not a murderer, I'm not. And I've never known the pleasures of a woman... or a proper eating apple!"
86916,336,167,781000,Inspector Wiggum,PUBLIC YARD,"Quiet, you."
86917,336,168,783000,Inspector Wiggum,PUBLIC YARD,Yuck! There's cheese in my eel pie!
86918,336,169,787000,Lord Mayor Quimby,PUBLIC YARD,"This week in our Summer Hanging Series, we're pleased to present the Muttonchop Murderer. At last God-fearing Londoners are free to walk Whore Alley."
86919,336,170,800000,Eliza,PUBLIC YARD,"Stay your hand, Inspector!"
86920,336,171,802000,Eliza,PUBLIC YARD,That man is innocent! The murderer's blade is covered with blood. But the handle is covered with something else. The unmistakable fragrance of eel pie!
86921,336,172,811000,Inspector Wiggum,PUBLIC YARD,"Eh, lots of people like eel pie."
86922,336,173,814000,Lou,PUBLIC YARD,"Yeah? Well, how many of them have muttonchops?"
86924,336,175,819000,Inspector Wiggum,PUBLIC YARD,Why can't you be more like Eddie? He never says a word against me.
86925,336,176,822000,Lou,PUBLIC YARD,That's 'cause you cut out his tongue.
86926,336,177,824000,Eddie,PUBLIC YARD,"E's 'ight, 'eef."
86927,336,178,825000,Eliza,PUBLIC YARD,"Inspector Wiggum, you were the most famous member of Scotland Yard. Why would you do this?"
86928,336,179,831000,Inspector Wiggum,PUBLIC YARD,"Well, the fact is, I wanted to come up with a case even you couldn't solve. And besides... so long, you stupid British twits!"
86929,336,180,843000,Inspector Wiggum,PUBLIC YARD,You'll never catch me! I'm traveling at the speed of wind!
86930,336,181,849000,Inspector Wiggum,PUBLIC YARD,Remember me for my police work and not the murders!
86932,336,183,855000,Kang,Spaceship,Well done. Their fleet is destroyed.
86936,336,187,864000,Ralph Wiggum,MAO'S DEN,"Daddy, I had the craziest dream."
86938,336,189,866000,Inspector Wiggum,MAO'S,Ralphie... you're still in it.
86939,336,190,873000,Ralph Wiggum,MAO'S,Weee!
86940,336,194,890000,Pleasant Female Voice,Springfield Convention Center,I have a serious brain disease. Please give me a cat.
86942,336,196,897000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Convention Center,"This comically large capsule has lifetime supplies of niacin, thiamin and riboflavin-glavin!"
86945,336,199,914000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Convention Center,"Prior to ingestion, the pill must be reduced by my amazing new shrink ray."
86946,336,200,920000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,"Shrink ray? Oh, there's always something else to buy."
86947,336,201,924000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Convention Center,"First I lower the capsule top, thusly..."
86948,336,202,929000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Convention Center,"Then I zap the capsule, thisly..."
86949,336,203,936000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Convention Center,"And now, who would like a lifetime of perfect health?"
86950,336,204,939000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Convention Center,I'll take it!
86951,336,205,941000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Convention Center,"No, no that's now... well, all right."
86952,336,206,946000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,That sounds like Maggie. But she's right here...
86954,336,208,951000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Convention Center,"Now, now don't worry, my dear woman. She will be rocked gently to sleep by the stomach acid."
86958,336,212,960000,Homer Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Hold on, Maggie! Daddy's coming!"
86960,336,214,965000,Homer Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,I've got her!
86961,336,215,967000,Homer Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Oh, Mag... No wait, this is yours."
86962,336,216,972000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Your daughter has thirty minutes before the acid dissolves the capsule.
86963,336,217,976000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,But we can rescue her by sending a miniaturized vessel through Mr. Burns' body.
86964,336,218,982000,C. Montgomery Burns,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Stop that! The felt is slicing through me like a knife!
86965,336,219,986000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Bio-nauts assemble!
86966,336,220,988000,Homer Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Captain!

86969,336,223,991000,Marge Simpson,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Marge!
86970,336,224,993000,C. Montgomery Burns,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,"Now, I insist you take off your shoes when you get inside. And uh, while you're in there, grab as much cancer as you can."
86971,336,225,1002000,Professor Jonathan Frink,PROF. FRINK'S LAB,Let the commencement beginulate!
86972,336,228,1016000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Sub,"Now, you must enter the subclavian vein!"
86973,336,229,1019000,Homer Simpson,Sub,"Screw you, doc! I fly from the gut."
86974,336,230,1023000,Lisa Simpson,Sub,"Dad, you should listen to him. He's a man of science and you can barely read!"
86975,336,231,1028000,Homer Simpson,Sub,"Bah! Has science ever kissed a woman, or won the Super Bowl, or put a man on the moon? This is what I think of your precious science."
86978,336,234,1040000,Homer Simpson,MR. BURNS' BODY,"Help me, science!"
86979,336,235,1047000,Professor Jonathan Frink,MR. BURNS' BODY,"Your ship is wedged in Mr. Burns' heart. And you must dislodge it from the outside. But watch out for retro-viruses. Oh boy, are they retro!"
86980,336,236,1058000,Professor Jonathan Frink,MR. BURNS' BODY,"It's a fun design by R. Crumb, who was friends with Harvey Pekar. Seriously, though, touch one and you're dead."
86982,336,238,1071000,Marge Simpson,Ship,Why is my swimsuit so revealing?
86983,336,239,1074000,Homer Simpson,Ship,"Marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage."
86985,336,241,1082000,Homer Simpson,BURNS' BODY,Maybe this'll help.
86986,336,242,1083000,Marge Simpson,BURNS' BODY,Where'd you get that rib?
86987,336,243,1085000,Homer Simpson,BURNS' BODY,There's a whole rack of 'em over there. I only ate two.
86988,336,244,1091000,Marge Simpson,BURNS' BODY,"Bart, what are you doing?"
86989,336,245,1092000,Bart Simpson,BURNS' BODY,Takin' a whiz.
86990,336,246,1093000,Marge Simpson,BURNS' BODY,Stop that! We're guests in Mr. Burns!
86992,336,248,1097000,Lisa Simpson,VESSEL,"To get Maggie in time, we'll have to catch a ride on a nerve impulse -- the body's information super-highway!"
86993,336,249,1104000,Bart Simpson,VESSEL,Learning is cool!
86994,336,250,1106000,Homer Simpson,VESSEL,"And to make sure we get there super fast, I'm hitting all the buttons with my palm."
86997,336,253,1118000,C. Montgomery Burns,FRINK'S OFFICE,"Well, that hurt like Hell."
87000,336,256,1129000,Marge Simpson,VESSEL,"Oh my sweet, undigested baby!"
87002,336,258,1136000,Professor Jonathan Frink,VESSEL,"I'm afraid I have some bad news, um Simpsons. With the baby's extra weight, you don't have enough power to make it back. And one of you must stay behind to save the rest. Frink out."
87003,336,259,1149000,Lisa Simpson,VESSEL,"Oh, my God! This is the worst Halloween horror we've ever faced."
87004,336,260,1153000,Marge Simpson,VESSEL,And white blood cells are attacking my clothes!
87005,336,261,1156000,Marge Simpson,VESSEL,"Although I must admit, they know where to stop."
87006,336,262,1158000,Homer Simpson,VESSEL,"We'll have to lighten the ship, which means one of us has to stay behind. Bart?... Lisa?..."
87007,336,263,1165000,Homer Simpson,VESSEL,"Fine, me."
87009,336,265,1167000,Marge Simpson,MR. BURNS' BODY,Don't worry. We'll be fine!
87010,336,266,1169000,Homer Simpson,MR. BURNS' BODY,"I'm saying goodbye to everything I ever loved. Ooh, a marshmallow!"
87011,336,267,1175000,Homer Simpson,MR. BURNS' BODY,"Boy, when God closes a door, he opens a window."
87013,336,269,1185000,Bart Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,"Mom, did you have to fly out through all those boogers?"
87014,336,270,1188000,Marge Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,"Cut me some slack, I'm a widow."
87015,336,271,1192000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,"Now, there is still a slight chance we could rescue your husband before he expands."
87017,336,273,1202000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,"Uh, make that zero chance. Frink out."
87019,336,275,1208000,Lisa Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Dad, would you like some of my Snicker-bar cheesecake?"
87020,336,276,1211000,C. Montgomery Burns,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Oh, I feel full enough as it is."
87021,336,277,1213000,Homer Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,I say when we're full. You don't wanna piss off a man who can kick you in the crotch from the inside.
87022,336,278,1223000,Homer Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,I need a mouth hole. And some other holes too.
87023,336,279,1227000,C. Montgomery Burns,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Cheer up, my chubby inner child. I've got a feeling everything's going to work out fine. Because I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN..."
87024,336,280,1240000,Homer Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,I'VE GOT YOU DEEP IN THE HEART OF ME...
