18320,95,18,136000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ya see, back in those days, rich men would ride around in zeppelins dropping coins on people. And one day, I seen J.D. Rockefeller flyin' by, so I run out of the house with a big washtub and... Where're you goin'?"
18321,95,19,154000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidotes, but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend them."
18323,95,21,162000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Anyway, about my washtub. I had just used it that morning to wash my turkey, which in those days was known as a ""Walking Bird""..."
18324,95,23,170000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Mall,"...we'd always have ""Walking Bird"" on Thanksgiving. ... With all the trimmings: cranberries, Injun eyes, and yams stuffed with gunpowder. Then we'd all watch football, which in those days was called 'baseball.'"
18326,95,25,183000,Homer Simpson,Kidstown USA,"Look, Maggie! It's Sgt. Thug's Mountaintop Command Post, complete with Death-bringer missiles that really launch!"

18356,95,53,349000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,There are too many leaves in your walkway!
18357,95,54,358000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why are you people avoiding me? Does my withered face remind you of the grim specter of death?
18358,95,55,372000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes. But there's more.
18359,95,56,372000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I love you, but: you are a weird, sore-headed old crank and nobody likes ya."
18360,95,57,381000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Consarn it! I guess I am an old crank. But what am I gonna do about it?
18361,95,58,391000,Hip Old Man,Simpson Home,One sip and I'm totally hip!
18362,95,59,398000,Buzz Announcer,Simpson Home,Buzz Cola. There's a little boogie in every bottle.

18365,95,62,419000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,A hush falls over the General Assembly as Stacy approaches the podium to deliver what will no doubt be a stirring and memorable address.
18366,95,63,428000,Malibu Stacy,Simpson Home,I wish they taught shopping in school!
18367,95,64,433000,Malibu Stacy,Simpson Home,Let's bake some cookies for the boys!
18368,95,65,436000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Stacy. I've waited my whole life to hear you speak. Don't you have anything relevant to say?"
18369,95,66,442000,Malibu Stacy,Simpson Home,Don't ask me -- I'm just a girl!
18370,95,67,442000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Right on! Say it, sister!"
18371,95,68,442000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's not funny, Bart! Millions of girls will grow up thinking that this is the right way to act! That they can never be anything more than vacuous ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty, land a rich husband, and spend all day on the phone with their equally vacuous friends talking about how damn terrific it is to look pretty and have a rich husband!!"
18372,95,69,463000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Just what I was gonna say.
18374,95,71,463000,Grampa Simpson,Street,Look at me! I'm actin' young! Woooow!

18378,95,76,488000,Goofy Girl,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, there's something wrong with what my Stacy says."
18379,95,77,493000,Goofy Girl's Stacy,Springfield Elementary School,My Spidey sense is tingling! Anybody call for a web-slinger?
18380,95,78,497000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No, Celeste, I mean the things she says are sexist."
18381,95,79,501000,Becky,Springfield Elementary School,Oooh! Lisa said a dirty word!
18383,95,81,504000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,They cannot keep making dolls like this! Something has to be done!
18384,95,82,516000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa -- ordinarily, I'd say you should stand up for what you believe in, but you have been doing that an awful lot lately."
18385,95,83,523000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, you made us march in that Gay Rights Parade."
18386,95,84,526000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And we can't watch Fox 'cause they own those chemical weapons plants in Syria.
18387,95,85,531000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I can't believe you're just gonna stand by as your daughters grow up in a world where this, this is their role model."
18388,95,86,537000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I had a Malibu Stacy when I was little, and I turned out all right. Now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream."
18389,95,87,546000,Malibu Stacy,Simpson Home,Now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream!
18391,95,89,551000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it! I'm calling the company!
18393,95,91,556000,Recorded Voice,KITCHEN,"Hello. You have reached the Malibu Stacy Customer Service Center. If you have a complaint about Malibu Stacy's appearance or odor, press one.

18394,95,92,570000,Lisa Simpson,KITCHEN,Mom! We could go on the factory tour and I could complain in person!
18395,95,93,576000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,"Honey, you're not going to throw red paint at the executives, are you? The Keebler people were very upset..."
18398,95,96,588000,Claire Harper,Malibu Stacy Factory,"Welcome to Enchantment Lane, where all the parts come together and Malibu Stacy is born! Some folks say there is a little touch of fairy dust in the air."
18400,95,97,598000,Ugly Man,Malibu Stacy Factory,"Aw, crap. There's a clog in the torso chute! Leroy, get your ass in gear."
18401,95,98,610000,Leroy,Malibu Stacy Factory,Shut yer hole.

18404,95,101,631000,Announcer,Malibu Stacy Factory,"Kids didn't much like the taste of dried onion meal, but they loved the doll! A second, plastic Malibu Stacy took America by storm. Just ask the owner of the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection--Waylon Smithers of Springfield."
18405,95,102,645000,Waylon Smithers,Malibu Stacy Factory,"Hello, Malibu Stacy collectors! I'll see you at StacyCon ninety-four, at the San Diego Airport Hilton!"
18406,95,103,653000,Announcer,Malibu Stacy Factory,And what does Stacy think of her thirty-five years of success and millions of friends worldwide?
18407,95,104,659000,Malibu Stacy,Malibu Stacy Factory,"Don't ask me, I'm just a girl!"
18408,95,105,659000,Announcer,Malibu Stacy Factory,She sure is!
18409,95,106,666000,Claire Harper,Malibu Stacy Factory,"Well, that's the tour. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer--"
18410,95,107,668000,Lisa Simpson,Malibu Stacy Factory,I have one.
18411,95,108,671000,Claire Harper,Malibu Stacy Factory,Yes?
18412,95,109,671000,Lisa Simpson,Malibu Stacy Factory,"Is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted by Malibu Stacy intentional, or is it just a horrible mistake?"
18413,95,110,678000,Claire Harper,Malibu Stacy Factory,"Believe me, we're very mindful of such concerns."
18414,95,111,683000,Executive,Malibu Stacy Factory,"Hey, Jiggles! Grab a pad and back that gorgeous butt in here!"
18415,95,112,688000,Claire Harper,Malibu Stacy Factory,"Oh, you, get away..."
18416,95,113,688000,Executive,Malibu Stacy Factory,"Ah, don't act like you don't like it."
18418,95,115,690000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's awful being a kid. No one listens to you.
18419,95,116,699000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's rotten being old. No one listens to ya.
18420,95,117,702000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm a white male, aged eighteen to forty-nine. Everyone listens to me! No matter how dumb my suggestions are."
18421,95,118,711000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm not gonna accomplish anything just sitting here--"
18422,95,119,715000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,--And gripin'. It's time for --
18423,95,120,715000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Action! I've got to talk to that woman who invented Malibu Stacy and see if I can get her to --
18424,95,121,720000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,-- Come out of retirement! I'm gonna get me a job! A real Malibu! ...And see if Stacy can help invent me... young... Help!!

18433,95,130,760000,Lisa Simpson,Apartment Complex,I thought you might be able to help me get in touch with the inventor of Malibu Stacy.
18434,95,131,763000,Waylon Smithers,Apartment Complex,"Whew! That would be quite a feat. Stacy Lovell's a total recluse -- she hasn't appeared in public in twenty years. Here, I'm writing an article on her for my next Malibu Stacy Newsletter. It contains her last known whereabouts. I'll - uh -print you out a copy."
18435,95,132,777000,Lisa Simpson,Apartment Complex,Thanks.
18436,95,133,779000,C. Montgomery Burns,Apartment Complex,"Hello, Smithers. You're quite good at turning me on."

18439,95,136,788000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD GABLES STREET,"No, it couldn't be..."
18440,95,137,808000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD GABLES STREET,Excuse me. Miss Lovell? I'd like to talk to you about Malibu Stacy.
18441,95,138,813000,Old Woman,SPRINGFIELD GABLES STREET,Do you have any idea how many kids have tried to track me down and--
18442,95,139,818000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD GABLES STREET,Am I the first?
18443,95,140,818000,Old Woman,SPRINGFIELD GABLES STREET,Yes.
18444,95,141,821000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD GABLES STREET,I want you to hear what Malibu Stacy is telling a generation of little girls.
18445,95,142,826000,Malibu Stacy,SPRINGFIELD GABLES STREET,Thinking too much gives you wrinkles.
18446,95,143,834000,Young Man,SPRINGFIELD GABLES STREET,All right! I've been waitin' nine years to get my Frisbee back!
18447,95,144,838000,Man,SPRINGFIELD GABLES STREET,Ohhhhh...

18450,95,147,838000,Stacy Lovell,Stacy Lovell's House,I see exactly what you mean. This is a problem. But what do you expect me to do?
18451,95,148,852000,Lisa Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,Change what she says. It's your company.
18452,95,149,854000,Stacy Lovell,Stacy Lovell's House,Not since I was forced out in nineteen seventy-four. They said my way of thinking just wasn't cost effective.
18453,95,150,862000,Lisa Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,That's awful!
18454,95,151,862000,Stacy Lovell,Stacy Lovell's House,"Well, that, and I was funneling profits to the Vietcong."
18455,95,152,867000,Lisa Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,"But you are Malibu Stacy, and as long as she has your name, you have a responsibility. I'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product with the Simpson name on it."
18456,95,153,876000,Stacy Lovell,Stacy Lovell's House,"I may have had things in common with Stacy in the beginning, but thirty years of living her lifestyle taught me some very harsh lessons. Five husbands..."
18457,95,154,885000,Stacy Lovell,Stacy Lovell's House,"Ken, Johnny, Joe, Dr. Colossus, Steve Austin..."
18458,95,155,891000,Lisa Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,"But if you can learn from Malibu Stacy's mistakes, so can everyone. I'm sure we can think of something together. C'mon!"
18459,95,156,897000,Stacy Lovell,Stacy Lovell's House,"Not now, I'm too drunk."
18460,95,157,900000,Lisa Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,"No you're not! Uh, I'll come back tomorrow."
18462,95,159,909000,Manager,Krusty Burger,We need some more secret sauce. Put this mayonnaise in the sun.
18463,95,160,914000,Grampa Simpson,Krusty Burger,"Hey! Now that old man Peterson's off our backs, let's have some fun!"
18464,95,161,920000,Grampa Simpson,Krusty Burger,Ever see a sandwich that could take a bite out of you? Look at this sandwich. It's gonna bite you.
18465,95,162,932000,Man,Krusty Burger,Ow!! Damn sandwich took a bite outta me!
18468,95,165,938000,Lisa Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,"I've got the solution -- you and I are gonna make our own talking doll. She'll have the wisdom of Gertrude Stein and the wit of Cathy Guisewite, the tenacity of Nina Totenberg and the common sense of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. And to top it off, the down-to-earth good looks of Eleanor Roosevelt!"
18469,95,166,956000,Stacy Lovell,Stacy Lovell's House,"All right, we'll make your doll!"
18470,95,167,961000,GI JOE,Stacy Lovell's House,"Stacy, please, I must have you back. Just come for a ride with me in my mobile command unit."

18472,95,169,973000,GI JOE,Stacy Lovell's House,"Fine. I'll bomb your house into the ground, missy."
18473,95,170,984000,Lisa Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,Make sure you get my Mom's hair just right.
18474,95,171,986000,Stacy Lovell,Stacy Lovell's House,"Um, I think we'll use someone different for the hair."
18475,95,172,989000,Lisa Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,How about me?
18476,95,173,989000,Stacy Lovell,Stacy Lovell's House,"Um, there's something not quite..."
18477,95,174,991000,Bart Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,How about me?
18479,95,176,991000,Homer Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,How about me?
18481,95,177,991000,Stacy Lovell,Stacy Lovell's House,You all have hideous hair!
18483,95,179,996000,Stacy Lovell,Stacy Lovell's House,I mean from a design point of view.
18485,95,181,1001000,Technician,Stacy Lovell's House,"Talking doll, take eight."

18490,95,186,1043000,Doll,Stacy Lovell's House,Trust in yourself and you can achieve anything.
18491,95,187,1046000,Lisa Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,All right! Now all we need is a name.
18492,95,188,1048000,Bart Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,"How about ""Blabbermouth -- The Jerky Doll for Jerks?"""
18493,95,189,1050000,Lisa Simpson,Stacy Lovell's House,"How about ""Minerva,"" after the Roman goddess of wisdom?"
18494,95,190,1054000,Stacy Lovell,Stacy Lovell's House,"Hmm, not enough commercial appeal."
