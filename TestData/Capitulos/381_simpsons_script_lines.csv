98855,381,19,84000,Bart Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,"These games are so old. Who got these high scores? Pilgrims? Hmm, never saw this one before."
98856,381,20,97000,Bart Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,What's going on here? Am I destroying these triangles or trying to assemble them? What does this button do? Now my ship is pooping more triangles!
98857,381,21,108000,Bart Simpson,Noiseland Arcade,"Oh no, I won a free game!"
98859,381,23,113000,Homer Simpson,Old Springfield Mall,"Ooh, gummy worms!"
98860,381,24,115000,Clerk,Old Springfield Mall,"Uh, that candy's been here an awfully long time. I'd think twice if I were you."
98861,381,25,119000,Homer Simpson,Old Springfield Mall,Don't tell me how many times to think!
98863,381,27,129000,Marge Simpson,Old Springfield Mall,You are not bringing that thing home.
98864,381,28,131000,Homer Simpson,Old Springfield Mall,Then stand back!
98866,381,30,140000,Homer Simpson,Old Springfield Mall,This doesn't taste like I thought it would.
98868,381,32,149000,Marge Simpson,Old Springfield Mall,"Well, if you're through, let's check out that discount book warehouse."
98869,381,33,153000,Homer Simpson,Old Springfield Mall,We already own a book!
98871,381,35,157000,Marge Simpson,Bookstore,"""Wisconsin From Above,"" ""Veterans' Day Parades,"" ooh, ""Smiles of Ireland""! Redheaded twins? Their mother must have her hands full!"

98873,381,37,176000,Homer Simpson,Bookstore,"This doesn't look easy, but I'll bet it is."
98874,381,38,179000,Marge Simpson,Bookstore,"Well, I like the idea of you as a handyman... and I love the idea of you reading!"
98875,381,39,185000,Homer Simpson,Bookstore,"Oh yeah? Blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah..."
98877,381,41,192000,Homer Simpson,Bookstore,"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah..."
98879,381,43,197000,Homer Simpson,Bookstore,"Okay, now you do me."
98881,381,45,198000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I never wanna go back to that mall. There were eels in the photo booth!
98882,381,46,203000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ew.
98883,381,47,206000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, here's a letter from your school!"
98884,381,48,208000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"A fire?! I didn't start a fire in the teachers' lounge! I mean, what fire? I mean, a letter from school? Please elaborate."
98885,381,49,216000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Someone at your school has a life-threatening peanut allergy.
98455,381,50,219000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Cool! Who is it?
98886,381,51,221000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"The letter doesn't say. But from now on, no peanut products are allowed on school property."
98887,381,52,226000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Let's see what you've got... Peanut butter and jelly sandwich, trail mix -- starring peanuts, Good grief! More peanuts!"
98888,381,53,241000,Nascar Announcer,Simpson Home,Harley Mozell is hit from behind by J. T. Delacroix!
98889,381,54,245000,Nascar Announcer,Simpson Home,"And Earl Tilleson! Oh, and Buddy Rollette! And the Pecker brothers, Danny and Dell! And the ol' Grizzley himself -- Weasel Johnson Junior! Look at that carnage -- we are worse than the ancient Romans!"
98890,381,55,259000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, don't you want to build something with your new fix-it books?"
98891,381,56,262000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I did! I made a foot rest.
98892,381,57,265000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't you have any follow-through on anything?
98893,381,58,267000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What's the point? We're all slowly dying.
98895,381,60,274000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, the floorboard broke my nightstand."
98897,381,62,288000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I did it! What's that strange feeling? It's ""of accomplishment""!"
98899,381,64,307000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow Mom, you made all this?"
98900,381,65,309000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's like you're the Jesus of carpentry.
98901,381,66,311000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aww, what a sweet blasphemy."
98902,381,67,314000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,This is a valuable skill. People might even pay you to build things for them.
98903,381,68,319000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I could start my own carpentry business. I'm already arranging the clip art for the letterhead in my mind.
98904,381,69,329000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Perfect!
98906,381,71,332000,Gary Chalmers,Suburban House,"Uh, can I help you, Miss?"
98907,381,72,334000,Marge Simpson,Suburban House,I'm here to fix your bookcase. You answered my flyer.
98908,381,73,339000,Gary Chalmers,Suburban House,And you're the carpenter?
98909,381,74,339000,Marge Simpson,Suburban House,That's right.
98910,381,75,341000,Gary Chalmers,Suburban House,"I see. Not that I have anything against female carpenters, but I have some pictures hanging that you might find um... unsavory. Goodbye."
98911,381,76,350000,Krusty the Clown,Suburban House,A lady carpenter? I dunno. What if you get pregnant and I'm left with half a hot tub? And don't tell me you're infertile. I ain't fallin' for that again.
98914,381,78,363000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's so unfair -- I'm as handy as any man.
98915,381,79,367000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You sure are, sweetie -- I love this bed you made."
98916,381,80,372000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess people just expect their carpenter to be some fat guy with his butt crack showing.
98917,381,81,384000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, your butt just gave me a brilliant idea!"
98918,381,82,389000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yep, it'll do that."
98919,381,83,392000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Simpsons Manly-Man Handyman"" at your service."
98920,381,84,395000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,Superlative! Please install a doggie door sized for a teacup poodle.
98921,381,85,401000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No problem. Why don't you go inside and stir your flubber while I get to work.
98922,381,86,409000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, the coast is clear."
98925,381,89,417000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,I'm terribly sorry. I thought I heard the sound of a woman measuring.
98926,381,90,420000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, uh, that was me. You know that old saying: ""measure like a girl, hammer like a guy."""
98927,381,91,422000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,"Yes, but you're holding your hammer backwards."
98928,381,92,429000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, uh... you know what they say, ""hammer with the wood and it's all good."""
98929,381,93,429000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's allll good.
98930,381,94,435000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,"All right, then."
98932,381,96,435000,Marge Simpson,Kent Brockman's House,"A dash of glue, a turn of screw, and a gazebo's built that's perfect for two -- or more!"
98933,381,97,453000,Marge Simpson,Kent Brockman's House,"Uh-oh, switch!"
98934,381,98,458000,Homer Simpson,Kent Brockman's House,...Annnd done.
98935,381,99,459000,Kent Brockman,Kent Brockman's House,"Mm-hmm! Simpson, you're a master craftsman."
98936,381,100,462000,Homer Simpson,Kent Brockman's House,Listen... what would you say if I told you a woman did most of the work?
98937,381,101,467000,Kent Brockman,Kent Brockman's House,I'd have this gazebo torn down and built into a coffin... for your manhood.
98939,381,103,470000,Kent Brockman,Kent Brockman's House,Why did my hypothetical scenario scare you so?
98940,381,104,475000,Homer Simpson,Kent Brockman's House,"Uh... Like all manly men, I have a vivid imagination."
98941,381,105,480000,Kent Brockman,Kent Brockman's House,Well said. Let's take off our shirts and wrestle.
98943,381,107,488000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, gimme all your peanuts, Goobers and Fluffer Nutters."
98945,381,108,494000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Why should we have to give up our salty snacks, just to keep one allergic kid from exploding?! Who is this selfish jerk anyway?"
98946,381,109,501000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"It's not me, I swear. I'm only allergic to honey, wheat, dairy, non-dairy, and my own tears."
98947,381,110,510000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Oh no! Call my allergist!
98948,381,111,513000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,And my optometrist!
98950,381,113,516000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Willie, you can tell me: who's the mystery wuss who can't eat peanuts?"
98951,381,114,522000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,I'll never say his name!
98952,381,115,524000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"""His,"" eh? Hmm, so it's a dude."
98953,381,116,527000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Who says it's a dude? A principal can be a man or a woman these days.
98954,381,117,533000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Hmmm.
98956,381,119,536000,Groundskeeper Willie,Skinner's Office,I've taken all the peanut products. Just like the English took our sheep and our women back in 1291. Then they sent them back -- which was worse!
98957,381,120,547000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Yes, yes, every day we go through this. Why don't you just incinerate the contraband."
98958,381,121,552000,Groundskeeper Willie,Skinner's Office,"Will do -- but first, Willie gets his gob-full!"
98959,381,122,557000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Careful with those peanut crumbs! My allergy is so sensitive a single molecule would make my throat close like a museum at four forty-five.
98962,381,125,568000,Helen Lovejoy,Builders' Barn,"Hello, Marge. Picking up supplies for Handy Homer?"
98963,381,126,573000,Lindsay Naegle,Builders' Barn,"It must feel good to know that you're ""helping."""
98964,381,127,573000,Marge Simpson,Builders' Barn,I help more than you might think.
98965,381,128,578000,Helen Lovejoy,Builders' Barn,Sure you do -- you provide food and sexual release for your handy husband!
98966,381,129,584000,Lindsay Naegle,Builders' Barn,Looks like you broke something -- better call Homer!
98969,381,132,591000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of course I can make a credenza, whatever that is. Just give all the details to my secretary Shirley."
98970,381,133,598000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is Shirley. Yes, fine, he'll be there tomorrow. Goodbye!"
98971,381,134,602000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That Shirley is quite a gal. We should fix her up with Barney.
98972,381,135,604000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie... I think you're taking a little too much credit for my work. I mean, look at your t-shirt!"
98973,381,136,614000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, giving me credit was your idea. Now could you rub my butt? I sat on it so much it's a little sore."
98975,381,138,622000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, I'm sorry you're upset. But if we tell the truth now, I'll be humiliated in front of the whole town. Then you won't be married to a man. You'll be married to some kind of gay jellyfish, floating outside the Florida Keys, cruising for rich snorkelers. You don't want that."
98976,381,139,640000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess I don't.
98978,381,141,650000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, Skinner's gonna be really mad at you."
98979,381,142,653000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, you might say he'll ""blow up."""
98980,381,143,653000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Whatever, I've got some paper to mâché."
98981,381,144,665000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Simpson! Report to detention at once.
98982,381,145,668000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm not a big fan of detention. You might say, it drives me nuts."
98983,381,146,674000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,My allergen!
98984,381,147,693000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I'M A COOTIE EATER / I'VE BEEN ONE ALL MY LIFE. / I LIKE THE COOTIES SO MUCH / I HAVE A COOTIE WIFE.
98987,381,150,696000,Marge Simpson,Lenny's House,Why does Lenny need a windmill anyway?
98988,381,151,706000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's House,He wants to grind his own corn. Maybe it'll finally shut him up about the high price of cornmeal.
98989,381,152,713000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's House,Switch!
98990,381,153,714000,Marge Simpson,Lenny's House,"Switch, switch, switch."
98991,381,154,717000,Lenny Leonard,Lenny's House,"Wow, great job, Homer."
98992,381,155,719000,Carl Carlson,Lenny's House,And to think you built this whole thing with your own two hands.
98993,381,156,722000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's House,"Who'd you think would help me, my wife? Heh."
98994,381,157,725000,Lenny Leonard,Lenny's House,Your wife? Gimme a break. The only thing women can build is credit card debt!
98996,381,159,731000,Carl Carlson,Lenny's House,Credit card debt.
98998,381,161,734000,Carl Carlson,Lenny's House,"Homer, did you leave a power drill on in your toolbox? It's makin' this horrible noise."
99001,381,163,738000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's House,"Yeah, I hear it too. Maybe we can cover it up by singing a fun song. ""WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU..."""
99002,381,164,742000,Carl Carlson,Lenny's House,"""WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU / WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU..."""
99003,381,165,748000,Carl Carlson,Lenny's House,"""WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU! / WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU..."""
99004,381,166,753000,Carl Carlson,Lenny's House,BUDDY YOU'RE A BOY MAKE A BIG NOISE / PLAYIN' IN THE STREET GONNA BE A BIG MAN SOME DAY...
99006,381,168,761000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"...I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, infinity. I never expected them to climb on the cabinet and ride it down the biggest hill in town."
99007,381,169,770000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, it's time people knew the truth: I'm doing the work and I want the credit."
99008,381,170,776000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, I understand that you're mad. Which makes now the perfect time to tell you the mayor's hired us to fix the old Springfield roller coaster."
99009,381,171,787000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"By the way, nice job installing this wall-chart bracket. If the kids ask, I did it."
99010,381,172,793000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're gonna have to fix that roller coaster yourself, 'cause I quit... and I'm taking this with me!"
99011,381,173,804000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Darn these counter-sunk molly clamps!
99012,381,174,811000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,This is not going to end well.
99014,381,176,816000,Homer Simpson,ROLLER COASTER SITE,"Now as I see it, the problem with this roller coaster is there are too many boring ""going-up"" parts."
99015,381,177,822000,Homer Simpson,ROLLER COASTER SITE,"We need to replace them with kick-ass ""going-down"" parts."
99017,381,179,828000,Contractor #1,ROLLER COASTER SITE,"Mr. Simpson, shouldn't we begin by securing the struts?"
99018,381,180,831000,Homer Simpson,ROLLER COASTER SITE,Hmm... let me mull that over.
99019,381,181,839000,Homer Simpson,ROLLER COASTER SITE,What are struts?
99020,381,182,843000,Homer Simpson,ROLLER COASTER SITE,I don't know anything about struts.
99021,381,183,848000,Contractor #1,ROLLER COASTER SITE,This guy's all bubble and no level.
99022,381,184,851000,Contractor #2,ROLLER COASTER SITE,So what? He's paying us fifty grand.
99023,381,185,854000,Homer Simpson,ROLLER COASTER SITE,And I promised these guys money I don't have! And they're gonna be so mad!
99024,381,186,861000,Contractor #1,ROLLER COASTER SITE,Let's go home.
99025,381,187,865000,Homer Simpson,ROLLER COASTER SITE,Maybe I can sneak home without them seeing me.
99000,381,190,884000,Mr. Peanut,Springfield Elementary School,Are you ready to be lightly assaulted?
98830,381,192,894000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Good morn-ing.
99029,381,194,897000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I brought you breakfast in bed.
99030,381,195,902000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Eat it.
99032,381,197,910000,Seymour Skinner,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Excuse me. I'm supposed to stand in your store window and breastfeed Bilbo Baggins.
99034,381,199,916000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Your cowering suggests that Bart has found your 'kryptonite'.
99035,381,200,919000,Seymour Skinner,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Kryptonite? What's that? The ""ite"" suffix suggests a mineral."
99036,381,201,922000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,I do not know whether to laugh or cry at your ignorance. I shall laugh: Ha-ha! Kryptonite is Superman's greatest weakness.
99037,381,202,929000,Seymour Skinner,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Wait... maybe Bart has a kryptonite!
99038,381,203,932000,Seymour Skinner,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Perhaps. But for now, you may suckle your Baggins."
99040,381,205,947000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield General Hospital,"I've got you now, Bart."
99043,381,208,966000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, here's a thought: if you just gave Mom credit, maybe she could help you."
99044,381,209,971000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetie, you don't understand. If I can do this myself, then all those lies I told will be true. Don't you want Daddy's lies to be true?"
99045,381,210,980000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'd like a Daddy who lived in the real world.
99046,381,211,983000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"To Daddy, the real world gets fainter and fainter every day."
99048,381,213,989000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Good morning, Seymour. You may be wondering what I'm doing with this hat full of maggots..."
99049,381,214,995000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Actually, I'm not wondering at all."
99050,381,215,1000000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Simpson, you've been waving your nuts in my face for too long. Eat shrimp and die!"
99051,381,216,1004000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,No! I'm allergic!
99052,381,217,1007000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Stick-on-stick. Just like the knights of old.
99053,381,218,1010000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,No one teaches me history!
99055,381,220,1057000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,A wooden sign!
