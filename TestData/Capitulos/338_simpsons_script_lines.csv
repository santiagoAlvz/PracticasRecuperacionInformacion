87307,338,1,16000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Check it out, girls. Sixty-eight squares of ankle-busting fury!"
87308,338,2,35000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"That's right, a double-dogleg, hamstring-knotting Hop-Way to Hell. What insane kangaroo dreamed this fevered nightmare? Behold!"
87309,338,3,48000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Ladies, grab your pebbles!"
87311,338,5,54000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What?
87312,338,6,55000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,Nothing.
87313,338,7,58000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,Lisa has a big butt!
87314,338,8,61000,Terri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,Lisa has a big butt!
87315,338,9,63000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Shut up! I do not!
87316,338,10,65000,Terri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,Oh no! Don't make Lisa mad!
87317,338,11,67000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,She might crush us all with her giant butt!
87318,338,12,70000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Shut up, you! Stop teasing the big-bottomed lass! She's just as God made her -- plump as a Christmas goose."
87320,338,14,79000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, the kids at school said my butt's big."
87321,338,15,82000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's ridiculous, honey. You're the cutest little girl I know. You just have what is known as the Simpson butt. Permit me to elaborate."
87322,338,16,92000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Every Simpson starts with a circle. Daddy has one big circle here... then a smaller one up here... two big, sexy circles for eyes... one macho muzzle... and a snappy new outfit. Hm, I'm lookin' good... ooh, cuffs... yeah... and for some reason, my hair and ear form an ""M"" and a ""G."""
87323,338,17,118000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Party! Party! Party! Party!
87325,338,18,121000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You wanna know a little trick? To downsize my derri√®re, I just tie a sweater around it."
87326,338,19,128000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,See?
87328,338,21,130000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer, you're wasting away to nothing. You simply must eat something. Well, you're the boss!"
87329,338,22,140000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I love to see my man eat."
87330,338,23,145000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Check it out, Homes. You said if I ever got a hundred on a test, you'd throw me a party."
87331,338,24,150000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,There's my hundred -- where's my party?
87332,338,25,155000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nice try, loser. I bet you made up a fake test."
87333,338,26,158000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nope, it's real -- check out the watermark."
87334,338,27,161000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right.
87336,338,29,167000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah-ha! Here's a mistake. It says the capital of Kentucky is Frankfort. Dream on, pal."
87337,338,30,175000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, the capital of Kentucky is Frankfort."
87338,338,31,178000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Really? Frankfurter... is that anything?
87339,338,32,183000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, it's something, dear."
87340,338,33,185000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"See, it's all legit. Now make with the party."
87341,338,34,187000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, boy, which con did you work here? Copy off another kid? Pay attention and take notes? Well, take note of this!"
87344,338,37,200000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Apartment Building,"Bart really did get a hundred. I gave a test on state capitals, but I forgot to roll up the map. Everyone got a hundred."
87345,338,38,208000,Bart Simpson,Apartment Building,I win! P-A-R-T. Par-tee!
87346,338,39,214000,Seymour Skinner,Apartment Building,"People, please. It's a school night."
87347,338,40,216000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,I thought you two broke up.
87348,338,41,218000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Apartment Building,This means nothing.
87349,338,42,219000,Seymour Skinner,Apartment Building,"Yes yes, you've made that quite clear."
87351,338,44,222000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,Maybe a different outfit would make me look thinner.
87353,338,46,236000,Lisa Simpson,THE THIN CROWD,This store makes me feel even worse about myself.
87354,338,47,249000,Eight-year-old Girl,THE THIN CROWD,"Ooh, I heard she's back to her birth weight."
87355,338,48,254000,Eight-year-old Girl's Friend,THE THIN CROWD,Must be nice.
87356,338,49,258000,Male Clerk,THE THIN CROWD,"No, no, the body on this mannequin is all wrong."
87357,338,50,260000,Lisa Simpson,THE THIN CROWD,I know! It's such an unrealistic standard for young... Huh?
87358,338,51,266000,Male Clerk,THE THIN CROWD,PLANING DOWN THE THIGHS / PLANING DOWN THE THIGHS / I MAKE FOUR BUCKS AN HOUR / PLANING DOWN THE THIGHS!
87359,338,52,275000,Lisa Simpson,THE THIN CROWD,"Hey, I don't look so bad."
87360,338,53,279000,Reflection,THE THIN CROWD,"Don't worry, Lisa. You can still find someone to love you."
87361,338,54,283000,Milhouse Van Houten,THE THIN CROWD,Now you've got no choice.
87362,338,55,286000,Lisa Simpson,THE THIN CROWD,Noooooo!
87364,338,57,289000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh boy! Barty's gonna party!
87365,338,58,291000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He sure is -- if he can keep up with these party animals!
87366,338,59,292000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Grandma Bouvier and Grampa!"
87368,338,61,305000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Plus your school-yard chums: Martin and Ralph!
87369,338,62,308000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,Bart's my bestest boyfriend.
87370,338,63,311000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Mom, this guest list sucks."
87371,338,64,314000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's the best I could do on such short notice.
87372,338,65,317000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Where's Milhouse?
87373,338,66,319000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He's got the measles. But we've got him on speakerphone!
87374,338,67,322000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Rock on! You know, the first time I met Bart--"
87375,338,68,328000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I told him to use a land line. Okay gang, let's get this party started -- or should I say Barted?"
87376,338,69,342000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"For our first game, I need everyone to draw a picture of President Eisenhower."
87377,338,70,349000,Martin Prince,Simpson Home,I drew him with Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. Their relationship was frosty at best.
87378,338,71,358000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck..."
87381,338,74,358000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck duck, duck, duck, duck, duck..."
87382,338,75,369000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Say ""goose,"" you stupid freak!"
87383,338,76,385000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, this was the worst party ever."
87384,338,77,389000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Gee, I did the best I could..."
87386,338,78,392000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here's Lisa! She'll save the party! Honey, sit down... have a big slice of cake!"
87387,338,79,399000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What?! I'm not fat enough already? How could you say that to me?
87388,338,80,405000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, wait..."
87389,338,81,415000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Hello? Hello? I had to leave 'cause my French bread pizza dinged! Hello?
87390,338,82,423000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck ..."
87391,338,83,439000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, what's the big deal? Bart didn't like his presents. So what? It's not like he gives us such great gifts. Remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper? What was that? That was crap."
87392,338,84,451000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not just the presents -- the kids don't appreciate me anymore. They'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom.
87393,338,85,458000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So they're growing up. Soon they'll be leaving the nest, and you'll have time for yourself. Hundreds of thousands of hours. And then, the peace of the grave."
87394,338,86,469000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No! No, I've got a lot more mothering left in me!"
87396,338,88,474000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I'll be right here at three to pick you up, then I'll take you to the zoo! We can eat fries out of a safari hat!"
87397,338,89,481000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,No thanks. I'm gonna stay in the library and do a little reading.
87398,338,90,487000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I guess it's just you and me, Bart!"
87399,338,91,489000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Mom, after that lame party you threw, I'd rather hang out with thunder-thighs here."
87401,338,93,497000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,They grow up so fast.
87402,338,94,499000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"They're just asserting their independence. If a child doesn't do it now, it may never happen."
87403,338,95,503000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Seymour! Do you want your vitamin in applesauce, or are you gonna take it like a big boy?"
87404,338,96,509000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Applesauce.
87407,338,99,514000,Marge Simpson,Park,"Oh sure, you love me now, but you'll turn."
87408,338,100,519000,Nelson Muntz,Park,"Stop struggling, and get in my mouth, jerks!"
87409,338,101,523000,Marge Simpson,Park,Aren't you the boy who beats up my son?
87410,338,102,525000,Nelson Muntz,Park,Prob'ly. What's your name?
87035,338,103,527000,Marge Simpson,Park,Simpson.
87385,338,104,528000,Nelson Muntz,Park,"Oh, yeah. Bart Simpson. Spiky hair, soft kidneys, always hitting himself?"
87411,338,105,536000,Marge Simpson,Park,Those tadpoles are your lunch?
87412,338,106,538000,Nelson Muntz,Park,"Technically, brunch."
87413,338,107,540000,Marge Simpson,Park,"Here, take this. My daughter didn't want the lunch I made."
87414,338,108,554000,Nelson Muntz,Park,This sandwich rocks. My tadpoles seem crude by comparison.
87416,338,110,566000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Zoo,Haw haw. You're nocturnal.
87417,338,111,569000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Zoo,You don't have to impress me by making fun of others. I already like you.
87418,338,112,574000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Zoo,Haw haw. I'm starting to let down my guard. Haw haw.
87421,338,115,582000,Nelson Muntz,Car,"Thanks, Mrs. S. Today didn't totally suck nard."
87422,338,116,586000,Marge Simpson,Car,It's nice to be appreciated.
87423,338,117,588000,Nelson Muntz,Car,Whatever. Take it sleazy.
87424,338,118,598000,Nelson Muntz,Car,Mom?!
87426,338,120,600000,Mrs. Muntz,Muntz House,Nelson?!
87427,338,121,600000,Mrs. Muntz,Muntz House,I thought you were sleeping in the park tonight.
87428,338,122,604000,Moe Szyslak,Muntz House,"Oh that's okay, the kid don't bother me none."
87429,338,123,607000,Mrs. Muntz,Muntz House,"Hey Nelson, say hello to Moe. He said he'd take you campin' sometime."
87430,338,124,612000,Moe Szyslak,Muntz House,I said I might.
87432,338,126,614000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, kids, I just heard they cancelled league night down at the bowling alley. You know what that means -- open lanes!"
87433,338,127,625000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whaddya say? It'll be BLAM! Bart, Lisa And Mom. Huh?"
87434,338,128,632000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, when I want lame and needy, I'll call Milhouse. No offense."
87435,338,129,636000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine! I'll take my mothering elsewhere.
87437,338,131,643000,Nelson Muntz,Barney's Bowlarama,Yeah!
87438,338,132,645000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Great roll, Nelson! Here, I cut up your hot dog for you."
87439,338,133,652000,Nelson Muntz,Barney's Bowlarama,"Wow, hot dogs are awesome!"
87440,338,134,655000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,You've never had one before?
87441,338,135,657000,Nelson Muntz,Barney's Bowlarama,"No, but I saw some in a catalog once -- people in sweaters were eating them at a picnic."
87442,338,136,671000,Nelson Muntz,Barney's Bowlarama,"So, my mom works at Hooters, but her dream is to go to Vegas and work in a real strip club."
87443,338,137,679000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"And uh, where's your Dad in all this?"
87445,338,138,682000,Nelson Muntz,Barney's Bowlarama,"He went out for a pack of cigarettes and never came back. He said ""smell ya later."" But he never smelled me again."
87446,338,139,690000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Nelson, how'd you like to earn some extra money around our house? I have some odd jobs my kids won't do."
87447,338,140,698000,Nelson Muntz,Barney's Bowlarama,"Yeah, I get the feeling Bart isn't everything he could be in the son department."
87448,338,141,704000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Sometimes I think he's more interested in his ""Itchy and Mitchy"" cartoons than me."
87449,338,142,709000,Nelson Muntz,Barney's Bowlarama,"Hey, I'm sure it's just a phase -- like when I used to stand on the overpass and drop computers on the freeway."
87450,338,143,715000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,That's how we got our Kaypro!
87452,338,145,719000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six..."
87453,338,146,721000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, Lisa."
87454,338,147,722000,Terri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,Are you counting how many days it takes to wash your big butt?
87456,338,149,728000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I can't hear you.
87457,338,150,730000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,That's because your butt blocks your ears.
87458,338,151,732000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That doesn't make any sense!
87459,338,152,734000,Terri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,Neither does your butt.
87463,338,156,739000,Lisa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,I know this obsession with thinness is unhealthy and anti-feminist... but that's what a fat girl would say!
87464,338,157,747000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Lis, look!"
87465,338,158,756000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Now, I know there's a handsome young man behind all that hair and dirt."
87466,338,159,763000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Well, maybe not. But you did a great job on the lawn."
87467,338,160,768000,Nelson Muntz,Evergreen Terrace,"Thanks, Dingus... I mean, ma'am."
87468,338,161,772000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,My mother... my bully... my God!
87470,338,163,775000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, just take a bite. One bite -- that's all I ask!"
87471,338,164,788000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, I can't have toothpaste tonight."
87473,338,166,795000,Mrs. Muntz,Simpson Home,Here's the money you gave my son.
87474,338,167,799000,Mrs. Muntz,Simpson Home,We don't want your charity.
87475,338,168,800000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't give your son charity. I gave him self-respect.
87476,338,169,805000,Mrs. Muntz,Simpson Home,"Self-respect, huh? No wonder he came home with his vest all buttoned. Like he was somebody."
87477,338,170,813000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Go home to your son, Mrs. Muntz. And try not to have intercourse on the way!"
87480,338,173,837000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nelson, what are you doing out this late?"
87481,338,174,840000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,My mom ditched me! She went to Hollywood to be an actress. But her range is limited!
87482,338,175,849000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,She's still your mother. Come inside.
87483,338,176,857000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Can I get you a glass of milk?
87484,338,177,859000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Cow milk?!
87485,338,178,861000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-huh.
87487,338,180,869000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you doing in my jammies?
87488,338,181,871000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,I'm your new roommate. I call top bunk.
87489,338,182,874000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But it's a single bed.
87490,338,183,876000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,I said top bunk!
87491,338,184,889000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, the reason God invented deadbolts is to keep people like Nelson out of your house."
87492,338,185,894000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, have you ever eaten a Tootsie Pop? You know, there's a tough crunchy shell, but if you lick it, there's a delicious sweetness inside. Be nice to Nelson and I'll give you a Tootsie Pop."
87493,338,186,911000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"Morning losers. Mrs. Simpson. Pancakes, my favorite!"
87494,338,187,918000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, eat up or you'll be late for school!"
87495,338,188,921000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm not hungry.
87496,338,189,923000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,You heard the lady! Clean your plate!
87497,338,190,927000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Savor it! Let the flavors dance on your palate!
87499,338,192,940000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"Next on ABC, who's dropping by to see George Lopez? We pray it's you!"
87500,338,193,945000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Open.
87501,338,194,948000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nelson, doesn't that hurt your teeth?"
87502,338,195,950000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,My teeth hurt all the time. I just try to think about motorcycles.
87503,338,196,954000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't like the sound of that. Tomorrow I'm taking you to Doctor Shapiro.
87504,338,197,959000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"A doctor for your teeth? What's next, a lawyer for your hair?"
87506,338,199,971000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Living Room,"PAPA, CAN YOU HEAR ME? / PAPA, CAN YOU SEE ME? / PAPA CAN YOU FIND ME IN THE NIGHT?"
87507,338,200,987000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Living Room,"PAPA ARE YOU NEAR ME? / PAPA, CAN YOU HEAR ME? / PAPA, CAN YOU HELP ME NOT BE FRIGHTENED? / LOOKING AT THE SKIES I SEEM TO SEE / A MILLION EYES WHICH ONES ARE YOURS?..."
87508,338,201,1008000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I've gotta do something about him.
87510,338,203,1017000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is the perfect test -- if I can have one dab of frosting and then stop, I'll know I've conquered food at last."
87511,338,204,1033000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That was too easy.
87514,338,207,1044000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, if I stop here, I still have some dignity."
87516,338,209,1052000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, at least she's not singing Streisand."
87517,338,210,1061000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"Hey Lis, still insecure about your body?"
87518,338,211,1065000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, a little. Those mean girls just get to me."
87519,338,212,1070000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,I understand. I have a sister... I think she's dead now... who had the same problem. And I know just the solution.

87527,338,220,1110000,Nelson Muntz,PLAYGROUND,"He who haw haws last, haw haws best."
87529,338,222,1113000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I really appreciate you teaching those mean girls a lesson.
87530,338,223,1117000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Tomorrow I can bleach a swear word into their hair.
87531,338,224,1121000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'd like that.
87532,338,225,1125000,Mr. Muntz,Simpson Home,Nelson?
87533,338,226,1127000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Poppa! You came back!
87534,338,227,1132000,Mr. Muntz,Simpson Home,"I never meant to leave you, Nelson. But uh, something awful happened when I went to the store."
87535,338,228,1137000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that explains a lot. Who's hungry?"
87536,338,229,1139000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No! I want to hear what happened at the store!
87537,338,230,1142000,Mr. Muntz,Simpson Home,"Well, I went in to buy cigarettes..."
87444,338,232,1144000,Mr. Muntz,Kwik-E-Mart,Could you gift-wrap them please? They're for my son.
87540,338,233,1147000,Mr. Muntz,Kwik-E-Mart,"I also bought myself a candy bar -- which uh, unfortunately was filled with peanuts, to which I am allergic."
87543,338,236,1159000,Mr. Muntz,Kwik-E-Mart,I ran outside just as the circus was rolling into town.
87545,338,238,1175000,Bart Simpson,Big Top,...and that's where I found him.
87547,338,240,1178000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I brought him back here so he could take Nelson away and my bruises would heal.
87548,338,241,1183000,Mr. Muntz,Simpson Home,"I want to give you a home again, son."
87549,338,242,1186000,Mrs. Muntz,Simpson Home,And so do I.
87550,338,243,1187000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Mom!
87551,338,244,1188000,Mrs. Muntz,Simpson Home,I got an acting job! From the third director I slept with! I play Lady MacBeth. I don't have to take my top off -- but I do anyway.
87552,338,245,1199000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm glad everything worked out so well."
87553,338,246,1203000,Mr. Muntz,Simpson Home,"Yep, the Muntzes are back in business."
87554,338,247,1206000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Yep, the four Muntzes!"
87555,338,248,1212000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"Thanks for finding my Dad, Bart. And thanks, lady, for making me feel good about myself."
87556,338,249,1218000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, now that you're happy again, I guess you won't beat me up at school anymore."
87557,338,250,1223000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,I wish it were that simple. I really do.
87558,338,251,1231000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,They're a family again. And so are we. What happened?
87559,338,252,1237000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Sometimes you have to adopt your son's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer.
87560,338,253,1244000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And Lisa, what have you learned?"
87561,338,254,1246000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nothing. Like many women, I still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight."
87562,338,255,1251000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution, right?"
87563,338,256,1255000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess. But there's a long way to go.
87564,338,257,1260000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, say something conclusive."
87565,338,258,1262000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm afraid this is a very open-ended problem.
87566,338,259,1265000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Open-ended! C'mon, Lisa. Say everything's fine. Everything's fine."
87567,338,260,1272000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That was you.
87568,338,261,1274000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Prove it.
