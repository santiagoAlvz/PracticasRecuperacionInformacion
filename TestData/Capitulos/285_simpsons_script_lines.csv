72402,285,64,313000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Homer, for your eyes, the best tonic is chronic. You're not afraid, are you?"
72403,285,65,320000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,I had a bad experience with drugs...
72405,285,67,324000,Present-Day Homer,HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM,It was that golden weekend between Summer school and regular school...
72406,285,68,327000,Lenny Leonard,HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM,"Hey Homer, wanna smoke some marijuana?"

72429,285,91,449000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And now I'm guilty of possession! I could go to prison! Unless I testify against you...
72430,285,92,455000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, it's making my eyes better, and it's legal."
72431,285,93,458000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I could walk up to the President and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it.
72432,285,94,491000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hello?
72433,285,95,492000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I just realized: I am the ""ow"" in the word ""now"". And if you tell anyone..."

72435,285,97,508000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hello?
72436,285,98,509000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, it's me. I got Marge on the other line and she is totally bumming me out."

72439,285,101,523000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't. But now Daddy's special medicine...
72440,285,102,526000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Which you must never use because it will ruin your life, lets Daddy see and hear magical things you will never experience. Ever."
72441,285,103,536000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, it's one a.m. And I'm out of saliva."
72442,285,104,540000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sh-sh-sh.
148585,285,105,549000,Homer's Brain,Simpson Home,Wow. That saxophone would make a great pipe.
72443,285,106,556000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Hidilly-hey, Homer!"
72444,285,107,557000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my God, this dude does the best Flanders! You got the mustache and the didilly... Okay, now do Wiggum."

72446,285,109,568000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh-ho-ho-ho right, the God dude. Hey, I got a question for you."
72447,285,110,574000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Could Jesus microwave a burrito so hot, that He Himself could not eat it?"""
72448,285,111,574000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, sir, of course He could... but then again... Wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle."
72449,285,112,587000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now you know what I've been goin' through.
72450,285,113,589000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, luckily, I've got a book right here that's jam-packed with answers."
72451,285,114,593000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh man, this is long. Could you read it to me?"
72452,285,115,599000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,I guess that could be arranged.
72453,285,116,601000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,...The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. The End.
72454,285,117,604000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wow. Wow. God does so much for me. And he doesn't ask anything in return.
72455,285,118,612000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, I know he's wishin' you'd sign his petition...to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana."
72456,285,119,616000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Done and done. Now, do Wiggum."
72457,285,120,618000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, okay... I, I guess it would go something like this: All right, Simpson, you're under arrest, see?"
72458,285,121,625000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I said Wiggum!
72460,285,123,627000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"""And so, potential investors..."""
72461,285,124,627000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"""...I hope you don't think our IPO is an IPU."" Then I hold my nose thusly. What do you think, Smithers?"
72462,285,125,637000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"A bit of a downer, sir."
72463,285,126,639000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, I hope the investors like it. I have to raise sixty million dollars or we're out of business."
72464,285,127,643000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Why is that, sir?"
72465,285,128,645000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I told you, I pissed it away. Oh, don't make that face."
72466,285,129,649000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes, that's the one!"
72467,285,130,651000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Smithers, I need someone who laughs at all my jokes. You know, honest feedback."
72468,285,131,657000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oops! I thought this was the can, man."

72471,285,134,670000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, if you liked that, listen to this: ""Working hard... or hardly working?"""
72473,285,136,677000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Smithers, you could learn a thing or two from this braying moron. Young man, I'm making you my executive vice president."

72480,285,143,705000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, whoa, one question at a time. Yes, you?"
72481,285,144,709000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, I'm really starting to worry. There's half-eaten cupcakes everywhere, we're all out of paperclips, and the curtains smell like doob!"

72489,285,152,755000,Otto Mann,Simpson Home,Now I'm scared.
72490,285,153,757000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?"
72491,285,154,761000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"As soon as I graduate, I am so outta here."
