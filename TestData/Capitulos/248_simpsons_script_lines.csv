61226,248,48,350000,Lisa Simpson,Street Corner,"Suddenly, I was invited to every birthday party. Sometimes I'd have to read the cake just to know who I was singing to."

61261,248,83,556000,Moe Szyslak,Buckingham Palace,"Aw, Homer was spendin' money like a teenage Arab. He bought me a Rolex and, ah, cashmere jeans. I felt kinda guilty 'cause I was always trying to score with his wife. So, when do we start filming? Oh."
61262,248,84,571000,Lenny Leonard,Buckingham Palace,Even Bart was throwin' dough around. He paid me and Carl a thousand bucks to kiss each other.

61275,248,95,647000,Homer Simpson,Buckingham Palace,"Oh, my leg! This is the worst pain ever! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful! Owww!"
61276,248,96,651000,Homer Simpson,Buckingham Palace,Why did I take such punishment? Let's just say that fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug was the drugs.
61277,248,97,659000,Narrator,Buckingham Palace,"But despite their mounting problems, the Simpsons' star continued to rise..."
