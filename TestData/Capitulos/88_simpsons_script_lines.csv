16259,88,6,52000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Why do you read that ""Free"" column, Homer? They never have anything good."

16263,88,10,59000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,He said what now?
16264,88,11,59000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Please don't bring home anymore old crutches!
16266,88,13,67000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Oh no, you don't! That trampoline is MINE."
16267,88,14,76000,Homer Simpson,Street,Huh?
16269,88,16,76000,Krusty the Clown,Street,Hey! That seltzer ain't free.

16272,88,19,94000,Homer Simpson,Street,Yeah. What's the deal?
16273,88,20,94000,Krusty the Clown,Street,"Well, I used to do a lot of tumbling in my act, but I'm phasing it out for more dirty limericks. There once was a man named Enos --"
16274,88,21,102000,Homer Simpson,Street,And I can just haul it away? Free?
16276,88,22,106000,Krusty the Clown,Street,Yup. It's all yours.
16278,88,24,109000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"You're a good dog, arencha, boy? Arencha?"
16279,88,25,122000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Hi, son. Hi, son. Hi, son."
16280,88,26,127000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,WOWWW!!
16282,88,28,128000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,I can't believe it!
16283,88,29,134000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Dad, this one gesture almost makes up for years of shaky fathering."
16284,88,30,139000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Look at me! /
16285,88,31,142000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,I will never get tired of this.
16286,88,32,146000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,I'm going to have my wedding here.
16287,88,33,151000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,I don't know if this is a good idea.
16288,88,34,153000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Marge, it's the perfect exercise. It'll double the value of our house. And it was free. FREEEE!!"
16289,88,35,158000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Are you sure it's safe?
16290,88,36,158000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Absolutely! And this is just the beginning! I've got some big plans.
16291,88,37,168000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Backyard,It smells funny in there.
16292,88,38,168000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,No it doesn't!
16296,88,42,185000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Otto! You okay?
16297,88,43,195000,Otto Mann,Simpson Home,"Yeah, just pop my shoulder back in."
16298,88,44,195000,Otto Mann,Simpson Home,"Thanks, buddy... Hey, I lost my turn!"
16299,88,45,203000,Wendell Borton,Simpson Home,Ohh... My arm!
16300,88,46,205000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Wee! Ow, I bit my tongue!"
16301,88,47,208000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,Each leap brings us closer to God!
16302,88,48,211000,Todd Flanders,Simpson Home,"Catch me, Lord! Catch me!"
16303,88,49,215000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,What have we done to make God angry?
16304,88,50,215000,Todd Flanders,Simpson Home,You did it!
16305,88,51,219000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Stop jumping on me! I'm hurt!
16306,88,52,221000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, kids, once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump."
16307,88,53,226000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, this is terrible!"
16308,88,54,226000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, okay. I'll take care of it."
16309,88,55,233000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I told you this was a bad idea!
16310,88,56,247000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, all right! I'll get rid of the trampoline!"
16312,88,58,252000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Hey, Krusty! I'm bringing back the..."
16313,88,59,254000,Krusty the Clown,Street,You just keep right on drivin'.
16314,88,61,260000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,There we go.
16315,88,62,268000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,That's the last I'll see of Mr. Trampoline.
16316,88,63,272000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,"Yep, it's finally gone."
16317,88,64,275000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,"If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now."
16318,88,65,287000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge,I'm thirsty.
16321,88,68,294000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Checkmate, Mr. Trampoline."
16322,88,69,312000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, all right, you win for now, but some day you'll rust."
16323,88,70,318000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Rust I tell ya.
16324,88,71,318000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad. Dad! You really want to get rid of this trampoline?
16325,88,72,326000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-huh.
16326,88,73,328000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Observe - a bike lock.
16327,88,74,331000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Now just turn around and count to three.
16328,88,75,335000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"One, two, three."
16329,88,76,338000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, better make it five."
16330,88,77,340000,Snake Jailbird,Simpson Home,"All right, I got me a bed."
16331,88,78,344000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Simpson Home,Shh! Quiet! You'll wake up Ol' Man Simpson.
16332,88,79,347000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,"Hey, no more trampoline."
16333,88,80,350000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Simpson Home,Let's jump on the car instead.
16334,88,81,352000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. But you know what? At least I'm out there trying new things. If it were up to you, all we'd ever do is work and go to church!"
16335,88,82,365000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's not true.
16336,88,83,365000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.
16337,88,84,369000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I can name ten things! I... I made sloppy Joes...
16338,88,85,372000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's not fun!
16340,88,87,375000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Kids. Tell me the truth. Am I no fun? Do I just nag all the time?
16341,88,88,380000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Um... Uh, well... Uh..."
16342,88,89,393000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"See, Marge?"
16343,88,90,393000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I didn't realize people saw me that way.
16344,88,91,402000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Are you mad?
16345,88,92,402000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,No. I'm fine. I'm going to my sisters' now.
16346,88,93,408000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Living Room,"Ooh, careful there, Marge! Almost nicked me!"
16348,88,95,414000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Your blood pressure is off the chart.
16350,88,96,416000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,And I don't like this urine sample one bit.
16351,88,97,419000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,You're headed for a nervous breakdown. You need Brad Goodman.
16352,88,98,422000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,His infomercial plays round-the-clock on channel 77.
16353,88,99,426000,GOODMAN,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Thank you, Martha Quinn. There you have it - unrehearsed testimonies from important celebrities. She's one of my favorites. I loved her in the thing I saw her in. You know, my course can help you with every personality disorder in the ""Feel Bad"" rainbow."
16354,88,100,444000,GOODMAN,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Let's look at the rainbow. What's in there? Depression, insomnia, motor-mouth, darting eyes, indecisiveness, decisiveness, bossiness, uncontrollable falling down, Geriatric Profanity Disorder or GPD, and chronic nagging. Nagging, nagging, nagging..."
16355,88,101,460000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Sorry, it does that sometimes."
16357,88,103,467000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"What up, Marge?"
16358,88,104,469000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I'm watching a videotape that could change our lives.
147804,88,105,475000,TROY,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, hi. I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such self-help videos as ""Smoke Yourself Thin"" and ""Get Confident, Stupid."" Well now I'm here to tell you about the only real path to mental health. That's right, it's... the Brad Goodman... something or other."
16359,88,106,492000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Marge, can I go outside and play?"
16360,88,107,492000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Shhh!
147805,88,108,495000,TROY,Simpson Living Room,A few weeks ago I was a washed up actor with a drinking problem. Then Brad Goodman came along and gave me this job and a can of fortified wine.
147806,88,109,503000,TROY,Simpson Living Room,"Ahhh. Sweet liquor eases the pain. And now I'd like to introduce the man who will put the ""you"" in impr-you-vement... Brad Goodman!"
16361,88,110,510000,GOODMAN,Simpson Living Room,"Thank you so much, Troy. And by the way, I'm not happy you're still drinking. But at least you're down to one from more than fifty. Folks, I'm often asked about my qualifications. Well, I may not have a lot of ""credentials"" or ""training."" But I'll tell you one thing -- I'm a Ph.D. in Pain. Now let me show you how you can change your life."
16362,88,111,541000,GOODMAN,Simpson Living Room,"Troy, this circle is you."
147807,88,112,545000,TROY,Simpson Living Room,My God. It's like you've known me all my life.
147808,88,114,548000,TROY,Simpson Home,"Doctor, you've solved all my problems."
16364,88,116,548000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That video really opened my eyes. I can see that I'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. By nagging you when you do foolish things, I just enable your life-script."
16365,88,117,569000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And that sends me into a shame spiral.
16366,88,118,572000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Exactly! So from now on, I'm going to quit nagging and have more fun."
16367,88,119,579000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies?"
16368,88,120,582000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh-oh. You're in for it now, Dad."
16369,88,121,586000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now."
16370,88,122,589000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
16371,88,123,592000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And I feel that you hear my shame.
16372,88,124,594000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance."
16373,88,125,599000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I feel validated by that.
16374,88,126,599000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Good. I'm glad we had this talk.
16375,88,127,603000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Me too.
16376,88,128,609000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow! For free, ""SURPLUS DRUMS OF MAYONNAISE FROM OPERATION DESERT STORM."""
16377,88,129,614000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Brad Goodman is coming to town!
16378,88,130,617000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Marge, you and I are fine now. Who needs Brad Goodman?"
16381,88,133,628000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,"Well, here we are at the Brad Goodman lecture."
16382,88,134,631000,Lisa Simpson,Parking Lot,"We know, Dad."
16383,88,135,631000,Homer Simpson,Parking Lot,"I just thought I'd remind everybody. After all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar."
16384,88,136,636000,Bart Simpson,Parking Lot,What an odd thing to say.
16386,88,138,638000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"Thank you. Okay folks, let me hear what's troubling you. Don't be shy. Yell it out! Everybody, go!"
16387,88,139,646000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Auditorium,"I uh, can't commit to a relationship!"
16388,88,140,646000,C. Montgomery Burns,Auditorium,I'm too nice!
16389,88,141,650000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Auditorium,I have problems with...
16390,88,142,650000,Lenny Leonard,Auditorium,I'm always interrupting people!
16391,88,143,652000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"Okay. Okay. Right now I want each of you to try something interesting. There's no trick to it; it's just a simple trick. Now Close your eyes for a moment and really listen to that inner voice inside, your Inner Child. Listen, what's he saying?"
16392,88,144,671000,Flanders' Inner Child,Auditorium,"Stay the course, Big Ned. You're doin' super!"
16393,88,145,675000,Homer's Inner Child,Auditorium,Food goes in here.
16394,88,146,675000,Homer Simpson,Auditorium,It sure does!
16395,88,147,680000,Moe's Inner Child,Auditorium,"Hey, Moe. What's a matta? You no talka with your accent no more."
16396,88,148,682000,Moe Szyslak,Auditorium,Mamma mia!
16397,88,149,687000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"Principal Skinner, Let's try some rage work. I want you to pretend this dummy right here is your mother."
16398,88,150,694000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,Okay... I'll try.
16399,88,151,694000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"Tell this dummy mother exactly how you feel, right now."
16400,88,152,700000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,"I'm annoyed with you, Mother. Not just annoyed... Angry! I'm a grown man now! And I can run MY OWN LIFE!!"
16401,88,153,709000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"Shh. Shh. Calm down. Calm down. Aw, moving. You can sit down now..."
16402,88,154,716000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,"We're still going antiquing on Saturday, right, mother?"
16403,88,155,719000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"You see, folks? We're all trying to please someone else. And as soon as you're not a human BE-ING, you're a human DO-ING! Then what comes next?"
16404,88,156,731000,Bart Simpson,Auditorium,A human GOING!
16405,88,157,734000,Marge Simpson,Auditorium,Bart! Be quiet!
16406,88,158,738000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"Son, that's wonderful. Come here. Come up here."
16407,88,159,742000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,What made you yell out that remark?
16408,88,160,742000,Bart Simpson,Auditorium,I 'unno.
16409,88,161,746000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,You just wanted to express yourself. Yes?
16410,88,162,749000,Bart Simpson,Auditorium,I do what I feel like.
16411,88,163,749000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"That's marvelous! I-I couldn't have put it better myself. ""I do what I feel like."" People, this young man here IS the inner child I've been talking about."
16412,88,164,764000,Lisa Simpson,Auditorium,What!?
16413,88,165,764000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"Son, you've never read any of my books, have you?"
16414,88,166,768000,Bart Simpson,Auditorium,Earth to boring guy.
16415,88,167,768000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"That means no, eh? I'm not so old-fashioned. Your parents have done a fantastic job. Mama, Papa -- could you come up here?"
16416,88,168,782000,Homer Simpson,Auditorium,"Thank you. Very, very much."
16417,88,169,785000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"This is really remarkable. Here we have a man with an obvious eating disorder, and a woman with a bizarre hairstyle I'm sure worn only for shock value..."
16419,88,171,795000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,... and yet they've managed to raise an emotionally healthy son. That's fantastic.
16420,88,172,802000,Marge Simpson,Auditorium,"Oh, thank you."
16421,88,173,805000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"We can all learn a lot from this young man, here, this... this..."
16422,88,174,805000,Bart Simpson,Auditorium,Rudiger.
16423,88,175,808000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,Rudiger. And if we can all be more like little Rudiger...
16424,88,176,812000,Marge Simpson,Auditorium,His name is Bart.
16425,88,177,812000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"His name isn't important. What's important here is that this lad has fully developed ego integrity, with well-defined boundaries."
16427,88,179,824000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,"Ha ha. People, I am excited. I can sense a change in the air tonight. You are all gonna start living. Really living!"
16428,88,180,840000,Crowd,Auditorium,YAAAYYY! LI-VING! LI-VING!
16429,88,181,844000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,Be like the boy!
16430,88,182,844000,Crowd,Auditorium,BE-LIKE-BOY! BE-LIKE-BOY!
16431,88,183,848000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,Just the ladies!
16432,88,184,848000,Women In Crowd,Auditorium,BE-LIKE-BOY! BE-LIKE-BOY!
16433,88,185,852000,GOODMAN,Auditorium,Now the seniors in the back!
16434,88,186,852000,Old Folks,Auditorium,WE-LIKE-ROY! WE-LIKE-ROY!
16435,88,187,859000,Lisa Simpson,Auditorium,This is madness. He's just peddling a bunch of easy answers.
16436,88,188,869000,Carl Carlson,Auditorium,And how!
16437,88,189,869000,Kent Brockman,Auditorium,"A new mood is in the air in Springfield, as refreshing as a pre-moistened towelette. Folks are finally accepting their feelings and really communicating, with no holding back. And this reporter thinks it's about fucking time. Of course, all these good vibes can be traced to one feisty little scamp who taught us that if it feels good, do it."
16439,88,191,894000,Bart Simpson,Auditorium,"Lis, today I am a god."
16440,88,192,903000,Lisa Simpson,Auditorium,Is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich?
16441,88,193,905000,Bart Simpson,Auditorium,Ewww... uhh.
16443,88,195,905000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Now instead of my boring old sermon, I'm going to take a page from the book of Bart and do something I've always wanted to do."
16444,88,196,923000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Take five, Mrs. Fische."
16445,88,197,926000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Wait! Wait... I can do this.
16446,88,198,933000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Wait! wait... hold on.
16449,88,201,939000,MR. KRABAPPEL,Springfield Elementary School,The wireless was an invention by Guglielmo Marconi. Who can tell me what his first message was?
16450,88,202,947000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,I want-a to change-a my name-a!
147921,88,203,950000,KRABAPPEL,Springfield Elementary School,"Good one, Milhouse. Anyone else? The first message by wireless..."
16451,88,204,957000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,It was...
16452,88,205,957000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,Our 10th caller will receive tickets to 'Supertramp'.
16453,88,206,961000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Aw geez. Everybody's a comedian.
16455,88,208,965000,Bart Simpson,Overpass,I'm blue. Time for some of my patented spitting off the overpass.
16456,88,209,971000,Bart Simpson,Overpass,"Oh, man."
16458,88,211,971000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Lis, everyone in town is acting like me, so why does it suck?"
16459,88,212,985000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"It's simple, Bart. You've defined yourself as a rebel. And in the absence of a repressive milieu, your societal niche has been co-opted."

16520,88,273,1277000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's not fair. The lesson here is that self-improvement is better left to people who live in big cities.
16521,88,274,1283000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No! Self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick-fix. It's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery."

16529,88,282,1312000,MCGARNIGAL,Simpson Home,"You're off your case, Chief."
16530,88,283,1316000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"What does that mean, exactly?"
16531,88,284,1318000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It means he gets results, you stupid chief."
