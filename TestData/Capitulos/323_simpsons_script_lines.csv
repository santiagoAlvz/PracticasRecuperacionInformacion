83101,323,44,203000,Boris,Springfield,I'll show you what we do with scammers like you!
83103,323,46,207000,Boris,Boris' Car Loft,"Okay, here's how it goes: buyers never tell you what they're willing to spend. And when they talk privately, we spy on them through this one-way mirror."
83104,323,47,213000,Homer Simpson,Boris' Car Loft,We'll clean out those stupid Americans.
83105,323,48,218000,Homer Simpson,Boris' Car Loft,"...you probably want to talk this over, so I'll leave you two ""alone."" Excuse me."

83112,323,55,270000,Homer Simpson,Boris' Car Loft,"Cool, an ambulance from the '60s! I bet a lotta hippies were denied care in this thing. Injured hippies!"
83113,323,56,279000,Boris,Boris' Car Loft,"We'll never sell this thing. The brakes are shot, the engine's rusted. The only thing that works is the siren."

83115,323,58,290000,Homer Simpson,Boris' Car Loft,I'll do it!

83123,323,66,310000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I think it's cool. I can defibrillate Lisa!"
83124,323,67,313000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Not if I pump your heart full of morphine first!
83125,323,68,316000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, kids. Those aren't your toys. They're to keep Daddy asleep and awake."
83126,323,69,325000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna need them on my first shift tonight.
83127,323,70,327000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Tonight? But I was hoping you could watch the kids while I work on my novel.
83128,323,71,330000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Slow down, Picasso! You were gonna start a novel without informing me?"
83129,323,72,334000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call."
83130,323,73,340000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I also fed some ducklings.
83131,323,74,342000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I know -- I got your message.

83136,323,79,356000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmm... what should I write about?
83137,323,80,360000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That painting has always sparked my imagination.
83138,323,81,367000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it. A novel about whaling -- that's something you haven't seen before. Thank you...

83155,323,97,432000,Bart Simpson,Ambulance,"Dad, you've been driving in circles for twenty minutes."
83156,323,98,435000,Lisa Simpson,Ambulance,Why don't you just admit you don't know where the hospital is?
83157,323,99,438000,Homer Simpson,Ambulance,Why don't you admit I know it's around here somewhere?
83159,323,101,441000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"For Temperance, the days passed on... as did seven of her ten children."
83161,323,103,448000,Bartleby,EVERGREEN MANOR,When will father return from his whaling voyage?

83171,323,113,493000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need some dinner, stat! And the kids need some CPR lessons."

83173,323,115,500000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll say.
83174,323,116,502000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh good, you can use that to take down my dinner order. I'll start with the soup, then a nice mixed grill with a side of wild rice."
83175,323,117,509000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. Right after this revision!
83176,323,118,512000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Temperance had to face the unhappy truth...
83178,323,120,512000,Marge Simpson,Nantucket House,...she had married a brute.
83179,323,121,517000,Captain Mordecai,Nantucket House,"Hey, baby. I've returned from Portsmouth. Now let me put my tongue down Yourmouth."
83146,323,122,526000,Captain Mordecai,Nantucket House,Now cook up my catch.

83183,323,126,533000,Captain Mordecai,Nantucket House,"Yeah, yeah. You know everything, don't ya? Now don't wait up. I'll be at Moab's."
83185,323,128,539000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"This story is as dark as those new Milky Way bars. Ooh, that's a good analogy. I'll work it in somewhere. But now I need some romance, pronto!"
83186,323,129,549000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Hey Marge, you look like you could use a nice big stud... detector."
83187,323,130,553000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"They were two for one at Krusty Home Depot, so I got an extra one for you guys!"
83188,323,131,558000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ned, that's so considerate."
83189,323,132,560000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, some say being thoughtful is old-fashioned. If so, then I guess I'm just a cave man. If they existed, which they didn't!"
83190,323,133,568000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boy, when you write you can let your imagination run wild. ""Temperance was doing the laundry..."""
83192,323,135,574000,FLANDERS' VOICE,Nantucket,"My, those are pretty calluses. And your back has a nice New England hump."
83193,323,136,585000,CYRUS MANLEY,Nantucket,"I'm Cyrus Manley, and I'm new to the island. Perhaps you could show me around?"
83194,323,137,590000,Temperance,Nantucket,Nantucket is an island?
83196,323,139,591000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What do you know? It is!
83197,323,140,594000,Temperance,Simpson Home,"Well, I could take you on a tour. As long as my husband doesn't need me."
83198,323,141,598000,Captain Mordecai,Simpson Home,"Hey baby, I know we work together, but I think you're hot."
83199,323,142,609000,Temperance,Simpson Home,Let's go.
83201,323,144,611000,Temperance,Beach,I've never met a man like you. You listen to what I say... your body has known the cleansing touch of soap... prithee tell me thou art not a Sodomite.
83202,323,145,620000,CYRUS MANLEY,Beach,"Nope. Not even a Gomorrahian. Oh Temperance, I've got an overpowering urge to see you with your hat off."
83203,323,146,628000,Temperance,Beach,I can't... I must remember my wedding vows.
83204,323,147,633000,CYRUS MANLEY,Beach,"Did you promise to be miserable, to be taken for granted by a drunken lout?"
83205,323,148,636000,Temperance,Beach,Pretty much. We wrote our own vows.
83206,323,149,639000,CYRUS MANLEY,Beach,Enough talk! I need to see how you look... up there!
83207,323,150,643000,CYRUS MANLEY,Beach,And to think my mother had one of those.
83209,323,152,648000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm finished! And it's so suggestive. But like they say, ""snuggling sells."" Now, do I dare push ""print?"""
83211,323,154,672000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, what do you think?"
83212,323,155,674000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hm...
83213,323,156,675000,Jealousy,Simpson Home,I can't believe Mom wrote a book before we did.
83214,323,157,680000,Honesty,Simpson Home,And it's a little trashy.
83215,323,158,681000,Conscience,Simpson Home,Mom has expressed herself. We should nurture her!
83216,323,159,684000,Libido,Simpson Home,Let's kiss boys. Binge and purge. Rock and roll!
83217,323,160,688000,Conscience,Simpson Home,You're not gettin' out 'til we're sixteen!
83219,323,162,695000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm proud of you, Mom. But just one thing: isn't your book a little hard on Dad?"
83220,323,163,699000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What do you mean? My book is set in whaling times.
83221,323,164,704000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Captain Mordecai stared at the shop window full of powdered blowholes. 'Mmm, blowholes,' he drooled."" Sounds like Dad to me."
83222,323,165,713000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I guess that part is loosely based on your father."
83223,323,166,717000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe you should let Dad read your book before you submit it to publishers.
83224,323,167,721000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I suppose I better. Your father's a very private person.
83225,323,168,725000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge! We're out of bath towels.
83226,323,169,728000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, ice cream truck!"

83230,323,173,743000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's really important that you read it and tell me what you think.
83231,323,174,747000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No problem.
83232,323,175,749000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Two hundred and eighty-six pages!
83233,323,176,751000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's double-spaced.
83234,323,177,752000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo! I'm half-way through!
83235,323,178,754000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, ""Chapter One."" Hm, that makes sense. ""There once was a girl from Nantucket..."" Good, good... ""Her name was Temperance Barrows and her heart was heavy with feeling. She..."""
83236,323,179,765000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No! Gotta read Marge's book. Can't get distracted. Hm... ""distracted,"" that's a funny word. Does anyone ever get ""tracted?"" Let me call the suicide hotline and ask them."

83243,323,186,804000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh that's wonderful. And the characters didn't bother you at all?
83244,323,187,809000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No! They were all in their own way totally awesome.
83245,323,188,813000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And you're fine with me trying to get it published?
83246,323,189,816000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"As I've always said: ""publish or perish""!"

Would I say ""If you're hunting for a good read this October, Marge Simpson's book is a clear and present danger to your free time?"" Hell no, I wouldn't. What do you mean I just said it?

83256,323,200,875000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"If Dad ever reads that book, he's gonna be so humiliated."
83257,323,201,879000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,He'll never read it.
83258,323,202,880000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,What if they make it into a movie?
83259,323,203,882000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,He'll never see it.
83260,323,204,883000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,What if they parody it on Mad TV?

83271,323,214,920000,Otto Mann,Bookaccino's,"And on page seventy-two, Temperance's name changes to Marge for three paragraphs!"
83273,323,216,926000,Springfieldites,Springfield,Can you believe Marge... Homer doesn't know... Marge... Homer...
83274,323,217,933000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield,"Can you believe that Homer and Marge's marriage is just a sham? All right, I'll order. Um, I'll have a medium pepperoni. And can you space out the meat so it spells ""happy birthday Moe""? Oh, God I'm alone."
83276,323,219,949000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Apu, do you sell Crazy Straws? I've got a guy with a broken back and I'm tryin' to cheer him up."

83279,323,222,960000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Nothing, nothing. It just seems your wife has an ""active imagination."""
83280,323,223,965000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Why do you keep talking that way?!
83281,323,224,967000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,You'll see when you read your wife's book.
83282,323,225,970000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, then maybe I will."
83283,323,226,973000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,If you do you'll see she lusts for Flanders.
83284,323,227,978000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,That one I got.
83285,323,228,980000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,This is how you talk when you learn English from porno movies.
83287,323,230,985000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"I'll have to read Marge's book. And I swore never to read again after ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" gave me no useful advice on killing mockingbirds. It did teach me not to judge a man based on the color of his skin, but what good does that do me?"
83289,323,232,998000,Homer Simpson,Ambulance,"""The Harpooned Heart."" Book on tape! As read by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen."

83297,323,238,1031000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How can you write such horrible things about me?
83298,323,239,1034000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You told me you liked it! You didn't read it at all! You lied to me!
83299,323,240,1039000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't lie. I was writing fiction with my mouth.
83300,323,241,1043000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Just tell me how much of this is true!
83301,323,242,1044000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... there is a place called Nantucket.
83302,323,243,1047000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I knew it! And what about the romance between you and Cyrus?
83303,323,244,1052000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It was only my imagination.

83315,323,256,1074000,Nelson Muntz,Flanders Home,Stealin' doormats.
83317,323,258,1082000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad's gonna catch Flanders, just like the end of Mom's book."
83318,323,259,1085000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah. How does that go again?
83319,323,260,1087000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Didn't you read Mom's book?
83320,323,261,1091000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fine, I'll tell you how it ends. The brutish Captain Mordecai has cornered his rival, Cyrus..."
83322,323,263,1096000,CYRUS MANLEY,Nantucket,"Put that harpoon down, Captain. You wouldn't kill the father of your next child, would you? Oops."
83324,323,265,1107000,CYRUS MANLEY,Nantucket,Temperance! I'll treasure your memory as long as I--

83332,323,274,1145000,Ned Flanders,Flanders's Car,"Well, he's got me there."
83334,323,276,1163000,Ned Flanders,Cliff,"Dear Lord, please make Homer's blows precise and deadly with a minimum of pain. Oh, and forgive me for those impure thoughts I had about the girl on the raisin box."
83335,323,277,1172000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,"Flanders, I'm gonna do something I shoulda done a long time ago."
83336,323,278,1181000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,Would you help me be a better husband?
83337,323,279,1183000,Ned Flanders,Cliff,Huh?
83338,323,280,1184000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,In Marge's book I was so mean and you were so nice. How can I be more like you? Just give me some advice.
83339,323,281,1192000,Ned Flanders,Cliff,Advice? Just call me Ann Flanders!
83340,323,282,1196000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,Uh-huh.
83341,323,283,1199000,Ned Flanders,Cliff,"Oh, and another thing..."
83342,323,284,1200000,Marge Simpson,Cliff,"Please Homie, don't hurt him!"
83343,323,285,1203000,Ned Flanders,Cliff,...and a backrub can just be a backrub. It doesn't have to lead to adult situations.
83344,323,286,1208000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,"Why would I rub her back unless I wanted to get some... oh, to make her feel good."
83345,323,287,1213000,Marge Simpson,Cliff,"Oh, Homie! You're trying to improve yourself, and it's because of my book."
83346,323,288,1218000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,"That's right. I love you Marge, and I realize now I should show you more often. The end of your book was the wakeup call I needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book."
83347,323,289,1228000,Marge Simpson,Cliff,That's the best review I've gotten. Seriously. These reviews are terrible.
83348,323,290,1234000,Homer Simpson,Cliff,"Don't worry about those losers, Marge. I think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own."
83350,323,292,1247000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Marge, I've got it all figured out: Lee Harvey Oswald wanted to steal the Jack Ruby."
83351,323,293,1254000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Jack Ruby was a man, not a jewel."
83352,323,294,1258000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"All right, we're back to square one. Put on some coffee."
