151773,10,224,927000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Well... Uh... Wine 'em, dine 'em, bring 'em flowers, write 'em love poetry, sir."
151774,10,225,933000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Of course! It's simplicity itself! I won't forget this, Simpson. Now return to your work, and tell no one of what transpired here."
151776,10,227,948000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Anybody home?
151777,10,228,949000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hi, Daddy."
151778,10,229,951000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Welcome back, Dad."
151779,10,230,953000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How's your Mom?
151780,10,231,955000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Still kinda ticked off.
151781,10,232,957000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, good luck, man."
151782,10,233,960000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, thanks, boy."
151783,10,234,963000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, Marge. It's me. Homer."
151784,10,235,966000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you still mad?... You are still mad. No need to say it. I'm your loving husband. I can read you like a book. I'll just have some milk.
151785,10,236,977000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, I'm not drinking out of the carton. Come on, Marge. Please forgive me? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
151786,10,237,989000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer! You don't even know why you're apologizing.
151787,10,238,992000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes I do. Because I'm hungry... my clothes are smelly... and I'm tired.
151788,10,239,997000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've been thinking, Homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? You taught Bart a very bad lesson. Your boy idolizes you."
151789,10,240,1006000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, he does not!"
151790,10,241,1007000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes he does, Homer. And when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay. You owe your son better than that, Homer."
151791,10,242,1015000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So what should I do, Marge?"
151792,10,243,1017000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I think you should take Bart to meet this exotic belly-person. I want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings. I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her."
151793,10,244,1031000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay. Your wish is my command, my little..."
151794,10,245,1034000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Do it!
151796,10,247,1042000,Manager,Florence of Arabia,Princess Kashmir? You must mean April Flowers. She's working over at the Girlesque.
151797,10,248,1046000,Bart Simpson,Florence of Arabia,Oooo.
151799,10,250,1053000,Homer Simpson,Girlesque,"You see, I'm trying to teach my son here about treating woman as objects."
151801,10,251,1057000,Man At Door,Girlesque,That's a good idea. But April's over at Foxy Boxing tonight.
151803,10,253,1060000,Ticket-seller,Foxy Boxing,Just let me say that it is an honor to have Springfield's number-one swinger with us to--
151804,10,254,1065000,Homer Simpson,Foxy Boxing,Forget that. I'm teaching my boy a lesson. Is she here or not?
151805,10,255,1068000,Ticket-seller,Foxy Boxing,Nahhh. Try the Club Mud.
151807,10,257,1071000,Homer Simpson,Club Mud,Marge. Marge. We're gonna try one more place. The Sapphire Lounge. Bart! I said look at the floor!

151814,10,264,1096000,Homer Simpson,Sapphire Lounge,"Look, I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an object."
151815,10,265,1096000,Princess Kashmir,Sapphire Lounge,Uh-huh.
151816,10,266,1100000,Homer Simpson,Sapphire Lounge,"I also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly. I want him to meet the woman behind all the spangles and glitter and find out that she has thoughts and feelings, too."
151817,10,267,1109000,Princess Kashmir,Sapphire Lounge,"Oh, okay, but can we make it quick?"
151818,10,268,1111000,Bart Simpson,Sapphire Lounge,"Nice to meet you, ma'am."
151819,10,269,1113000,Homer Simpson,Sapphire Lounge,Could you tell him a little about yourself?
151820,10,270,1115000,Princess Kashmir,Sapphire Lounge,"Well, um... my real name's Shawna Tifton, my pet peeve is rude people. And my turn ons include silk sheets and a warm fire place."

151825,10,275,1148000,Homer Simpson,Sapphire Lounge,Oh no.

151837,10,286,1224000,Homer Simpson,Sapphire Lounge,Hep... heyyy... whoooo... look out... yeah... Da da da da da.
151838,10,287,1232000,C. Montgomery Burns,Sapphire Lounge,"How does he do it, Smithers?"
151839,10,288,1234000,Waylon Smithers,Sapphire Lounge,"He's a love machine, sir."
151840,10,289,1238000,Bart Simpson,Sapphire Lounge,Way to go dad!
151841,10,290,1239000,Homer Simpson,Sapphire Lounge,Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop the music... Quiet please... I have something to say. Quiet!

151844,10,293,1259000,Homer Simpson,Sapphire Lounge,"Quiet! I have something to say to all the sons out there; to all the boys; to all the men; to all of us. It's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy. No, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews -- well, not our nephews -- they are our mothers. And you know something, folks? As ridiculous as it sounds, I would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as I sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's G-string. Am I wrong, or am I right?"
151845,10,294,1302000,Theatre-goer #2,Sapphire Lounge,My wife gets the cutest little thing right here when she smiles.
151846,10,295,1307000,Theatre-goer #1,Sapphire Lounge,That's my Suzie.
151847,10,296,1307000,Theatre-goer #3,Sapphire Lounge,She's so cute. Here's mine.
151848,10,297,1313000,Gulliver Dark,Sapphire Lounge,"You know, my Mom sounded a little down the other day. I better give her a call."
151849,10,298,1317000,Marge Simpson,Sapphire Lounge,Homer!
151850,10,299,1317000,Homer Simpson,Sapphire Lounge,Marge!
151851,10,300,1326000,Bart Simpson,Sapphire Lounge,"All right, folks show's over. No more to see, folks. Only sick people want to see my folks kiss."
