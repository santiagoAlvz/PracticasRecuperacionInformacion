102520,395,87,391000,Troll Moe,EARTHLAND REALMS,"What? No, my character's supposed to look like me. Why does everyone keep thinking I'm a troll?"

102522,395,89,413000,VENDOR APU,EARTHLAND REALMS,"The Shadow Knight! Where he rides, death is sure to follow."

102550,395,116,510000,Troll Moe,EARTHLAND REALMS,"Uh, what can I get ya, Mr. Shadow Knight, sir? Grog? Grog light? Diet grog with lemon?"
102551,395,117,516000,Shadow Knight,EARTHLAND REALMS,Just wring the blood from this pixie head.
102552,395,118,519000,Troll Moe,EARTHLAND REALMS,"Yes, sir."

102561,395,127,554000,Elf Marge,EARTHLAND REALMS,"If they think less of you because of me, then they're not really your minions."
102562,395,128,559000,Bart Simpson,EARTHLAND REALMS,I am going off to explore the Crevices of Lagrimmar.
102563,395,129,561000,Elf Marge,EARTHLAND REALMS,"Great, I'll come with you. Shouldn't you bundle up? Here, let me enchant your pants."
102566,395,132,567000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Lisa, self-conscious about your shins? In my day, girls were worried about their boobs."
102567,395,133,573000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I'm going to play soccer."
102568,395,134,578000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I fell in love with the game when I saw ""Bend It Like Beckham."""

102575,395,140,594000,East Indian Father,Movie Theater,His father is an important business acquaintance of mine. Love counts for nothing!
102576,395,141,598000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Movie Theater,"You tell her, Mr. Dhanabhai -- Business contacts are more important than love!"
102578,395,143,603000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait, that's soccer? I always called it ""human foosball."" Would you like me to take you to your game?"
102579,395,144,609000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You already promised you would.
102580,395,145,611000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Do I have to?
102582,395,147,614000,Krusty the Clown,SOCCER FIELD,"Uh-huh. Okay, Morty, I'll tell them. Sorry, ladies. We got no referee, so the game's been canceled. I'm sorry. I'm sure you're very disappointed."
102583,395,148,627000,Lisa Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,What happened to the ref?
102584,395,149,628000,Krusty the Clown,SOCCER FIELD,He quit! Being a ref is a thankless job... the parents hate ya... the only upside is the kids share their snack with you.
102585,395,150,635000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,"Did someone say ""snack""?"
102586,395,151,638000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,I'll be your ref!
102588,395,153,642000,Lisa Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,"Dad, where'd you get that outfit?"

102590,395,155,648000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,"What'sa matter, buddy? The American flag not good enough for ya?"

102594,395,159,669000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,So... tired.
102596,395,161,675000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,Could someone bring me another barf cone?
102597,395,162,678000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,So... I thought it went real well. Until I swallowed the whistle.
102598,395,163,683000,Lisa Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,"You don't even know the rules! This could be my new thing, and you're turning it into a joke!"
102599,395,164,688000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,Hilarious joke?
102600,395,165,690000,Lisa Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,"Sadly, no. I'm disappointed with the way you acted today... but I'm not surprised."
102602,395,167,708000,Elf Marge,EARTHLAND REALMS,"Oh, let's see, should I take the ""Trail of Death,"" or the ""Path of Doom?"" Maybe I should just go back."
102604,395,169,718000,C. Montgomery Burns,EARTHLAND REALMS,Is this Wall Street Journal online?
102605,395,171,724000,Rogue Dolph,EARTHLAND REALMS,"Well, well -- looks like something's finally about to happen in this game."
102606,395,172,728000,Rogue Kearney,EARTHLAND REALMS,Just in time. I was about to go to the Pottery Barn site to get design ideas.
102607,395,173,735000,Rogue Jimbo,EARTHLAND REALMS,It's the Shadow Knight!
102608,395,174,737000,Rogue Dolph,EARTHLAND REALMS,Run!

102618,395,184,763000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,"Thanks, honey. After what you said to me, I watched hours and hours of soccer. I almost saw a goal! But there were so many ads for Spanish cell phones..."

102621,395,187,787000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,Foul on twenty-three!
102622,395,188,788000,Helen Lovejoy,SOCCER FIELD,That's crazy! Your daughter just tripped on her own clumsy feet!

102626,395,192,799000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,I said foul on twenty-three!
102627,395,193,804000,Helen Lovejoy,SOCCER FIELD,"You are so blind, even Jesus couldn't heal you!"

102630,395,196,822000,Lisa Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,Ow! She tripped me. Ow! Owww!
102631,395,197,829000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,"Foul on the other girl. Lisa gets a penalty kick, and every other kid has to pay her a dollar!"
102632,395,198,834000,Brandine Del Roy,SOCCER FIELD,That is an outrage! Your daughter's been floppin' all day!
102633,395,199,837000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,She has not! Your daughter's a dirty player!

102644,395,209,888000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,"When I put on these shorts, I'm not your father anymore. And judging by how tight they are, I'm never gonna be anyone else's either."
102645,395,210,896000,Lisa Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,This is what I think of your yellow card!
102646,395,211,898000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,Un-sportsman-like conduct.
102647,395,212,900000,Homer Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,That's a red card. You're out of the game!
102648,395,213,903000,Lisa Simpson,SOCCER FIELD,"But, but..."

102652,395,217,915000,Bart Simpson,EARTHLAND REALMS,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me just put this holy grail in my trophy room."
102654,395,219,919000,Bart Simpson,TROPHY ROOM,Where's all my stuff?!
102655,395,220,922000,Elf Marge,TROPHY ROOM,I thought all the swords and severed heads were kind of gory so I redecorated using the Hello Kitty expansion pack.

102657,395,222,936000,Bart Simpson,TROPHY ROOM,Mom? Mom?
102659,395,224,939000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I was killed... by my own son.
102660,395,225,946000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How could you kill your own mother?
102661,395,226,948000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It was just a game. A game I used to enjoy before you mommed all over it.
102662,395,227,951000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, sweetie, I was just following the rules."
102663,395,228,954000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Great. The one time you actually do something right, you ruin my life."
102664,395,229,961000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I think I'll go to bed.
102665,395,230,963000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's five in the afternoon!

102676,395,241,989000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Lisa's mad at me and Marge is mad at him.
102677,395,242,992000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I'm just the bartender here, but it seems to me you could win Lisa back by appealing to her sense of reason. And you could win your Mom back by appealing to her feelings."
102678,395,243,1001000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Gee Moe, you give great advice."
102679,395,244,1004000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Yeah. What have you done with the real Moe?

102707,395,273,1148000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You were right to kick me out of that game. Soccer was making me insane, just as it did the continents of Europe and South America."

102716,395,282,1181000,Shadow Knight,EARTHLAND REALMS,"Wait! Stop! If you kill me, I'll egg your houses in real life!"
102717,395,283,1187000,Enchantress Krabappel,EARTHLAND REALMS,It's still worth it!
102718,395,284,1190000,Satyr Largo,EARTHLAND REALMS,I live in a loft!

102729,395,295,1256000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no. I'm fine."
102730,395,296,1260000,Troll Moe,Simpson Home,Why am I payin' fourteen ninety-five a month for this?
