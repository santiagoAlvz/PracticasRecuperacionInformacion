95652,369,7,56000,Marge Simpson,Cave,"""Local Anahoopi Indians believed this stalactite was the finger of Tsisnajini, their God of pointing down."""
95653,369,8,56000,Homer Simpson,Cave,Silly Indians. Our God made their god.
95654,369,9,73000,Lisa Simpson,Cave,It's so impressive.
95655,369,10,75000,Homer Simpson,Cave,I'm just gonna get a tiny chip to put on my desk at work.
95658,369,13,88000,Homer Simpson,HOLE,"Save me, Tsisnajini!"
95660,369,15,98000,Homer Simpson,Underground Chamber,I'm stuck! And I have to pee. Now I'm just stuck.
95661,369,16,107000,Marge Simpson,Underground Chamber,"Don't worry, Homer. We'll get that fireman who cut you out of that teacup ride."
95662,369,17,113000,Bart Simpson,Underground Chamber,"That was two firemen, a crane and Snow White."
95663,369,18,115000,Homer Simpson,Underground Chamber,Why you little...!

95673,369,28,141000,Lisa Simpson,Underground Chamber,"Oh. All right, um, I'll tell you something that happened to me last week. I was walking home from school..."
95675,369,30,149000,Lisa Simpson,Field,...when suddenly I heard...
95676,369,31,153000,Lisa Simpson,Field,"Hello, Mr. Bighorn Sheep!"
95677,369,32,156000,Lisa Simpson,Field,"I've read about you. You're shy, and you rarely approach humans!"

95700,369,57,238000,Lisa Simpson,TOWER ATTIC ROOM,Maybe Mr. Smithers will help us.
95701,369,58,241000,C. Montgomery Burns,TOWER ATTIC ROOM,"No, he's out getting a spray-on tan. He comes back orange and stains the furniture -- the man's a walking creamsicle!"
95702,369,59,249000,Lisa Simpson,TOWER ATTIC ROOM,You worked at Moe's?
95703,369,60,252000,C. Montgomery Burns,TOWER ATTIC ROOM,Yes -- and therein lies a tale of woe and heartbreak. One I couldn't possibly recount.
95704,369,61,258000,Lisa Simpson,TOWER ATTIC ROOM,I understand. I'll just read a magazine.
95705,369,62,261000,C. Montgomery Burns,TOWER ATTIC ROOM,"Okay, here's the story: I belong to a very exclusive club -- The Excluders' Club..."
95707,369,64,268000,C. Montgomery Burns,EXCLUDERS' CLUB,"One day, while I was savoring the exclusivity--"
95708,369,65,270000,Homer Simpson,EXCLUDERS' CLUB,"Wait, wait, wait, wait..."
95710,369,67,272000,Homer Simpson,Cave,Now you're telling me Burns's story?
95711,369,68,275000,Lisa Simpson,Cave,"Yeah -- it's like the play within a play in ""Hamlet."""
95712,369,69,278000,Homer Simpson,Cave,Huh?
95713,369,70,278000,Lisa Simpson,Cave,Let's see... It's like when you watch old home movies of you watching TV.
95714,369,71,282000,Homer Simpson,Cave,Gotcha.
95716,369,73,284000,C. Montgomery Burns,EXCLUDERS' CLUB,One day a new member arrived at the club...

95719,369,76,297000,C. Montgomery Burns,EXCLUDERS' CLUB,Nuclear power. I make money using my brain... not sticking a pole in the ground and praying for goo.
95720,369,77,305000,The Rich Texan,EXCLUDERS' CLUB,"You need to get your hands dirty, Poindexter! Dip 'em in a little Texas crude!"

95723,369,80,320000,The Rich Texan,EXCLUDERS' CLUB,You got it! A bullet in the brain at high noon!
95724,369,81,327000,Mr. Burns's Reflection,EXCLUDERS' CLUB,"At my age, that could kill me!"
95725,369,82,329000,C. Montgomery Burns,EXCLUDERS' CLUB,How about we settle things with a scavenger hunt?
95726,369,83,331000,The Rich Texan,EXCLUDERS' CLUB,"You're on, Twiggy!"

95745,369,102,420000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"With nowhere else to turn, I spent the first three days with relatives."
95747,369,104,425000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Cemetery,"I had to get a job. And I had to start at the bottom. But to get to the bottom, I had to work my way up from Moe's."

95754,369,111,452000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,I'm a little busy. Can I do it later?
95755,369,112,455000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Sure! You're gonna be all ""I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid!"""
95757,369,114,464000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Burns sure will look like a jerk later!
95758,369,115,466000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,"At five-fifteen an hour, it would take an eternity to make my fortune back -- and FICA wasn't helping."
95759,369,116,474000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,"But then, for once in my life, things went my way."
95760,369,117,483000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,I steamed the letter open with Moe's cappuccino machine.
95761,369,118,486000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"If you're reading this, I am dead, and you are about to learn the story of my treasure."
95762,369,119,492000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,Treasure?!
95764,369,121,493000,Lisa Simpson,Tower Room,Treasure?!
95766,369,123,495000,Homer Simpson,Cave,Moe has a cappuccino machine??!!
95768,369,125,503000,Marge Simpson,CHAMBER OF CAVE,We couldn't find a way out.
95769,369,126,505000,Bart Simpson,CHAMBER OF CAVE,"But on the upside, I found some cave paintings and made them awesome."

95778,369,135,522000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,It was the first day of summer...
95780,369,137,526000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield,"...I was headin' to the restaurant supply store to buy some urinal-cake mix, when I was suddenly sideswiped by love."
95781,369,138,535000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield,"There she was -- the gorgeous new girl in town, Edna Krabappel."
95782,369,139,541000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield,"Oh, you poor man."
95783,369,140,543000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield,"She had gossamer hair, limpid eyes and the rack of an angel."
95784,369,141,549000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield,"I see you're new to town -- maybe I could uh, show you around? I know a terrific tavern..."
95785,369,142,553000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield,"Ha! My ex-husband was a drunk. I hate bars, saloons, nightclubs, and most of all... taverns."
95786,369,143,561000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield,"Oh, yeah, me too! Why, that's why I'm not a tavern keeper."
95787,369,144,564000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield,What do you do for a living?
95788,369,145,566000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield,"Me? Well, I, uh, for a living? Well, there's all kinds of things a fella can do, such as... hemming, and hawing, and uh, but me, I'm a highly respected uh... therapist for alcoholics."
95790,369,147,581000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"I knew that in order to win her love, I needed to get rid of the human garbage otherwise known as my best friends."
95791,369,148,594000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Barney, how do you keep gettin' back in?"
95792,369,149,596000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,I'm a drunk. I don't know nothin' about how I do anything.
95794,369,151,604000,Moe Szyslak,Country Road,"For one sweet summer, I was a true gentleman. As a result of which, Krabappel was lettin' me do her."
95795,369,152,617000,Moe Szyslak,Country Road,"So, Mrs. Krabappel, you got any plans?"
95796,369,153,620000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Country Road,"In the fall, I'll be teaching fourth grade at Springfield Elementary."
95797,369,154,624000,Moe Szyslak,Country Road,Aw that's great -- wonderful bunch of kids.
95798,369,155,627000,Martin Prince,Country Road,Lab partners don't treat lab partners like this.
95799,369,156,631000,Nelson Muntz,Country Road,Shut up and attract lightning!
95801,369,158,637000,Moe Szyslak,Upscale Restaurant,"Edna, you've made me feel love where before there was only pain."
95802,369,159,641000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Upscale Restaurant,"C'mere, you."
95803,369,160,645000,Moe Szyslak,Upscale Restaurant,Aw geez.
95804,369,161,646000,Homer Simpson,Upscale Restaurant,"Hey Moe! Thanks to you, I've been sober a week!"
95806,369,163,649000,Carl Carlson,Upscale Restaurant,"Yeah, me too."
95807,369,164,649000,Lenny Leonard,Upscale Restaurant,We're all sober.
95808,369,165,651000,Moe Szyslak,Upscale Restaurant,"Uh, these are some of the local alcoholics I told you about."
95809,369,166,654000,Carl Carlson,Upscale Restaurant,"Don't pigeonhole us, we have other vices."
95810,369,167,657000,Lenny Leonard,Upscale Restaurant,I dress up like a baby!
95811,369,168,659000,Moe Szyslak,Upscale Restaurant,"C'mon guys, lemme give you some counseling over here."
95813,369,169,663000,Moe Szyslak,Upscale Restaurant,"Listen booze-bags, I got a good thing goin' here. If you mess it up, I will ""out"" the one of you that is gay."
95815,369,171,672000,Moe Szyslak,Upscale Restaurant,"So uh, where were we?"
95817,369,173,677000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"I had to get Edna out of Springfield -- make a fresh start in a new town, far away. A place where we can play bridge with our neighbors. And if they're interested in wife-swapping, who am I to say no? I'm just the new guy."
95818,369,174,689000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"But where would I get the money to start a new life? And then, opportunity strolled right in the door..."
95819,369,175,698000,Snake Jailbird,Moe's Tavern,"Yes, hello. I need directions to the Springfield Natural History Museum. I totally have a donation for them."
95820,369,176,706000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Coins money gold!
95821,369,177,708000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"See, this was back before Snake became a notorious jailbird, when he was an idealistic, law-abiding young archaeologist."
95822,369,178,715000,Snake Jailbird,Moe's Tavern,"I was, like, excavating this Mayan pyramid and I totally unearth these gold coins and I'm all like ""could you be any more pre-Columbian?"""
95823,369,179,723000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, you can't donate that gold to the museum today, 'cause um... uh it's closed, so they can clean under the wangs on the statues."
95824,369,180,731000,Snake Jailbird,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, well no problem. I'll just spend the night in that motel across the street."
95825,369,181,736000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Love had handed me an awful dilemma. Should I rob this guy or rob him and kill him?
95827,369,183,741000,Moe Szyslak,Moeview Motel,I decided to do the right thing.
95829,369,185,754000,Snake Jailbird,Motel Room,I've been robbed!
95830,369,186,755000,Snake Jailbird,Motel Room,"I'll take my revenge on society. By which I mean convenience stores. And who would suspect me, Professor Jailbird!"
95834,369,190,767000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Street,"Before we left town for good, we hadda make one stop -- so she could tell the school she wouldn't be teachin' there."
95835,369,191,773000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Street,"Back in a flash, my sweet little gargoyle!"
95837,369,193,781000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Street,"I was the happiest guy in the world. But fate likes to play a little game called ""Up Yours, Moe."""
95839,369,195,788000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Moe... we need to talk.
95840,369,196,791000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Elementary School,About what? How nothin' changed when you were in there?
95841,369,197,793000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Not exactly. You see, when I went inside..."
95843,369,199,799000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CLASSROOM,"Young man, it's summertime. What are you doing here?"
95844,369,200,802000,Bart Simpson,CLASSROOM,I've got detention all summer.
95845,369,201,804000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CLASSROOM,Why?
95846,369,202,805000,Bart Simpson,CLASSROOM,Because I'm a screw-up. My sister's the smart one -- all I do is get in trouble.
95847,369,203,810000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CLASSROOM,"Aw sweetheart, do you want to do better?"
95848,369,204,813000,Bart Simpson,CLASSROOM,"Oh, it doesn't matter. Everyone's pretty much given up on me. I bet I won't even make it through fourth grade."
95849,369,205,823000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,CLASSROOM,You'll make it through fourth grade -- because I'm gonna stay here and be your teacher!
95850,369,206,828000,Marge Simpson,CLASSROOM,"Wait, wait, wait, there's one thing I don't understand here."
95852,369,208,832000,Marge Simpson,Cave,You never had detention all summer.
95853,369,209,835000,Bart Simpson,Cave,"Oh, that load of crap? No, I was just keepin' her busy while Nelson stole microscopes. Make with the story."
95854,369,210,842000,Lisa Simpson,Cave,"Well, my best recollection of Burns' paraphrasing of what he read in Moe's letter is that Krabappel told Moe..."
95856,369,212,848000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"I have to stay here in Springfield, because boys like Bart Simpson need me...Sweet, misunderstood boys, who just need someone to recognize the basic goodness, that's trapped inside them and is desperately trying to get out..."
95857,369,213,863000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Elementary School,"There was nothing I could do. Well, except go nuts."
95858,369,214,867000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Elementary School,You crazy skirt! Nobody backs out on fake good Moe! I oughta...
95860,369,216,888000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"If I couldn't spend the treasure on Edner, I didn't want to spend it. I just sat there playin' our song on the jukebox. One gold--"
95861,369,217,896000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,...coin at a time.
95862,369,218,896000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, you poor man. You're about to get a lot poorer."
95865,369,219,911000,The Rich Texan,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, I'll take your gold, and give you back all of your worldly possessions, 'ceptin' your nucular plant. You don't get that back till you bring me a photo of yourself with a smiling child."
95866,369,220,925000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,What the hell could that mean to you?
95867,369,221,927000,The Rich Texan,Moe's Tavern,"I'm obsessive-compulsive! Yee-haw! One, two, three, four. Yee-haw! One, two, three, four. Yee-haw! One, two, three, four."
95869,369,223,934000,The Rich Texan,Burns's Office,"No nuclear plant without a photo. One, two, three, four. That's where we left off. One, two, three, four."
95871,369,225,944000,C. Montgomery Burns,TOWER ATTIC ROOM,"...so without my beloved nuclear plant, I have nothing to live for."
95873,369,227,956000,C. Montgomery Burns,TOWER ATTIC ROOM,"Take me, a barren old thistle, and spare this sweet young flower!"

95882,369,236,992000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Attic,The sheep was no danger at all. I sacrificed my gorgeous body for nothing. This must be what it's like to have a baby.
95883,369,237,999000,Lisa Simpson,Burns's Attic,I want a photo of the hero who risked his life to save me!
95884,369,238,1010000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Attic,A picture of me with a smiling child?! I can get my plant back!

95895,369,249,1062000,Homer Simpson,Cave,"Well, I guess I should explain. Not long ago, it was my day to take care of the baby, so I was out in the forest, hiding."

95898,369,252,1080000,Homer Simpson,CAVE MOUTH,I deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave.
95899,369,253,1087000,Homer Simpson,CAVE MOUTH,I figured he'd never miss two or three pieces. Money which we could use to pay for Bart's operation.
95901,369,255,1094000,Bart Simpson,CAVE CHAMBER,I need an operation?
95902,369,256,1095000,Homer Simpson,CAVE CHAMBER,That's a story for another day.

95907,369,261,1107000,Marge Simpson,CAVE CHAMBER,How can you take it? We haven't found it.

95922,369,276,1189000,Moe Szyslak,CAVE CHAMBER,It could. Definitely.
95923,369,277,1190000,Marge Simpson,CAVE CHAMBER,"Mr. Burns, isn't it more important that you got a child to smile at you?"
