97890,377,54,339000,Disco Stu,Museum,"Disco Stu slides in front of you! Hey, that rhymed."
97891,377,55,347000,Ned Flanders,Museum,"Tell you what -- if we turn around, it'll feel like we're at the front of the line!"

97896,377,60,359000,Imax Narrator,Museum,The nunchuck was invented thousands of years ago by a Chinese monk. Artifacts of the time indicate that this incident was hilarious.
97897,377,61,379000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"Wow, this 3-D is amazing! You can actually feel the vase!"
97899,377,63,385000,Marge Simpson,MUSEUM EXHIBIT,"Go ahead, Maggie. You're allowed to touch the deadly weapons."

97906,377,70,418000,Milhouse Van Houten,WEAPONS EXHIBIT,"Bart, my arm's out of its thing."
97907,377,71,421000,Bart Simpson,WEAPONS EXHIBIT,That means it's working.

97910,377,74,432000,Ned Flanders,Museum,"You're leavin' already? We, we haven't even gotten in yet."
97911,377,75,436000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"Sorry, Flanders. But when you get in, you can use my audio tour. Narrated by Melanie Griffith."
97912,377,76,442000,Melanie Griffith,Museum,This room's nice. Let's go into the next one. This room's nice too.
97913,377,77,449000,Melanie Griffith,Museum,This room's nice. This room's nice too. This room's nice too. This room's nice. This room's nice. This room's nice too.

96962,377,82,473000,Ned Flanders,HALL OF MAN,Evolution?!
97919,377,86,484000,Ned Flanders,HALL OF MAN,Excuse me. How can you put up an exhibit on the origin of man and not have one mention of the Bible?
97920,377,87,490000,Museum Employee,HALL OF MAN,"Oh, we do."
97921,377,88,500000,Ned Flanders,HALL OF MAN,My most cherished beliefs -- a myth?
97922,377,89,503000,Todd Flanders,HALL OF MAN,"Daddy, was Mommy a monkey? I can't remember!"
97923,377,90,506000,Ned Flanders,HALL OF MAN,No one was ever a monkey! Everything is what it was and always will be! God put us here and that's that!
97924,377,91,512000,Todd Flanders,HALL OF MAN,But you said a stork brought me.
97925,377,92,515000,Ned Flanders,HALL OF MAN,"Um, that was God disguised as a stork."
97926,377,93,517000,Rod Flanders,HALL OF MAN,Who brings baby storks?
97927,377,94,519000,Ned Flanders,HALL OF MAN,There's no such thing as storks! It's all God!
97928,377,95,522000,Todd Flanders,HALL OF MAN,"Please bless Daddy, and Mommy..."
97929,377,96,524000,Ned Flanders,HALL OF MAN,Stop praying to that stork!
97931,377,98,529000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,They're telling people we're descended from a pack of apes. Even though there's nothing about it in the Bible!
97932,377,99,535000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Ned, you've gotta take this thing with a grain of salt. I mean, c'mon."
97933,377,100,540000,Helen Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Tim, this controversy could put more meat in the seats."
97934,377,101,543000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Well... our membership has been dwindling since those Episcopalians put in those vibrating pews.
97936,377,103,554000,Helen Lovejoy,EPISCOPALIAN CHURCH,Evolution is the hot button issue we need to mobilize our flock -- they'll be hanging on your every word!
97937,377,104,560000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,EPISCOPALIAN CHURCH,I'll be a white Al Sharpton!
97938,377,105,566000,Sideshow Mel,EPISCOPALIAN CHURCH,Why does every church meeting end this way?
97941,377,108,571000,Ned Flanders,Skinner's Office,We want you to teach alternative theories to Darwinian evolution.
97942,377,109,575000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,You mean... Lamarckian evolution?
97943,377,110,576000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Skinner's Office,No -- the Adam and Eve one!
97944,377,111,580000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,And what if I say no?
97945,377,112,581000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Skinner's Office,I believe you leased your Camry from Christian Brothers Auto...
97946,377,113,585000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,No! That was a once-in-a-lifetime A.P.R.!
97949,377,115,588000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Class, starting today we will be presenting an alternative theory on the origin of man."
97950,377,116,596000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Creationism? But that's not science.
97951,377,117,599000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,It is now.
97952,377,118,600000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Are oceans God's tears?
97953,377,119,606000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"They sure are. ""A"" plus!"
97955,377,121,609000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Now Lisa's the Ralph!
97956,377,122,615000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,How can you teach the book of Genesis as a scientific theory?
97957,377,123,617000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Hm, this helpful video will evade all your questions. Eyes screenward!"
97958,377,124,628000,Narrator,Springfield Elementary School,"""So You're Calling God A Liar!"" ""An Unbiased Comparison Of Evolution and Creationism."""
97959,377,125,628000,Narrator,Springfield Elementary School,"Let's say hi to two books: one, the Bible, was written by our Lord...the other, ""The Origin of the Species""...was written by a cowardly drunk named Charles Darwin."
97960,377,126,647000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,This is slander! Darwin was one of the greatest minds of all time!
97961,377,127,651000,JANEY,Springfield Elementary School,Then why is he making out with Satan?
97962,377,128,656000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Evolution is widely acknowledged as scientific fact. It's even accepted by prominent conservatives, like George Will and the late Pope John Paul!"
97964,377,130,668000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,The George Will?
97965,377,131,669000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, you've said quite enough. Children, drown her out with whistling and arm flatulence."
97966,377,132,671000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,All I'm saying is--
97970,377,136,689000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"What's wrong, sweetie?"
97971,377,137,690000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"They're making us learn creation theory in school. Today we had a test, and every answer was ""God did it."""
97972,377,138,693000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I think it's good to give both ideas a fair hearing. Maybe they could learn from each other."
97973,377,139,703000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But they're incompatible!
97974,377,140,705000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, lots of times two incompatible things can both be true. My son's a brat but he's a special little guy. Your father says he's at work, but there he is jumping on a trampoline."
97975,377,141,719000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, you really have to choose here, between science and belief."
97976,377,142,728000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well then I choose... uh...
97977,377,143,741000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, according to creationism, there were no cavemen."
97978,377,144,744000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Good riddance. Their drawings suck and they look like hippies.
97979,377,145,747000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you're not really reconsidering evolution, are you?"
97980,377,146,750000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,My mind is always open to new ideas.
97981,377,147,753000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Onions in the peas! What the hell?
97983,377,149,761000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,It is agreed: regular people can park in handicapped spaces if they're just running in to buy smokes or maybe some Pop Tarts for tomorrow.
97984,377,150,770000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Town Hall,The system works.
97985,377,151,772000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"And if there's no further business, I hereby declare this meeting--"
97986,377,152,777000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,I have an issue I'd like to raise!
97987,377,153,779000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Curse my slow gaveling.
97988,377,154,781000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Last week, the unscientific theory of creationism was introduced alongside evolution in Springfield public schools."
97989,377,155,789000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Town Hall,"Now honestly, the Bible's about the same age as the rest of our textbooks."
97990,377,156,796000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Evolution and Creationism cannot co-exist, people. It is time to go back to teaching one single truth!"
97991,377,157,802000,Barney Gumble,Springfield Town Hall,Homer's son's sister is right!
97994,377,160,808000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Class, the town has spoken. From now on we're only teaching one theory... creationism. Now please hand in your evolution books to Groundskeeper Willie while I beat this ominous drum."
97996,377,162,826000,Database,Springfield Elementary School,There seems to be a note on your locker.
97997,377,163,829000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,From a secret admirer perhaps.
97998,377,164,832000,Database,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't make me laugh. Ah, ha-ha!"
97999,377,165,834000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"""Dear Seekers of Truth: Meet in the school's single-purpose room tomorrow at lunch. Rationally yours, L.M.S."""
98000,377,166,841000,Database,Springfield Elementary School,"""L.M.S."" Who could it be?"
98001,377,167,852000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,Little Moe Szyslak?
98002,377,168,854000,Little Moe Szyslak,Springfield Elementary School,Why does everybody call me that? Buncha snot-faced pukebags...
98005,377,171,867000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm so glad you could all come. I'll be reading to you from ""The Origin of Species"" by Charles Darwin."
98006,377,172,874000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I thought we were gonna light spiders on fire!
98007,377,173,878000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,We're over here.
98008,377,174,879000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,You all have a nice day.
98009,377,175,888000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Chapter One: When we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals...
98010,377,176,888000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa Simpson, you're under arrest for the teaching of non-Biblical science!"
98011,377,177,903000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,There are so many worse crimes. Why are you persecuting me?
98012,377,178,907000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, well we only have the manpower to enforce the last law passed. Y'know, it's not the best system... but, well in fact, it's uh, it's pretty much the worst."
98013,377,179,917000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Elementary School,You live! You die! You live! You die!
98014,377,180,922000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,In the old days we woulda been all over that.
98015,377,181,922000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Elementary School,Ha-haaa.
98017,377,183,929000,Kent Brockman,Courthouse,"This is Kent Brockman, reporting live from the trial of God versus Lisa Simpson. Defending Miss Simpson is ACLU appointed liberal, Clarisse Drummond."
98018,377,184,937000,Clarisse Drummond,Courthouse,I'm from New York!
98020,377,186,940000,Kent Brockman,Courthouse,And prosecuting the case against Lisa is humble country lawyer Wallace Brady.
98021,377,187,945000,Wallace Brady,Courthouse,"As the little chicken said to his mama ""I just hope I don't 'cluck up.'"""
98022,377,188,945000,Passersby,Courthouse,Awww...
98023,377,189,950000,Kent Brockman,Courthouse,"I think it's fair to say if that man doesn't win, I'm resigning from the jury."
98024,377,190,955000,Kent Brockman,Courthouse,"This is Kent Brockman, juror number seven, saying: ""I'll have the roast beef for lunch."""
98026,377,192,955000,Clarisse Drummond,Courtroom,So does this theory of evolution necessarily mean that there is no God?
98027,377,193,966000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Courtroom,"No, of course not."
98028,377,194,969000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Courtroom,"It just says that God is an impotent nothing from nowhere with less power than the Undersecretary of Agriculture, who has very little power in our system."
98029,377,195,982000,Wallace Brady,Courtroom,"Now sir, you are a scientist, correct?"
98031,377,196,985000,Scientist-type,Courtroom,That's right. I have a Ph. D in Truthology from Christian Tech.
98032,377,197,989000,Jurors,Courtroom,Oooh!
98033,377,198,991000,Lenny Leonard,Courtroom,"Move over, Carl -- I've got a new hero!"
98034,377,199,993000,Carl Carlson,Courtroom,This'll last about a day.
98035,377,200,995000,Wallace Brady,Courtroom,"So as a scientist, what is your take on this ""devil-ution""?"
98036,377,201,1001000,Scientist-type,Courtroom,"Pure hogwash. If man evolved from monkeys, there'd be evidence. But when we look at the fossil record, here's what we see."
98037,377,202,1008000,Scientist-type,Courtroom,A missing link.
98038,377,203,1014000,Wallace Brady,Courtroom,"Why, I believe right now this gentleman's havin' dinner with the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny."
98039,377,204,1017000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,This is the break in the case we've been waiting for!
98040,377,205,1021000,Wallace Brady,Courtroom,"I mean, he doesn't exist. Evolution is just a lot of that Hollywood hooey."
98042,377,207,1029000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,Well I've heard enough for today. I have to a judge a wet t-shirt contest in twenty minutes.
98043,377,208,1033000,Clarisse Drummond,Courtroom,"This trial is the biggest load of Oh, for cryin' out loud."
98044,377,209,1038000,Wallace Brady,Courtroom,"Now, Bambi, who started that forest fire that killed your mama? Evolution? My, my, my."
98045,377,210,1045000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Poor Bambi... poor Thumper...
98047,377,212,1056000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, Mom. I should have just gone with the flow like you said."
98048,377,213,1068000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I might as well see what all the fuss is about."
98050,377,215,1081000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, please."
98051,377,216,1083000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I love it when you're not into it. Oh yeah, baby. Oh yeah that's it ignore me. I'm not even here."
98052,377,217,1090000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, Darwin's argument is incredibly persuasive. And his ship was the Beagle, which reminds me of Snoopy... my favorite Peanut!"
98055,377,220,1102000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Lisa, I think I have a way to help you at the trial today."
