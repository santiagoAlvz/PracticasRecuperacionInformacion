116327,450,1,40000,Homer Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,"Oh, I love going to aquatic parks -- they have worse rides than amusement parks, less fish than aquariums -- but the parking is ample!"
116328,450,2,53000,Homer Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,Now to seal you in for safety.
116331,450,5,58000,Marge Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,"Oh, there's so many photo ops, but I already filled up my camera in the parking lot...parking lot C sign... the tram... a license plate from Canada..."
116334,450,6,64000,Marge Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,"A bird eating potato chips... my feet walking... that boy who got sick on the tram... Grampa talking to a mermaid hedge... the Park Rules in Spanish... a fat baby... Grampa telling a story to a trailer hitch... Oops, I erased them all!"
116335,450,7,86000,Lisa Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,I wanna do that!
116337,450,9,90000,Bart Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,I'm gonna take stuff from the lost and found!
116338,450,10,98000,Grampa Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,My feet hurt! My left ear's freezing! My right ear's burning! I got fish smell in my wrinkles!
116339,450,11,106000,Announcer,Seaworld-type Park,"Attention, exploro-nauts!"
116340,450,12,108000,Marge Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,That's us!
116341,450,13,109000,Announcer,Seaworld-type Park,"In one minute, we'll be starting our rock-quatic roll-tacular!"
116342,450,14,114000,Homer Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,"Hurry! If we don't get a seat in the splash zone, I've worn my bathing suit under my clothes for nothing!"
116343,450,15,119000,Grampa Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,A splash-'em-up show? Reminds me of the time I high-dived into a damp sponge for the amusement of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.
116344,450,16,129000,Marge Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,"Grampa, no stories! You can come with us, or sit here on the shark bench."
116345,450,17,133000,Grampa Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,"You know, I did sit on a shark once..."
116346,450,18,136000,Homer Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,"Dad, bathing suit!"
116347,450,19,139000,Homer Simpson,Seaworld-type Park,"Oops, no bathing suit."
116350,450,22,142000,Trainer,INSIDE AQUATIC STADIUM,Let's give a wet and wacky welcome to Springfield's oldest performing mollusk...
116351,450,23,147000,Homer Simpson,INSIDE AQUATIC STADIUM,Get to the show!
116352,450,24,149000,Trainer,INSIDE AQUATIC STADIUM,"This is the show! Here's the original ""octo-mom"" -- Slimu!"
116354,450,26,162000,Moe Szyslak,INSIDE AQUATIC STADIUM,Slimu! Did you get my letters?
116355,450,27,164000,Trainer,INSIDE AQUATIC STADIUM,"Slimu wasn't expecting company, so he's got some cleaning up to do!"
116357,450,29,177000,Lisa Simpson,INSIDE AQUATIC STADIUM,Slimu looks kind of uncomfortable.
116358,450,30,178000,Homer Simpson,INSIDE AQUATIC STADIUM,Wouldn't you be if you were a saltwater fish in a fresh water aquarium?
116359,450,31,183000,Trainer,INSIDE AQUATIC STADIUM,The country has its first black president -- maybe it's time for the first octopus president!
116360,450,32,192000,Trainer,INSIDE AQUATIC STADIUM,"And when it comes to signing bills, he can provide his own ink!"
116361,450,33,198000,Lenny Leonard,INSIDE AQUATIC STADIUM,"Mm, oily!"
116332,450,35,204000,Grampa Simpson,Amusement Park,"They'll cheer a dancing octopus, but not an old man complaining about everything."
116363,450,36,210000,Marshall Goldman,Amusement Park,"Excuse me, sir, is this seat taken?"
116364,450,37,212000,Grampa Simpson,Amusement Park,"Well, not for a pretty girl like you!"
116365,450,38,217000,Marshall Goldman,Amusement Park,"Well, this is the first time I ever sat on a shark."
116366,450,39,220000,Grampa Simpson,Amusement Park,Not me -- sat on a real one once!
116367,450,40,222000,Marshall Goldman,Amusement Park,Tell me more!
116368,450,41,222000,Grampa Simpson,Amusement Park,"More?! Play it cool, Grampa. Play it cool!"
116369,450,42,229000,Grampa Simpson,Amusement Park,"It was back in World War II. I was a seaman first class on the U.S.S. World War One. We were minding our own business, when we were attacked by a heat-seeking torpedo we had fired the day before."
116370,450,43,250000,Commanding Officer,Amusement Park,"Don't worry about the sharks, boys -- just play possum and they'll leave you alone."
116371,450,44,255000,Grampa Simpson,Amusement Park,"Unfortunately, sharks love possum."
148183,450,45,261000,Young Grampa,Amusement Park,"Hey, boys -- these sharks can't bite us if we're on their backs!"
116372,450,46,265000,Brooklyn Sailor,Amusement Park,Yeah. It's like ridin' the Cyclone back at Coney Island!
116373,450,47,271000,Boston Sailor,Amusement Park,It's like riding a dust devil back in Yuma -- like I read about in a book back in Boston!
116374,450,48,276000,Grampa Simpson,Amusement Park,"By the time the rescue planes came, we had those sharks trained pretty good."
116375,450,49,288000,Grampa Simpson,Amusement Park,"I still keep in touch with all those men and some of the sharks. Why, here's us in Hawaii last year. Good times."
116376,450,50,297000,Marshall Goldman,Amusement Park,"Sir, my name is Marshall Goldman. I'm a newspaper columnist specializing in human-interest stories."
116377,450,51,304000,Grampa Simpson,Amusement Park,You're in the newspaper business? Something that's gonna die before I do!
116378,450,52,308000,Marshall Goldman,Amusement Park,Have any other stories you'd care to tell me?
116379,450,53,311000,Grampa Simpson,Amusement Park,Someone's listening to me! Now I know how a radio feels!
116381,450,55,318000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Well class, it's Friday afternoon. That means it's time to find out which one of you gets to take Larry the Lamb home for the weekend."
116382,450,56,327000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"And don't forget, the lucky student gets to add his or her page to Larry's personal journal...just like Martin did last week. Ha!"
116383,450,57,336000,Class,Springfield Elementary School,"I want him first! / No, me! /"
116384,450,58,338000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Not that stupid stuffed lamb again. This isn't learning!
116385,450,59,342000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Do you want to learn?
116386,450,60,343000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No, no, no. I'm just sayin'..."
116387,450,61,345000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"This weekend, Larry will go home wiiiith..."
116388,450,62,350000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Please, God, I need this."
116389,450,63,351000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,...Bart Simpson.
116391,450,65,354000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,O cruel irony!
116392,450,66,356000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, the only thing I bring home are notes to my parents, and those do not arrive the way that they left."
116393,450,67,364000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What a nice note!
116395,450,69,366000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,I'm not sticking my hand in that can again. You're getting the lamb.
116396,450,70,373000,Nelson Muntz,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Not so fast. Tell the diary how special he makes you feel!
116397,450,71,380000,Nelson Muntz,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,More adjectives!
116398,450,72,383000,Nelson Muntz,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,That's an adverb!
116400,450,74,394000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Top of the mornin', Homer."
116401,450,75,395000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Seen the paper?
116402,450,76,396000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I get my news off the internet."
116403,450,77,400000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, sir, it looks like your Dad is a quotable notable."
116404,450,78,406000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's funny... it's poignant... it actually happened... My father is interesting?! The whole world's upside down! That must mean Cathy is funny.
116405,450,79,418000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Nope.
116407,450,81,423000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Abe, I never knew you were so full of !"
116408,450,82,425000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,What does that mean?
116409,450,83,427000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,It's like but with a pinch more !
116410,450,84,431000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yep, I may just be the best-known Abraham in history."
116411,450,85,435000,Marshall Goldman,Springfield Retirement Castle,"So Abe, what else you got for me?"
116412,450,86,437000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Hmm, well, let's see... ooh, I was working as a shoeshine boy at Springfield Union Station..."
116414,450,88,450000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Union Station,"Every Monday, the Tinseltown Starliner would stop at one-seventeen p.m. on its way to Hollywood. I never rode that train, but I'd palaver with the movie stars when they got out to stretch their legs."
116415,450,89,483000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Union Station,But none was more memorable than...
148182,450,90,487000,Young Grampa,Springfield Union Station,Clark Gable!
116416,450,91,487000,Clark Gable,Springfield Union Station,"Looks like someone has seen my work as an extra in ""Du Barry, Woman Of Passion."""
148184,450,92,491000,Young Grampa,Springfield Union Station,"I sure have, Mr. Gable. How come you ain't a star yet?"
116417,450,93,494000,Clark Gable,Springfield Union Station,"Maybe my ears are too big, I don't know. Hey, what you reading there?"
148185,450,94,498000,Young Grampa,Springfield Union Station,"Oh, it's called ""Gone With The Wind."" You can have it -- it's only got one swear word, and not a very good one."
116418,450,95,504000,Clark Gable,Springfield Union Station,"""Gone With The Wind,"" eh? Well let's see: garbage, garbage, my line... garbage, garbage, my line... Atlanta burns... nice dresses... I like it!"
116419,450,96,511000,Clark Gable,Springfield Union Station,"Thanks, Kid. Don't tell this story to anyone for sixty years."
116421,450,98,518000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,...Clark Gable owes me a book. And he never paid me for the shoeshine. But his big blue eyes could melt the butter you kept in your pocket for lunch. Lunch butter we called it.
116422,450,99,526000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How come Grampa never shares those stories with us?
116423,450,100,531000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He does all the time. You just never listen.
116424,450,101,534000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, my brain is like a computer, and I file away Grampa's stories in a very special place."
116425,450,102,545000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmm, while I'm up there..."
116427,450,104,556000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh.
116429,450,106,561000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's it, boy -- go for the nards!"
116430,450,107,563000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart!
116431,450,108,565000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you're not gonna take care of him right, then give him to me."
116432,450,109,568000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,How come you don't get mad when I torment real animals?
116433,450,110,570000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I do! It enrages me!
116434,450,111,573000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought you Hindus were supposed to love everybody.
116435,450,112,575000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm a freakin' Buddhist! A Buddhist!
116437,450,114,580000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"Larry, please don't judge our whole family by Bart. He's the black sheep. Not that black sheep are in any way inferior to white sheep. I do not judge wool by its color -- only by how itchy it is. Ooh, look! Jazz!"
116438,450,115,594000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"Larry, what sub-genre of jazz do you like? Fusion? Neo-bop?"
116439,450,116,599000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,Afro-Cuban?
116440,450,117,602000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,Larry!
116441,450,118,603000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,Gotcha!
116442,450,120,603000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,Larry? Larry? Larry? Larryyyy?!
116443,450,121,612000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield,"You're comin' off desperate, honey."
116446,450,124,616000,Grampa Simpson,REC ROOM,"...that's how I got the idea for a suitcase with wheels, from watching a commercial about a suitcase with wheels."
116448,450,126,624000,Mitch Albom,REC ROOM,"Hey Abe, great stories. I'm Mitch Albom, author of ""Tuesdays With Morrie."""
116449,450,127,629000,Grampa Simpson,REC ROOM,Never heard of you.
116450,450,128,630000,Mitch Albom,REC ROOM,Yeah. Sure you haven't.
116451,450,129,632000,Grampa Simpson,REC ROOM,"Take a hike, Hollywood. I've already got a college boy to turn my every word into syndicated gold."
116452,450,130,638000,Jasper Beardly,REC ROOM,"Yeah, beat it, sports page!"
116453,450,131,641000,Mitch Albom,REC ROOM,And what if I don't?
116455,450,133,655000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Retirement Castle,Clouds are God's sneezes.
116456,450,134,659000,Mitch Albom,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Ooh, I like this kid."
116457,450,135,665000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh Dad, I got you some scotch. One of those fancy ones the checkout lady had to unlock the cabinet to get."
116459,450,137,672000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well, well, well -- look who decided to visit me twice in one year."
116460,450,138,676000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,This man's more of a son to me than you've ever been.
116461,450,139,680000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"What the?! Well, he's more of a father to me than you've ever been."
116462,450,140,684000,Marshall Goldman,Springfield Retirement Castle,I don't think that's true.
116463,450,141,686000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Stay out of this, Dad!"
116464,450,142,687000,Marshall Goldman,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Uh, no-- O-okay."
116465,450,143,689000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,You only care about me now because I'm famous!
116466,450,144,692000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,That's it! Here's your ring back.
116467,450,145,694000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Ring? What ring?
116468,450,146,695000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,It's a father-son commitment band that I bought and never told you about!
116470,450,148,711000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, I need the stupid lamb back."
116471,450,149,713000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,He's in here. Safe and sound. Let me just staple that bag for you.
116472,450,150,724000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,This isn't Larry. It's just cotton balls on toilet paper rolls! Where's the real Larry?
116474,450,151,729000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What do you care? You don't even like him.
116475,450,152,732000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of course I don't, but other people do!"
116476,450,153,734000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"Hey, Bart. Can't wait to see Larry again."
116477,450,154,737000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Um... what if someone were to lose Larry?
116478,450,155,740000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,They'd see a dark side of me no one knows about.
116479,450,156,744000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,"NELSON LOVED A LITTLE LAMB / LITTLE LAMB, LITTLE LAMB / NELSON LOVED A LITTLE LAMB / HE KEPT ME NICE AND SANE..."
116480,450,157,760000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,You've reached Abe!
116481,450,158,762000,Marshall Goldman,Simpson Home,And Marshall! Abe can't come to the phone right now.
116482,450,159,765000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"And if this is Homer, you're too late for my love!"
116483,450,160,769000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Stupid Grampa. I try to end the cycle of neglect and he hits me with some super neglect!
116484,450,161,775000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe you're not really mad at Grampa. Maybe you're mad at yourself for taking him for granted all these years.
116485,450,162,781000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, how can anyone be mad at himself? It's impossible. Watch."
116486,450,163,785000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why you little... oh, I can't. When I look at those beautiful chubby cheeks... c'mere, you."
116487,450,164,794000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll kill you! You son-of-a--- Don't look hurt. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
116488,450,165,801000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll show Grampa. I'll find my own surrogate father, full of heart-warming stories I can share with the world."
116490,450,167,807000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,... and that's how you win an opium war!
116491,450,168,811000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Oh, great stuff. And the life lesson is?..."
116492,450,169,814000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,The Yangtze River swallows all secrets.
116493,450,170,818000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Hmm... I'm just gonna put ""haste makes waste."""
116494,450,171,819000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Yes, although these days I can make neither haste nor waste. You know, Simpson -- this has truly been a lovely afternoon."
116495,450,172,828000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Release... a hound.
116496,450,173,831000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Isn't that cute? He thinks he's a pack.
116498,450,175,838000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,Where'd you get this rope?
116499,450,176,840000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Swiped it from gym class.
116501,450,178,841000,Coach Krupt,Gym Class,Climb that rope!
116502,450,179,844000,Milhouse Van Houten,Gym Class,There is no rope.
116503,450,180,846000,Coach Krupt,Gym Class,Well you'd better get to the ceiling somehow!
116504,450,181,849000,Coach Krupt,Gym Class,"Ceiling, ceiling, ceiling!"
116506,450,183,849000,Lisa Simpson,STORM DRAIN,"Bart, I'm losing my grip!"
116507,450,184,855000,Bart Simpson,STORM DRAIN,Put the rope in your teeth!
116508,450,185,856000,Lisa Simpson,STORM DRAIN,What will that do?
116509,450,186,858000,Bart Simpson,STORM DRAIN,It'll shut you up!
116510,450,187,863000,Bart Simpson,STORM DRAIN,Larry? Larry the Lamb?
116511,450,188,866000,Bart Simpson,STORM DRAIN,"There you are, you piece of crap."
116514,450,191,870000,Bart Simpson,Street,There's rats in my pants!
116515,450,192,872000,Lisa Simpson,Street,"Chief, my brother fell in the storm drain!"
116516,450,193,875000,Chief Wiggum,Street,"Um, I'm strictly an ""above-the-ground"" policeman. What you need is the sewer cops."
116517,450,194,880000,Lisa Simpson,Street,Fine. What's their number?
116518,450,195,881000,Chief Wiggum,Street,"Lisa, you're old enough now that I can tell you the truth: there's no such thing as the sewer cops. It's just something we tell kids to make them feel safe."
116519,450,196,889000,Lisa Simpson,Street,What about Bart?
116520,450,197,891000,Chief Wiggum,Street,"Well, if you miss him, yell into a toilet."
116521,450,198,895000,Bart Simpson,Street,It's dark down here.
116523,450,200,899000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Shopper,I have a column I'd like to submit. Pay me whenever.
116524,450,201,903000,Receptionist,Springfield Shopper,I'll just take this to our editor.
116526,450,203,917000,Homer Simpson,MARSHALL GOLDMAN'S OFFICE,What? Pulitzer Prize application form?

116528,450,205,930000,Homer Simpson,MARSHALL GOLDMAN'S OFFICE,How would he know Grampa was going to die today? Unless... he was going to kill him! But would someone really kill a man just to win a Pulitzer Prize?
116531,450,208,960000,Conductor,Springfield Union Station,"All aboard the final run of the Tinseltown Starliner, the last ride into a nostalgic past. Anyone without a ticket will be beaten by classic railroad bulls."

116537,450,212,982000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Union Station,You don't get a beatin' like this travelling by plane.
116538,450,213,985000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Union Station,I'm finally riding the Tinseltown Starliner! I could die a happy man.
116541,450,216,1008000,Marshall Goldman,TINSELTOWN STARLINER,"Drink up, Abe. Live each moment as if someone's about to kill you... I mean, as if it's your last."
116542,450,217,1014000,Grampa Simpson,TINSELTOWN STARLINER,"Sorry, my hearing aid's on the fritz. The only word I heard was ""kill."""
116543,450,218,1026000,Grampa Simpson,TINSELTOWN STARLINER,"Look at that, they've recreated the thirties... tent cities... failing banks..."
116544,450,219,1032000,Marshall Goldman,TINSELTOWN STARLINER,"No, those are real."
116546,450,221,1038000,Homer Simpson,TINSELTOWN STARLINER,Beware of Marshall Goldmannn!
116547,450,222,1040000,Grampa Simpson,TINSELTOWN STARLINER,What was that?!
116548,450,223,1042000,Marshall Goldman,TINSELTOWN STARLINER,Um... an elephant on a circus train bellowing for his mother...
116549,450,224,1045000,Grampa Simpson,TINSELTOWN STARLINER,"Oh, I remember the first time an elephant tried to eat me like a peanut. I was on the set of a Warner Brothers cartoon. Jack Warner came by and said..."

116473,450,240,1121000,Homer Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,Drop that pillow!
116565,450,242,1125000,Marshall Goldman,Grampa's Compartment,It gets worse.
116567,450,244,1128000,Marshall Goldman,Grampa's Compartment,Yeah.

116571,450,248,1135000,Lenny Leonard,Train,As long as it's not a dude!
116573,450,250,1146000,Homer Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,How can you stand up to this punishment?
116574,450,251,1149000,Marshall Goldman,Grampa's Compartment,I'm the toughest S.O.B. there is -- a bi-weekly human interest columnist. And your father's gonna make me a fortune. Pathetic old fool.
116575,450,252,1159000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,Maybe so... but I know how to play possum!
116577,450,254,1171000,Marshall Goldman,Train Car,So many... hat boxes.
116579,450,256,1176000,Homer Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,"Dad, I don't have the right words to say how I really feel about you, but at least I know how to beat up a guy who does."
116580,450,257,1183000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,"Well, at least you never tried to kill me."
116581,450,258,1186000,Homer Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,Just with indifference.
116582,450,259,1190000,Clark Gable,Grampa's Compartment,"You did good, kid. This is for the shoeshine."
116583,450,260,1193000,Clark Gable,Grampa's Compartment,"It's a ghost quarter, but you'll be able to spend it pretty soon."
116584,450,261,1198000,Lisa Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,"So Grampa, you really saved Dad's life?"
116585,450,262,1201000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,I sure did. But why don't we let Homer tell the story.
116586,450,263,1205000,Homer Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,Really? Me? You mean it?
116587,450,264,1207000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,I think you're ready for your first ramble.
116588,450,265,1210000,Homer Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,"I've been waiting for this day for so long. The year is nineteen forty-six. In a war-torn world, a single flower blooms. And that flower is an angry Japanese monster named Godzilla. How am I doin', Dad?"
116589,450,266,1224000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,I'm hangin' on every word.
116590,450,267,1226000,Homer Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,"Fortunately there was one man who could help: Colonel Tom Parker. The Colonel took this monster, cleaned him up and put him onstage under the name ""The Rolling Stones."" The first concert was a sellout, with many, many, many people eaten. But those that survived raved about the undeniable harmonies and brutally honest lyrics of what they had just seen."
116593,450,268,1248000,Homer Simpson,Grampa's Compartment,...and that lasted about five years. But then Godzilla dropped out for a while to do movies. All of the awful movies we see now today in the drive-ins that no longer exist.
