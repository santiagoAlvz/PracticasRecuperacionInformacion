23834,116,8,53000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Every week there's a canal.
23835,116,9,55000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Or an inlet.
23836,116,10,56000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Or a fjord.
23837,116,11,58000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Quiet. I will not hear another word against the Boat.
23838,116,12,61000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, TV off. It's family time."
23839,116,13,63000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But Marge, Knightboat. The crime solving boat."
23840,116,14,68000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you promised. One night of family time a week. Besides, that back-talking boat sets a bad example."
23841,116,15,75000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Says you, woman."
23842,116,16,78000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, family time begins now."
23843,116,17,90000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer!
23844,116,18,92000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It was Bart.
23845,116,19,93000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't we all look at the photo album?
23846,116,20,96000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So many memories. Aw, look... Knightboat."
23847,116,21,100000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Aw.
23849,116,22,102000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And here's our TV next to the mirror. It looks like we have two.
23850,116,23,107000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Wow. Two.
23851,116,24,110000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, yeah, yeah two. Let's get to the baby pictures."
23852,116,25,115000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Moom.
23853,116,26,115000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's exciting.
23854,116,27,116000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh please.
23857,116,30,122000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here's Bart sleeping... Here he is dozing... Here he is after a visit from the sandman... Ooh, here's nappy-time Bart... Here's a cute one, he's all tuckered out..."
23858,116,31,134000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why aren't there any pictures of Maggie?
23859,116,32,137000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm glad you asked. It's actually a very interesting story."
23861,116,34,143000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It all began about two years ago, before Maggie was even born. Bart, you were Lisa's age and Lisa you were the age Bart was several years ago."
23862,116,35,153000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Get the camera ready, Bart very seepy."
23863,116,36,156000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any TV show. It was a tumultuous time for our nation. The clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.
23864,116,37,167000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The Information Super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about ""Star Trek,"" and the domestication of the dog continued unabated."
23866,116,39,177000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I was at my work station when suddenly...
23867,116,40,180000,Villain,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Attention American workers. Your plant has been taken over by an all-star team of free-lance terrorists.
23868,116,41,188000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Not on my shift.
23870,116,43,198000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,Oh no you don't!
23871,116,44,202000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,"Simpson ten, terrorists eight."
23872,116,45,207000,Marge Simpson,Burns's Office,Homer! Tell the story right.
23873,116,46,209000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Office,Okay.
23875,116,48,215000,Carl Carlson,PLANT,"Homer, you should see a doctor. I don't think a healthy man could make that kind of a smell."
23876,116,49,220000,Waylon Smithers,PLANT,"Your paychecks, gentlemen."
23877,116,50,223000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Woo hoo! This is it! With this single glorious check, I'm finally completely out of debt."
23879,116,51,236000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Yes! With my bills paid off, I can finally quit this lousy job."
23880,116,52,241000,Lenny Leonard,PLANT,"But Homer, how're you gonna make a living?"
23881,116,53,243000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,Don't worry about Homer J. I've got a plan. A plan that'll fix you good.
23882,116,54,249000,Carl Carlson,PLANT,"Hey, what did we do?"
23883,116,55,251000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Sorry, that just slipped out. I'll miss ya."
23885,116,57,254000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Did you hear me? I said, I quit, Monty. And since I quit, I can do anything I want."
23886,116,58,261000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Is that so?
23887,116,59,262000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ooh, lovely desk. It would be too bad if someone, oh, I don't know... didn't use a coaster!!"
23888,116,60,272000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Such a nice tidy office. Maybe it's time you started living like a pig!
23889,116,61,280000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, I hope I haven't upset you... bongo head!"
23890,116,62,288000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I should be resisting this, but I'm paralyzed with rage... and island rhythms."
23892,116,64,296000,Carl Carlson,PLANT,"Yeah, way to play the boss' head like a bongo, Homer."
23893,116,65,300000,Lenny Leonard,PLANT,He's gettin' a pretty good sound outta that guy.
23894,116,66,308000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,That's for employing me for eight years! Ha ha.
23895,116,67,315000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"And that is that. Goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. Hello dream job in paradise."
23897,116,69,329000,Homer Simpson,Somewhere,And now the final phase of my plan.
23898,116,70,337000,Homer Simpson,Somewhere,"Hey Barney, any chance you can get me a job here?"
23899,116,71,340000,Barney Gumble,Somewhere,"Hey sure, Homer. I told you, my uncle owns the place."
23900,116,72,345000,Barney Gumble,Somewhere,"Hey, Uncle Al, can Homer have a job?"
23901,116,73,347000,Al,Somewhere,Sure.
23902,116,74,348000,Homer Simpson,Somewhere,Woo hoo!
23903,116,75,351000,Al,Somewhere,"Barney, you're fired."
23904,116,76,353000,Barney Gumble,Somewhere,Okay.
23905,116,77,354000,Al,Somewhere,"Show up tomorrow. Bring three rags. Oh, and a change of pants."
23906,116,78,357000,Homer Simpson,Somewhere,Why?
23907,116,79,358000,Al,Somewhere,"When it happens, you'll know."
23909,116,81,361000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're a pin-monkey? Wow. Finally I don't have to be ashamed of my father's job.
23910,116,82,367000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I think it's romantic. Throwing off the shackles of the workaday world and following a dream... of sorts.
23911,116,83,373000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know if it's such a good idea. Can we get by on a pin-monkey salary?
23912,116,84,378000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Marge. I've come up with a perfectly balanced budget. There will be exactly enough money for you, me, Bart and Lisa, if we make a few small sacrifices."
23914,116,86,391000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"From now on we use regular toilet paper, not that fancy quilted kind..."
23915,116,87,399000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And only one of you kids can go to college.
23916,116,88,401000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine.
23917,116,89,404000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That night your mother and I went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life. We began with dinner and dancing... followed by a stroll on the beach...
23918,116,90,432000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge...
23919,116,91,433000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer...
23920,116,92,434000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've got sand in my underpants.
23921,116,93,437000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Me too. Let's go home.
23922,116,94,459000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I love you, Marge."
23923,116,95,462000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I love you too, Homie."
23924,116,96,465000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced. I hope things stay exactly like this forever.
23929,116,101,481000,Sperm #40012,Simpson Home,Woo hoo!
23930,116,102,484000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Did you have to be so graphic?
23931,116,103,487000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's okay, Marge. They pave the way for this kind of filth in school."
23932,116,104,491000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"So Dad, were you excited that mom was pregnant?"
23933,116,105,494000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, your mother hadn't told me yet. At that time, I had no idea Maggie even existed."
23934,116,106,500000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Daaad!
23935,116,107,502000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hi Maggie.
23936,116,108,507000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So anyhoo, back then there was no way for me to know your mother was pregnant."
23938,116,110,515000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning. I've got to wash my hair."
23940,116,112,520000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,The next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma.
23941,116,113,527000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Mmm... bowling fresh.
23942,116,114,544000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Mmm... urinal fresh.
23944,116,115,557000,Al,Barney's Bowlarama,"Homer, did you polish your head in the ""Shine-O Ball-O?"""
23945,116,116,562000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,No.
23946,116,117,563000,Al,Barney's Bowlarama,Okay then.
23947,116,118,566000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"...I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley, like where the pins go after they're knocked down."
23948,116,119,592000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"I was in heaven. If horse racing is the sport of kings, then surely bowling... is a very good sport as well."
23949,116,120,601000,Customers,Barney's Bowlarama,"Hey, great job, Homer. / Thanks a lot./ You're the best."
23950,116,121,605000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,I'M GONNA MAKE IT AFTER ALL!
23952,116,123,612000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Congratulations Mrs. Simpson, you're pregnant."
23954,116,125,617000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Am I to take it that this is... an unwanted pregnancy?
23955,116,126,622000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Oh no, no. N-not exactly. It's just that I haven't told Homer yet; and with his new job, I don't know how we're going to be able to afford this."
23956,116,127,632000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Well, you know, a healthy baby can bring upwards of sixty-thousand dollars."
23957,116,128,635000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,What?
23958,116,129,636000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Of course, that was just a test. Had you reacted differently, why you'd be in jail right now. Simply a test."
23960,116,131,644000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,So in a few months both of you will have a brand new brother or sister.
23961,116,132,648000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Been there, done that."
23962,116,133,650000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I hope it's a girl.
23963,116,134,651000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know nothin' about genetics, Lis. It goes boy, girl, boy, girl."
23964,116,135,655000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're worried about telling dad, aren't you, mom?"
23965,116,136,658000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why do you say that?
23966,116,137,659000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you've been in my room for about four hours now."
23967,116,138,662000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I'm just hangin'."
23968,116,139,671000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I--"
23969,116,140,672000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Can't talk, praying. Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me and I am thankful. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is."
23973,116,142,686000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and I won't ask for anything more. If that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign. Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. Thy will be done."
23975,116,144,707000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Kitchen,"Oogie boogie, boogie, boogie, boo,"
23976,116,145,714000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"I've got to tell Homer about this baby in just the right way and at just the right time. Until then please, keep this to yourselves."
23977,116,146,722000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Kitchen,"If he found out now it would probably destroy him, huh?"
23978,116,147,726000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Oh yes.
23979,116,148,727000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Kitchen,Gotta go.
23980,116,149,729000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Wait a minute, wait, I know that look. Now promise you won't tell Homer."
23981,116,150,734000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh, we promise we won't tell... Homer."
23983,116,152,742000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Hello, is this A. Aaronson? It might interest you to know that Marge Simpson is pregnant again..."
23984,116,153,752000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Just thought you'd like to know, Mr. Zowkowski."
23985,116,154,756000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,There. Aaronson and Zowkowski are the two biggest gossips in town. In an hour everyone will know.
23987,116,156,764000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Ah... another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job.
23988,116,157,770000,Chief Wiggum,Barney's Bowlarama,"Hey, just heard the news over the squawk box. That's nice work, Homer."
23989,116,158,774000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Thank you. Thank you very much. It is nice work.
23990,116,159,779000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oh Mr. Simpson, I have just heard about the little bundle of joy. Congratulations, sir."
23991,116,160,784000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"It's true, the bundle is little. But I'm not in it for the money."
23992,116,161,790000,Moe Szyslak,Barney's Bowlarama,"Hey Homer, way to get Marge pregnant. Heh, heh, heh."
23993,116,162,795000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"This is getting very abstract, but thank you. I do enjoy working at the bowling alley."
23995,116,164,802000,All,Simpson Home,Surprise! Baby Shower!
23996,116,165,805000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Baby shower?! You know I haven't told Homer yet, and he'll be home any minute."
23997,116,166,811000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,Oh really.
23998,116,167,817000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Man. It's windy as hell out there.
23971,116,168,819000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, wait a minute. What are all these presents? It looks like you're ""showering"" Marge with gifts."
24000,116,169,828000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmmm. With little, tiny, baby-sized gifts. Well... I'll be in the tub."
24001,116,170,837000,Maude Flanders,Simpson Home,"By the way, congratulations on your new job, Homer."
24002,116,171,841000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,New job?... Marge is pregnant?! Nooooo!
24003,116,172,851000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, Dad. You really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl?"
24004,116,173,854000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh just that one time.
24005,116,174,856000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, when I was about to have Bart..."
24006,116,175,859000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're pregnant?!
24007,116,176,864000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And then when I told him about Lisa...
24008,116,177,866000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're pregnant again?!
24009,116,178,872000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well who wouldn't be upset? That new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from Sunday! Hey, where're you going?"
24010,116,179,882000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you can't expect a person to sit for thirty minutes straight."
24011,116,180,885000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna get a snack and maybe go to the bathroom.
24012,116,181,888000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll stay here, but I'm gonna think about products I might like to purchase."
24013,116,182,893000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, I don't have that."
24014,116,183,901000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're pregnant! We're gonna have to have a baby! All our financial plans are ruined. We're doomed! Doomed I tells ya!
24015,116,184,912000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer! Let your father tell the story.
24016,116,185,915000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah.
24017,116,186,916000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, but I know funny."
24018,116,187,918000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Anyhoo...
24019,116,188,919000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We're doomed!
24020,116,189,921000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you had a head."
24021,116,190,921000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Check.
24022,116,191,924000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And your bottom was a little bigger.
24024,116,193,926000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You've worked hard at the bowling alley. Why don't you ask for a raise?
24025,116,194,931000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, a raise! I've never been good enough at any job to deserve one before. But I'm damn good at this one. That's it! I'm gonna march right up to Al and say..."
24027,116,196,938000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Steve -- I mean Al, I think I deserve a raise."
24028,116,197,944000,Al,Barney's Bowlarama,"Well, you're a hard worker and I'd like to give you a raise, but the alley just ain't doin' enough business to pay that kind of money."
24030,116,198,950000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,How about if I triple the business? Then could I get a raise?
24031,116,199,955000,Al,Barney's Bowlarama,"Well yeah, but how--"
24033,116,201,982000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Of course!
24035,116,203,985000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Bowling! Bowling here! Come bowl now! Get yer bowling! Who's ready?! Bowling!
24036,116,204,992000,Lisa Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Mom! Make Dad tell the story right.
24037,116,205,994000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,That's what really happened.
24038,116,206,996000,Lisa Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Oh.
24039,116,207,997000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"My marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials, but few stayed to bowl. I failed. Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I've ever done."
24040,116,208,1009000,Al,Barney's Bowlarama,"You did a great job Homer, and I'm really gonna miss you. The place has never been cleaner, and the way you kept the young people away... That was beautiful."
24042,116,210,1019000,Al,Barney's Bowlarama,"Anyway, we all pitched in and we got you this little goin' away thing."
24043,116,211,1029000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"This was the happiest time of my life. I'll never forget you guys. Especially you, Joey."
24044,116,212,1037000,Joey,Barney's Bowlarama,"See ya 'round, Mr. Homer."
24045,116,213,1038000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Don't worry, Joey. We'll make it to California some day."
24046,116,214,1042000,Joey,Barney's Bowlarama,"Sure we will, Mr. Homer. Sure we will."
24047,116,215,1047000,Customer #1,Barney's Bowlarama,"It's gonna be sad around here without you, Homer."
