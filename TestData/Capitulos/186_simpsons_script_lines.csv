42469,186,1,37000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Ha! Ha! This sting can't miss, boys. I mailed these bogus prize certificates to every scofflaw in Springfield."
42470,186,2,62000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"When they show up for their ""free motorboats,"" we arrest them and beat them to the full extent of the law."
42471,186,3,69000,Eddie,Springfield Police Station,"So, the hook is baited, huh?"
42472,186,4,72000,Lou,Springfield Police Station,"Heh. Nice metaphor, Eddie."
42473,186,5,74000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Yeah, good work, Eddie."
42475,186,7,76000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"""Up, up and away, in my beautiful, my beautiful motor boattt..."" Da-da-da-da-da."
42476,186,8,83000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,But we didn't enter any police raffle.
42477,186,9,86000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,That doesn't matter. The important thing is we won.
42478,186,10,92000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,I don't know... there's something very peculiar about this.
42479,186,11,96000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Sheesh! You're the most paranoid family I've ever been affiliated with.
42481,186,13,103000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"I'd like a yellow boat, please. With extra motors."
42482,186,14,106000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Police Station,"Yo. No cuts, bro. Where's my motorboat, pig?"
42483,186,15,110000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Uh, right through that door."
42484,186,16,116000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Police Station,"What the... Yo! Ouch! Oh, I call brutality on you!"
42455,186,17,121000,Lou,Springfield Police Station,You have the right to remain--
42485,186,19,121000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"All right, uh, Simpson, Homer. You're next."
42486,186,20,127000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Woo hoo!
42487,186,21,130000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Howdy, gents! I'm here to collect my free--"
42488,186,22,130000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,OW! OW! My boating arm! What's going on?
42489,186,23,136000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"You're under arrest, slimebag. What's this perp in for, Lou?"
42490,186,24,139000,Lou,Springfield Police Station,"Uh, 235 unpaid parking tickets. Totaling 175 dollars."
42491,186,25,145000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Ha, I hope you brought your checkbook, wise guy."
42492,186,26,147000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Lousy cops. Lucky for you I'm double-parked or I'd... There. Now, can I please have my motorboat?"
42494,186,28,159000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,Dad? Why aren't you saying anything? Where's our motorboat?
42495,186,29,163000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,I didn't like it. The mast had termites.
42496,186,30,165000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,Why would a motorboat have a mast?
42497,186,31,167000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Because... the thingee was... shut up.
42498,186,32,173000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Ooo, there's that new mega-mall they're building! They say the air conditioner will be more powerful than a million hydrogen bombs."
42499,186,33,181000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Hey, they can't just build a parking lot on Saber Tooth Meadow. That's where they discovered all those fossils!"
42500,186,34,187000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Fossils shmossils. You can't stop progress 'cause of some moldy old bones. Bones shmones.
42501,186,35,193000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"But they might be paving over rare specimens. Pull over so we can complain, Dad. Come on, who wants to complain with me?"
42502,186,36,202000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,Fine. I'll come back later. Who wants to come back with me? Fine.
42504,186,38,212000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,"My attorney, Lionel Hutz, calls your attention to Municipal Code 147-c: ""Protection of antiquities and fossils."""
42505,186,39,212000,Lionel Hutz,Construction Site,That's right.
42506,186,40,222000,Mall Executive,Construction Site,"There aren't any fossils here, little girl. Museum folks dug 'em all up years ago."
42507,186,41,228000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,"Oh, but what if they missed something? You have to allow an archeological survey!"
42508,186,42,232000,Mall Executive,Construction Site,Who's gonna make us? You?
42510,186,44,237000,Pr Man,Construction Site,"Now, hold on, Sid. Hold on. Maybe we should let the kid dig. Could be good publicity."
42511,186,45,244000,Pr Man,Construction Site,"All right. / Yeah. / Oh, yeah. / We could do that."
42512,186,46,246000,Mall Executive,Construction Site,Okay. You want to dig? Be my guest.
42513,186,47,250000,Lionel Hutz,Construction Site,Fine! We'll see you in court.
42514,186,48,252000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,"Mr. Hutz, we won."
42515,186,49,254000,Lionel Hutz,Construction Site,We?
42518,186,52,257000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Principal Skinner, remember how I didn't sue when I found that scorpion in my applesauce? Well, I'm calling in a favor."
42519,186,53,264000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Hmm. I knew this day would come.
42521,186,55,266000,Seymour Skinner,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Attention. All honor students will be rewarded with a trip to an archeological dig!
42522,186,56,268000,Terri Mackleberry,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Yay!
42523,186,57,274000,Seymour Skinner,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Conversely, all detention students will be punished with a trip to an archeological dig."
42524,186,58,278000,Milhouse Van Houten,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Oh, why? / Oh, no, not tomorrow. / Aw, crud."
42526,186,60,286000,Jimbo Jones,Construction Site,Gonna dig me a hole...
42527,186,61,286000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Construction Site,Gonna dig me a hole.
42528,186,62,289000,Jimbo Jones,Construction Site,Gonna put a nerd in it...
42529,186,63,289000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Construction Site,Gonna put a nerd in it.
42530,186,64,292000,Jimbo Jones,Construction Site,Gonna take a firecracker...
42531,186,65,292000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Construction Site,Gonna take a firecracker.
42532,186,66,296000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,This is so exciting! I can't wait to see what we find!
42533,186,67,300000,Seymour Skinner,Construction Site,"I must admit, it is rather exciting. And -- Why, look -- here's something right here!"
42534,186,68,304000,Seymour Skinner,Construction Site,"It appears to be some sort of rock. I-- Oh, no, it's just a clump of dirt. Even so, my heart is pounding like a kettle drum. I'd better sit down for a moment."
42535,186,69,317000,Ralph Wiggum,Construction Site,Princeskipper Skipple! Prinnipple Skimsker! I found something!
42536,186,70,324000,Ralph Wiggum,Construction Site,It's a spearhead!
42537,186,71,326000,Miss Hoover,Construction Site,"That's your trowel blade, Ralph. It fell off the handle."
42538,186,72,329000,Ralph Wiggum,Construction Site,And I found it!
42539,186,73,330000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,"Okay, everyone! Back to work! You never know when we might uncover a Tyrannosaurus."
42540,186,74,348000,Seymour Skinner,Construction Site,"Well, this was a big bust. Come on, kids. Let's go home to our mothers."
42541,186,75,354000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,Don't give up! I'm sure we'll find something!
42543,186,76,357000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,"C'mon, c'mon! A bottle cap, a shoe, a bar of gold, anything! She suddenly uncovers a white patch."
42544,186,77,369000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,Everybody! Come quick!
42545,186,78,374000,Crowd,Construction Site,"What is it? / What? / That's unbelievable. / Oh, this is nice. / Wow."
42546,186,79,376000,Homer Simpson,Construction Site,Lemme through! I got here late!
42547,186,80,385000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Construction Site,"Hmm, from the looks of it, I'd say this fellow died from causes unknown."
42548,186,81,392000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,"Look, there's more. What the heck is this thing?"
42549,186,82,395000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Construction Site,"Speaking from a strictly medical point of view, that ain't right."
42550,186,83,404000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,"Oh, my goodness."
42551,186,84,407000,Milhouse Van Houten,Construction Site,"What is it, Lisa?"
42552,186,85,409000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,It looks like a human skeleton... but these other bones look almost like wings.
42553,186,86,414000,Ned Flanders,Construction Site,You mean like... an angel?!!
42554,186,87,416000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,"Well, obviously that's impossible--"
42555,186,88,418000,Moe Szyslak,Construction Site,Lisa's right! It's an angel!
42556,186,89,423000,Homer Simpson,Construction Site,Now that's interesting.
42557,186,90,428000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,But it can't be an angel!
42558,186,91,432000,Moe Szyslak,Construction Site,"Oh, no? Well if you're so sure what it ain't, how 'bout tellin' us what it am?"
42559,186,92,439000,Crowd,Construction Site,Yeah! / What am it? / etc.
42560,186,93,439000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,"Well, maybe it's, uh, uh... a Neanderthal, who got bitten by some angry fish."
42561,186,94,457000,Caveman,Construction Site,Hmm?
42562,186,95,457000,Caveman,Construction Site,Ah! Ow! Ow! Ah!
42563,186,96,457000,Ned Flanders,Construction Site,"Oh-ho, I gotta say, Lisa, it sounds like you're strainin' to do some explainin'."
42564,186,97,462000,Chief Wiggum,Construction Site,"Yeah, everyone's heard of angels. But who's ever heard of a ""Neanderthal""?"
42565,186,98,468000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,It could be anything. It could be a mutant from the nuclear plant.
42566,186,99,472000,C. Montgomery Burns,Construction Site,"Oh, fiddle-faddle. Everyone knows our mutants have flippers. Oops. I've said too much. Smithers, use the amnesia ray."
42567,186,100,479000,Waylon Smithers,Construction Site,"You mean the revolver, sir?"
42568,186,101,480000,C. Montgomery Burns,Construction Site,Precisely. And be sure to wipe your own memory clear when you're finished.
42569,186,102,483000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Construction Site,"Now, regardless of what this thing is, it's a priceless scientific find. So our most pressing concern now is determining who owns such a valuable skeleton. And I'd like to suggest that I do."
42570,186,103,498000,Lisa Simpson,Construction Site,Hey! / What are you...? / Wait a minute. / Wait! Wait! Wait! / Settle down! / No! No! No! / Excuse me! / No! No!
42571,186,104,499000,Sideshow Mel,Construction Site,I'd like to hear from Lionel Hutz!
42572,186,105,502000,Lionel Hutz,Construction Site,"It's a thorny legal issue, all right. I'll need to refer to the case of Finders vs. Keepers."
42573,186,106,507000,Ned Flanders,Construction Site,"Oh, we can work this out, friends. In the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--"
42574,186,107,509000,Homer Simpson,Construction Site,"So long, suckers!"
42576,186,109,520000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on... Come on, Angel."
42577,186,110,523000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you doing with that?
42578,186,111,525000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm locking it up in my safe deposit closet with my other valuables.
42579,186,112,530000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll just leave it in here a few years and let it appreciate in value.
42580,186,113,534000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's probably a million years old, Dad. I think it's as valuable as it's gonna get."
42581,186,114,539000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Pfft. That's what they said about this Billy Beer, smartypants."
42582,186,115,546000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ahh. We elected the wrong Carter.
42583,186,116,549000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Coming up next... an hilarious ""boat giveaway"" scam nets Springfield's dumbest criminals!"
42584,186,117,555000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sounds like goood watchin'.
42585,186,118,563000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Hey-hey there, Marge. Just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you."
42586,186,119,568000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Get your own angel, ya moocher."
42587,186,120,570000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Thanks anyway, Homer."
42588,186,121,576000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, hello, Agnes."
42589,186,122,578000,Agnes Skinner,Simpson Home,"Sorry to trouble you, but I'm goin' in for surgery tomorrow, and I wondered if I could rub the angel with my foot for good luck. It's foot surgery."
42590,186,123,586000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I'm trying to eat here. Beat it, Pegleg!"
42591,186,124,590000,Agnes Skinner,Simpson Home,Jackass. Marge.
42592,186,125,598000,Crowd,Simpson Home,"Hey, we want to see the angel! / Come on, we want to see the angel! / I would like to... / Angel! Angel! Angel!"
42593,186,126,601000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"C'mon, Homer. I just want a quick look-see. Pay ya a buck..."
42594,186,127,604000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"A buck, eh? That gives me an idea..."
42595,186,128,607000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fifty cents, please."
42598,186,130,610000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,HEEERE'S THE ANGEL! / SEEEE THE ANGEL / IT'S MY ANGEL / NO ONE ELSE'S / NEXT TO-OO TH-E RAKES!
42599,186,131,618000,Lisa Simpson,GARAGE,"Dad, it's not fair to claim this thing is an angel. There's no proof of that."
42600,186,132,622000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,"No one's calling it an angel, Lisa. If you'll look carefully, you'll notice I never once used the word ""angel""."
42601,186,133,624000,Lisa Simpson,GARAGE,What about that sign right there?
42602,186,134,630000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,That's a typo.
42603,186,135,631000,Lisa Simpson,GARAGE,Just let me take it to the museum for one day. They can do scientific tests and prove it's not an angel.
42604,186,136,637000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,"Oh, no. Oh, no. We could lose out on bags and bags of money. It's sacrilegious, I tell ya."
42609,186,141,664000,Lisa Simpson,MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,Wow... so lifelike.
42611,186,143,676000,Stephen Jay Gould,Museum,Astonishing. Simply astonishing. One of the most singular specimens I've encountered in all my distinguished career.
42612,186,144,683000,Stephen Jay Gould,Museum,"But enough about my work. What did you want to show me, Lisa?"
42613,186,145,687000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,It's a bone scraping from that skeleton I found.
42614,186,146,690000,Stephen Jay Gould,Museum,"Oh yeah, the so-called ""angel."" The whole thing's preposterous, of course."
42615,186,147,695000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,Quite preposterous. But no one will believe me until I can prove what it really is. Can't you do a DNA test or something?
42616,186,148,701000,Stephen Jay Gould,Museum,Certainly. I'll have the results by tomorrow.
42617,186,149,704000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,"Oh, thank you so much! Uhm... you know I can't afford to pay you."
42618,186,150,709000,Stephen Jay Gould,Museum,I didn't become a scientist for financial gain. Whatever little money you have will be just fine.
42620,186,152,717000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"I say it's the Angel of Peace, ya idiot!"
42621,186,153,719000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"And I say it's the Angel of Mercy, you jerk!"
42622,186,154,722000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Excuse me. I took a piece of the skeleton for scientific analysis. Soon we will have all the facts.
42623,186,155,728000,Crowd,Simpson Home,You did what? / Analysis? / I don't like her.
42624,186,156,730000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Pfft! Facts are meaningless. You can use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true. Facts shmacts.
42597,186,158,740000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ahh, here's Dr. Gould now. What were the results, Professor?"
42423,186,159,743000,Stephen Jay Gould,Simpson Home,Inconclusive.
42626,186,160,744000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Inconclusive? Then why did you come running up like that?
42627,186,161,750000,Stephen Jay Gould,Simpson Home,Can I use your bathroom?
42629,186,163,753000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,Well. It appears science has faltered once again in the face of overwhelming religious evidence.
42630,186,164,760000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But--
42631,186,165,760000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Go home, science girl."
42632,186,166,762000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I am home.
42633,186,167,763000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Good. Stay there.
42634,186,168,765000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, folks. Get your angel glow sticks! No one gets into heaven without a glow stick!"
42635,186,169,770000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,I'll take four!
42636,186,170,773000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ugh, those morons make me so angry."
42637,186,171,776000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe so, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't call them morons."
42638,186,172,780000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But they are morons. What grown person could believe in angels?
42639,186,173,783000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well... your mother, for one."
42640,186,174,786000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You? But... you're an intelligent person, Mom."
42641,186,175,792000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"There has to be more to life than just what we see, Lisa. Everyone needs something to believe in."
42642,186,176,798000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not that I don't have a spiritual side. I just find it hard to believe there's a dead angel hanging in our garage.
42643,186,177,805000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"My poor Lisa. If you can't make a leap of faith now and then, well... I feel sorry for you."
42644,186,178,814000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't feel sorry for me, Mom. I feel sorry for you."
42645,186,179,819000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Next on Smartline: ""The Springfield Angel Controversy""."
42646,186,180,823000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Our guest tonight, making her 13th appearance on Smartline... Miss Lisa Simpson."
42647,186,181,827000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Kent.
42648,186,182,828000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Miss Simpson, how can you maintain your skepticism in spite of the fact that this thing really, really looks like an angel?"
42649,186,183,835000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I just think it's a fantasy. If you believe in angels, then why not unicorns, or sea monsters, or leprechauns?"
42650,186,184,840000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Ohh, that's a buncha baloney, Lisa. Everyone knows leprechauns are extinct."
42651,186,185,845000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, you can either accept science and face reality, or you can believe in angels and live in a childish dream world."
42654,186,187,852000,Moe Szyslak,CHURCH BASEMENT,Science! What's science ever done for us? TV off.
42655,186,188,856000,Ned Flanders,CHURCH BASEMENT,"Science is like a blabbermouth who ruins a movie by telling you how it ends. Well, I say there are some things we don't want to know! Important things!"
42656,186,189,864000,Crowd,CHURCH BASEMENT,Yeah! / Science stinks! / Down with science! / Etc.
42657,186,190,866000,Agnes Skinner,CHURCH BASEMENT,Enough talk. It's smashin' time!
42658,186,191,880000,Moe Szyslak,CHURCH BASEMENT,Take that! And that! And...
42659,186,192,880000,Moe Szyslak,CHURCH BASEMENT,Ooo! Ow! I'm paralyzed! I just hope medical science can cure me.
42660,186,193,892000,Robot,CHURCH BASEMENT,Why?! Why was I programmed to feel pain?!
42661,186,194,895000,Kent Brockman,CHURCH BASEMENT,Technocrats are learning a lesson in humility tonight as angel supporters lay waste to Springfield's scientific institutions.
42663,186,196,903000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ugh, I wish I'd never found those stupid bones! It's time to put an end to this. Bart, I'm borrowing your blue crowbar."
42664,186,197,910000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Good ol' Bluey.
42665,186,198,912000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, she's gonna smash the angel!"
42666,186,199,913000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Somebody stop her!
42667,186,200,919000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's gone...
42668,186,201,921000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh-ho, no! This can't be happening! What the hell are we gonna do with ten thousand angel ashtrayyys?"
42669,186,202,928000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I could take up smoking.
42670,186,203,930000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You damn well better!
42671,186,204,935000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, okay, don't panic. Marge, stop panicking. We need a replacement skeleton, and we need it now. Bart! Strip down to your skeleton!"

42675,186,208,954000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Nothing. Someone must have stolen it.
42676,186,209,957000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,Looks to me like Lisa Simpson found something science couldn't explain. So she had to destroy it.
42677,186,210,964000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Well, that's all the evidence I need. Arrest the girl!"
42678,186,211,968000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What?! She didn't do anything.
42679,186,212,970000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Give her a nice cell. Somethin' in ""C"" block."
42682,186,214,976000,Judge Snyder,MUNICIPAL COURT,"Lisa Simpson, you are charged with destruction of an historic curiosity, a misdemeanor. But in a larger sense, this trial will settle the age-old question of Science vs. Religion. Let the opening statements commence."
42683,186,215,989000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,MUNICIPAL COURT,"Your honor, over the coming weeks and months, we intend to prove Lisa Simpson willfully destroyed--"
42684,186,216,989000,Lenny Leonard,MUNICIPAL COURT,There's the angel!
42685,186,217,1007000,Judge Snyder,MUNICIPAL COURT,"I find the defendant not guilty. As for Science vs. Religion, I'm issuing a restraining order. Religion must stay 500 yards from science at all times."

42688,186,220,1024000,Moe Szyslak,Hilltop,"Well, it didn't ride up on no zebra."

42692,186,224,1040000,Chief Wiggum,Hilltop,"It's okay, son. Just relax and it'll come."
42693,186,225,1043000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Hilltop,Even Lisa Simpson must now agree we have witnessed a miracle.
42694,186,226,1047000,Lisa Simpson,Hilltop,Hardly. Anyone could have written that.
42695,186,227,1050000,Homer Simpson,Hilltop,"Oh angel, listen not to this child of Satan."
42696,186,228,1053000,Ned Flanders,Hilltop,"Reverend, I've got to admit, this doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated."
42697,186,229,1058000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Hilltop,"Oh, now be calm, Ned. But be afraid also. Tremendously afraid. For the day of reckoning is upon us."
42698,186,230,1067000,Crowd,Hilltop,"/ Reckoning? / Oh, no! / Oh!"
42700,186,232,1075000,Aide,Vatican,"Your Holiness, there is word from America. They say an angel has foretold the apocalypse."
42701,186,233,1082000,The Pope,Vatican,"Uhm, keep an eye on it."
42703,186,235,1084000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"This could be our last day together, my love. How about a farewell romp in the garden of earthly delights?"
42704,186,236,1091000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, Edna, my sweet buttercup, you read my mind. Just, uh, give me twenty minutes, or so, to finish these tardy slips."
42706,186,238,1098000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why are we getting dressed up, Mom? Are we going to Black Angus?"
42681,186,239,1102000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... you might say we're going to the best steakhouse in the whole universe.
42707,186,240,1107000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,So we're not going to Black Angus.
42708,186,241,1110000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Will you leave me alone? It's bad enough you're making me go to your stupid ""Judgment Day""."
42709,186,242,1116000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Please, Lisa. I don't know exactly what's gonna happen, but I really wish we could make peace before sunset."
42710,186,243,1124000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nothing is going to happen, Mom. I hate to disappoint you, but the world is not coming to an end."
42712,186,245,1136000,Ned Flanders,Hilltop,"Well, shall we sing a hymn? Uh, ""Nearer My God to Thee"", maybe? Or, or, or ""Amazing Grace""?"
42713,186,246,1143000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Hilltop,"Uhm, nah."
42714,186,247,1145000,Homer Simpson,Hilltop,"Oh, Marge, don't let go, no matter what. If they want you in heaven, they gotta take me, too."
42715,186,248,1153000,Chief Wiggum,Hilltop,Ten seconds till sundown.
42716,186,249,1160000,Selma Bouvier,Hilltop,We did it. We beat cancer.

42738,186,270,1268000,Lisa Simpson,Hilltop,"I don't understand, Professor. Why didn't your tests show the skeleton was a fake?"
42739,186,271,1273000,Stephen Jay Gould,Hilltop,"I'm gonna be honest with you, Lisa. I never did the tests."
42741,186,273,1279000,Waylon Smithers,MALL ENTRANCE,"Uh, sir, ah, about that, uh, ah, that kiss. I-hi-hi, I hope you understand it was merely a sign of my respect."
