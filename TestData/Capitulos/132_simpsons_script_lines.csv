28176,132,7,79000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Hey, Marge, remember when we used to make out to this hymn?"
28178,132,9,83000,Congregation,First Church of Springfield,"OH, WON'T YOU COME WITH ME AND TAKE MY HAND? / OH, WON'T YOU COME WITH ME AND WALK THIS LAND?"
28179,132,10,96000,Seymour Skinner,First Church of Springfield,PLEASE TAKE MY HA-A-A-ND!
28180,132,11,99000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Wait a minute -- This sounds like rock and/or roll.
28182,132,13,106000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,"I know one of you is responsible for this. So repeat after me: If I withhold the truth, may I go straight to hell, where I will eat naught but burning hot coals and drink naught but burning hot cola..."
28183,132,14,127000,Ralph Wiggum,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,... where fiery demons will punch me in the back...
28184,132,15,130000,Kids,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,... where fiery demons will punch me in the back...
28185,132,16,130000,Bart Simpson,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,...where my soul will be chopped into confetti and strewn upon a parade of murderers and single mothers...
28186,132,17,130000,Kids,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,... where my soul will be chopped into confetti and strewn upon a parade of murderers and single mothers...
28187,132,18,134000,Milhouse Van Houten,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,...where my tongue will be torn out by ravenous birds...
28188,132,19,139000,Kids,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,... where my tongue will be torn out by ravenous birds...
28190,132,21,139000,Milhouse Van Houten,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,Bart did it! That Bart right there!
28191,132,22,142000,Bart Simpson,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,Milhouse!
28192,132,23,143000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Rev. Lovejoy's Office,"Milhouse, you did the right thing. Bart, come with me for punishment. You too, Snitchy."
28194,132,25,149000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"I want you to clean every one of these organ pipes that you have befouled with your ""popular music."""
28195,132,26,149000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,You shank. How could you tell on me?
28196,132,27,166000,Milhouse Van Houten,First Church of Springfield,"Well, I didn't want hungry birds pecking my soul forever."
28197,132,28,169000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Soul? Come on, Milhouse. There's no such thing as a soul. It's just something they made up to scare kids, like the Boogeyman or Michael Jackson."
28198,132,29,178000,Milhouse Van Houten,First Church of Springfield,"But every religion says there's a soul, Bart. Why would they lie? What would they have to gain?"
28199,132,30,184000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,I don't hear scrubbing.
28200,132,31,187000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Well, if your soul's real, where is it?"
28201,132,32,189000,Milhouse Van Houten,First Church of Springfield,"It's kinda in here. And when you sneeze, that's your soul trying to escape. Saying ""God bless you"" crams it back in. And when you die, it squirms out and flies away."
28202,132,33,200000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Uh huh. What if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean?
28203,132,34,203000,Milhouse Van Houten,First Church of Springfield,"Oh, it can swim. It's even got wheels, in case you die in the desert and it has to drive to the cemetery."
28204,132,35,210000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"How can someone with glasses that thick be so stupid? Listen. You don't have a soul, I don't have a soul, there's no such thing as a soul."
28205,132,36,218000,Milhouse Van Houten,First Church of Springfield,"Fine. If you're so sure about that, why don't you sell your soul to me."
28206,132,37,224000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,How much you got?
28207,132,38,225000,Milhouse Van Houten,First Church of Springfield,Five bucks.

28218,132,48,251000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Marge's Station Wagon,"Well, what about this place? ""Moe's."""
28220,132,50,252000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Agh! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me!
28221,132,51,260000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought this was a family restaurant."
28222,132,52,263000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, it is. It is. Just, uh, pull them stools up to the pool table."
28223,132,53,267000,Little Hibbert Girl,Moe's Tavern,"Daddy, this place smells like tinkle."
28224,132,54,271000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Moe's Tavern,"Mmm-hmm, I think we'll just go to The Texas Cheesecake Depository."
28225,132,55,274000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Everybody is goin' to family restaurants these days. Seems nobody wants to hang out in a dank pit no more.
28226,132,56,280000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Ya ain't thinking of gettin' rid of the dank, are ya, Moe?"
28227,132,57,283000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, maybe I am."
28228,132,58,285000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Aw, but Moe, the dank. The dank!"
28229,132,59,287000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah. Family restaurants. That's where the big bucks are. I could turn this joint into a place where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring your family, huh?"
28230,132,60,296000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I'm not ashamed.
28231,132,61,299000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, put a coaster under that."
28233,132,63,310000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Li-sa. There's a little present for you lying in the driveway."
28234,132,64,315000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh boy! Really?
28236,132,66,325000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Nooooo! It's dripping funny-smelling water all over me!
28237,132,67,338000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I wasted five bucks on these.
28238,132,68,340000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Where'd you get five bucks? I want five bucks.
28239,132,69,343000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I sold my soul to Milhouse.
28240,132,70,345000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What? How could you do that? Your soul is the most valuable part of you!
28241,132,71,350000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You believe in that junk?
28242,132,72,351000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, whether or not the soul is physically real, Bart, it's the symbol of everything fine inside us."
28243,132,73,357000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Poor gullible Lisa. I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks."
28244,132,74,362000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever. For five dollars, Milhouse could own you for a zillion years."
28245,132,75,369000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if you think he got such a good deal, I'll sell you my conscience for four-fifty."
28247,132,76,373000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll throw in my sense of decency, too. It's a Bart sales event! Everything about me must go!"
28249,132,78,379000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Hey, boy. How ya doin'?"
28251,132,80,382000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Man, what's gotten into you?"
28253,132,82,385000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Geez. You're pretty uppity for someone who eats bugs all day.
28255,132,84,393000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Stupid automatic door.
28256,132,85,399000,Todd Flanders,Kwik-E-Mart,"Thank you, door."
28257,132,86,407000,DOLPH,Kwik-E-Mart,Ha! Some ice cream guy's gonna see that and it'll blow his mind.
28258,132,87,410000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Let me try.
28259,132,88,415000,Jimbo Jones,Kwik-E-Mart,"Way to breathe, No-Breath."

28270,132,99,453000,Barney-Shaped Form,Moe's Tavern,I hate it.
28271,132,100,456000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Oh boy. The deep fryer's here.
28272,132,101,458000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I got it used from the Navy. You can flash-fry a buffalo in forty seconds.
28273,132,102,463000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Forty seconds? But I want it now.
28275,132,104,519000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know that's funny, but I'm just not laughing."
28276,132,105,521000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmmm... Pablo Neruda said laughter is the language of the soul.
28277,132,106,526000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I am familiar with the works of Pablo Neruda.
28278,132,107,528000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I think we should do a test.
28280,132,109,543000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Well?
28281,132,110,545000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Nope. I don't feel a thing.
28283,132,111,547000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's creepy, Bart. I think you really did lose your soul."
28285,132,113,555000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Nothing.

28310,132,138,662000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, uh, uh, let me guess. A mother can always tell. Hmm, it's not fear of nuclear war. Hmm, it's not swim test anxiety. It almost feels like you're missing something. Something important."
28164,132,139,679000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Like I don't have a soul?
28246,132,140,682000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, honey, you're not a monster."
