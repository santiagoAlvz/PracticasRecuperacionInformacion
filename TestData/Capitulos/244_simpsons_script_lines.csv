60062,244,111,521000,Lindsay Naegle,A.A. Meeting,And that's when you realized you were an alcoholic...
60063,244,112,524000,Gil Gunderson,A.A. Meeting,"Oh, no. I never touch the stuff. But you don't have to be drunk to know the value of Amway."
60064,244,113,529000,Gil Gunderson,A.A. Meeting,"Now this is used crankcase oil, which you ladies know is murder to clean up, ya know. And company's coming!"

60068,244,117,552000,Homer Simpson,A.A. Meeting,The sugar cookies you speak of. Are they real or symbolic?
60069,244,118,556000,Lindsay Naegle,A.A. Meeting,They're on that table over there.
60070,244,119,558000,Homer Simpson,A.A. Meeting,I don't wanna walk that far. Anything that takes twelve steps isn't worth doing. Get it? Huh? Twelve? Steps.

60074,244,123,576000,Creature,Simpson Home,Hurt everyone.
60075,244,124,578000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Did Gaga just say ""hurt everyone""?"
60076,244,125,580000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Gaga. Cute name.
60077,244,126,581000,Announcer,Simpson Home,The Springfield phone book needs a new cover!

60095,244,144,640000,Barney Gumble,Airfield,I'd like to sign up for helicopter lessons.
60096,244,145,643000,Instructor,Airfield,"Sorry pal, but it takes a special kind of man to pilot these birds."
60097,244,146,648000,Barney Gumble,Airfield,I've got a coupon.
60098,244,147,649000,Instructor,Airfield,"Okay, get in."
60100,244,149,653000,Instructor,Helicopter,"Elvis played a chopper pilot one time. He made so many darn mistakes, we were just laughin' at him."
60101,244,150,661000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,"Great singer, though."
60103,244,151,662000,Instructor,Helicopter,"Oh, absolutely. You know who else I like is that, uh, Leo Sayer. Anyway, we're nice and level now. How'd you like to take the controls?"
60104,244,152,671000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,You think I'm ready?
60105,244,153,673000,Instructor,Helicopter,"Sure I do. One sec... Testing black box, one, two... She's all yours, friend."
60106,244,154,684000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,"Whoa, whoa, ah, ah."
60107,244,155,687000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,"Hey, I think I'm gettin' it!"
60108,244,156,690000,Instructor,Helicopter,"Yes, that's great. Now, let's just pull ourselves out of this tailspin here."
60109,244,157,697000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,"Ooh, oh, I'm sorry 'bout that."
60110,244,158,699000,Instructor,Helicopter,It's okay. That's what the diapers are for.
60112,244,160,705000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Now, when the mama bird returns to feed her babies, we'll have a prize-winning picture."
60113,244,161,710000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Lisa, people these days don't want to see a baby bird. They want to see celebrities at their worst."
60114,244,162,718000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Is that Rainier Wolfcastle?
60115,244,163,720000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Check out the gut!
148014,244,164,721000,WOLFCASTLE,Springfield Town Square,It's for a movie. I'm filling a fat secret agent.
60117,244,166,729000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, Homer. Ah, no, no, no, don't sit there. Take this seat, right next to the tap."
60118,244,167,734000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,But that's Barney's seat. Are you tryin' to make me the new Barney?
60119,244,168,738000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, every bar needs a world-class drunk."
60120,244,169,741000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, someone who makes our alcoholism seem less raging."
60121,244,170,744000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, forget it, guys. I am not Barney!"
60122,244,171,751000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"See, Homer? It's not so bad. Now dance, rummy!"
60123,244,172,754000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Okay...
60125,244,174,763000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You danced for hours just because they told you to?
60126,244,175,766000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If I didn't, I'd lose their respect."
60128,244,177,770000,Barney Gumble,Simpson Home,"Check it out, Homer! I'm flying this thing!"
60129,244,178,774000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Get it away from the house!
60130,244,179,776000,Barney Gumble,Simpson Home,Wanna go for a ride?
60131,244,180,777000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Can I, Marge? Can I?"
60132,244,181,778000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, go! Just go!"
60134,244,183,782000,Homer Simpson,Helicopter,So you missed some big changes at Moe's. He hangs newspapers over the urinals now. You can read the sports page while you pee. Very la-di-da.
60135,244,184,793000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,"I've made some big changes, too. Can you believe I'm flying this helicopter?"
60136,244,185,796000,Instructor,Helicopter,Power lines! Power lines!
60137,244,186,798000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,"Whoops, sorry. When I think about all the time I wasted at Moe's..."
60138,244,187,804000,Homer Simpson,Helicopter,Wasted? What about our staring contests? And the way we always knew what football coaches should've done? Remember the day we jumped that Census guy and stole his clicker?
60139,244,188,814000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,"Those are all priceless memories, Homer, but I don't want to do that stuff anymore."
60140,244,189,819000,Homer Simpson,Helicopter,"Oh, so you're better than me, is that it?"
60141,244,190,822000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,I didn't say that.
60142,244,191,824000,Homer Simpson,Helicopter,Take me home.
60143,244,192,825000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,"Oh, don't be that way, Homer."
60144,244,193,826000,Homer Simpson,Helicopter,I'll scream.
60145,244,194,826000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,"Okay, okay!"
60147,244,196,833000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,So how was your ride with Barney?
60148,244,197,835000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't wanna talk about it!
60149,244,198,851000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Stupid Barney, thinks he's too good for me."
60150,244,199,854000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Cheer up, Homie. You don't need friends to be happy. I haven't had a friend in years."
60151,244,200,859000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But you've got me. Who have I got?
60152,244,201,862000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you still have Lenny and Carl."
60153,244,202,865000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lenny and Carl suck. Please don't tell Lenny and Carl I said that, 'cause if I ever lost them as friends..."
60154,244,203,872000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if Barney's that important to you, you've gotta work it out. Old friends stick together, like O.J. and A.C., or the Falcon and the Snowman."
60155,244,204,880000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, why can't I have a nickname?"
60157,244,206,887000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Okay, that's it... looks good... Oh, Bart, the bulldog didn't ante!"
60158,244,207,896000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Okay, on three. One... two..."
60159,244,208,899000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Backyard,"Perfect. Phone book cover, here I come. Haw haw!"
60160,244,209,902000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Hey! No fair! We'll never get a good picture.
60161,244,210,907000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Hey, why don't we dump spaghetti on Maggie's head?"
60102,244,211,909000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,That picture's a cliché .
60162,244,212,911000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Picture?

60198,244,248,1011000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"No, it's not okay. I broke barstools, befouled your broom closet, and made sweet love to your pool table... which I then befouled."
60199,244,249,1019000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, that would explain the drop-off in play."

60203,244,253,1031000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,"Unfortunately, fire trucks are unavailable to fight the blaze, as they are all being used to film the new Burt Reynolds movie, ""Fireball and Mudflap."" I caught up with Burt on the set."
60204,244,254,1041000,Kent Brockman,Moe's Tavern,"So, Burt, tell us a little about ""Fireball and Mudflap."""

60227,244,277,1141000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,You brave man. You took six silver bullets for me.
60228,244,278,1146000,Homer Simpson,Helicopter,Stay away from my wife!
60229,244,279,1150000,Barney Gumble,Helicopter,Looks like it's up to me.
60232,244,281,1164000,Bart Simpson,Mt. Springfield,We should be safe up here. I'm pretty sure fires can't climb trees.
60233,244,282,1167000,Lisa Simpson,Mt. Springfield,Ow!

60242,244,291,1214000,Homer Simpson,Mt. Springfield,You can't prove I did it.
60243,244,292,1217000,Lisa Simpson,Mt. Springfield,"No, you saved our lives."
60244,244,293,1220000,Homer Simpson,Mt. Springfield,I could do a lotta things if I had some money.
60245,244,294,1223000,Lisa Simpson,Mt. Springfield,What?
60246,244,295,1224000,Bart Simpson,Mt. Springfield,"Now, there's a picture."

60260,244,309,1270000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Park,Yeah. So what do you call this stuff?
60261,244,310,1273000,Barney Gumble,Springfield Park,A double tall mocha latte.
60262,244,311,1277000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Park,It's not bad.
60263,244,312,1278000,Barney Gumble,Springfield Park,"Well, it ain't beer, but at least I got that monkey off my back."
