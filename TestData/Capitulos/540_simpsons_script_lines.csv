140492,540,37,250000,Milhouse Van Houten,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Mr. Book Guy? Can I go first? I was once cast to play Fallout Boy in a movie.
140493,540,38,256000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Tell it to Harlan Ellison.
140494,540,39,258000,Harlan Ellison,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,I think you over-privileged kids with your electronic tablets and your talking phones wouldn't know a good piece of fiction if your iPod read it to your ass!
140495,540,40,267000,Milhouse Van Houten,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,I wish someone would've come from the future and warned me not to talk to you.
140496,540,41,271000,Harlan Ellison,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,That's my idea. You're stealing my idea.
140497,540,42,274000,Milhouse Van Houten,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Sorry.

140501,540,46,298000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Indeed. And how did you spend your evening?
140502,540,47,301000,Milo,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Let's see... I wrote a ""Lost"" fan fiction finale that also answers all the questions from ""Twin Peaks..."" re-ranked all the ""Dr. Who""s by puffiness of the hair... oh, and I also got married to my actual, non-imaginary, comic-tolerating girlfriend, Strawberry!"
140503,540,48,316000,Strawberry,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Now when Milo talks to himself it won't seem crazy.
140504,540,49,319000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"So, Milo talks to himself. We will treasure that information. Yes we will."
140505,540,50,328000,Milo,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna share this primo origin ish with my bride. Even the mintiest comic is just acidifying pulp if you have no one to read it with, right?"
140506,540,51,337000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Nerds don't get girls!
140507,540,52,339000,Milo,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"These days they do, man. Comicon is now eight percent women."
140508,540,53,344000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Wrong! Wrong! Wr-- or... is he?
140509,540,54,348000,Homer Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"C'mon, buddy. I gotta get home and climb into bed with my loving wife."
140510,540,55,351000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Oh right, you have a loving wife?"
140511,540,56,354000,Homer Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Marge and I get along perfect. We're like George Burns and John Denver.
140512,540,57,362000,Homer Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Man, carrying these kids is hard on my back."
140513,540,58,369000,Homer Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,And now to Moe's.
140514,540,59,370000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Look at him, he's got family... friends... what do I have? ""Jimmy Olsen versus Matter-Eater Lad."" Hm, better than I remembered actually. No! No, it isn't! It's horrible! The only thing that could make this moment more clich√©d is if I started to sing about my feelings... and here I go."

140533,540,77,500000,Stan Lee,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Come on, Nudnick. Ask her out."
140534,540,78,502000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,You're interfering!
140535,540,79,503000,Stan Lee,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Hey, I'm ninety years old. I can do what I want."

140543,540,87,544000,Kumiko,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Yes, through window. But you don't see me. You're either looking down in disgust or up in disdain. I think you have great soul."
140544,540,88,552000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Would you permit me to go in the back and do a brief inventory?

140553,540,97,593000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But why pick me?
140554,540,98,594000,Comic Book Guy,Simpson Home,Because you're the only fat man in real life who ever got a hot woman.
140556,540,100,598000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, come in! I'll explain how it all works. Okay, it helps if she's got a mother she's trying to get back at."
140558,540,102,608000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Streets,No woman will be able to resist you dressed like this.
140559,540,103,611000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Streets,"Now remember, don't be the way you normally are, and sustain that for the rest of your life."
140560,540,104,617000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield Streets,"Kumiko, meet my dear friends, Homer and Marge Simpson. In my country it is a tradition to bring a much older couple on a first date. It is not in any way weird or sad."
140561,540,105,628000,Kumiko,Springfield Streets,Does anyone tell you that you look like the man on a box of Mr. Sparkle?
140562,540,106,632000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,Aka ni taishte burei da! Yogore o yaburu!
140563,540,107,637000,Kumiko,Springfield Streets,"In Japan, drinking your detergent is a popular method of suicide!"
140564,540,108,641000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,Honki da yo?!
140567,540,111,647000,Marge Simpson,Restaurant,"Kumiko, for you we chose the coolest restaurant in town."
140568,540,112,650000,Kumiko,Restaurant,But the walls are covered with garbage.
140569,540,113,655000,Homer Simpson,Restaurant,"Not garbage, Americana."
140570,540,114,660000,Cletus Spuckler,Restaurant,Here's some more Americana that bubbled up in the swamp.

140573,540,117,672000,Comic Book Guy,Restaurant,They're neither in alphabetical nor geographical order! What madness is this?!
140574,540,118,677000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Restaurant,"Please, sir, ask your questions after all fifty ""tates""!"
140575,540,119,678000,Comic Book Guy,Restaurant,I cannot hide the snide inside!
140576,540,120,687000,Kumiko,Restaurant,"I don't mind. If you think it's stupid, say it's stupid."
140577,540,121,692000,Comic Book Guy,Restaurant,Really?
140578,540,122,693000,Kumiko,Restaurant,"In Japan, no one ever says what they think. We know our game shows are degrading and our baseball fences are too close. But no one says anything."
140579,540,123,702000,Comic Book Guy,Restaurant,"Attention restaurateurs! You should've spent less on the kitsch and more on the kitchen! With this bowl of Chuck's Cherokee Salsa, I baptize you mediocre at best!"
140580,540,124,715000,Kumiko,Restaurant,American nerd snark is the finest in the world. Let's go walking and mocking in the rain.
140581,540,125,722000,Comic Book Guy,Restaurant,I'm in love! And yet still a little bitter. It's surprising.
140583,540,127,738000,Jim-jam Bonks,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Father, why-sa you-sa forsake-a me-sa?"
140585,540,128,762000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Marge, Homer, you have nurtured our love like Steven Spielberg nurtured the careers of Zemeckis and Gale..."
140587,540,130,770000,Kumiko,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"So we want you to know I have decided to move in, to the basement under his store."
140588,540,131,775000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"At last we'll be in the same bed, just like Batman and Robin."
140591,540,134,782000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I want you to take Kumiko and Comic Book Guy a housewarming present... and maybe check in on them?"
140592,540,135,788000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"We've talked about this, Marge. The hammock is a chore-free zone."
140593,540,136,793000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Apparently including tying the knots on the hammock.
140594,540,137,798000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And getting the termites out of the trees.
140595,540,138,803000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Not a word.
140597,540,140,807000,Yutaka,Springfield Street,"Excuse me, sir, I am looking for my daughter. I thought this was her residence, but all I see is a store full of non-pornographic manga."
140598,540,141,817000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"You're Kumiko's father? Welcome, sensei!"
140599,540,142,821000,Yutaka,Springfield Street,"I am not Kung Fu instructor. I am humble salaryman who could kick your ass. Say, has anyone told you you look like--"
140600,540,143,827000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"I know, Mr. Sparkle."
140601,540,144,829000,Yutaka,Springfield Street,"I was going to say, like you're going to have a stroke."
140602,540,145,833000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,I get that a lot too.
140603,540,146,834000,Yutaka,Springfield Street,"Now please, where is my daughter?"
140604,540,147,837000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Okay, she moved in with her boyfriend. Well, he's not a boy. He's immature, but fat and old."
140605,540,148,843000,Yutaka,Springfield Street,"So, an obese nerd has stolen my daughter to live in his basement?!"
140606,540,149,848000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,I didn't tell you about the basement.
140607,540,150,849000,Yutaka,Springfield Street,It was an obvious guess!
140609,540,152,854000,Yutaka,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Daughter, you are coming back to Japan! There are eighty-seven old people who need you to take care of them."
140610,540,153,861000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,No! Please! Please! I was becoming cuddly! I deleted rants from my blog!
140611,540,154,866000,Yutaka,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,You can retrieve rants if you did not empty your trash. Goodbye!
140613,540,157,876000,Comic Book Guy,LIVING ROOM,"Now I know I've got a heart, because it's breaking. Wizard of Oz reference! Did I do that? Urkel reference! Help me. Fly reference! I can't stop. I can't stop."
140614,540,158,889000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Homer Simpson, this was your doing. And I want you to fix it!"
140615,540,159,893000,Comic Book Guy,LIVING ROOM,I have a bad feeling about this. Every-action-movie-ever-made reference!
140616,540,160,897000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,Now!
140619,540,163,900000,Yutaka,SWANKYFISH,"Homer, we have much in common. We both love our daughters and discipline our sons."
140620,540,164,906000,Homer Simpson,SWANKYFISH,"No, discipline would imply I'm trying to make him better... so, are you married?"
140621,540,165,914000,Yutaka,SWANKYFISH,My dear Michiko has passed away but she is always with me.
140622,540,166,917000,Michiko,SWANKYFISH,You promised double suicide!
140623,540,167,919000,Yutaka,SWANKYFISH,You hear what you want to hear!
140624,540,168,922000,Yutaka,SWANKYFISH,Always with me. Another drink! Something stronger!
140625,540,169,933000,Bartender,SWANKYFISH,Snake rice wine.
140626,540,170,936000,Homer Simpson,SWANKYFISH,Now that's disgusting. Wine made of rice?
140627,540,171,943000,Bartender,SWANKYFISH,Try some.
140628,540,172,944000,Yutaka,SWANKYFISH,Hei.
140631,540,175,953000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Why didn't I stop with the snake wine? Why did I drink the fish wine?
140632,540,176,959000,Yutaka,Springfield,That was the aquarium!
140633,540,177,982000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield,You didn't see nothin'. Scram!
140634,540,178,1022000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Springfield,I am ruined by whimsy!

140637,540,181,1039000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,We'll explain it!
140638,540,182,1040000,Lisa Snail,Springfield,The rice wine has penetrated to the essence of your souls.
140639,540,183,1045000,Bart Snail,Springfield,"Yeah, listen to my tail."
