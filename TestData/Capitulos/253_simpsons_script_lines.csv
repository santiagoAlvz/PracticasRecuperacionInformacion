62649,253,20,159000,Bart Simpson,Supply Closet,I needed to get my mind on something else. Anything else.
62619,253,21,163000,Bart Simpson,Supply Closet,"And for the first time in my life, education was the answer."

62671,253,43,253000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Dad, what happened to the back seat?"
62672,253,44,255000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,I had to sell it for gas money.
62673,253,45,260000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Which I spent on a novelty horn.
62674,253,46,264000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Maybe we should talk to a financial planner.
62675,253,47,267000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Financial panther, eh?"
62676,253,48,271000,Banker,Simpson Car,"Mr. Simpson, you're a dollar overdrawn."

62681,253,53,283000,Chief Wiggum,FINANCIAL PLANNING OFFICE,"Eh, you know how it is with cops. I'll get shot three days before retirement. In the business, we call it ""ret-irony."""
62682,253,54,286000,Financial Planner,FINANCIAL PLANNING OFFICE,What if you don't get shot?
62683,253,55,290000,Chief Wiggum,FINANCIAL PLANNING OFFICE,"What a terrible thing to say. Now look, you made my wife cry."

62686,253,58,303000,Lindsay Naegle,FINANCIAL PLANNING OFFICE,I couldn't ask you to do that.
62687,253,59,305000,Homer Simpson,FINANCIAL PLANNING OFFICE,Consider it done.
62688,253,60,306000,Lindsay Naegle,FINANCIAL PLANNING OFFICE,"Based on these figures, I'm afraid you'll need to declare bankruptcy... several times. Just look at this projection."
62689,253,61,317000,Homer Simpson,FINANCIAL PLANNING OFFICE,"Marge, your posture looks terrible."
62690,253,62,320000,Lindsay Naegle,FINANCIAL PLANNING OFFICE,"What's interesting is, you'll continue losing money even after you're dead. Your gravesites will go untended and vandalized."
62691,253,63,327000,Nelson Muntz,FINANCIAL PLANNING OFFICE,Haw haw!
62692,253,64,329000,Lindsay Naegle,FINANCIAL PLANNING OFFICE,"Mr. Simpson, your intelligence profile indicates that you're too ""stupid"" to stick to a budget."

62702,253,74,367000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"I disabled the button, sir. Anyway, I need some time off. As you know, I've been writing a musical about the Malibu Stacy doll."
62703,253,75,374000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"A show about a doll? Why not write a musical about the common cat? Or the King of Siam? Give it up, Smithers."
62704,253,76,383000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Actually, sir, we've been booked into a small theater in New Mexico."

62717,253,89,438000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'm just trying to work up the courage to ask Burns for a raise. Or a highly-paid internship. Something to solve my money woes.
62718,253,90,448000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hmm, this must be some sort of cafetorium."
62719,253,91,448000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ah, here's your chance, Homer. Mr. Burns just ""entered"" the room."
62720,253,92,460000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hmmm. What is this? Some kind of force-field around these vegetables.
62721,253,93,468000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That's the sneeze guard. You have to lean under it to get salad or sneeze on stuff.
62722,253,94,472000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Everything's so green and alive!
62723,253,95,476000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Mr. Burns... I was wondering if I could get a raise.
62724,253,96,482000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What kind of a raise?
62725,253,97,484000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Whopping?
62726,253,98,485000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I see. You have thirty seconds to wow me.
62727,253,99,489000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, sir... you see, sir... I've worked here a long time, and my wife has a game leg, and my kids have game things as well..."
62728,253,100,497000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I don't want to hear your whining. I'm a bored and joyless old man, give me a laugh!"
