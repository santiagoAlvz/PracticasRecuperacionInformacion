89162,344,204,946000,Needy Woman,Jail,I love the way I've heard of you!
89164,344,206,950000,Chief Wiggum,COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,"So Bart, as you can see... from what I just said... everyone is a winner here."
89167,344,209,967000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,A shirt from that rap concert... Bart must've gone to the show. But that means...
89168,344,210,972000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"...Bart was never kidnapped! Lisa, I'm very glad you brought me this. I'll see that it gets to the proper authorities."
89169,344,211,980000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad!? Why did you do that?
89170,344,212,983000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hollywood producers have paid me a fortune, which I've already lost, for the rights to Bart's story. So I have to destroy anything that proves that story's not true."
89171,344,213,996000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why did you burn up your shirt?
89172,344,214,998000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What shirt? I don't see any shirt.
89173,344,215,1004000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Burn the truth. Burn the truth.
89176,344,218,1009000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"So you see Principal Skinner, that's why I had to come to you."
89177,344,219,1012000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Wait, why did your father burn his pants?"
89178,344,220,1014000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"It doesn't matter. The point is, only with your help can I expose Bart's lies."
89179,344,221,1020000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,A chance to bring down Bart Simpson? Our school's second most-wanted criminal after the mysterious El Barto?
89180,344,222,1029000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Hmm... sign me up!
89182,344,224,1030000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Hall,"Boys, let me tell ya. Now that I'm commissioner, the shaves are hotter, the steaks are thicker, and I've got my own private bathroom, so Lou here won't be using my sonic toothbrush on his rotten choppers. Yeah."
89183,344,225,1044000,Lou,Springfield Town Hall,"Uh, listen, Commissioner... Lisa Simpson came by the office today, asking questions about her brother's kidnapping."
89184,344,226,1050000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Hall,Questions?!
89186,344,227,1051000,Lou,Springfield Town Hall,"Yes, as if she were trying to unravel a tapestry of deceit."
89188,344,229,1062000,Chief Wiggum,Jail,"All right, people, we got a situation here. Your daughter's gonna blow our whole deal sky high."
89189,344,230,1067000,Homer Simpson,Jail,You leave Maggie to me.
89190,344,231,1070000,Chief Wiggum,Jail,"No, Lisa!"
89191,344,232,1071000,Homer Simpson,Jail,Not her! She'll hunt us down relentlessly -- like a bloodhound mixed with a student loan officer!
89192,344,233,1078000,Kirk Van Houten,Jail,"Hey, I can't leave this place! I get three square meals a day and trailer time with Springfield's craziest chicks."
89194,344,235,1086000,Chief Wiggum,Jail,"Hey, I've got the most to lose here. I just printed up ten thousand business cards -- how am I going to pass these all out before she catches me!"
89195,344,236,1093000,Chief Wiggum,Jail,Give me a call sometime! Give me a call sometime! Here comes the panic!
89196,344,237,1096000,Bart Simpson,Jail,"People, please. The only way Lisa can bust me is if she finds someone who can prove I was at that rap show. And I know just where she can find that someone. Let's go cover our asses!"
89197,344,238,1108000,Chief Wiggum,Jail,"Wait, before we go, I took the liberty of making these embroidered conspiracy jackets for all of us."
89198,344,239,1113000,Homer Simpson,Jail,"Wow, those jackets are beautiful."
89199,344,240,1116000,Chief Wiggum,Jail,We must never wear them.
89201,344,242,1123000,Lisa Simpson,FANCY ESTATE,"Mr. Alcatraaaz, my name is Lisa Simpson, and this is Principal Skinner."
89202,344,243,1127000,Seymour Skinner,FANCY ESTATE,Hi. Would you mind showing us video footage of your last concert?
89203,344,244,1131000,Alcatraaaz,FANCY ESTATE,No problem. I've got a two hundred inch plasma TV. In my shoe closet.
89205,344,246,1141000,Seymour Skinner,FANCY ESTATE,I'm sharing a laugh with my new friends!
89207,344,248,1143000,Bart Simpson,Alcatraaaz Mansion,HOMER IS A FAT LOAD!
89208,344,249,1146000,Audience,Alcatraaaz Mansion,HOMER IS A FAT LOAD!
89209,344,250,1149000,Lisa Simpson,Alcatraaaz Mansion,This proves Bart lied about being kidnapped!
89210,344,251,1152000,Seymour Skinner,Alcatraaaz Mansion,Not yet. Can we verify exactly what time Bart was at the show?
89211,344,252,1160000,Seymour Skinner,Alcatraaaz Mansion,If only we had the exact date.
89212,344,253,1165000,Seymour Skinner,Alcatraaaz Mansion,"Bingo! Thank you, Mr. Alcatraaaz."
89213,344,254,1168000,Alcatraaaz,Alcatraaaz Mansion,Ain't nothin'.
89214,344,255,1169000,Seymour Skinner,Alcatraaaz Mansion,"Ah, ah, ah. ""It is nothing."""
89128,344,256,1169000,Alcatraaaz,Alcatraaaz Mansion,"It's idiomatic, biatch."
89215,344,257,1175000,Chief Wiggum,Alcatraaaz Mansion,"All right, hand over the tape and nobody gets hurt."
89216,344,258,1180000,Chief Wiggum,Alcatraaaz Mansion,This is hopeless. My gun isn't even loaded.
89217,344,259,1183000,Chief Wiggum,Alcatraaaz Mansion,"Aw nuts. They're gonna release that tape and our hoax will be exposed. Well, I guess I'll go back to Baltimore and sell ribbon with my Daddy. Ribbon! Get your ribbon! Great for presents!"
89218,344,260,1197000,Bart Simpson,Alcatraaaz Mansion,Wait a minute. Why do we have to come clean? Nobody's been hurt. Everyone's happier with the lie.
89219,344,261,1202000,Homer Simpson,Alcatraaaz Mansion,The lie is love.
89220,344,262,1205000,Lisa Simpson,Alcatraaaz Mansion,Wait just a minute.
89221,344,263,1206000,Homer Simpson,Alcatraaaz Mansion,Love the lie!
89222,344,264,1208000,Lisa Simpson,Alcatraaaz Mansion,"The way I was raised, by Mom, I learned the truth can't be swept under the rug."
89223,344,265,1214000,Bart Simpson,Alcatraaaz Mansion,"That's a very noble sentiment, Lisa. But for once in your life, can't you just be cool?"
89224,344,266,1218000,Homer Simpson,Alcatraaaz Mansion,"Yeah, be cool. Like us."
89225,344,267,1220000,Homer Simpson,Alcatraaaz Mansion,"Coolee, coolee cool! C'mon, fool! Be coolee, coolee cool!"
89227,344,269,1228000,Alcatraaaz,Alcatraaaz Mansion,"Yo, put away your glocks, man."
89228,344,270,1231000,Seymour Skinner,Alcatraaaz Mansion,"Yes. Share with us the wisdom of the street, oh mighty Alcatraaaz."
89229,344,271,1235000,Alcatraaaz,Alcatraaaz Mansion,"There are times in life when the truth ain't black nor white, but a subtler shade of gray, y'all. And when the path of justice is obscured by the fog of uncertainty, there is only one solution. House par-ty!!"
89231,344,273,1259000,Lisa Simpson,ALCATRAAAZ' HOUSE,"Dad, I don't understand. After all the corruption and deceit we've witnessed, how can everyone just party?"
89232,344,274,1266000,Homer Simpson,ALCATRAAAZ' HOUSE,"Lisa, the world is a very complicated place. And when you get right down to it... cannonball!"
89233,344,275,1280000,Seymour Skinner,ALCATRAAAZ' HOUSE,Do you think there's a place in the hip-hop world for a forty-something elementary school administrator?
89234,344,276,1285000,Alcatraaaz,ALCATRAAAZ' HOUSE,Hell yes.
89235,344,277,1287000,Seymour Skinner,ALCATRAAAZ' HOUSE,Hmmm.
89236,344,278,1287000,Alcatraaaz,ALCATRAAAZ' HOUSE,But I'm already payin' a guy for that.
89237,344,279,1289000,Gary Chalmers,ALCATRAAAZ' HOUSE,"Skinner! I order you to step off, dog."
89238,344,280,1295000,Gary Chalmers,ALCATRAAAZ' HOUSE,"I think they're making fun of me, but my wife is very sick."
