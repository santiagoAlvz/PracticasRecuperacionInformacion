16759,89,226,992000,Ned Flanders,OUT AT SEA,"Wrong, we're saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die."
16760,89,227,999000,Homer Simpson,OUT AT SEA,"Woo-hoo! See that, boy? Your old man was right, not Flanders. We are doomed! In your face, Flanders!"
16761,89,228,1010000,Bart Simpson,OUT AT SEA,"Well, at least Ned is trying! What are you doing to help?"
16762,89,229,1013000,Homer Simpson,OUT AT SEA,"Well, since you're all such a bunch of big ration-babies, I'll just be in charge of the rationing."
16763,89,230,1018000,Homer Simpson,OUT AT SEA,"Observe, boy. The secret is to take tiny bites, like so:"
16765,89,232,1029000,Bart Simpson,OUT AT SEA,STOP IT! / STOP IT! / DAD!
16766,89,233,1033000,Homer Simpson,OUT AT SEA,Why couldn't I be on one of the smart rafts. I bet they're having the time of their life.
16769,89,236,1053000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"I keep telling you, lady, your husband and son have to be missing for a week before we can start searching. I'd like to help sooner, I would, but we're very, very busy down here."
16770,89,237,1063000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,King me.
16772,89,239,1065000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Still no help.
16773,89,240,1067000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Kitchen,"You know, it is cougar season. And those things don't mess around."

16777,89,244,1079000,Homer Simpson,OUT AT SEA,"This ain't one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, Flanders. This is the Real Thing..."
16778,89,245,1088000,Homer Simpson,OUT AT SEA,"All right, well that's okay. When they come to rescue him, they'll rescue us."
16781,89,248,1103000,Ned Flanders,RAFT,Here's our chance! Dolphins always help humans lost at sea.
16783,89,250,1107000,Ned Flanders,RAFT,"Come back! Come back! Oh, we're done for! We're done for! We're Done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily..."

16785,89,252,1126000,Ned Flanders,RAFT,"Thank you, Homer, I dunno what got--"
16786,89,253,1128000,Bart Simpson,RAFT,"Dad, I think he's oka--"

16798,89,267,1178000,Homer Simpson,Ocean,"Son, there's something I was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, I want you to have it now."
16799,89,268,1187000,Bart Simpson,Ocean,A real Swiss army knife. Cool!
16800,89,269,1191000,Homer Simpson,Ocean,I stole it from that Borgnine guy.
16802,89,271,1194000,Ernest Borgnine,Woods,"Don't worry, kids, I'll take care of him with my trusty..."
16803,89,272,1200000,Ernest Borgnine,Woods,Uh... uh... Um.. Uh... Hmm...
16805,89,274,1207000,Bart Simpson,OUT AT SEA,"Dad, I know I've been a little hard on you the last couple of days. If I had the strength to lift my arms, I'd give you a hug."
16806,89,275,1215000,Homer Simpson,OUT AT SEA,Thanks boy. Now be careful when you...
16807,89,276,1220000,Bart Simpson,OUT AT SEA,"Dad, don't take this wrong, but your expression doesn't fill me with confidence."

16809,89,278,1238000,Bart Simpson,OUT AT SEA,"Hey, wait! I smell hamburgers too."

16815,89,284,1267000,Accountant,OFFSHORE OIL RIG,We tried to tell you these are unmanned oil rigs.
16816,89,285,1270000,Krusty the Clown,OFFSHORE OIL RIG,Close the damn thing down! No one's ever gonna come.
