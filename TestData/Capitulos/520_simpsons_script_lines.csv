135137,520,75,341000,Mary,Cletus's Shack,Eight more payments and I own this. But are you sure there ain't no video game you'd rather be playin'?
135138,520,76,346000,Bart Simpson,Cletus's Shack,"All eyes on you, baby."
135104,520,77,348000,Mary,Cletus's Shack,"Well, tell your eye-ears to watch-listen to this!"

135159,520,98,438000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer Simpson! Did you take Maggie to Moe's?
135160,520,99,441000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It was during Happy Hour. Don't you want our baby to be happy?
135161,520,100,444000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't you see, you're taking women for granted. And aside from being lumped together and generalized about, it's the one thing all women hate."
135162,520,101,453000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How can something that applies to Bart apply to me? I'm so much older and wiser.
135163,520,102,459000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,More like balder and wider.

135185,520,124,540000,Mary,COMMUNITY CENTER,"Bart Simpson, you get out of that gosh-darned fugue state this instant! Lift my spirits!"
135186,520,125,545000,Bart Simpson,COMMUNITY CENTER,"Um... lifting people's spirits is an interesting topic. For centuries, Neanderthal and astronaut alike have enjoyed lifting spirits."

135188,520,127,556000,Brazilian Man,COMMUNITY CENTER,"Excuse me, I am a Brazilian record producer. I concentrate in the rapidly-growing jug band-samba fusion market."

135202,520,144,641000,Bart Simpson,South Street Squidport,Am I getting dumped?
135203,520,145,645000,Caricature,South Street Squidport,"Okay Bart, maybe you blew it by taking Mary for granted. Women are life's great mystery, along with why do they give you salt and pepper at a Chinese restaurant. But if you want one more shot, I know a date that'll turn this mighty Aphrodite into your purple rose of Cairo. Those are movies I made -- my oeuvre. Sounds dirty, but it's not."
135205,520,147,679000,Caricature,Art Movie House,Everyone's fast asleep. It's like my second wedding night. Except more walkouts and there were no refunds. Gee...

135211,520,153,702000,Mary,INSPIRATION POINT,"Bart, I think it's best if we ""take a break."""
135212,520,154,706000,Bart Simpson,INSPIRATION POINT,Good idea. I can chuck eggs at the other couples.
135213,520,155,709000,Mary,INSPIRATION POINT,"Just hug me, dummy."
135214,520,156,718000,Bart Simpson,INSPIRATION POINT,Back pats?! This is a break up!
135215,520,157,724000,Mary,INSPIRATION POINT,You'll be fine: there's a pot for every possum.
135217,520,158,727000,Bart Simpson,INSPIRATION POINT,Give me another chance. I'll be way more attentive to your needs on the seesaw -- I'll stay down there for as long as you want.
135218,520,159,733000,Mary,INSPIRATION POINT,"Sorry, Bart, I'm a hillbilly girl of thirteen. If I'm not married in the next few months, nobody's gonna want me. Not even Ol' Joe Clabby."
135219,520,160,741000,Ol' Joe Clabby,INSPIRATION POINT,"Hey, you're a pretty li'l thing, you are. But, tick-tock, tick-tock."
135220,520,161,745000,Mary,INSPIRATION POINT,"Goodbye, Bart."
135221,520,162,747000,Brandine Del Roy,INSPIRATION POINT,"Aw, sweetie. I told you this would happen if you dated outside the family."
135223,520,164,756000,Chief Wiggum,INSPIRATION POINT,"Move along, relationship's over."
135224,520,165,759000,Chief Wiggum,INSPIRATION POINT,Sure do like forcing people to leave areas.
135226,520,167,765000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I was the only one without a date at Patty's new lady friend's travel bookstore soft opening!
135227,520,168,770000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You told me it was up to me if I wanted to go!
135228,520,169,773000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You should know that me saying I don't care means I couldn't care more.
135229,520,170,777000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself!!!
135230,520,171,784000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, would you go to your room while your father and I finish our little talk?"
135231,520,172,787000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Little talk? You guys are having a big fight! This is the problem with women! They don't say what they mean, until it's too late!"
135232,520,173,794000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right. Fine. If you boys want it, I'll tell you what I really think."
135233,520,174,799000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Finally, we're gettin' somewhere."
135234,520,175,802000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're both in the doghouse, which is misleading 'cause I still like the dog."
135235,520,176,809000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hand me my suitcase, boy."
135236,520,177,812000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,When do I get a Krusty suitcase?
135237,520,178,813000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,When you're older.
135240,520,181,821000,Bart Simpson,Building,So this is where you go when Mom kicks you out?
135241,520,182,823000,Homer Simpson,Building,"You're saying it like it happens all the time. And by the way, the paint's a little faded on my parking spot. You call this a Platinum Club experience?"
135242,520,183,832000,Front Desk Man,Building,"We'll get right on it, Mr. Simpson."
135243,520,184,834000,Homer Simpson,Building,"I've told you a thousand times, call me Homer!"
135244,520,186,839000,Bart Simpson,Apartment Building,What's this notice on the wall?
135245,520,187,841000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,Standard hotel boilerplate. It just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours.
135246,520,188,845000,Bart Simpson,Apartment Building,"Aw, man! We just missed it."
135247,520,189,848000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,"Oh, it'll happen again, son."
135248,520,190,849000,Bart Simpson,Apartment Building,"Um, I've gotta make a phone call."
135249,520,191,851000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,Knock yourself out.
135250,520,192,855000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,Not again!
135252,520,194,859000,Bart Simpson,Brokewood Apartments,"Mary? That's odd, I thought I was calling the Suicide Not Line. Because I'm doin' great. So, um, how are you handling ""taking a break?"""
135253,520,195,868000,Mary,Brokewood Apartments,Great! It turns out Adele was right: ain't nothin' better for songwritin' than when your relationship takes a bolt to the brain. Tell me what you think:
135254,520,196,878000,Mary,Brokewood Apartments,I BROKE UP WITH A FELLA BUT I AIN'T GRIEVIN' / HE WAS MUCH TOO PROUD OF UNDERACHIEVIN'
135255,520,197,890000,Mary,Brokewood Apartments,"I CAN'T BELIEVE I LIKED HIM, I MUST HAVE BEEN BLIND"
135256,520,198,896000,Mary,Brokewood Apartments,HE WASN'T SO SMART OR HANDSOME OR KIND...EVERY MOMENT WITH THAT BOY WAS TOTALLY HORRID / AND I CAN'T EVEN TELL WHERE HIS HAIR MEETS HIS FOREHEAD.
135257,520,199,912000,Bart Simpson,Brokewood Apartments,Why did I buy her that rhyming dictionary?
135258,520,200,915000,Mary,Brokewood Apartments,"MY EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, NOW I SEE HIS WARTS / I WISH HIM WELL, DOWN IN HELL, WHERE HE'LL EAT HIS OWN SHORTS! It just poured out of me, like venom from a snake!"
135259,520,201,934000,Homer Simpson,Brokewood Apartments,I had this idea years ago...but your mother wouldn't let me do it.
