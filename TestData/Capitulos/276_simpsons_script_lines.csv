69899,276,83,453000,Homer Simpson,Cell,"No, you are an angel like Denzel Washington in ""The Preacher's Wife,"" or Will Smith in ""Bagger Vance,"" or Slimer in ""Ghostbusters."""
69900,276,84,463000,Marge Simpson,Cell,"Sir, we know you're not an angel. My husband sees too many movies."

69915,276,100,528000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Okay Gabriel, this is a ""bar."" It's where I go to drink ""alcohol,"" which is the mortal equivalent of your ambrosia."
69916,276,101,536000,Gabriel,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, I am not an angel!"
69917,276,102,539000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, not with that temper."
69918,276,103,543000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Look, the thing about my family is, there's five of us. Marge, Bart, girl-Bart, the one who doesn't talk, and the fat guy. How I loathe him."

69924,276,109,581000,Bart Simpson,Clearing,They chose me.
69925,276,110,583000,Gabriel,Clearing,"Homer, your problem is quite simple. You're a drunken, childish buffoon."
69926,276,111,588000,Homer Simpson,Clearing,...Which is society's fault because...
69927,276,112,591000,Gabriel,Clearing,"It's your fault, Homer. But I've got an exercise that will help all of you break out of the roles you're stuck in. Who feels like lunch?"
69928,276,113,598000,Homer Simpson,Clearing,"Me. / Right here. / Oh, me too. / Please."
69929,276,114,601000,Gabriel,Clearing,Good. I hung it on the top of that tree.
69930,276,115,604000,Bart Simpson,Clearing,But how are we supposed to get it?
69931,276,116,605000,Gabriel,Clearing,You'll just have to cooperate.
69932,276,117,607000,Homer Simpson,Clearing,Cooperate?! This is one family that doesn't swing that way.
69933,276,118,613000,Gabriel,Clearing,"Are you sure? I made roast beef sandwiches, one falafel..."
69934,276,119,618000,Lisa Simpson,Clearing,Thank you.
69935,276,120,619000,Gabriel,Clearing,...And plenty of beer.
69936,276,121,620000,Homer Simpson,Clearing,Gimme that beer!
69939,276,124,638000,Lisa Simpson,EDGE OF GORGE,"Gabriel, are you okay?"
69940,276,125,640000,Gabriel,EDGE OF GORGE,"Yes, but I'm afraid your lunch has attracted some unwanted visitors."
69941,276,126,648000,Marge Simpson,EDGE OF GORGE,"We've got to do something, but what?"
69942,276,127,651000,Homer Simpson,EDGE OF GORGE,"Okay, family huddle."
69943,276,128,653000,Homer Simpson,EDGE OF GORGE,"Here's how it's gonna go down. As a family, we drive away. We cover for each other -- as a family. It's what Gabriel would have wanted."
69944,276,129,662000,Lisa Simpson,EDGE OF GORGE,"Look, we can't fall into old patterns. We've gotta think of a plan."
69945,276,130,665000,Homer Simpson,EDGE OF GORGE,"Okay, but talk like this."
69946,276,131,668000,Lisa Simpson,EDGE OF GORGE,"Fine, I'll talk like this."
69947,276,132,670000,Homer Simpson,EDGE OF GORGE,What?
69949,276,134,673000,Homer Simpson,GORGE,"Look, Gabriel. We're learning to work together."
69950,276,135,677000,Gabriel,GORGE,"That's great, but so are the wolves and cougars."
69952,276,137,690000,Lisa Simpson,GORGE,"Dad's on the log. Now Mom, you get the car and pull them to safety."
69953,276,138,696000,Marge Simpson,GORGE,"My driving ankle! Bart, I know this sounds crazy, but do you think you can drive the car?"
69954,276,139,704000,Bart Simpson,GORGE,"Okay, but it's my first time."
69955,276,140,707000,Marge Simpson,GORGE,Here's the keys.
69956,276,141,708000,Bart Simpson,GORGE,I got a set.
69958,276,143,720000,Lisa Simpson,EDGE OF GORGE,"Now, Bart!"
69961,276,146,731000,Gabriel,LOG IN GORGE,Give them the food!
69962,276,147,737000,Homer Simpson,LOG IN GORGE,"Oh, no! The roast beef is making them stronger -- and the falafel is making them angrier!"
69963,276,148,746000,Gabriel,LOG IN GORGE,Give them the beer! It will impair their motor skills!
69964,276,149,750000,Homer Simpson,LOG IN GORGE,"No! I will never... Oh wait, it's Blatz."
69965,276,150,762000,Homer Simpson,LOG IN GORGE,"Hey, they're all right."
69967,276,152,764000,Simpsons,Simpson Car,WE ARE FAMILY!

69971,276,156,774000,Gabriel,Simpson Car,"Well, I think you all did great. You broke out of your normal roles to accomplish something as a family. I've really earned my wings."
69972,276,157,783000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,I knew it!
69973,276,158,784000,Gabriel,Simpson Car,"No, I mean this CD -- ""The Best of Wings""."
69974,276,159,790000,Gabriel,Simpson Car,BAND ON THE RUN....
69975,276,160,792000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"You know, we've been through some two hundred and eighty adventures together, but our bond has never been stronger."
69976,276,161,801000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Yep. Our family is as functional as all get out.
69977,276,162,805000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,Could this be the end of our series... of events?
69979,276,164,820000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Oh, it's the woman I married in Vegas!"
69981,276,166,824000,Gabriel,Car,"Homer, you're a bad man, and your seed should be wiped from the earth. No offense, children."
69982,276,167,838000,Minister,Car,"Homer and Ned, you may now kiss your brides."
69983,276,168,841000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Give it to me, baby."
69984,276,169,844000,Ned Flanders,Car,Homer!
69985,276,170,845000,Homer Simpson,Car,It's okay. We're married.
69986,276,171,847000,Marge Simpson,Car,You and Ned married a couple floozies?
69987,276,172,850000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Marge, I'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. Liquors drunkened me."
69988,276,173,855000,Marge Simpson,Car,"If I Had known there were loose women in Las Vegas, I would never have let you go."
69989,276,174,859000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Look, I did marry her, but I abandoned her. Amber, tell her how I abandoned you."
69990,276,175,865000,Marge Simpson,Car,This is the worst thing you've ever done.
69992,276,177,870000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Well, Ginger, sure is, uh, um, neat that you managed to hunt me down."
69993,276,178,876000,Ginger,Flanders Home,Where's the bed?
69994,276,179,878000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh Lord, I know my new wife is a little more... ""peppermint"" than you're used to. But, uh, I know you'd want me to honor my sacred vows, so I will."
69995,276,180,887000,Ginger,Flanders Home,"Hey stud, where do you keep your Wet Ones? I need a shower."
69996,276,181,890000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh, we've got a real shower upstairs."

69999,276,184,903000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Get out, Homer."
70000,276,185,904000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, I married her, but that is as far as we went. We never, ever made whoopee -- or even mouth whoopee."
70001,276,186,911000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I don't know if I can ever forgive you. Please go away."
70005,276,190,947000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You can't kick me out. It'll cause a miscount in the census. A miscount!
70008,276,193,955000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Of all the things that have ever come back to bite me in the ass, this is the worst."

70028,276,213,1025000,Todd Flanders,Flanders Home,Me! Me! / I do!
70030,276,215,1027000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Hey, ""Vegas Mom,"" how long are you gonna stay here?"
70031,276,216,1032000,Amber Dempsey,Simpson Backyard,"Oh, I'm not goin' anywhere. I already unpacked my delicates."
70032,276,217,1037000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Doesn't it bother you that you're breaking up our family?
70033,276,218,1039000,Amber Dempsey,Simpson Backyard,"You know, I bet you and me could be friends. I could show you how to put on makeup."
70034,276,219,1045000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Backyard,I'm eight years old.
70035,276,220,1047000,Amber Dempsey,Simpson Backyard,You could look seven. And I could teach you to count cards.

70044,276,229,1113000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you come inside and we'll talk?
