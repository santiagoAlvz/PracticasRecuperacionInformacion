137827,530,7,48000,Homer Simpson,OUTDOOR MALL,Better clean that off.
137828,530,8,54000,Homer Simpson,OUTDOOR MALL,"You have a great day, ma'am."
137829,530,9,58000,Marge Simpson,OUTDOOR MALL,Wish I could get a little of that attention.
137831,530,11,65000,Ned Flanders,OUTDOOR MALL,"Hey, Simpsons! Don't mean to be a pesto, but I'll be happy to watch your scampy shrimp."
137799,530,12,69000,Homer Simpson,OUTDOOR MALL,"Aww... thanks, Flanders. Gotta warn ya, he doesn't talk much."
137800,530,13,73000,1-Year-Old Bart,OUTDOOR MALL,Daddy!
137832,530,14,74000,Homer Simpson,OUTDOOR MALL,He's not your daddy.
137833,530,15,76000,1-Year-Old Bart,OUTDOOR MALL,Nice Daddy. Moustache Daddy. Good Daddy no-yell.
137834,530,16,81000,1-Year-Old Bart,OUTDOOR MALL,Fat daddy smell like beer!
137835,530,17,83000,Homer Simpson,OUTDOOR MALL,I'll teach you to speak in complete sentences.
137836,530,18,87000,Homer Simpson,OUTDOOR MALL,"But first, m'lady, let me escort you to Heaven -- the fancy Swiss chocolate store on level three!"

137844,530,26,148000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,OUTDOOR MALL,They have to get off and get back on.
137845,530,27,150000,Supervisor,OUTDOOR MALL,Sometimes you have to say to hell with rules.
137847,530,29,157000,Homer Simpson,THE SAME MALL,But somehow our anniversaries didn't get better than that first one on the train.
137848,530,30,162000,Lisa Simpson,THE SAME MALL,Wait... you named me after a train?
137849,530,31,166000,Homer Simpson,THE SAME MALL,"Yeah, just like we did with Bart. Anyway, this year I'm gonna recreate our magical first anniversary, ending with a romantic ride on that..."
137850,530,32,168000,Homer Simpson,THE SAME MALL,Why are you taking away the train?
137851,530,33,178000,Worker,THE SAME MALL,I'm afraid no one rides it anymore despite millions in government subsidies. So we're replacing it with something that makes money and sends people to the food court.
137852,530,34,187000,Hippie-looking Guy,THE SAME MALL,"Step right up! Medical marijuana! You got nausea, my friend? Everyone's got nausea!"
137853,530,35,193000,Hippie-looking Guy,THE SAME MALL,"And what is your malady, my son?"
137854,530,36,195000,Otto Mann,THE SAME MALL,"Uh... I had one, but I forgot it."
137855,530,37,198000,Hippie-looking Guy,THE SAME MALL,Memory loss! Could be a brain tumor! Take this and go see Fantasia!
137856,530,38,205000,Homer Simpson,THE SAME MALL,"Kids, I've only had three great ideas: marrying your mother, using a hot dog as a straw, and this romantic train ride anniversary. Sir, I need this train!"
137857,530,39,216000,Worker,THE SAME MALL,"Take it home, it's yours."
137859,530,40,218000,Lisa Simpson,THE SAME MALL,Are you sure mom is really gonna want a rusted-out kiddy train?
137860,530,41,221000,Homer Simpson,THE SAME MALL,She won't see it like this. I'll make this train look as beautiful as it did when this mall was young.
137861,530,42,227000,Lisa Simpson,THE SAME MALL,"Aww, Dad, I just got a little twinge in my heart."
137862,530,43,230000,Otto Mann,THE SAME MALL,Try this.
137863,530,44,231000,Homer Simpson,THE SAME MALL,You stay away from my kids unless you're driving them to school!
137864,530,45,234000,Otto Mann,THE SAME MALL,So I'm not babysitting tomorrow night?
137865,530,46,237000,Homer Simpson,THE SAME MALL,"Oh, we're still on for tomorrow night."
137867,530,48,242000,Lisa Simpson,Street,Dad! Do we have to ride like this?
137868,530,49,245000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Hey, what could be cooler than a choo-choo with lollipops on it?"
137869,530,50,248000,Jimbo Jones,Street,Hey babies! Where you goin' in your baby train? Babytown?
137871,530,52,254000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Shake it off kids, they're just jealous!"
137872,530,53,257000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Street,Hey Lardo! Where're you goin' in your Lardo car? Lardville?
137873,530,54,261000,Homer Simpson,Street,There's no such place!
137875,530,56,265000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, I've entered my billing address... expiration date... and charged!"
137876,530,57,271000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"We're back from ""Baby Beethovens."""

137880,530,61,285000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Yeah, what size cufflinks do you get an elephant?"
137881,530,62,287000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well in the first place, the elephant's cufflinks would be the same size. It's the cuffs that would be bigger. As for Homer, I'm getting him a case of his favorite snack cakes, Dolly Madison."
137882,530,63,298000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,Marge -- this isn't Dolly Madison. It's Sassy Madison.
137883,530,64,303000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Trust me, Homer doesn't care where the cupcakes come from."

137896,530,77,363000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,You've got a lot of fish wriggling in that net. Maybe I should get married so I can date these guys.
137897,530,78,368000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Selma, cheating is a sin. As much a sin as not replying to an instant message. So, if you'll excuse me, I've got a lot of sleazy gentlemen to let down gently!"

137911,530,93,438000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I am focused on this like a laser. ""Laser."" That's a funny word. It's just ""loser"" with an ""a."" And speaking of losers, I've lost my train of thought. Oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see--"
137912,530,94,452000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The surprise is safe! The expression on her face will be priceless!
137914,530,95,457000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He forgot our anniversary again? He remembers the exact number of pork chops in the freezer.

137919,530,100,477000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought I was buying snack cakes!
137920,530,101,477000,Ben,Simpson Home,"That's so cute. Really, really cute. You are over eighteen, right?"
137921,530,102,485000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I am, and you seem more interested in my day than my husband!"
137922,530,103,485000,Ben,Simpson Home,"I know what it's like not to be listened to. Please ignore every sensible instinct you have and continue this conversation. And by the way, this is my real voice."

137928,530,109,513000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I bet you're wondering why I stayed on the computer until four a.m."
137929,530,110,526000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, those Yelp reviews don't write themselves. Did you know a well-placed one star can destroy a mom and pop hardware in nothing flat?"
137930,530,111,533000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen, I want us to be honest with each other."
148607,530,112,536000,Homer's Brain,Simpson Home,"Uh-oh. If you're honest, you'll have to tell her about the train!"
137941,530,113,540000,Homer's Thoughts,Simpson Home,What train?
148608,530,114,541000,Homer's Brain,Simpson Home,How stupid are you?
137931,530,115,543000,HOMER THOUGHTS,Simpson Home,"Thinking is your department, jerk! That's what I pay you in beer for!"
148609,530,116,547000,Homer's Brain,Simpson Home,Just for that I'm not going to help you.
137932,530,117,549000,HOMER THOUGHTS,Simpson Home,What? Where're your going? I--
137933,530,118,552000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Um, Marge, I have to go."
137934,530,119,553000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What? Now? Why?
137937,530,122,566000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,He's writing me again! Better put a stop to this.
137938,530,123,571000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,"Is that him, getting the text?"
137939,530,124,576000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,He's in the market! We might've squeezed the same tomatoes!
137940,530,125,580000,Ben,Supermarket,Are you Marge?
137858,530,126,582000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,"Oooohhh, I'm going to Hell!"
137942,530,127,584000,Ben,Supermarket,"I'm sorry, I didn't even know you were here. What a crazy coincidence that you buy food too."
137943,530,128,588000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,"Gee, I thought you'd be some kind of creep. But you're actually a perfectly normal-looking--"
137944,530,129,594000,Ben,Supermarket,"Whoa! ""A"" is for ""apple,"" right?"
137945,530,130,598000,Ben,Supermarket,O-kay. I'll just be going.
137946,530,131,600000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,"Wait, wait, wait! Let me get the stain out. But not here..."
137947,530,132,606000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,I know a place where no one in town will see us.
137948,530,133,613000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,There you go. Good as new.
137949,530,134,616000,Ben,Supermarket,"Now, let me at least buy you a coffee, or dare I say... a Danish?"
137950,530,135,620000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,No Danishes!
137951,530,136,621000,Ben,Supermarket,"Sorry, I go to pastry way too fast."
137952,530,137,624000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,I want to be very clear. I'm a happily married woman. Going on ten years. The aluminum anniversary! Nothing turns leftovers into swans like aluminum!
137953,530,138,635000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,"What the heck am I saying? Homer's probably at that bar right now, getting hammered."
137955,530,140,642000,Homer Simpson,Back Room of Moe's,All worth it for Marge!
137957,530,142,644000,Ben,Supermarket Coffee Shop,"Marge, you are terrific. I am so glad I reset my distance filter from fifteen to twenty-five miles."
137959,530,144,649000,Ben,Supermarket Coffee Shop,Your Homer is the luckiest man on earth.
137960,530,145,653000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket Coffee Shop,"Well, he keeps falling down a cliff and living, so I guess that's true."
137961,530,146,657000,Ben,Supermarket Coffee Shop,"The only time my wife and I talk is when I apologize. ""Life's an infernal muddle,"" as Mr. Drake says on ""Upton Rectory."""
137962,530,147,664000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket Coffee Shop,"Ooh, I love that show!"
137963,530,148,667000,Ben,Supermarket Coffee Shop,"Isn't it great? Finally, a reason to watch TV on Sundays."
137964,530,149,670000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket Coffee Shop,"Such great characters, like Buxton the scheming larder-keep. Why can't Lady Cavendish see he's pilfering the aspic?"
137965,530,150,681000,Ben,Supermarket Coffee Shop,"Uh, does, does Homer watch?"
137966,530,151,682000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket Coffee Shop,He says shows set during World War One are too sad. Particularly how everyone's always climbing stairs.
137967,530,152,688000,Ben,Supermarket Coffee Shop,"You are watching the season finale this week, right?"
137968,530,153,691000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket Coffee Shop,"Yeah. Alone, I'm sure."
137969,530,154,693000,Ben,Supermarket Coffee Shop,"Well, we could... live blog it."
137913,530,155,696000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket Coffee Shop,"Save that sugar for your coffee, Bub."
137970,530,157,702000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'VE BEEN WORKIN' ON THE RAILROAD...
137971,530,158,705000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why are you singing that?
137972,530,159,706000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because it's in the public domain?
137973,530,160,708000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hello! It's Moe from Moe's Tavern.
137974,530,161,712000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, uh, I'd better take this. Y'see, Moe's been depressed and needs to hear a friendly voice. Why the hell are you calling me at home, you moron?!"
137976,530,163,722000,Moe Szyslak,Back Room of Moe's,Lovejoy went to get a hamburger and the whole thing fell apart!
137977,530,164,726000,Lenny Leonard,Back Room of Moe's,I'm gettin' cooked like a cabbage!
137978,530,165,727000,Moe Szyslak,Back Room of Moe's,Then keep quiet like a cabbage!
137979,530,166,729000,Homer Simpson,Back Room of Moe's,"All right, all right, I'll be right there!"
137982,530,169,745000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Is it me or did this house just get classy?
137983,530,170,752000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom! Lisa made me break a lamp!
137984,530,171,754000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom! Bart's twisting facts in an Orwellian fashion!
137985,530,172,758000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Can I have one hour of grownup time where you two aren't tattling on each other or using obscure references?
137986,530,173,764000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Orwell, obscure? The author of ""Animal Farm?"""
137987,530,174,767000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Grampa says he was a Commie.
137988,530,175,769000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No tattling!

137993,530,180,794000,Ben,Ben's Bedroom,No. I can't. My wife's watching a reality show about a man who repossesses zoo animals.
137994,530,181,799000,Ramona,Ben's Bedroom,"C'mon, taser that flamingo!"
137995,530,182,802000,Ben,Ben's Bedroom,Can't believe I'm missing the finale.

137999,530,186,820000,Marge Simpson,Ben's Bedroom,Can you follow everything okay?
138001,530,187,822000,Ben,Ben's Bedroom,I guess sometimes you just don't end up with the person you're supposed to.
138002,530,188,827000,Patty Bouvier,Ben's Bedroom,"Marge, can I use your free Amazon shipping?"
138003,530,189,830000,Marge Simpson,Ben's Bedroom,Not a good time!
