87875,340,24,104000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Of course I can twist it, I'm great."
87879,340,28,112000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,This is my last baby tooth.
87880,340,29,114000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,That's the money tooth -- I heard the Tooth Fairy pays triple for it.
87881,340,30,119000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Then let's hurry up and rip it out of my head.
87883,340,31,126000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Skinner! Your bus driver just totaled my Camry!
87884,340,32,130000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Can I offer you the use of my Merkur?

87891,340,39,159000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I wouldn't say that.
87892,340,40,161000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Um-huh.
87893,340,41,163000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"God, please give your daughter the Tooth Fairy the strength to carry my cash, and the integrity not to dip her wand in the till."
87895,340,43,179000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,What the?!
87897,340,45,180000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"""The Tooth Fairy has made a donation in my name to the ­United Way""?! That gossamer witch."
87898,340,46,185000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe when the Tooth Fairy saw it was your last baby tooth, she realized you're not a little boy anymore. So she gave you a grown-up gift."
87899,340,47,194000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm not gonna grow up!
87900,340,48,195000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh yes you are. Why, in the right light, you're starting to get your own muzzle."
87901,340,49,200000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought it was chocolate milk!
87902,340,50,201000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, that's how it starts."
87903,340,51,203000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Nooo!
87905,340,53,206000,Bart Simpson,Try-N-Save,"I'm still a kid. And what do kids love? Kid stuff, like this."
87906,340,54,212000,Bart Simpson,Try-N-Save,"Vroom vroom. Vroom vroom... Vroom, vroom."
87907,340,55,220000,Jimbo Jones,Try-N-Save,"What'cha realizing, jerk?"
87908,340,56,222000,Bart Simpson,Try-N-Save,That I'm not a kid anymore.
87910,340,58,224000,Jimbo Jones,Try-N-Save,That's harsh.
87911,340,59,225000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Try-N-Save,"I knew I was an adult the day the judge said ""we're trying you as an adult."""
87913,340,61,225000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, there's one thing no one can take away: my childlike imagination."
87914,340,62,234000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sergeant Activity, your mission is to scale the icy walls of Mount Bloodkill!"
87916,340,63,242000,Sgt. Activity,Simpson Home,Must... defeat... Doctor Blizzard... and the Avalanche-oids.
87917,340,64,250000,Sgt. Activity,Simpson Home,"Lieutenant Adventure, what are you doing here?"
87918,340,65,253000,Lt. Adventure,Simpson Home,"You're quite the daredevil, Sergeant Activity. It's high time you protected yourself with supplemental disability insurance."
87919,340,66,260000,Sgt. Activity,Simpson Home,"At my age, can I qualify?"
87920,340,67,263000,Lt. Adventure,Simpson Home,"You'd be surprised -- if you're a nonsmoker, it can cost just a few dollars a month."
87921,340,68,268000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What's happening to me? Maybe I'm not a kid anymore.
87923,340,70,273000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Goodbye, Spirogram. Goodbye, Sketch 'n' Etch. Goodbye Ravenous Ravenous Rhinos, Duopoly, Parchoosey, Humor Putty and Sock 'em Knock 'em Cyborgs. Goodbye, childhood."

87930,340,77,322000,Bart Simpson,Lake Springfield,I really don't want to talk about it.
87931,340,78,323000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Lake Springfield,"If you change your mind, I won't be farrr."
87932,340,79,327000,Bart Simpson,Lake Springfield,"Thanks, but--"
87933,340,80,328000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Lake Springfield,"I've been told I'm a good listener. But when you're a captain, you never know when people are just flatterin' ya. Yarr."
87934,340,81,336000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Lake Springfield,He's gone. Darn it! I just want a friend who isn't a work friend.
87936,340,83,346000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, if you don't get up now, good luck getting a pancake. Dad's pulled his chair right up to the stove."
87937,340,84,351000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lis, I think I'm having a midlife crisis."
87938,340,85,354000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you're feeling depressed, do what I do and write something. A novel, a play..."
87939,340,86,359000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Or, I could write something that's not gay."
87940,340,87,363000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, someone wrote something cynical on your shirt!"

87943,340,90,368000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Leave me alone -- this expresses my rage at the machine.
87945,340,91,372000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I like T-shirts with a nice joke, like ""support our troops."""
87946,340,92,375000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart's shirt is a classic, Marge. Just like ""Keep On Truckin'"". As if I would ever want to stop truckin'."
87948,340,94,386000,Otto Mann,School Bus,Whoa.
87949,340,95,390000,Database,School Bus,"I wish I had that shirt. It's clever, funny and would cover my boy boobs nicely."
87952,340,98,408000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, I need that shirt. I'll trade you Puppy Goo Goo for it."
87953,340,99,412000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,She still has a lot of her original strawberry scent.
87954,340,100,416000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Forget it. My attitude isn't for sale! What am I saying? Of course it is!
87956,340,102,422000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"T-shirts! Get your sassy T-shirts! Fifty percent cotton, one hundred percent awesome!"

87959,340,105,438000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,This could get me out of a lot of sticky situations. I'll take a dozen.
87960,340,106,444000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Do you have a T-shirt with Calvin peeing on Hobbes?

87965,340,111,460000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Chief. I can't afford to pay protection to you and Nelson."
87966,340,112,464000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Um-hmmm.
87967,340,113,465000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Well then you're out of business. Let's go, boys -- confiscate his merchandise."
87968,340,114,471000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Are any of those my size? Extra extra extra extra extra extra extra large.

87972,340,118,488000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you go legit and sell your shirts in stores?
87973,340,119,492000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But I'm just a kid.
87975,340,120,494000,Sgt. Activity,Simpson Home,"You're a kid no longer, Bart. You've become a man."
87976,340,121,497000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, you're right, I am."
87977,340,122,500000,Lt. Adventure,Simpson Home,"And as an adult, you'll be needing comprehensive insurance."

88016,340,161,683000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Look at all that cash.

88047,340,194,799000,Homer Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Hey, just 'cause I'm not working doesn't mean I can't gripe like you guys. Don't you hate it when people steal your lunch out of the break-room fridge?"
