132953,512,48,206000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Nah, you don't have to bet the money. The poker website just keeps it nice and safe, where the FDIC can't get its grubby little hands on it!"
132954,512,49,213000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"A poker site is now safer than an American bank. Has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?"
132955,512,50,223000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't you badmouth this country. Compared to the rest of the third world, we're doin' great!"

132961,512,56,245000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,On a poker site!
132962,512,57,246000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,More importantly it's a college fund...
132963,512,58,248000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,On a poker site!
132964,512,59,249000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, please!"

132967,512,62,256000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've had it for a long time. I was just about to throw it out, and then this happened."
132968,512,63,266000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's one way to avoid drunk driving.
132969,512,64,268000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Another way is don't drink.

132974,512,69,287000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What the?! Stupid calendar. First you put the Fourth of July on Sunday, and now this! Ooh, we're gonna discuss this later!"
132976,512,71,298000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"Okay, remember the plan. Apologize to Grampa. Then when he wants us to take him out to lunch, point to the leftovers, tell him we already did, but he forgot."
132977,512,72,306000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Streets,I still feel guilty. Your father's not going to be around forever.
132978,512,73,310000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"Marge, you take that back!"
132979,512,74,312000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Streets,"Fine, he'll be around forever."
132980,512,75,314000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,You take that back!

132984,512,81,329000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Missing?! What kind of a prison are you people running here?
132985,512,82,332000,Male Orderly,Springfield Retirement Castle,"If it's any consolation, we'll probably find him when the river thaws in the spring. A lot of bobbers then."
132988,512,85,345000,Marge Simpson,RETIREMENT CASTLE - ABE'S ROOM,"There's gotta be a clue in here somewhere. Spats, sock garters, the world's hardest hard candy..."
132989,512,86,355000,Homer Simpson,RETIREMENT CASTLE - ABE'S ROOM,"Oh, it's hopeless! This room is like a museum of meaningless old crap. By which I mean every museum."
132990,512,87,362000,Marge Simpson,RETIREMENT CASTLE - ABE'S ROOM,Grampa's army footlocker! I bet the most important things in the world to him are in this box!
132991,512,88,367000,Homer Simpson,RETIREMENT CASTLE - ABE'S ROOM,So precious...
132992,512,89,374000,Homer Simpson,RETIREMENT CASTLE - ABE'S ROOM,"Look at that, a man's whole life being kicked around on the floor."

132999,512,96,399000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm only down sixty-two dollars. Not counting my tips to the waitresses.

133001,512,98,410000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fine, fine."
133002,512,99,413000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"New low, even for this family... college fund on a poker site... I'm just gonna log right out."

133010,512,107,459000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah! Fifty dollars up! Time to play with house money!
133011,512,108,465000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Or, time to walk away from the table."
133012,512,109,465000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Shoo!

133019,512,116,500000,Bikers,Spiro's,What'd he say about a cop?
133020,512,117,501000,Homer Simpson,Spiro's,"Or a spy from a rival gang! Hey, what are you doin'?"
133021,512,118,509000,Bartender,Spiro's,Abe Simpson -- used to work here. Put him down!
133022,512,119,517000,Bartender,Spiro's,Welcome to Spiro's! I am Spiro. Not the Spiro on the sign -- that's my brother.
133023,512,120,522000,Homer Simpson,Spiro's,Did you say my dad worked here?
133024,512,121,524000,Spiro,Spiro's,"Yes. In the old days. When people ate steak, drank champagne, and the music... oh, the music! I hated the music!"
133025,512,122,549000,YOUNG SPIRO,Spiro's,"Simpson! I pay you to clean tables, not to write songs. And you, Marvin Hamlisch, I pay you to write songs, not to clean tables!"

148190,512,129,586000,Young Grampa,Spiro's,Rita Lafleur singing one of my tunes?! Can a thirty-five-year-old busboy's life get any better?

133054,512,152,675000,Jennifer Tilly,Apartment,"Start with your Simpsons money, use a little girl voice, and take 'em for everything they've got."
133055,512,153,680000,Jennifer Tilly,Apartment,"Now, I'm needed on the set of ""Bride of Chucky Five."""

133064,512,162,727000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street - Day,I can't believe my Dad never told me he had another wife. The man I looked up to my whole life.
133065,512,163,733000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street - Day,You never looked up to him.
133066,512,164,735000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street - Day,"Well, it's a good thing I didn't because I'd be pretty devastated right now."

133070,512,169,757000,Homer Simpson,Old Apartment Complex,Well just what attracted you to my father?
133071,512,170,760000,RITA,Old Apartment Complex,Beneath his mediocrity there was genius. Then a layer of anger. Then a beautiful soul. Then some more anger. A lot of layers.
133074,512,173,782000,RITA,JUKE JOINT,"After we were fired from Spiro's, we teamed up... for more than music."
133075,512,174,787000,YOUNG RITA,JUKE JOINT,"Oh, Abe! Yeah."

133079,512,178,801000,RITA,JUKE JOINT,"Alive, but very clueless."
133080,512,179,803000,Marge Simpson,JUKE JOINT,"So, this was after Homer's mother left?"
133081,512,180,807000,RITA,JUKE JOINT,I love men on the rebound. They always think they've done something wrong and they usually come with furniture.
133082,512,181,814000,Homer Simpson,JUKE JOINT,My Dad had furniture?! I don't know him at all!
133085,512,184,824000,RITA,Springfield Town Hall,We got married in the city hall across from the prettiest church you've ever seen. Then tragedy struck.

148192,512,193,878000,Young Grampa,Hospital Room,"Y'know... Europe's no place for a six-year-old. He can handle a hundred-and-ten volt, but two-twenty would kill him."
133093,512,194,886000,YOUNG RITA,Hospital Room,"But making music is my dream, Abe... our dream."
148193,512,195,891000,Young Grampa,Hospital Room,"I know, Sugar Tomato, but I'm all the family this boy's got. If I don't take care of him now, he'll forget the day he's supposed to come and see me when I'm old."
133095,512,197,907000,Little Homer,Springfield Airport,"You okay, Daddy?"
148195,512,198,909000,Young Grampa,Springfield Airport,"Well of course I'm okay, I'm with you! Goodbye, Rita. This is why ""life"" comes before ""love"" in the dictionary."

133098,512,201,932000,Homer Simpson,Rita's Apartment,"Oh my God. I never knew the sacrifices my father made. Move over, Fonzie. I've got a new hero."

133100,512,203,943000,Marge Simpson,Rita's Apartment,But I thought you still loved him.
133101,512,204,945000,RITA,Rita's Apartment,Life isn't all major chords... sometimes you gotta hit the minor keys.
133102,512,205,951000,Marge Simpson,Rita's Apartment,What does that mean?
133103,512,206,952000,RITA,Rita's Apartment,I got super-addicted to heroin. Yeah.
133105,512,208,960000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, education paid for. With a gap year, to find myself. Every nerve in my body is screaming ""cash out now,"" and yet... I've got a pair of aces!"
133106,512,209,971000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Full house! Aces over threes! Take that, rich-texan-oh-oh-one, and sideshow-bob-at-springfield- penitentiary. Ha! I'm going all in!"
133107,512,210,985000,The Rich Texan,Simpson Home,"Doggone it, I give up. It's like Kenny Rogers' most famous line: ""This is a bad piece of chicken."""
133108,512,211,989000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What? He didn't fold? But that's insane unless he has...

133112,512,215,1035000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, c'mon, Lis. No gambling story has a happy ending, except Seabiscuit. But you never hear about the ruined lives of the people who bet against him."

133120,512,223,1075000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen... after I won, the website found out we were both under eighteen, so we're back to the original five thousand."
133096,512,224,1081000,Dealer Avatar,Simpson Home,Shame! Shame!
133121,512,225,1083000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Did you give the money back to the people who lost it?

133132,512,236,1116000,RITA,Rita's Apartment,And tell him to put on a splash of this.
133133,512,237,1121000,Homer Simpson,Rita's Apartment,That's Dad's cologne? I always thought it was his old-man stink.
133134,512,238,1125000,RITA,Rita's Apartment,"When I knew him, it was young-man musk."
133135,512,239,1129000,Homer Simpson,Rita's Apartment,"Man, you're making me hot for my Dad."
133138,512,242,1133000,Elderly Owner,Store,"Only place in town that still sells Chicory Mist. After people found out it's ninety-eight percent squirrel sweat, they sorta stopped buying."

133147,512,251,1166000,Grampa Simpson,Store,"You think I'm boring, and you never visit me, and I got sick of waitin' for ya! So I got a job and found a new dump to live in and I didn't tell you about it, so at least that way I know you're not coming!"
133148,512,252,1178000,Marge Simpson,Store,"Grampa, we will never miss a visit again. And there'll be a lot more of them."
133149,512,253,1184000,Homer Simpson,Store,"And I don't think you're boring. It's just that in today's multi-channel environment, you have too many great choices. Look at Sunday night. There's like eight amazing shows. None of them on Fox."
133150,512,254,1196000,Grampa Simpson,Store,"Well... when you put it that way... all right. I can't say all is forgiven, but most is forgotten."
