4184,46,60,305000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Are you sure? Cuz once I open the bottle there's no refund.
4217,46,61,310000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that's my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy."

4219,46,63,327000,Hans,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, thank you. My English is not perfect, but I have to tell you your beer is like swill to us. Do I have that right? I am saying that only a swine would drink this beer."

4224,46,68,349000,Hans,Moe's Tavern,We are interested in buying the power plant. Do you think the owner would ever sell it?
4225,46,69,353000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars."
4226,46,70,357000,Fritz,Moe's Tavern,A hundred million?
4227,46,71,361000,Hans,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, don't worry! We'll still have enough left to buy the Cleveland Browns."

4255,46,100,467000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You'll see the Statue of Liberty wearing lederhosen before you see Germans running my plant!
4256,46,101,471000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well then, sir, why are you meeting with them?"
4257,46,102,474000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,So I can look Uncle Fritz square in the monocle and say nein.

4268,46,113,542000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Those lousy Germans can't fire me. I'm the only one who knows how to unjam the rod bottom dissociator.

4274,46,118,555000,Horst,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Guten morgen, I am Horst. The new owners have elected me to speak with you because I am the most nonthreatening. Perhaps I remind you of the lovable Sergeant Schultz on Hogan's Heroes."

4322,46,167,752000,Horst,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I must have phrased that badly. My English is, how you say... inelegant. I meant to say, may we have a brief, friendly chat?"
4323,46,168,758000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No!
4324,46,169,759000,Horst,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Once again, I have failed."

4329,46,174,774000,Horst,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I see. Then you must have some good ideas for the future as well.
4330,46,175,779000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I sure do!
4331,46,176,785000,Fritz,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Such as...
4332,46,177,787000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, ah, I wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy."
4334,46,178,798000,Horst,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"We understand Homer. After all, we are from the land of chocolate."
4335,46,179,802000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Mmm. The land of chocolate...

4346,46,190,860000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, you know those Germans aren't so bad."
4347,46,191,862000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sure, they've made mistakes in the past, but that's why pencils have erasers."
4348,46,192,866000,Horst,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Attention workers. We have completed our evaluation of the plant.
4349,46,193,870000,Horst,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"We regret to announce the following lay-offs, which I will read in alphabetical order. Simpson, Homer. That is all."
4351,46,195,896000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Aye carumba!
4352,46,196,897000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, Bart, Lisa did a wonderful job on my hair and we saved forty dollars for the family. We all have to pull together 'til your father gets a new job."
4353,46,197,907000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I made a new bar of soap by squeezing all our little soap slivers together.
4354,46,198,911000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's very clever.
4355,46,199,912000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"And today, instead of buying comic books, I just read 'em and left 'em in the store."
4356,46,200,916000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmmm, you shouldn't do that."
4357,46,201,917000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"My jump rope broke, but I just tied it back together."
4358,46,202,920000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's good, Lisa."
4359,46,203,921000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't take a bath today and I may not take one tomorrow.
4360,46,204,924000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I want you to take baths, Bart."
4361,46,205,926000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh what's the matter with this thing."
4362,46,206,934000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No problems here.
4363,46,207,936000,Jasper Beardly,Simpson Home,"That's right, Burnsie... keep your wrist supple... throw it, don't aim it..."

4365,46,210,953000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,"This place has really gone to hell, Mr. Burns. It's obscene what they did to your office."

4411,46,256,1131000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.
4412,46,257,1135000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?
4413,46,258,1139000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,Yes.
4414,46,259,1140000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?"

4416,46,261,1148000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"And does it ever say, ""I love you?"""

4418,46,263,1152000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!"
4419,46,264,1157000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Nobody loves you...
4420,46,265,1159000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,"Good heavens, Smithers! They're not afraid of me anymore!"
4421,46,266,1162000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey Mr. Burns, did you get that letter I sent?"
4422,46,267,1165000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,Letter? I don't recall any letter...
4423,46,268,1165000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,That's because I forgot to stamp it.
4424,46,269,1171000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, that kid slays me."
4425,46,270,1174000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,That was no accident. Let's get out of here.
4426,46,271,1177000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Na na na na / Na na na na /
4427,46,272,1180000,Barflies,Moe's Tavern,Hey hey hey / Goodbye -- Na na na na / na na na na / hey hey hey / goodbye...
4428,46,273,1183000,C. Montgomery Burns,Moe's Tavern,What good is money if you can't inspire terror in your fellow man? I've got to get my plant back!
4430,46,275,1199000,Hans,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Gott in himmel! Who'd have thought a nuclear plant could be such a deathtrap.
4431,46,276,1205000,Fritz,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It will cost us another hundred million just to bring it up to code.
4432,46,277,1211000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Please sell me my plant back! I'll pay anything.
4433,46,278,1214000,Horst,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Isn't this a happy coincidence? You are desperate to buy, and we are desperate to sell."
4434,46,279,1220000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Desperate, eh? Advantage, Burns."
4435,46,280,1225000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"This is my offer. I think you'll find it's most unfair, but those are the breaks."
4436,46,281,1229000,Hans,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"But Mr. Burns, this is half of what we paid you."
4437,46,282,1234000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"That's my final offer, take it or leave it."
4438,46,283,1236000,Horst,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"All right, Mr. Burns. You win. But beware. We Germans aren't all smiles and sunshine."
4439,46,284,1243000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ooh, the Germans are mad at me. I'm so scared. Ooh, the Germans."
4440,46,285,1249000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh-oh, the Germans are comin' to get me. Oh, don't let the Germans come after me... Oh no, the Germans are coming after me. Oh, no, they're so big and strong..."

4442,46,287,1266000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You too. This is a place of business, not a Peewee flop house!"
4443,46,288,1272000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Your orders, sir?"
4444,46,289,1273000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Restore my office. Cancel all repairs. And rehire that chap who sassed me in the bar.
4445,46,290,1278000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Homer Simpson, but why?"
4446,46,291,1280000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Smithers. I keep my friends close and my enemies even closer. He'll slowly regain his confidence as the months and years drift by, blissfully unaware that the sword of Damocles is dangling just above his head."
4447,46,292,1294000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,And then one day... when he least expects it --
4449,46,294,1299000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo-hoo! I got my job back!
