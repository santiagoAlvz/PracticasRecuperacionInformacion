35733,161,2,46000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmm, pressure dropping, humidity rising over eighty percent, increasing wind..."
35734,161,3,54000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here we are, Chapter Two: ""So Your Pressure Is Dropping."" --"
35735,161,4,54000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, wake up!"
35736,161,5,64000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,... Is it... Wah?
35737,161,6,66000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I think a hurricane is coming!
35738,161,7,68000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Lisa, there's no record of a hurricane ever hitting Springfield."
35739,161,8,73000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, but the records only go back to 1978, when the Hall of Records was mysteriously blown away!"
35741,161,10,82000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What is it, boy? Fire? Earthquake? Hippies?"
35742,161,11,86000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hurricane! Somehow the animals are always the first to know.
35743,161,12,90000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,... and the Weather Service has warned us to brace ourselves for the onslaught of Hurricane Barbara.
35744,161,13,90000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"And if you think naming a destructive storm after a woman is sexist, you obviously have never seen the gals grabbing for items at a clearance sale."
35745,161,14,104000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's true, but he shouldn't say it."
35746,161,15,107000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We better pick up some supplies.
35749,161,18,111000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Stand behind the flaming garbage cans! We'll be letting you into the store seventy people at a time.
35660,161,19,118000,Kirk Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, let's just beat him up and take his stuff!"
35751,161,20,120000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"No, no, no! Do not listen to that man. Remain calm. You will all have a chance to be gouged."
35753,161,22,144000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, there's so little left: Creamed Eels? Corn Nog? Wadded beef?"
35754,161,23,151000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Mo-om, let's just grab what we can and get out of here. This storm is making people crazy."
35755,161,24,158000,Mrs. Glick,Kwik-E-Mart,"The last pineapple. And plenty ripe, too."
35756,161,25,161000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,But I'm not fruit! I'm a kid!
35757,161,26,164000,Mrs. Glick,Kwik-E-Mart,That's what the pumpkin said.
35758,161,27,166000,Ralph Wiggum,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hi, Lisa. We're going to be in a pie!"
35761,161,30,171000,National Guardsman,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Sir, for your own safety, we do advise you to evacuate."
35762,161,31,174000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,I ain't leavin'! I was born in this nursing home and I'll die in this nursing home!
35763,161,32,180000,National Guardsman,Springfield Retirement Castle,Is there any chance of you changing your mind?
35764,161,33,182000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Sure. Let's go.
35767,161,36,193000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, need some help there? You know, maybe you folks should come over and hunker in our bunker."
35768,161,37,198000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oh, it'll be fun. We're gonna go through our old cancelled checks and receipts and give ourselves an audit. Make sure we don't owe anything extra."
35769,161,38,205000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm sure I'd be a third wheel."
35770,161,39,208000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"No, sirree, we'd be happy as hens to ha--"
35771,161,40,210000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I would make it my business to be a third wheel.
35772,161,41,214000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Okilly-dokilly. Oo, I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage."
35773,161,42,227000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, it's the standard Grampa drill. Everybody into the cellar!"
35775,161,44,249000,Main Title Singers,Springfield,The Hurri-cane...
35777,161,46,249000,Convict,Springfield Prison,"Awesome! So long, suckers!"
35778,161,47,252000,Prison Officials,Springfield Prison,Awww.
35779,161,48,255000,Prison Officials,Springfield Prison,Yay!
35781,161,50,262000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?
35695,161,51,267000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, a Rubik's Cube. Let's all work it together."
35750,161,52,271000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, start with diagonal colors."
35782,161,53,274000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on the orange side and turn it.
35783,161,54,278000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My main finger?
35784,161,55,279000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You've got to start backwards! / Orange to orange! Ignore the reds! / Alternate corners! /
35785,161,56,285000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,One at a time.
35786,161,57,287000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Spin the middle side topwise. Topwise.
35787,161,58,290000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Now I remember why I put
35788,161,59,290000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,this down here in the first place!
35791,161,62,307000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's dying down!
35792,161,63,309000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All clear, everyone."
35793,161,64,310000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, no! This may just be the eye of the hurricane."
35794,161,65,314000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Relax. Can't you see how eerily calm it is?
35795,161,66,318000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,See? I told you it was over.
35796,161,67,321000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmm. I don't remember a bowling alley being th--
35797,161,68,336000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dear God, this is Marge Simpson. If you stop this hurricane and save our family, we will be forever grateful and recommend you to all our friends. So if you could find it in your infinite wisdom to..."
35798,161,69,350000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait. Listen, everybody!"
35799,161,70,355000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The hurricane's over.
35800,161,71,356000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"He fell for it! Way to go, Marge!"
35801,161,72,361000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Remarkable -- there doesn't seem to be any damage at all. It just goes to show you that everything will work out if you have faith.
35802,161,73,374000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,It's all gone. Everything... gone-diddily-on.
35804,161,75,385000,Ned Flanders,FLANDERS' FORMER HOUSE,Maude? Rod? Todd?
35805,161,76,389000,Todd Flanders,FLANDERS' FORMER HOUSE,"I'm right here, Daddy."
35806,161,77,391000,Maude Flanders,FLANDERS' FORMER HOUSE,"Oh, Neddy, it was terrifying. I thought I was headed for the eternal bliss of paradise."
35807,161,78,396000,Todd Flanders,FLANDERS' FORMER HOUSE,Oh my gosh. Look at Rod!
35808,161,79,399000,Rod Flanders,FLANDERS' FORMER HOUSE,I have a headache.
35809,161,80,404000,Ned Flanders,FLANDERS' FORMER HOUSE,"Well, sir, everyone's alive. Guess that's something to be thankful for."
35810,161,81,407000,Homer Simpson,FLANDERS' FORMER HOUSE,Now that kinda attitude's not gonna get your house back.
35811,161,82,411000,Marge Simpson,FLANDERS' FORMER HOUSE,I'm sure your insurance will cover the house.
35813,161,83,413000,Maude Flanders,FLANDERS' FORMER HOUSE,"Uh, well, no. Neddy doesn't believe in insurance -- he considers it a form of gambling."
35814,161,84,419000,Ned Flanders,FLANDERS' FORMER HOUSE,"Y'know, it's kinda funny. The only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. They're all we have left."
35815,161,85,425000,Homer Simpson,FLANDERS' FORMER HOUSE,"Well, call us if you need anything."
35818,161,88,433000,Todd Flanders,First Church of Springfield,We got new clothes from the donation bin! I'm a surfer.
35819,161,89,437000,Rod Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Look, Daddy. Todd is stupid and I'm with him. And now Mommy's stupid."
35820,161,90,443000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Lookin' good, Rod. Lookin' good."
35821,161,91,448000,Maude Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Neddy, I know this has been a terrible day. But, by golly, first thing tomorrow we're going to open up the Leftorium and before ya know it, we'll be back on our feet."
35822,161,92,460000,Kent Brockman,First Church of Springfield,"...Down here at Springfield Mall a storm-addled crowd appears to have turned its rage on ""The Leftorium."""
35823,161,93,468000,Kent Brockman,First Church of Springfield,"Surprisingly, people are grabbing things with both hands, suggesting it's not just southpaws in this rampaging mob."
35825,161,95,475000,Kent Brockman,First Church of Springfield,"Try looking in the back. Meantime, Springfield bowlers will be happy to hear that the Bowl-A-Rama is back in business at its new location teetering over the Carter-Dixon Tunnel."
35826,161,96,488000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Reverend Lovejoy, with all that's happened to us today -- Uh, I... I kinda feel like Job."
35827,161,97,495000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Well... Aren't you being a tad melodramatic, Ned? Also, I believe Job was right-handed."
35828,161,98,503000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"But Reverend, I need to know. Is God punishing me?"
35829,161,99,506000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Ooh. Short answer, ""yes"" with an ""if""; long answer, ""no"" with a ""but."" Uh, if you need additional solace, by the way, I've got a copy of something or other by Art Linkletter in my office."
35830,161,100,531000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Even in my darkest hour, I can turn to the Good Book for..."
35831,161,101,535000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,Son of a gun-diddily-un! Those gilded edges smart!
35834,161,102,542000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Why me, Lord? Where have I gone wrong? I've always been nice to people. I don't drink or dance or swear. I've even kept kosher, just to be on the safe side. I've done everything the Bible says, even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff. What more could I do? I... I feel like I'm coming apart here. I want to yell out, but I... I... I just can't dang-diddily-do-dang-do-don-diddily-darn-do it. I... I...I..."
35835,161,103,572000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Ned! Maude! You've got to go back to your house. Something incredible has happened!
35836,161,104,577000,Ned Flanders,First Church of Springfield,"Aw, what happened now? Did the rubble burn down?"
35837,161,105,579000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,No! Come on!
35840,161,108,589000,Maude Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh, they rebuilt our house!"
35841,161,109,591000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,It's a miracle!
35842,161,110,594000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Home,"I started making some calls last night, and before I knew it, practically all of Springfield was offering to help."
35843,161,111,604000,Citizens,Flanders Home,Glad to do it. / Sure. / Happy to help out. / Etc.
35844,161,112,604000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,"Hope you like it, neighbor. We didn't have the best tools or all the know-how, but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love."
35845,161,113,612000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Flanders Home,And a cement mixer full of hope and some cement.
35846,161,114,615000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"It's wonderful. I... I... I don't know how I can possibly repay you, but if any of you ever need a favor, just look for the happiest man in Springfield."
35847,161,115,626000,Happy Man,Flanders Home,"No, no, not me, friends -- he's talking about himself! But thanks for looking!"
35849,161,117,639000,Homer Simpson,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,The living and dining rooms... with a lovely flow for entertaining...
35850,161,118,643000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Uh-huh. Ooh, looks like a loose nail."
35851,161,119,647000,Homer Simpson,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Eh, one out of twenty-five ain't bad."
35852,161,120,650000,Homer Simpson,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Your beautiful kitchen, Ned. Just as you remember it."
35853,161,121,656000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Was that... uh, was that toilet always next to the refrigerator?"
35854,161,122,660000,Chief Wiggum,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Uh, Ned, you ever tried lugging a toilet up a flight of stairs?"
35855,161,123,664000,Bart Simpson,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,Lisa and I built your room.
35856,161,124,666000,Rod Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,But I don't like this clown!
35857,161,125,668000,Bart Simpson,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Uh, I wouldn't take it down if I were you. It's a load-bearing poster."
35832,161,126,678000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Now, this is the room with electricity, but it has too much electricity. So I don't know, you might want to wear a hat."
35833,161,127,685000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,Uh-huh. Floor feels a little gritty here.
35858,161,128,689000,Moe Szyslak,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Yeah, we ran out of floorboards there, so we painted the dirt. Pretty clever."
35859,161,129,696000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Oh, something is definitely wrong with this hallway!"
35860,161,130,700000,Barney Gumble,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,Come on in. It's your master bedroom.
35861,161,131,704000,Barney Gumble,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Ow, my nose!"
35862,161,132,705000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Well, I've seen about enough."
35863,161,133,707000,Homer Simpson,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"So, Flanders, what do you think of the house that love built?"
35864,161,134,716000,Homer Simpson,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Aw, shoot."
35866,161,136,727000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Oh, now, calm down Neddilly-diddily-diddily-diddily-diddily... They did their best... Shoddily-iddily-iddily-diddily... Gotta be nice... hostility-ilitity-bility-dility -- Aw, hell, diddly-ding-dong-crap! Can't you morons do anything right?!!"
35868,161,138,744000,Marge Simpson,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Ned, we meant well, and everyone here tried their best --"
35869,161,139,748000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Well, my family and I can't live in good intentions, Marge! Oh, your family is out of control, but we can't blame you, because you have goooood intentions."
35870,161,140,758000,Bart Simpson,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Hey, back off, man."
35871,161,141,759000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Oh, okay ""Dude."" I wouldn't want you to have a cow, ""Man."" Here's a catch-phrase you better learn for your adult years: ""Hey, buddy, got a quarter?"""
35873,161,143,771000,Bart Simpson,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,I am shocked and appalled.
35874,161,144,773000,Lisa Simpson,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Mr. Flanders, with all due respect, Bart didn't do anything."
35875,161,145,777000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,Do I hear the sound of butting in? It's gotta be little Lisa Simpson -- Springfield's answer to a question no one asked!
35877,161,147,784000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"What do we have here? The long, flabby arm of the law. The last case you got to the bottom of was a case of Mallomars."
35878,161,148,791000,Krusty the Clown,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Mallomars. Oh, that's going in the act."
35879,161,149,794000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Oh yeah, the clown. The only one of you buffoons who doesn't make me laugh. And as for you -- I don't know you, but I'm sure you're a jerk."
35880,161,150,802000,Lenny Leonard,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Hey, I've only been here a few minutes. What's going on?"
35881,161,151,805000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"You ugly, hate-filled man."
35883,161,152,807000,Moe Szyslak,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Hey, hey, I may be ugly and hate-filled, but I, uh... what was the third thing you said?"
35884,161,153,815000,Ned Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Homer, you are the worst human being I have ever met."
35885,161,154,822000,Homer Simpson,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Hey, I got off pretty easy."
35886,161,155,826000,Maude Flanders,NEW FLANDERS HOUSE,"Neddy! Uh, wait! Well, where you going?"
35890,161,159,860000,Ned Flanders,Calmwood Mental Hospital,I attacked all my friends and neighbors just for trying to help me. I'd like to commit myself.
35891,161,160,865000,Receptionist,Calmwood Mental Hospital,"Very well. Shall I show you to your room, or would you prefer to be dragged off, kicking and screaming?"
35892,161,161,870000,Ned Flanders,Calmwood Mental Hospital,"Ooh, kicking and screaming, please."
35893,161,162,873000,Receptionist,Calmwood Mental Hospital,As you wish.
35894,161,163,886000,Ned Flanders,Calmwood Mental Hospital,Noooooooooooo!
35896,161,165,886000,Older Nurse,INSANE ASYLUM,"""Flanders?"" Ned Flanders?"
35897,161,166,892000,Older Nurse,INSANE ASYLUM,I'd better call Dr. Foster.
35899,161,168,895000,Dr. Foster,DOCTOR FOSTER'S HOUSE,"Yes, Doctor Foster here. Ned Flanders? You're sure? No, no, no, I'll... I'll come right over. And may God have mercy on us all."
35900,161,169,907000,Dr. Foster,DOCTOR FOSTER'S HOUSE,"Darling, there's an emergency at the hospital. Er, where are my shoes?"
35901,161,170,910000,Wife,DOCTOR FOSTER'S HOUSE,"Oh, I think they're in the den."
35902,161,171,912000,Dr. Foster,DOCTOR FOSTER'S HOUSE,In the den? May God have mercy on us all.
35905,161,174,919000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"Well, how are you feeling this evening?"
35906,161,175,921000,Ned Flanders,INSANE ASYLUM,"Uh, actually, I'm a little chilly. Could I have another straitjacket?"
35907,161,176,925000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,Of course.
35908,161,177,927000,Ned Flanders,INSANE ASYLUM,Thank you. Doctor Foster?
35909,161,178,930000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"Hmm, at least your memory's not crazy."
35910,161,179,934000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"Now, Ned, you may remember we spent some time together thirty years ago. Do you recall what you were like back then?"
35911,161,180,941000,Ned Flanders,INSANE ASYLUM,"Oh, sure. I was a good little boy."
35912,161,181,943000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,Were you?
35913,161,182,952000,Young Ned,INSANE ASYLUM,"Whee, I'm Dick Tracy! Bam! Take that, Prune Face! Now, I'm Prune Face! Take that, Dick Tracy! Now, I'm Prune Tracy! Take that, Dick Fay!"
35882,161,183,961000,Young Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,Ned! Stop it at once! Stop it! --
35914,161,184,965000,Ned Flanders,INSANE ASYLUM,I can't believe I was such a terror.
35915,161,185,968000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"Well, neither could your parents. That's why they brought you to me."
35916,161,186,973000,Young Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"Well, I'm afraid young Ned is unusually aggressive, but I can't seem to find a cause for it. Hey, hey, get down from that bookshelf, please! Most of those books haven't been discredited yet. Would you please tell your son to stop."
35917,161,187,986000,"Nedward Flanders, Sr.",INSANE ASYLUM,"We can't do it, man. That's discipline. That's like tellin' Gene Krupa not to go boom, boom, bap, bap, bap..."
35918,161,188,997000,Young Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"Hmm, lack of discipline. I'm beginning to see the problem."
35919,161,189,1000000,"Nedward Flanders, Sr.",INSANE ASYLUM,"We don't believe in rules. Like, we gave them up when we started living like freaky beatniks."
35920,161,190,1007000,Young Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"You don't believe in rules, yet you want to control Ned's anger."
35921,161,191,1010000,Mona Flanders,INSANE ASYLUM,"Yeah. You've got to help us, doc. We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas."
35922,161,192,1016000,Young Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,Hmm. There is an experimental therapy that might help Ned contain his anger...
35923,161,193,1021000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,It was known as the University of Minnesota Spankological Protocol.
35924,161,194,1021000,Young Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"And that's just about eight months... now. Well, Ned, how do you feel?"
35925,161,195,1041000,Young Ned,INSANE ASYLUM,I feel... fine.
35926,161,196,1044000,Young Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,You don't feel angry?
35927,161,197,1047000,Young Ned,INSANE ASYLUM,Absa-tively not-a-reeno.
35928,161,198,1050000,Young Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,How do you feel about me?
35929,161,199,1052000,Young Ned,INSANE ASYLUM,Pretty darn-diddly-doodly good.
35930,161,200,1057000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"The only problem with the treatment was that it worked too well. You became unable to express any anger at all. From that point on, anytime you felt angry, you could only respond with a string of nonsensical jabbering."
35931,161,201,1070000,Ned Flanders,INSANE ASYLUM,"Well, I'll be darn-diddly-arned."
35932,161,202,1072000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"Now that's the stuff. You suppressed your rage for so long, it finally erupted as a massive public explosion."
35933,161,203,1080000,Ned Flanders,INSANE ASYLUM,It sure did-diddly-id.
35934,161,204,1081000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"All right, all right, just watch it there. I'm here to help, you know. Now, I'd like to try something -- is there any person who makes you particularly angry?"
35937,161,206,1093000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yello? Yes... Mental hospital? I don't know any ""Ned Flanders."""
35938,161,207,1100000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The man who lived next door until his house blew down.
35939,161,208,1103000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, him."
35942,161,211,1108000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"Mr. Simpson? Dr. Foster. Please come with me. You folks are free to roam the grounds. Uh, just remember -- one of our patients is a cannibal. Try to guess which one. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
35944,161,213,1125000,Jay Sherman,INSANE ASYLUM,It stinks! It stinks! It stinks!
35945,161,214,1131000,Orderly,INSANE ASYLUM,"Yes, Mr. Sherman, everything stinks."
35946,161,215,1136000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,We want to teach Ned to release his anger in healthy doses. We need someone so irritating that Ned simply will not be able to repress his rage.
35947,161,216,1146000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"Homer, can you be that annoying?"
35948,161,217,1149000,Homer Simpson,INSANE ASYLUM,I... What?
35949,161,218,1151000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,Get in the booth.
35951,161,220,1160000,Homer Simpson,FLANDERS' BOOTH,"""Ned Flanders, I mock your value system. You also appear foolish in the eyes of others."""
35952,161,221,1163000,Ned Flanders,FLANDERS' BOOTH,"Well, howdy, Homer!"
35953,161,222,1169000,Ned Flanders,FLANDERS' BOOTH,"Ooh, thanks for dropping by!"
35955,161,224,1171000,Dr. Foster,OBSERVATION ROOM,Mmm. He's not responding. Proceed to Level Two Antagonism.
35956,161,225,1177000,Homer Simpson,OBSERVATION ROOM,Past instances in which I professed to like you were fraudulent.
35957,161,226,1177000,Ned Flanders,OBSERVATION ROOM,"Oh, well, I'll just have to try harder! Oops, thanks for dropping by."
35958,161,227,1186000,Dr. Foster,OBSERVATION ROOM,"Ah, he's still repressing. Maximum hostility factor."
35959,161,228,1191000,Homer Simpson,OBSERVATION ROOM,"""I engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other."" Now that's psychiatry! Eh? Eh?"
35960,161,229,1198000,Ned Flanders,OBSERVATION ROOM,"Ho ho ho. Very funny, wise guy."
35961,161,230,1203000,Homer Simpson,OBSERVATION ROOM,"Aw, that's it. You just can't insult this guy. You call him a moron and he just sits there, grinning moronly."
35962,161,231,1208000,Ned Flanders,OBSERVATION ROOM,"Hi, neighbor!"
35963,161,232,1209000,Homer Simpson,OBSERVATION ROOM,"You know what your problem is, Flanders? You're afraid to be human."
35964,161,233,1213000,Ned Flanders,OBSERVATION ROOM,"Oh, now, why would I be afraid of that?"
35966,161,234,1215000,Homer Simpson,OBSERVATION ROOM,Because humans are obnoxious sometimes. Humans hate things.
35967,161,235,1219000,Ned Flanders,OBSERVATION ROOM,"Well, maybe a few of them do. Back East."
35968,161,236,1222000,Dr. Foster,OBSERVATION ROOM,I can't find what Homer's saying. Did you write that?
35969,161,237,1225000,Assistant,OBSERVATION ROOM,"Um, did you like it?"
35970,161,238,1227000,Homer Simpson,OBSERVATION ROOM,"C'mon, Flanders. There's got to be something you hate. What about mosquito bites?"
35971,161,239,1231000,Ned Flanders,OBSERVATION ROOM,"Mmm, mmm. 'Sure are fun to scratch. Mmm. Satisfying."
35972,161,240,1236000,Homer Simpson,OBSERVATION ROOM,"What about, uh, fluorescent lights?"
35973,161,241,1240000,Ned Flanders,OBSERVATION ROOM,"Oh, they hum like angels. You're never lonely if you've got a fluorescent light."
35974,161,242,1245000,Homer Simpson,OBSERVATION ROOM,See? You like everything.
35975,161,243,1247000,Ned Flanders,OBSERVATION ROOM,"No, that's not true. I... I... I don't like the service at the post office. Y'know, it's all rush, rush, get you in, get you out. Then, they've got those machines in the lobby. They're even faster. No help there. You might even say I hate the post office. That, and my parents. Lousy beatniks! Hey, that felt good!"
35976,161,244,1270000,Dr. Foster,OBSERVATION ROOM,He just said he hates his parents. Do you know what that means?
35977,161,245,1274000,Assistant,OBSERVATION ROOM,"Uh, what do you think?"
35978,161,246,1276000,Dr. Foster,OBSERVATION ROOM,It means he's cured!
35979,161,247,1277000,Assistant,OBSERVATION ROOM,That's what I said.
35982,161,250,1285000,Ned Flanders,INSANE ASYLUM,"Thanks, everyone. I'm all better now. No more storing up the anger 'til I explode. If any of you does something I don't like, you are gonna hear about it!"
35983,161,251,1298000,Dr. Foster,INSANE ASYLUM,"Yes, that's very healthy, Ned."
35984,161,252,1301000,Ned Flanders,INSANE ASYLUM,"And if you really tick me off, I'm gonna run you down with my car!"
35986,161,254,1311000,Homer Simpson,INSANE ASYLUM,"Ned, you so crazy."
