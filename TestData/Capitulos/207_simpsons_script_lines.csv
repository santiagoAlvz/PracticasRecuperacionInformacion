48716,207,230,1032000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Lord. I was hoping this day would never come."
48717,207,231,1036000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh? What are you talking about?
48718,207,232,1038000,Kang,Simpson Home,You mean you never told him?
48719,207,233,1042000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess I've been in denial. Homer... Kang is Maggie's father.
48720,207,234,1050000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You intergalactic hussy! How could you?! Was he better than me?
48721,207,235,1057000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It all happened about two years ago...
48725,207,237,1060000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"There I was, having a great time in the back yard, when without warning, I was abducted by aliens."
48726,207,238,1066000,Kang,Simpson Backyard,Warning! Warning! Prepare to be abducted!
48728,207,240,1078000,Kang,FLYING SAUCER,Congratulations. You have been selected for our cross-breeding program.
48729,207,241,1084000,Kodos,FLYING SAUCER,"To put you at ease, we have re-created the most common spawning locations of your species."
48730,207,242,1090000,Kodos,FLYING SAUCER,"You may choose either... the back seat of a Camaro, an airplane bathroom, a friend's wedding, or the alley behind a porno theater."
48731,207,243,1100000,Marge Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,"I absolutely refuse to go along with this. But since I have no choice, I'll take the alley."
48732,207,244,1110000,Kodos,FLYING SAUCER,Initiate fertilization procedure.
48733,207,245,1114000,Kang,FLYING SAUCER,"Oh, you look lovely this evening. Have you decreased in mass?"
48734,207,246,1119000,Marge Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,"I tried to resist, but they applied powerful mind confusion techniques."
48735,207,247,1125000,Kang,FLYING SAUCER,Look behind you!
48736,207,248,1126000,Kang,FLYING SAUCER,Insemination complete.
48737,207,249,1128000,Marge Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,Really? That seemed awfully quick.
48738,207,250,1130000,Kang,FLYING SAUCER,What are you implying?
48739,207,251,1131000,Marge Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,"Nothing, nothing."
48740,207,252,1132000,Kang,FLYING SAUCER,"Whoa. Wow, look at the time. I'd love to stay, but I have an early meeting tomorrow. You're a super girl, though. I'll call you some time."
48741,207,253,1144000,Marge Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,"Nine months later, I gave birth to Maggie."
48742,207,254,1147000,Kang,FLYING SAUCER,"And now she must return home to Rigel 7, where she will be guaranteed a lucrative civil service job for life."
48743,207,255,1155000,Homer Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,"Well, we can't compete with that, but--"
48744,207,256,1157000,Kodos,FLYING SAUCER,But nothing. Get your slimeless hands off her.
48745,207,257,1161000,Bart Simpson,FLYING SAUCER,"People, people. Space monsters. This is going nowhere. There's only one man who can settle an argument this bizarre."
48747,207,259,1167000,Audience,TV Studio,Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
48748,207,260,1172000,Jerry Springer,TV Studio,"Okay, we're back."
48749,207,261,1174000,Jerry Springer,TV Studio,"Homer, how did it feel to learn your baby was fathered by a drooling space octopus?"
48750,207,262,1179000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,"It made me angry, Jerry. Angry and tired."
48751,207,263,1182000,Jerry Springer,TV Studio,"Well, you're about to get a whole lot angrier... because we have the extramarital extraterrestrial backstage in a soundproof booth where he can't hear us."
48691,207,264,1190000,Kang,TV Studio,I hear all.
48723,207,265,1192000,Jerry Springer,TV Studio,"Ladies and gentlemen, meet Kang."
48752,207,266,1204000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,"One-eyed, two-timing ! I'm gonna !"
48753,207,267,1207000,Kang,TV Studio,"Oh yeah? Well, hyperbolic paraboloid yo mama!"
48754,207,268,1217000,Audience,TV Studio,Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
48755,207,269,1217000,Woman In Audience,TV Studio,"Yeah, I got a question for that gross thing, whatever it is..."
48756,207,270,1219000,Jerry Springer,TV Studio,Homer.
48757,207,271,1220000,Woman In Audience,TV Studio,"Nah, the green dude. If you're that baby's daddy, where you been at?"
48758,207,272,1227000,Audience,TV Studio,Yeah.
48759,207,273,1227000,Woman In Audience,TV Studio,"You know, somebody needs to learn your green ass some responsibility--"
48761,207,275,1233000,Jerry Springer,TV Studio,"Now hold on, Kang. You can't bully my audience with your fancy ray gun."
48762,207,276,1242000,Jerry Springer,TV Studio,And now for my final thought. Nobody wins when parents put their petty squabbles above the welfare of a child.
48763,207,277,1248000,Jerry Springer,TV Studio,Let's hope they put their differences aside and do what's best for Maggie.
48764,207,278,1253000,Jerry Springer,TV Studio,Ow! What the fu-- Get the baby off Son of a bit--
48765,207,279,1267000,Marge Simpson,TV Studio,I am so -ing embarrassed.
48766,207,280,1271000,Marge Simpson,TV Studio,I can't believe it. Jerry Springer didn't solve our conflict.
48767,207,281,1275000,Lisa Simpson,TV Studio,And now he's dead.
48768,207,282,1277000,Kang,TV Studio,"Anyhoo, this is your last chance. Turn over the baby now."
48769,207,283,1282000,Kodos,TV Studio,Or we will destroy all your leaders in Washington.
48770,207,284,1286000,Marge Simpson,TV Studio,"Oh, you couldn't destroy every politician."
48771,207,285,1290000,Kang,TV Studio,Just watch us.
48773,207,287,1297000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,Don't forget Ken Starr.
48774,207,288,1301000,Marge Simpson,TV Studio,Suckers.
48775,207,289,1303000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,"C'mon, Maggie. Let's go home."
48776,207,290,1307000,Maggie Simpson,TV Studio,Very well. I'll drive.
48777,207,291,1315000,Maggie Simpson,TV Studio,I need blood.
48778,207,292,1364000,Regis Philbin,TV Studio,My eyes! My beautiful eyes!
