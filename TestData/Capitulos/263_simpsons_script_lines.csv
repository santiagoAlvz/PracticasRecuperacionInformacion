65757,263,4,94000,Commercial Announcer,Simpson Home,The amusement park made entirely of Blocko brand assembly fun blocks!
65758,263,5,100000,Commercial Announcer,Simpson Home,So how much did you love Blockoland?
65759,263,6,103000,Testimonial Kid,Simpson Home,"It was all right, I guess."
65760,263,7,105000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Kids... How would you... like to go to... Blockoland?!!
65761,263,8,112000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Meh.
65762,263,9,113000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But... the TV gave me the impression that...
65763,263,10,115000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"We said ""meh."""
65764,263,11,115000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,M-E-H. Meh.
65765,263,12,120000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'd like to go. How about you, Maggie?"

65769,263,16,139000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,We're here.
65770,263,17,145000,Blocko Cowboy,Blockoland,"Howdy, partner."
65771,263,18,147000,Blocko Lincoln,Blockoland,Four score and seven blocks ago my...
65774,263,21,152000,Girl,Blockoland,Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Whee!
65775,263,22,160000,Lisa Simpson,Blockoland,"Okay, we have our choice of Rectangle Land, Cube Country or Squaresville."
65776,263,23,165000,Marge Simpson,Blockoland,Squaresville sounds pretty cool.
65777,263,24,170000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,I am a robot. Do what I say.
65778,263,25,176000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,I am a washing machine. Do what I say.
65780,263,27,183000,Bart Simpson,Blockoland,Take that!
65781,263,28,183000,Nelson Muntz,Blockoland,In the face!
65782,263,29,189000,Booth Attendant,Blockoland,You knocked his block off!
65783,263,30,192000,Security Guard,Blockoland,Come with me.
65784,263,31,197000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,Check it out. I built myself a healthy apple.
65785,263,32,201000,Lisa Simpson,Blockoland,But you made it out of ham cubes.
65786,263,33,204000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,"Yep, a shiny new apple."
65787,263,34,209000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,I get it. Everything's made of blocks. Even the water.
65788,263,35,215000,Lisa Simpson,Blockoland,Ow! Ow!
65789,263,36,217000,Attendant,Blockoland,"Hey, boat twenty-eight, stop splashing!"
65790,263,37,219000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,What are you gonna do about it?
65791,263,38,223000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,Uh-oh.
65792,263,39,231000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,Leeches!
65794,263,41,236000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Oh, why did I get this Lego shirt?"
65795,263,42,239000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Don't you mean Blocko shirt?
65796,263,43,242000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Right, right. Blocko shirt."
65797,263,44,244000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Lisa, how's your Eiffel Tower kit?"
65798,263,45,246000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"It's okay, but it's missing a piece."
65799,263,46,248000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Welcome to real life, Lisa. You can't fight city hall, AKA Blockoland. So don't even try."
65800,263,47,257000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,What kind of a thing is that to tell your children?
65801,263,48,260000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,It's what I always tell them. I told them that twice yesterday. And then again as they were going to sleep.
65802,263,49,265000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,I'm sure the gift shop will replace the missing piece.
65803,263,50,269000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"You're right, honey. Hear that, kids? The Simpsons are going to Blockoland!"
65804,263,51,277000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,Yaaayy!
65805,263,52,277000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,'Scuse me.
65807,263,54,287000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,You sold my little girl a shoddy Eiffel Tower.
65808,263,55,290000,Souvenir Salesman,Blockoland,"Hey, tough luck, pal. You can't fight the Souvenir Industry. We're too powerful."
65809,263,56,294000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,"Yeah, you're right."
65810,263,57,299000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,"But before I go, I'm gonna give you a little souvenir of my own."
65811,263,58,307000,Souvenir Salesman,Blockoland,"Oh, what the hey... here you go."
65812,263,59,312000,Lisa Simpson,Blockoland,"Thank you, Dad."
65813,263,60,314000,Homer Simpson,Blockoland,"Hey, any friend of Marge is a friend of mine."
65815,263,62,318000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"So, how's that new block I got you?"
65816,263,63,320000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,Great!
65817,263,64,323000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"You know, standing up for the little guy felt good. I'm gonna do it more often."
65819,263,66,336000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Those bullies are gone now!
65820,263,67,338000,Snake Jailbird,Simpson Car,You idiot. They were beating out my shirt fire!
65821,263,68,342000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"My heart was in the right place, jerk!"
65823,263,70,349000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks again, Dad."
65824,263,71,352000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you're welcome, honey. Now, I'm gonna spend the whole day helping shmoes with their problems. Got a problem, Bart?"
65825,263,72,359000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,A girl at school won't go to the dance with me.
65826,263,73,362000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart's got a girlfriend!
65827,263,74,364000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No I don't, that's the problem."
65828,263,75,366000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart's got a problem!
65829,263,76,368000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, son. I'll handle this."
65831,263,78,377000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Come on! Why won't you go out with Bart?
65832,263,79,380000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,He's a smelly ugly dork.
65833,263,80,382000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Please, ugly is such a smelly word. Who would you rather go out with?"
65834,263,81,387000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,Tommy.
65835,263,82,391000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well duh! He's breathtaking, but Bart has inner beauty... like you'd find in a rodent."
65836,263,83,401000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"And face it, you're no prize either. You wear braces, you dress like a kid and you're not gettin' any younger. Take what you can get."
65837,263,84,409000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,He's right. Grab something. And don't let go!
65838,263,85,412000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, Bart's not so bad."
65840,263,87,418000,Marge Simpson,Beauty Salon,They wouldn't honor my coupon for two free streaks.
65841,263,88,422000,Homer Simpson,Beauty Salon,"They wouldn't? Well I'll go to bat for you, honey."
65842,263,89,429000,Henri,Beauty Salon,"Yes, may I help you?"
65843,263,90,431000,Homer Simpson,Beauty Salon,"Nice place you got here. Ooh look, a hair net. Be a shame if it was hurled to the ground!"
65844,263,91,442000,Homer Simpson,Beauty Salon,"Oh, how clumsy of me? And..."
65845,263,92,447000,Homer Simpson,Beauty Salon,Oops!
65846,263,93,448000,Henri,Beauty Salon,Why are you doing zese things?
65847,263,94,450000,Homer Simpson,Beauty Salon,"Either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more lids will be unscrewed."
65848,263,95,454000,Henri,Beauty Salon,I cannot streak that much hair. Think of the cost. I'd be ruined!
65849,263,96,459000,Homer Simpson,Beauty Salon,"Oh, really..."
65850,263,97,462000,Homer Simpson,Beauty Salon,"Boy, you weren't kidding. Your profit margins are razor-thin."
65851,263,98,466000,Henri,Beauty Salon,You see? Zees is what I'm...
65852,263,99,467000,Homer Simpson,Beauty Salon,Wait a minute. Four hundred a month for loafer lightener?
65853,263,100,472000,Henri,Beauty Salon,But we must have it. It is ze lifeblood of ze industry.
65854,263,101,477000,Homer Simpson,Beauty Salon,You get the same results with a mincing gel.
65855,263,102,481000,Henri,Beauty Salon,But of course! I will save thousands! Thank you!
65857,263,104,485000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie, I love them. I can't thank you enough."
65858,263,105,489000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The satisfaction of helping another human being is all the thanks I et cetera.
65859,263,107,497000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"And I gave that man directions, even though I didn't know the way. 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am this week."
65860,263,108,509000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Lousy Isotopes! They're a disgrace to baseball.
65861,263,109,513000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,They lost again?
65862,263,110,514000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Mm hmm. The team's been terrible since they got bought by the cheap, heartless Duff Corporation. Hey Moe, gimme a Duff. Oh yeah, sweet Duff."
65863,263,111,526000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Wait a minute. Duff owns the Springfield Isotopes? Since when?
65864,263,112,530000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"They bought 'em a year ago, from the Mafia. It was the last of the family-owned teams."
65865,263,113,535000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"I tried to return my season ticket, but they wouldn't give me my money back. They said they wanted it."
65866,263,114,540000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Say no more. I'll help you, Lenny."
65867,263,115,542000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,You wanna help me?
65868,263,116,544000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Haven't you heard? He's the new Homer.
65869,263,117,546000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,He's wonderful.
65872,263,120,553000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,I'm trying to get a refund for this ticket. Is this the executive office of the ball club?
65873,263,121,558000,Trainer,STADIUM,Nope. This is the equipment shed.
65874,263,122,560000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,Oh.
65875,263,123,560000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Well, is that it?"
65876,263,124,562000,Trainer,STADIUM,That's where we keep the water heater.
65877,263,125,565000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,Is...
65878,263,126,566000,Trainer,STADIUM,That's a tractor.
65879,263,127,567000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,I see.
65881,263,129,568000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,"Sir, we can't give your friend a refund just because the team is losing."
65882,263,130,573000,Homer Simpson,Office,I'm sorry to hear that.
65883,263,131,576000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,Spin that back to where it was.
65884,263,132,578000,Homer Simpson,Office,"Yes, sir."
65885,263,133,579000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,This meeting is over.
65886,263,134,581000,Homer Simpson,Office,"Okay. So, uh, you wanna go get something to eat?"
65887,263,135,585000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,No. I don't. Get out of here.
65888,263,136,588000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,"No, no, not that door!"
65889,263,137,594000,Homer Simpson,Office,Albuquerque Isotopes? What is all this stuff?
65890,263,138,599000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,It's not anything. It has no purpose.
65891,263,139,605000,Homer Simpson,Office,What a crazy room. There's no Albuquerque Isotopes. It's the Springfield... Ohhhh.
65892,263,140,611000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,"No, no. There's no 'ohhhh.'"
65893,263,141,611000,Homer Simpson,Office,"You're moving the team to Albuquerque, aren't you?"
65894,263,142,616000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,"No, no, we would never abandon our loyal Springfield fans. By the way, all this barging into rooms marked ""PRIVATE"" must have made you thirsty. Would you like a beer?"
65895,263,143,626000,Homer Simpson,Office,"Well, okay. But you can't silence Homer Simpson. I'm the friend of the downtrodden. And I'm not gonna forget what I saw here today."
65896,263,144,634000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,Of course not.
65897,263,145,636000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,"Duffman, could you bring in two bottles of smooth, untainted Duff?"
65898,263,146,640000,Duffman,Office,Oh yeah!
65899,263,147,645000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,"Now, Homer, we've developed this additive that makes beer super, super malty. Care to try it?"
65900,263,148,651000,Homer Simpson,Office,Wait a minute. Will this erase my memory?
65901,263,149,654000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,"No, not at all."
65902,263,150,662000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Office,"Man, that is malty. But he'll never know."
65904,263,152,672000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Good grief.
65905,263,153,673000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my head. How long have I been out here?"
65906,263,154,678000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,All night. You were yelling at the swing.
65907,263,155,680000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I was? But I love the swing.
65908,263,156,683000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you were nuts."
65909,263,157,685000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know me. Occasionally, I'll be quirky. ""I'll be quirky..."" Albuquerque! I'll be right back!"
65911,263,159,695000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,Members of the media...
65912,263,160,695000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,...thank you for coming. The proof that the Isotopes are moving to Albuquerque is right behind this door.
65913,263,161,702000,Voice,STADIUM,Excuse me.
65914,263,162,704000,Reporter,STADIUM,"Joel Duffman, The Newsly Times. What's with the smear campaign against this beloved brewer?"
65915,263,163,711000,Reporter,STADIUM,"And weren't you once in a loony bin? Oh, yeah!"
65916,263,164,715000,Howard K. Duff VIII,STADIUM,"He's right, folks. The only story here is the rich, smooth taste of Duff."
65917,263,165,721000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Yes, that is an important story. But so is this!"
65918,263,166,727000,Howard K. Duff VIII,STADIUM,"Well, I think I know tomorrow's headline: ""Local Man Is Liar""."
65919,263,167,728000,Reporter,STADIUM,That is a good headline.
65922,263,169,737000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"So let me get this straight, Mr. Duff. The Isotopes are not moving to Albuquerque?"
65923,263,170,742000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Simpson Home,Absolutely not.
65924,263,171,743000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"So, are you calling Homer Simpson a liar?"
65925,263,172,747000,Howard K. Duff VIII,Simpson Home,"Well, we have obtained this footage of him with his pants on fire."
65926,263,173,753000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Homie, I believe you're telling the truth about the Isotopes."
65927,263,174,757000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't mind being called a liar when I'm lying, or about to lie, or just finished lying. But not when I'm telling the truth."
65928,263,175,767000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but what can you do?"
65929,263,176,769000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,There's all kinds of ways to get the public on your side. Bob Dylan wrote songs. Cesar Chavez staged hunger strikes.
65930,263,177,776000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it! I'll go on a hunger strike.
65931,263,178,780000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie, you couldn't keep up a hunger strike. You eat while you brush your teeth. You're eating a huge sausage right now."
65932,263,179,787000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So? I can stop. And I will stop. I'm on a hunger strike, starting right... now!"
65934,263,181,819000,Homer Simpson,Duff Stadium,Let's see those double A baseball honchos ignore this.
65935,263,182,822000,Marge Simpson,Duff Stadium,You're really not gonna eat anything?
65936,263,183,824000,Homer Simpson,Duff Stadium,"My hunger strike will not end until Duff admits they're moving the team. Bart, my chains."
65937,263,184,835000,Homer Simpson,Duff Stadium,Now it begins.
65938,263,185,836000,Lisa Simpson,Duff Stadium,"Dad, I'm so proud of you. If you need some inspiration, here's a book of Mike Farrell's core beliefs."
65939,263,186,845000,Homer Simpson,Duff Stadium,"Man, he really hates Wayne Rogers."
65940,263,187,849000,Marge Simpson,Duff Stadium,"Goodbye, Homie. Here's Dr. Hibbert's number if you feel weak."
65941,263,188,853000,Homer Simpson,Duff Stadium,Don't worry. Duff's not gonna let me waste away to nothing.
65942,263,189,857000,Bart Simpson,Duff Stadium,"Uh, Dad?"
65945,263,192,864000,Milhouse Van Houten,STADIUM,"What a great ball game. Thanks, Weekend Dad."
65946,263,193,867000,Kirk Van Houten,STADIUM,Stop calling me that.
65947,263,194,869000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,Hey kid and man!
65948,263,195,869000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,Don't support a team run by liars!
65949,263,196,872000,Milhouse Van Houten,STADIUM,Liars?
65950,263,197,873000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,They're secretly planning to move to Albuquerque.
65952,263,198,876000,Kirk Van Houten,STADIUM,"That's crazy. It would have been on a talk radio show like Sports Chat, or Sportszilla and the Jabber Jocks."
65953,263,199,882000,Milhouse Van Houten,STADIUM,Yeah!
65954,263,200,883000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,Why you little...
65956,263,202,883000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Oh, so hungry... Can't give up... Must continue fighting evil corporation."
65957,263,203,896000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,STADIUM,"Oh, oh Seymour, you shouldn't have. It's gonna go straight to my thighs."
65958,263,204,901000,Seymour Skinner,STADIUM,"Well Edna, it just might have some company."
65959,263,205,904000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,STADIUM,"Oh, Seymour!"
65960,263,206,910000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Nice try, God."
65961,263,207,913000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,But Homer Simpson doesn't give in to temptation that easily... Hey!
65962,263,208,918000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,Stop that!
65965,263,211,925000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,There's still more meatloaf.
65966,263,212,927000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ohh, that's impossible."
65967,263,213,929000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, c'mon, we all have to pitch in and eat your father's share."
65968,263,214,933000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you just cook less?
65969,263,215,935000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't do things that way, Lisa."
