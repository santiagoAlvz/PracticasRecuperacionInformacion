44641,194,2,41000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ow! Bart, that has nuts in it!"
44642,194,3,46000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I thought your mother told you to take a bath."
44643,194,4,49000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, Mom says a lot of things."
44644,194,5,51000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, I understand, kids. I'm not a bath man myself -- more of a cologne man."
44645,194,6,56000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, we can't take a bath anyway. The water heater is broken."
44646,194,7,58000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't worry. Daddy'll fix it.

44649,194,10,79000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What on earth -- ?!
44650,194,11,80000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hi sweetie. I'm off to Moe's. Love ya.
44652,194,13,86000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,To Marge. And all the blissful years I've spent hiding from her in this bar.

44654,194,15,94000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah. Big deal. You got a wife. I got a rash. Who cares? Ech, I'm sorry, Homer. It's just, it's been four years since my last date with a whatchacallit, uh, woman."
44655,194,16,106000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Whatever happened to your mail order bride?
44656,194,17,108000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, she got homesick for her old life, diving for tourist pennies in a Micronesian swamp."
44657,194,18,114000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,So her career got in the way.
44658,194,19,116000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, I don't blame her. No girl wants to end up with a Joe Puke-pail like me."
44659,194,20,121000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Now, now, I won't hear of it, Moe. You're a fabulous catch."
44661,194,21,124000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, well, uh, how come I ain't fendin' off movie starlets with a pointy stick?"
44662,194,22,129000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, it's probably due to your ugliness. But that doesn't mean we can't find you a woman. Come on, we're goin' to the darkest bar in town."
44664,194,24,138000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Ah, I don't know, Homer. Women can smell panic. And, uh, right now, I gotta be reekin' of it."
44665,194,25,153000,Homer Simpson,Stu's Disco,Relax. All I smell is garlic and fish.
44666,194,26,161000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Uh, you look pretty clean. You, uh, mind if I had this dance?"
44667,194,27,165000,Woman #1,Stu's Disco,It's all yours.
44668,194,28,169000,Homer Simpson,Stu's Disco,"Okay, I won't lie to you. A lot of people saw that. But you gotta keep tryin'."
44669,194,29,176000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"So, hi there... Uh, don't scream."
44670,194,30,178000,Woman #2,Stu's Disco,"Oh, hi! Wanna join me for a Bacardi and soda?"
44671,194,31,182000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Yeah, yeah, that'd be great!"
44672,194,32,184000,Woman #2,Stu's Disco,"Or maybe you'd prefer a cool, refreshing Bacardi colada."
44673,194,33,188000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Sure, whatever."
44674,194,34,189000,Woman #2,Stu's Disco,Because Bacardi makes the night come alive... with freshness.
44675,194,35,193000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Uh, do you work for Bacardi?"
44676,194,36,195000,Woman #2,Stu's Disco,"No, I'm in love with you."
44677,194,37,201000,Homer Simpson,Stu's Disco,"Hey, don't give up, Moe. The girl of your dreams has gotta be in some bar."
44678,194,38,207000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Awww, there's nobody for Moe. I'm just gonna die lonely, and ugly, and dead."
44679,194,39,213000,Renee,Stu's Disco,"Well, hello, Mary Sunshine..."
44680,194,40,215000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,Huh?
44681,194,41,216000,Renee,Stu's Disco,"Aw, cheer up. Here, have a flower."
44682,194,42,218000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"All right, come on, what's the catch? A gorgeous woman don't just hand ya a free daffydil."
44683,194,43,224000,Renee,Stu's Disco,Really? You think I'm gorgeous?
44684,194,44,226000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Yeah, well, the part that's showin'. I guess you could have a lot of weird scars, or a fake ass, or somethin'."
44685,194,45,232000,Renee,Stu's Disco,"You don't talk to a lot of women, do you?"
44686,194,46,234000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Well... no... no... well... no... not a... lot... I... Gee, I'm sorry. I used to box you know, my brain's... Well, it's in and out."

44688,194,48,246000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Yeah, there's extensive cauliflowering."
44689,194,49,248000,Renee,Stu's Disco,"Well, your bow tie's just darling."
44690,194,50,252000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Oh, well, thanks. Yeah, it kinda draws the eye away from the old mug."
44691,194,51,257000,Renee,Stu's Disco,I like a face with character.
44692,194,52,259000,Homer Simpson,Stu's Disco,"Let's get out of here, Moe. This is goin' nowhere."
44693,194,53,261000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Yeah, I... look, I don't suppose... you'd never want to... uh... I dunno... get together sometime?"
44694,194,54,269000,Renee,Stu's Disco,"You mean like a date? Well, I don't know..."
44695,194,55,273000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Ah, what was I thinkin'? A beautiful girl like you and a gargoyle like me. I... I-I'm sorry."
44696,194,56,278000,Renee,Stu's Disco,Hold on. Hold on. I didn't say no exactly...
44697,194,57,279000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Really? Hot damn! All right. Don't eat nothin' for the next three days, 'cause I'm takin' you out for a steak the size of a toilet seat!"
44698,194,58,288000,Renee,Stu's Disco,"Well, when you put it that way... My name's Renee."
44699,194,59,292000,Moe Szyslak,Stu's Disco,"Who cares? You're goin' out with me. She's going out with me, cat!"
44700,194,60,298000,Homer Simpson,Stu's Disco,Stop kissing that cat and get in the car!
44702,194,62,301000,Moe Szyslak,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Hey! Hey! Sabu! Ah, I need another magnum of your best champagne, here, uh? And bring us the finest food you got, stuffed with the second finest."

44706,194,66,350000,Marge Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"So, Renee, it looks like you've taken quite a shine to Moe. Do you mind if I ask why?"
44707,194,67,357000,Homer Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,Maa-rrge...
44708,194,68,358000,Marge Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,I didn't mean any disrespect. I just can't figure it out.
44709,194,69,363000,Renee,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Well, to be honest, at first it was just pity."
44711,194,71,367000,Moe Szyslak,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Yeah. It's like out of a story book, ain't it?"
44712,194,72,369000,Renee,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"But he's really grown on me. He's got this insecure, sweaty charm."

44714,194,74,376000,Renee,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"And he's so thoughtful. Last night, he bought all the seats in a movie theater just so we could have a romantic evening together."
44715,194,75,383000,Moe Szyslak,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Yeahhh, well, I just get so tired of idiots shootin' their mouths off, laughin' and clappin'. Makes you wanna start pokin' eyes out and slashin' guts and kickin' throats..."

44717,194,78,395000,Waiter,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Ah, excuse me, sir. Will there be anything else?"
44718,194,79,397000,Moe Szyslak,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Uh, yeah, park the dessert cart under this beautiful lady's nose. And charge it all to my Players Club card."

44725,194,86,445000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, that's it. It's all over. Renee ain't gonna wanna hang around with no Joe Pinchpenny."

44736,194,97,506000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, I insist you steal that car."
44737,194,98,509000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I'll do it!
44738,194,99,514000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, here's the plan. This model car represents my car, huh? And this olive is you. Now..."

44740,194,101,522000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey! Hey! Aw, that's great. Now the car's gonna have to represent you, and, uh, this little toy man will represent the car."

44742,194,103,530000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Listen up, here. Tomorrow night at eight, you go down to the waterfront and you ""steal"" my car."
44743,194,104,536000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,What about the cops?
44744,194,105,537000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,That's the beauty part. Every cop in town's gonna be on the Police Department's Moonlight Charity Cruise. And I'm gonna be right there with 'em.
44745,194,106,544000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"So, as soon as you get back, we steal the car, right?"
44746,194,107,549000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Righ-- No, no. Wrong. Listen. While I'm on the boat with the perfect alibi, you steal my car, and park it on the railroad tracks. Then when the 10:15 train comes along..."
44747,194,108,557000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,WHAM! The insurance company pays off five thousand clams. I keep showing Renee the sweet life.
44748,194,109,565000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"You're a genius, Moe. All your troubles will soon be over for a couple months."
44750,194,111,576000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why all the black?
44751,194,112,577000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why all the pearls? Why all the hair? Why anything?
