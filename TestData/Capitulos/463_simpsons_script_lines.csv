119885,463,21,178000,Lou,Springfield Street,"I don't know, Chief. We can't afford a radar gun. So we're just using a thermos on top of a hose handle."

119887,463,23,185000,Lou,Springfield Street,"Hey, that Ralphie's getting' to be a pretty fine artist."

119944,463,82,404000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Nothing is ever boobs or ice cream.
119947,463,85,411000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I'll prove I'm not crazy. Sideshow Bob could never resist singing along to a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta.

119954,463,92,438000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,We need a third maid. Maybe someone will step in and help.
119955,463,93,443000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"ONE LITTLE MAID IS A BRIDE, YUM YUM."
119956,463,94,445000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,TWO LITTLE MAIDS IN ATTENDANCE COME.
119957,463,95,447000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,THREE LITTLE MAIDS... THREE LITTLE MAIDS...

119959,463,97,453000,WALT,Bart's Treehouse,"Sorry, gentlemen. I'm not a fan...of that particular style of music. My radio dial never strays from ""89.4 - The Spur."""
119960,463,98,457000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"It is a good station, Bart, what with the ""Morning Cattle Drive"" and Armadillo Mike in the afternoon. And nothing keeps me informed like ""Rodeo Rick's News Roundup"" every hour on the--"

119963,463,101,474000,WALT,WALT'S HOUSE,"I just want to say I've not only found new neighbors but gained new friends. And from now on, Wi-Fi in this neighborhood is on me!"
119965,463,103,487000,Lenny Leonard,WALT'S HOUSE,"Ooh, that book I ordered is gonna be delayed."
119966,463,104,493000,Bart Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,"All right, ""Walt Warren,"" let's see who you really are."
119967,463,105,497000,Bart Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,"""Harmless World,"" ""Mild Manners,"" ""Not Mad Magazine,"" ""Nap Fancy,"" ""Calm,"" ""Comfortable,"" a ""Cuddly Puppies"" calendar..."
119968,463,106,506000,Bart Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,"Aww, the little guy can't get out of the pumpkin. There must be something here!"
119969,463,107,511000,Bart Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,"Something, something, something!"
119970,463,108,513000,Marge Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,Bart?!
119972,463,110,513000,Marge Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,What are you doing?! You're indoors at an outdoor party!
119973,463,111,518000,Bart Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,Walt is Sideshow Bob and I'm gonna prove it. Look!
119974,463,112,520000,Bart Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,Who needs a knife this big?
119975,463,113,523000,Marge Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,It's probably a de-boner.
119976,463,114,526000,Bart Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,"Boner. Mom, I'm scared!"
119977,463,115,528000,Marge Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,I can see there's only one way to settle this once and for all.
119979,463,117,537000,Guard,Springfield Penitentiary,"Okay ma'am, Sideshow Bob's cell is all the way at the end. Walk fast and don't call attention to yourself."
119980,463,118,543000,Guard,Springfield Penitentiary,Pretty lady in a strapless dress comin' through!
119981,463,119,546000,Prisoners,Springfield Penitentiary,"Oh yeah! / If you were my wife, I never woulda killed you..."
119982,463,120,551000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,Thank you... you're very sweet...
119983,463,121,553000,Guard,Springfield Penitentiary,Nothin' is holdin' up the dress! Only her melons! And here we are.

119987,463,125,565000,Guard,Springfield Penitentiary,"Oh, here you go."
119988,463,126,568000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,That is Bob. Guess I was wrong.
119990,463,128,575000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Penitentiary,We better go.
119991,463,129,577000,Guard,Springfield Penitentiary,Pretty lady comin' back!
119992,463,130,580000,Prisoners,Springfield Penitentiary,"C'mere, baby."

119999,463,137,637000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Great day to be alive!
120000,463,138,641000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The paper's here.
120001,463,139,641000,WALT,Simpson Home,"Morning, Marge."
120003,463,141,641000,WALT,Simpson Home,"Hope I didn't interrupt your petite dejeuner. Look, I feel terrible that Bart and I got off on the wrong foot, and I have an extra ticket to today's baseball game... Bart, care to come?"
120004,463,142,653000,WALT,Simpson Home,They're playing Spokane...
120005,463,143,655000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The Cascades?! They totally stole the Federal Cup from us last year! Can I go Mom? Can I?
120006,463,144,660000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Is your room clean?
120007,463,145,660000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
120008,463,146,662000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Good. That'll give me something to do while you're at the game.
120009,463,147,671000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, the bathroom scale is lying again."
120012,463,150,680000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, Sideshow. I'm gonna do to you what you shoulda done to my son a long time ago!"
120013,463,151,686000,THE REAL WALT,Simpson Home,I'm not Sideshow Bob! I'm the real Walt Warren!
120014,463,152,689000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"But that's impossible! If you're the real Walt Warren, who's taking our son to the baseball game right now?"
120017,463,155,698000,Bart Simpson,"""WALT'S"" CAR","Uh, you missed the turn-off, Mr. Warren."
120018,463,156,700000,WALT,"""WALT'S"" CAR","You don't have to call me Mr. Warren anymore. You see, Bart, you were right all along."
120019,463,157,708000,WALT,"""WALT'S"" CAR",I am... Sideshow Bob!
120021,463,159,713000,THE REAL BOB,"""WALT'S"" CAR",And now I am free to sing all the Gilbert and Sullivan I damn well please!
120022,463,160,718000,WALT,"""WALT'S"" CAR",BEHOLD THE LORD HIGH EXECUTIONER / A PERSONAGE OF NOBLE RANK AND TITLE...
120025,463,163,738000,THE REAL WALT,Simpson Home,"I'll prove I'm telling the truth! Bob has huge feet, right? Well, look!"
118988,463,164,745000,THE REAL WALT,Simpson Home,You see?
120026,463,166,747000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's like you're a Chinese empress!
120027,463,167,750000,THE REAL WALT,Simpson Home,"You see, I was Bob's cellmate..."
120029,463,169,752000,THE REAL BOB,Car,"...My new cellmate, Walt Warren, was the perfect candidate for my plan. He had the same build as me -- lacking only my regal bearing and leonine grace..."
120030,463,170,763000,THE REAL BOB,Car,"--as a minor offender, he was scheduled for early release..."
120032,463,172,774000,THE REAL WALT,TWO-MAN CELL,"Say, Bob, why do you keep measuring my face?"
120033,463,173,778000,THE REAL BOB,TWO-MAN CELL,"Just passing the time, bunky."
120034,463,174,780000,THE REAL WALT,TWO-MAN CELL,"Well, I guess it beats what the last guy did. Well, nighty-night."
120035,463,175,786000,THE REAL BOB,TWO-MAN CELL,And nighty-night to you.
120037,463,177,794000,THE REAL BOB,HOSPITAL MEDICAL WARD,I began by removing Walt's face.
120038,463,178,801000,THE REAL BOB,HOSPITAL MEDICAL WARD,Five-second rule!
120039,463,179,803000,THE REAL BOB,HOSPITAL MEDICAL WARD,That was the easy part. The hard part was removing my own face.
120040,463,180,807000,THE REAL BOB,HOSPITAL MEDICAL WARD,"Luckily, as Krusty's sidekick, I'd been hit with so many pies that my face had lost all sensation."
120042,463,182,815000,THE REAL BOB,HOSPITAL MEDICAL WARD,Or so I thought.
120046,463,186,825000,THE REAL BOB,HOSPITAL MEDICAL WARD,The final reattachment was a mere bagatelle.
120047,463,187,829000,THE REAL BOB,HOSPITAL MEDICAL WARD,Or so I thought.
120049,463,189,834000,THE REAL BOB,Springfield Penitentiary,They returned Walt's possessions to me...
120050,463,190,836000,Prison Worker,Springfield Penitentiary,Keys... cell phone... a hundred and forty-three thousand dollars.
120052,463,192,841000,Prison Worker,Springfield Penitentiary,"It was only twenty-seven thousand when you came in, but we invested it well."
120053,463,193,845000,THE REAL BOB,Springfield Penitentiary,Would you like a commission?
120054,463,194,845000,Prison Worker,Springfield Penitentiary,Not allowed.
120055,463,195,847000,THE REAL BOB,Springfield Penitentiary,And I walked out free as a bird.
120057,463,197,854000,THE REAL BOB,Car,"I bought the house next to you, and here we are. So I just have to kill you, then sell the house. Selling the house will be murder."
120058,463,198,863000,Bart Simpson,Car,You could just rent it till the market recovers... which'll be never!
120059,463,200,871000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,"Walt, why didn't you tell your story to the guards?"
120060,463,201,875000,THE REAL WALT,Springfield,"Well, I tried to -- but I had trouble moving my new lips. They heard me babbling, thought I was crazy, and threw me into a padded cell."
120062,463,203,883000,THE REAL WALT,PADDED CELL,"I tried to warn you by writing ""Bart Simpson will die"" on the walls, but you ignored me."
120064,463,205,890000,Marge Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,"You have to admit, ""Bart Simpson Will Die"" was kind of open to interpretation."
120065,463,206,895000,THE REAL WALT,WALT'S HOUSE,I'm not a writer.
120066,463,207,896000,Homer Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,And I'm not a locksmith!
120067,463,208,908000,Homer Simpson,WALT'S HOUSE,"Man, that dude does not like Bart."
120069,463,210,911000,Lisa Simpson,"""WALT'S"" HOUSE",I know where Bob's taking Bart!
120071,463,212,923000,Joyce,GAS & GRUB,"Another cup of coffee, handsome? It's on the house."
120072,463,213,927000,THE REAL BOB,GAS & GRUB,"That's kind of you, Joyce, but caffeine makes me jittery, and I have a task ahead of me which requires a firm hand."
120073,463,214,933000,Joyce,GAS & GRUB,"Ooo, I like a man with a firm hand. Hey, looks like you've got a loose thread on your collar."
120074,463,215,940000,THE REAL BOB,GAS & GRUB,"No, don't!"
120075,463,216,943000,THE REAL BOB,GAS & GRUB,My face! My beautiful borrowed face!
120077,463,218,949000,Joyce,Gas & Grub,Come back! I don't care if you don't have a face! I just need something warm to cuddle at night!
120078,463,219,956000,Marge Simpson,Gas & Grub,"Excuse me, have you seen this man?"
120079,463,220,959000,Joyce,Gas & Grub,Yeah I've seen him. He... uh... said he was driving down to Mexico.
120080,463,221,964000,Homer Simpson,Gas & Grub,Mexico! Andalé! Andalé! Arriba!
120081,463,222,967000,THE REAL WALT,Gas & Grub,I don't believe her -- I think she fell in love with my face and she's trying to throw us off the scent.
120082,463,223,973000,Marge Simpson,Gas & Grub,"Walt, it's a nice face, but I don't think it would drive a professional waitress to lie."
120083,463,224,979000,THE REAL WALT,Gas & Grub,"Well, fine. You go to Mexico. I'm going to Five Corners."
120084,463,225,984000,Joyce,Gas & Grub,"Hey, handsome. Is that a loose thread on your collar?"
120085,463,226,993000,Joyce,Gas & Grub,All the good men are either gay or have no face.
120087,463,228,999000,THE REAL BOB,REMOTE WILDERNESS,"Welcome to Five Corners -- the only geographic location in the U.S. where five states meet, and where you will meet your doom."
120088,463,229,1008000,Bart Simpson,REMOTE WILDERNESS,"Come on, Bob, you don't need to kill me. I'll probably kill myself pretty soon with all the stupid things I do. Oh no, I swallowed my tongue."
120089,463,230,1020000,THE REAL BOB,REMOTE WILDERNESS,"Yes... I would be a fool. Unless I did it here, where your murder will be unprosecutable."
120090,463,231,1028000,Bart Simpson,REMOTE WILDERNESS,"You know, the great ones can kill without explaining."
120091,463,232,1030000,THE REAL BOB,REMOTE WILDERNESS,"I can stand in one state...fire a gun in a second state, the bullet will travel through the third, hitting you in the fourth, so you fall dead in the fifth."
120092,463,233,1038000,THE REAL BOB,REMOTE WILDERNESS,No single act is against any law. But their sum total is the greatest murder since Snape killed Dumbledore!
