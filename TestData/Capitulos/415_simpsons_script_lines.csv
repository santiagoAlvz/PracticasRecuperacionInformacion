107699,415,7,62000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, boy. All the nerds are doin' it."
107700,415,8,65000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm not a nerd -- I'm a jock who's too cool for sports.
107702,415,10,69000,Sherri Mackleberry,Bookaccino's,It's the final book!
107703,415,11,69000,Terri Mackleberry,Bookaccino's,I wonder what happens!
107704,415,12,72000,Database,Bookaccino's,Maybe the Sandrux is the Narcolops!
107705,415,13,74000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bookaccino's,I read a rumor Spider-man's in it!
107706,415,14,76000,Seymour Skinner,Bookaccino's,Shut up! Shut up! This is a spoiler-free zone!
107707,415,15,83000,Comic Book Guy,Bookaccino's,"Nice Angelica Button costume, Lisa. Althooough... the gryphon on your coat of arms is facing left not right, and F.Y.I.: Angelica wears two tortoise-shell barrettes... nice try though."
107708,415,16,95000,Lisa Simpson,Bookaccino's,"I based my costume on the books, not the movies."
107709,415,17,105000,Store Manager,Bookaccino's,"Okay, I'm gonna hand out colored bracelets. The color on your bracelet will determine--"
107710,415,18,110000,Homer Simpson,Bookaccino's,Move or die!
107712,415,20,115000,Kirk Van Houten,Store,It's for my kid!
107713,415,21,117000,Martin Prince,Store,Eureka!
107714,415,22,117000,Nelson Muntz,Store,Now read it to me!
107715,415,23,122000,Martin Prince,Store,"""The dark lord has summoned you,"" said the withered troll."
107716,415,24,126000,Nelson Muntz,Store,Do the character voices!
107717,415,25,129000,Martin Prince,Store,And bring your cloak. The torture room can be frightfully chilly.
107720,415,28,131000,Lisa Simpson,Car,"Angelica's first kiss, da, da, da... Subplot about her cat, who cares?... Professor Skizzletwitch is a Were-bear... And, uh, no, no he's not... Maluicious Krubb is actually Kraluicious Mubb!"
107723,415,30,146000,Lisa Simpson,Car,"All is lost... Angelica uses the spell she learned in chapter six... Magic, magic, magic... All is won!"
107726,415,33,155000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, that's our book for the year -- I think we've earned some TV."
107727,415,34,160000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,TV! TV! TV!
107728,415,35,162000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But kids, I want you in bed by three a.m."
107730,415,37,165000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, somebody's gotta be the bad guy."
107731,415,38,168000,Bald Detective,Simpson Home,"But I don't understand, how could he have murdered his wife if he was making a phone call three thousand miles away?"
107732,415,39,174000,Red-haired Detective,Simpson Home,Maybe he reached out... and killed someone.
107734,415,41,183000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I saw this. He trained his dog to do it.
107737,415,44,187000,E.T. Reporter,Simpson Home,"Up next, which former ""Friends"" star is speaking out against adult illiteracy?"
107739,415,46,193000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's Lisa Kudrow.
107742,415,49,193000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Stop saying things, Bart! That's the TV's job!"
107743,415,50,199000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,...and the First Lady has agreed to sit on the egg until it hatches. More after this.
107744,415,51,208000,Chazz Busby,Simpson Home,See that? That's talent. You think you got it? You don't. 'Cause only I can teach it -- and I ain't taught you... so you don't.
107745,415,52,213000,Chazz Busby,Simpson Home,The Chazz Busby Ballet Academy is coming to Springfield.
107746,415,53,216000,Chazz Busby,Simpson Home,"Auditions are Monday. Callbacks are Tuesday. Wednesday you see I'm a heartless bastard. Thursday you realize you love me, dammit. Friday, we're closed."
107747,415,54,224000,Chazz Busby,Simpson Home,"You're fired. You're her. Jump, dance, love."
107748,415,55,227000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"A ballet academy here in Springfield?! Move over, Europe!"
107749,415,56,232000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't know you cared about ballet.
107750,415,57,234000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, have I ever shown you my Shattered Dreams Box?"
107751,415,58,234000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No.
107752,415,59,238000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's upstairs in my Disappointment Closet.
107753,415,60,241000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh. Oh.
107755,415,61,242000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"There were so many things I wanted to do in life that I never got a chance to do: doctor , safecracker , stethoscope sales lady ... none came to pass. But the thing I really wanted to be, ever since I was little, was a ballerina!"
107756,415,62,259000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,So what happened?
107757,415,63,260000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My bosoms came in and ruined my balance.
107758,415,64,263000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Really? How?
107759,415,65,264000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,They came in one at a time.
107760,415,66,266000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Do you think mine...
107761,415,67,268000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I'm pretty sure you'll have your dad's boobs."
107762,415,68,271000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh.
107763,415,69,275000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, it's not too late to un-shatter your dream! Martha Graham danced well into her seventies."
107764,415,70,280000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait, you mean she danced well, into her seventies? Or she danced, well into her seventies?"
107765,415,71,285000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... she danced into her seventies.
107766,415,72,287000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I think you've got a point! Homie, I'm gonna be a dancer!"
107767,415,73,292000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Go-go or boring?
107768,415,74,293000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Boring!
107772,415,78,300000,Chazz Busby,BALLET ACADEMY,"Okay, ladies, listen up -- forget everything you've ever learned about ballet. Good. Now from Bolshoi Fifth Position, give me a Battement Glissé, a Double Changement, two Swan Lake Fouettés, then finish with a Grand Pas De Chat."
107773,415,79,313000,Chazz Busby,BALLET ACADEMY,"Now show me what you got, uh... Simpson, comma, Marge!"
107774,415,80,330000,Chazz Busby,BALLET ACADEMY,"I haven't seen dancing like that since my Broadway Show ""Dancing Like That."" Closed in a week. Too smart for the corndog crowd. Too dumb for the bagel bunch. You keep it up, kid. You got somethin'."
107777,415,83,340000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son, while your mother and little mother are out, I'm gonna let you in on a deep dark family secret."
107778,415,84,347000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You have a drinking problem?
107779,415,85,349000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I said secret.
107780,415,86,352000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Have you ever wondered what I do in that locked room?
107781,415,87,355000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Gay out?
107782,415,88,356000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Well wonder no more!
107722,415,89,361000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Beef jerky? The queen of all the jerkys!
107754,415,90,364000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's right. Now I'll cut and you soak.
107783,415,91,371000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad... marinating with you is cool.
107784,415,92,374000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, son."
107786,415,94,377000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Some of that is cow blood.
107788,415,96,381000,Marge Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,"Look, Lis! I'm as supple as ever!"
107789,415,97,387000,Marge Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,It won't go down!
107791,415,99,390000,Marge Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,Uh-oh.
107792,415,100,394000,Chazz Busby,BALLET ACADEMY,"Marge, Marge, Marge -- you know what they say, those who cannot do..."
107793,415,101,394000,Marge Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,Teach?
107794,415,102,398000,Chazz Busby,BALLET ACADEMY,No -- they go home. How can they teach if they can't do? Get out!
107795,415,103,407000,Chazz Busby,BALLET ACADEMY,Who the hell...?
107796,415,104,409000,Chazz Busby,BALLET ACADEMY,... taught you to stand like that?
107797,415,105,410000,Lisa Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,This is how I always stand when I tell adults what they should be doing.
107798,415,106,414000,Chazz Busby,BALLET ACADEMY,"You have naturally perfect posture! I rarely say this, but, how would you like to become a paying student at my dance academy?"
107799,415,107,420000,Lisa Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,"Uh, I don't know I--"
107800,415,108,423000,Marge Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,We accept!
107802,415,110,435000,Lisa Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,"I'm sorry, I got confused."
107803,415,111,437000,Chazz Busby,BALLET ACADEMY,"You don't get to be ""confused."" Not till you've won six Tonys, gone into rehab, married your plastic surgeon, retired, then un-retired in a special little show called ""Woman of the Year."" You can't, uh... yeah, I forget where I'm goin' with this. Take a break, people."
107804,415,112,452000,Chazz Busby,BALLET ACADEMY,"Eh, eh, eh -- en pointe!"
107806,415,114,458000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Ballet Theater,This is so hard!
107807,415,115,459000,Annette,Springfield Ballet Theater,"Get used to it. We ballerinas are under constant pressure to stay focused, skinny, graceful and skinny."
107808,415,116,465000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Ballet Theater,How do you cope with it?
107809,415,117,467000,Annette,Springfield Ballet Theater,"You find out what works for you. For some people, it might be yoga, for others, meditation..."
107811,415,119,472000,Annette,Springfield Ballet Theater,"But for every ballerina in the world, it's cigarettes."
107812,415,120,478000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Ballet Theater,"Cigarettes?! They could kill you. They did a whole episode about it on ""The Suite Life of Zach and Cody""! Zach tried to impress a girl by smoking. But she went for Cody instead! Zach's life wasn't so sweet then."
107813,415,121,490000,Annette,Springfield Ballet Theater,"Hey, if God didn't want ballerinas to smoke, how come I can do this?"
107814,415,122,500000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Ballet Theater,Wowww... No! All I need to stay focused is good old-fashioned fresh air.
107815,415,123,507000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Ballet Theater,Nothing like fresh air.
107816,415,124,511000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Ballet Theater,Fresh air.
107818,415,126,518000,Chazz Busby,BALLET ACADEMY,"Horrible, horrible, horrible... no longer describes your dancing, Lisa. You're good, kid!"
107819,415,127,526000,Lisa Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,I've gotten better since this morning. How could that have happened?
107820,415,128,530000,Annette,BALLET ACADEMY,"Maybe it's all the secondhand ""focus"" and ""pep"" you're inhaling."
107821,415,129,536000,Annette,BALLET ACADEMY,"They don't call these ""dancer sticks"" for nothin'."
107822,415,130,538000,Lisa Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,I thought they were cancer sticks.
107823,415,131,542000,Annette,BALLET ACADEMY,I dan't dear dou!
107825,415,133,544000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"My Hindu friend, this is a chance for your Kwik-E-Mart to get in on the ground floor of a delicious new taste sensation."
107826,415,134,551000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,You talk a good game -- but do you have the product to back it up?
107827,415,135,554000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Step into our Jerkatorium.
107828,415,136,559000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What the?!
107829,415,137,559000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Where's our jerky?
107830,415,138,561000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,You have wasted my time! You have made a very powerless enemy. Good day and be well!
107831,415,139,567000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You haven't seen our Power Point presentation. Bart?"
107832,415,140,573000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,J -- Just the product you need. E -- Excellent value. R -- Retailer's dream. K--
107833,415,141,578000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"You can skip the ""K"" and the ""Y"" -- I do not thank you and I will not come again."
107834,415,142,590000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who could have done this?!
107835,415,143,591000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, something chewed through the cellar door... and the floor is covered with paw prints..."
107836,415,144,596000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This can only mean one thing.
107837,415,145,596000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Flanders! You ate my jerky!
107838,415,146,600000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"As the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. I spent the whole morning blackin' out the ""goshes"" and ""darns"" in these Hardy Boys books."
107839,415,147,607000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I know you ate my jerky. Just like I ate your earthquake supplies!
107633,415,148,612000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, look! Raccoons!"
107840,415,149,617000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You stay right here.
107841,415,150,619000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Okily dokily!
107842,415,151,623000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Ah, ""heck,"" ""darn"" -- I don't think so."
107844,415,153,629000,Smoke Lisa,Lisa's Bedroom,Lisa... Lisa Simpson...
107845,415,154,634000,Smoke Lisa,Lisa's Bedroom,Time for a smoke.
107846,415,155,636000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Look, everyone knows that cigarettes are where flavor lives and a cool choice for a hot night. But they're for losers!"
107847,415,156,643000,Smoke Lisa,Lisa's Bedroom,Losers? You mean losers like...
107848,415,157,646000,Smoke Lisa,Lisa's Bedroom,"Simone de Beauvoir, Margaret Mead, Queen Elizabeth the First, Lauren Bacall..."
107849,415,158,652000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,My feminist heroes!
107850,415,159,653000,Lillian Hellman,Lisa's Bedroom,"Don't forget me, Lillian Hellman! Smoking gave me the energy I needed to write plays and invent mayonnaise! Bring out the Hellman's, and bring out the best."
107851,415,160,664000,Smoke Historical Figures,Lisa's Bedroom,Puff with us! Puff with us! Puff with us!
107853,415,162,679000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, that's it, don't be shy..."
107854,415,163,683000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Enjoy your jerky laced with sleeping pills... nobody outwits Homer Simpson... Hey, they're not sleepy. They're just turning fuzzy..."
107855,415,164,695000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, you ate their jerky."
107856,415,165,697000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I thought this might happen, so I brought the best weapon to operate while drugged: a crossbow."
107857,415,166,716000,Truck Driver,Simpson Home,Nooo!
107860,415,169,725000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,Chazz Busby says you're really making progress! Do you need more leg warmers?
107861,415,170,731000,Lisa Simpson,Marge's Car,"No, stop buying me leg warmers! I'm already wearing six pairs!"
107862,415,171,735000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,"Well, the important thing is, someday I'll be watching my little Marge dancing at Lincoln Center."
107863,415,172,741000,Lisa Simpson,Marge's Car,"Lisa, Mom. I'm Lisa."
107864,415,173,743000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,Of course -- you're Lisa. Lisa the dancing Marge girl.
107866,415,175,749000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Dad, you never win a fight with animals. Remember when you lost that war with the worms?"
107867,415,176,754000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"That wasn't a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal."
107868,415,177,756000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Oh yeah? They made you build this statue.
107871,415,178,761000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,When you cut 'em they multiply -- I can't fight that! Now let's take care of those raccoons.
107873,415,180,774000,Homer Simpson,Raccoon Hutch,"Awww, they're using the jerky to feed their family! Look, there's a Homer and a Bart and a Marge and a Lisa. Aww... and they even share my views on parenting!"
107875,415,182,785000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Enjoy your jerky, little critters, and one day you'll grow up to be people. Bart, get some more jerky for man's new best friend."
107877,415,184,802000,Lisa Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,When's our next break?
107878,415,185,804000,Annette,BALLET ACADEMY,When the big cigarette hits nine.
107880,415,187,807000,Chazz Busby,BALLET ACADEMY,"All right -- that was pretty good for uncoordinated hippopotamuses. Hit the river, ladies. Go ahead, have a wallow."
107883,415,190,822000,Lisa Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,What am I doing? I don't need secondhand smoke to do ballet.
107884,415,191,828000,Lisa Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,I need firsthand smoke!
107885,415,192,833000,Homer Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,Lisa!
107886,415,193,835000,Homer Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,Gimme that!
107887,415,194,842000,Homer Simpson,BALLET ACADEMY,I can't believe how easy it is in this country to get cigarettes.
107889,415,196,851000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,I can't believe you were smoking. Do you know the sturgeon general said you're not supposed to?
107890,415,197,857000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,A sturgeon is a fish.
107891,415,198,859000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,And a very wise fish he is!
107893,415,200,864000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I'm taking Lisa out of that stupid-- What the?"
107894,415,201,869000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Homie, I've been so happy lately. I'm completely fulfilled, both as a mother and a fan of youth ballet! Now what did you want to say to me?"
107895,415,202,879000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh... are you sure you want Lisa to keep dancing?
107896,415,203,883000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"There's nothing that makes a mother's heart soar more than seeing her child take wing. Look at me, I'm glowing!"
107897,415,204,890000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe you're drunk.
107898,415,205,891000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, Lisa's dancing has made me really, really, happy."
107899,415,206,900000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay.
107900,415,207,902000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fatherhood hurts my brain.
107869,415,208,905000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad! Dad, a little help?"
107870,415,209,908000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're on your own.
107902,415,210,913000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Because it means so much to your mother, you can keep doing ballet. But you have to stop smoking -- including secondhand!"
107903,415,211,920000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's easy for you to say. You've never had to be thin and focused.
107904,415,212,923000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What'd you say?
107905,415,213,925000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm just saying it's gonna be hard for me to quit, especially before the recital."
107906,415,214,930000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought you might have trouble with this. That's why I'm assigning someone to keep watch over you. Someone you'd never expect.
