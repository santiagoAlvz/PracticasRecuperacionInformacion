98497,379,159,671000,Fat Tony,FAT TONY'S MANSION,Again this Palm Pilot has failed to remind me. I believe this needs to be hot-synced.
98498,379,160,679000,Fat Tony,FAT TONY'S MANSION,What are you doing?
98499,379,161,680000,Louie,FAT TONY'S MANSION,"I thought you meant ""hot-sync"" it. You know how it is with us -- everything means kill."
98501,379,163,685000,Fat Tony,Library,Sit-down item number one: your recent murderous overtures with regard to my person.
98502,379,164,692000,Dante Calabresi,Library,"We meant no disrespect, Fat Tony -- we were simply trying to kill you."
98503,379,165,696000,DANTE JR.,Library,"When we saw you driving that carpool, we figured you'd gone soft, and were therefore whackable."
98504,379,166,701000,Fat Tony,Library,You'd be fools to kill me! For my son Michael would take my place -- and wreak a terrible vengeance.
98506,379,168,708000,Michael,Dining Room,I made soufflés!
98508,379,170,712000,Marge Simpson,Dining Room,"I've tried to make those, but they always end up as brownies."

98510,379,172,724000,Homer Simpson,Dining Room,"Mmm, this must be what angels taste like!"
98511,379,173,728000,Lisa Simpson,Dining Room,"Oh Michael, one bite of this soufflé and your father will realize your gift deserves to flower."
98512,379,174,738000,Homer Simpson,Dining Room,Why can't you do anything?
98514,379,176,742000,Fat Tony,COGNAC ROOM,"So, we are at peace once more. Let us indulge in exaggerated displays of affection!"
98515,379,177,748000,Dante Calabresi,COGNAC ROOM,"This guy, I love him! Get over here!"

98521,379,183,769000,Dante Calabresi,COGNAC ROOM,"My God, this is like a lap-dance for my taste buds!"
98522,379,184,772000,DANTE JR.,COGNAC ROOM,"Yeah, the flavor just drove my sweet tooth to a vacant lot and whacked it."
98524,379,185,777000,Primo,COGNAC ROOM,"Hey kid, what bakery did you boost these from?"
98525,379,186,783000,Michael,COGNAC ROOM,"Well actually, I made them."
98526,379,187,786000,Michael,COGNAC ROOM,"Papa, I want to be a chef."
98528,379,189,790000,Dante Calabresi,COGNAC ROOM,"A chef, huh?! Hey, look what we got here, it's Chef Boy-ar-gay!"
98529,379,190,795000,DANTE JR.,COGNAC ROOM,What's he gonna do if we rub you out? Serve our soup cold?
98531,379,192,800000,Michael,COGNAC ROOM,"Well, Gazpacho is served cold. So take that."
98533,379,194,807000,Dante Calabresi,COGNAC ROOM,"Hey Tony, catch you later. Your kid's got a bright future... catering your funeral."
98534,379,195,813000,DANTE JR.,COGNAC ROOM,You know what I like? Those little baby hot dogs. Do they small down big ones or do they make 'em different?
98535,379,196,825000,Fat Tony,COGNAC ROOM,"Michael, you have made me appear weak in the eyes of my enemies."
98536,379,197,829000,Lisa Simpson,COGNAC ROOM,"Fat Tony, it's not important what other people think of you. What matters is how you feel, inside!"
98537,379,198,842000,Michael,COGNAC ROOM,Papa!
98540,379,201,854000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,"Your father's gonna be absolutely fine in about three months... but for now he can't talk, write or blink."
98541,379,202,862000,Johnny Tightlips,Hospital Room,"With Fat Tony doin' the morphine mambo, the Calabresis are gonna try to put him down for a dirt nap."
98542,379,203,866000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Room,"Dirt nap, eh? Hm..."
98545,379,206,873000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Homer, our house is on fire! Help me save the children!"
98546,379,207,875000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Sorry, Marge, can't hear ya!"
98548,379,209,882000,Michael,HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM,What am I gonna do now?
98549,379,210,884000,Johnny Tightlips,HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM,"Kid, the only way you're gonna live to grow shprazoot on your abonjoola is if you take your dad's place. Let's go."
98550,379,211,891000,Louie,HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM,"Hey, can we go by the Lexus place? I wanna test drive that new hybrid."
98551,379,212,895000,Johnny Tightlips,HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM,"You are a hybrid: half idiot, half moron."
98552,379,213,898000,Louie,HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM,Whoa! Where did that come from? Whoa!
98553,379,214,901000,Michael,HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM,I don't know what to do.
