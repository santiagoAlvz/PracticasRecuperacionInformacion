114758,443,70,469000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I never wanted her to get fired.
114759,443,71,471000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I bet it was that hamster medicine we added that put her over the edge.
114760,443,72,476000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Maybe I should tell Skinner that it was our...

114772,443,84,517000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought you were studying the Lincoln-Douglas debates?
114773,443,85,520000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean the L-man-D-dog flame wars?

114776,443,88,528000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, no worries. I heard on the four-square court she's doin' great."

114752,443,95,562000,Zack,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Yes, you have. What are these?"
114783,443,96,566000,Milhouse Van Houten,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Those are smiley stickers. Mrs. Krabappel used to put them on our papers as a reward for good work.
114784,443,97,571000,Zack,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,I run a paperless classroom. Check this out.
114785,443,98,574000,Milhouse Van Houten,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"But, this is just nonsense punctuation."
114786,443,99,581000,Milhouse Van Houten,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Oh my God!
114787,443,100,582000,Zack,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Anybody want to return these caveman kudos to Mrs. Krabappel?
114788,443,101,587000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,Oh sure... it's sorta on my way home. I can check up on the old girl. She probably landed a job at some fancy-schmancy prep school.

114808,443,121,665000,Bart Simpson,KRABAPPEL'S APT.,"Well, that's better than me. But still, you've gotta get out."

114814,443,127,691000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Classroom,I'm not asking for A's. Just incompletes.
114815,443,128,694000,Zack,Bart's Classroom,"Mr. Simpson, I don't need your money. Bart can definitely be a challenge, but I like challenges. And he... he's got a wild sense of humor. Look at this picture he drew:"
114817,443,130,705000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Classroom,It will be his last birthday if he keeps drawing pictures like this.
114818,443,131,708000,Zack,Bart's Classroom,What?
114819,443,132,708000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Classroom,"I said, are there any areas that we, his parents, can improve upon?"
114820,443,133,712000,Zack,Bart's Classroom,Yes. Just one: relax. You're clearly a caring father.
114821,443,134,720000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Classroom,You're the first teacher that ever got me.

114828,443,141,754000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bookaccino's,But we can't lose Zack! Look at the awesome video he just emailed me.
114829,443,142,758000,Zack,Bookaccino's,Check out the multiples of seven y'all.

114831,443,144,771000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bookaccino's,Maybe we can find an answer in this bookstore.
114832,443,145,774000,Bart Simpson,Bookaccino's,Bookstores don't have answers. They just have creepy guys sitting in easy chairs at the end of aisleways.
114833,443,146,778000,Moe Szyslak,Bookaccino's,"I ain't paid for Doris Kearns Goodwin in my life and I ain't gonna start now. Oh, that's some good Doris there."
114834,443,147,786000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bookaccino's,You're right. I guess no one's ever written a book to help a middle-aged woman turn her life around.

114840,443,152,816000,Australian Woman,Bookaccino's,"""The Answer"" was discovered by the philosophers of ancient Greece, who hid it under a rock where it was discovered by the knights of King Arthur, who placed it in a bottle and set it in the ocean, where it was found by Pat Sajak."
114841,443,153,832000,Australian Woman,Bookaccino's,These great men knew the answer:
114842,443,154,840000,Australian Woman,Bookaccino's,The Answer is the secret to achieving your heart's desire.

114849,443,161,867000,Bart Simpson,KRABAPPEL'S APT.,This book uses the ancient power of wanting.
114850,443,162,867000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,KRABAPPEL'S APT.,That makes absolutely no sense.
114851,443,163,871000,Bart Simpson,KRABAPPEL'S APT.,"Hey... ""Just because we don't understand electricity, doesn't mean we can't enjoy its benefits."""
114852,443,164,871000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,KRABAPPEL'S APT.,But we do understand electricity. Every positively charged nucleus is--
114853,443,165,881000,Bart Simpson,KRABAPPEL'S APT.,Cut it out. You're not a teacher anymore.
114854,443,166,883000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,KRABAPPEL'S APT.,"Way to cheer me up, kid."

114858,443,170,896000,Bart Simpson,MRS. KRABAPPEL'S APT.,"So, did you write your dream on the index card of fate?"
114859,443,171,901000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,MRS. KRABAPPEL'S APT.,Yes. But it still seems stupid.
114860,443,172,906000,Bart Simpson,MRS. KRABAPPEL'S APT.,I want to own a muffin store. Great idea! Now let's see...
114861,443,173,912000,Bart Simpson,MRS. KRABAPPEL'S APT.,"""Break your dream down into smaller 'wishes,' then break those down into 'wish-able actions.'"""
114862,443,174,912000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,MRS. KRABAPPEL'S APT.,"Bart, this is starting to sound like one of those loony self-help books."
114863,443,175,921000,Bart Simpson,MRS. KRABAPPEL'S APT.,Loony? Would a loony self-help book come with a magic question mark inside?
114864,443,176,926000,Bart Simpson,MRS. KRABAPPEL'S APT.,Eh? Eh? Eh?
114753,443,178,930000,Bart Simpson,Edna's Edibles,"All thanks to... ""The Answer""!"
114866,443,179,933000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Edna's Edibles,"Well, opening this store was a lot of work. But your faith in me got me through it. And it looks like you've got your own index card of fate. What's your dream?"

114873,443,186,962000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Edna's Edibles,"Well, thanks again, Bart -- this store has definitely turned my life around."
114874,443,187,966000,Bart Simpson,Edna's Edibles,Yep. I'm off the hook now.
114875,443,188,968000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Edna's Edibles,What do you mean by that?

114879,443,192,985000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Edna's Edibles,You did what?!
114880,443,193,987000,Bart Simpson,Edna's Edibles,Please don't kill me.
114882,443,195,994000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Edna's Edibles,You ruined my life! It's your fault I have to work at this stupid muffin store.
114883,443,196,998000,Bart Simpson,Edna's Edibles,But this place was your dream!
114884,443,197,1000000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Edna's Edibles,"My real dream was to be a teacher -- and you got me fired! Now I'm up to my eyeballs in debt with this stupid store, and four more muffin stores just opened on this block!"
114885,443,198,1017000,Bart Simpson,Edna's Edibles,Noooo!
114886,443,199,1019000,Bart Simpson,Edna's Edibles,"But-but-but, you found ""The Answer!"""
114887,443,200,1024000,Bart Simpson,Edna's Edibles,Nooo! I wrote a phone number in there!
114888,443,201,1026000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Edna's Edibles,"No matter what you've done, I always thought there was a spark of decency in you, Bart Simpson. But I was wrong. I never thought I'd say this to a child, but you are bad on the inside."
114891,443,204,1044000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Dad... am I bad on the inside?
114892,443,205,1046000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,No... but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center.
114893,443,206,1051000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"But you think there's like a kernel of good inside me, right?"
114895,443,207,1055000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Hm, I don't know -- kernels are kind of big."
114896,443,208,1058000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Listen... I was thinking...if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher... and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back, would it be okay?"
114897,443,209,1071000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"When you say ""teacher,"" do you really mean ""parent?"""
114898,443,210,1074000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"No, I mean teacher."
114899,443,211,1076000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Great. Go nuts. But remember, we never had this discussion."
114900,443,212,1080000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,What discussion?
114901,443,213,1082000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"The one we just had about you doing bad things, you stupid kid! Ohhh."
114905,443,217,1113000,Bart Simpson,Skinner's Office,"...so you see, it was my fault. I got Mrs. Krabappel drunk. And then I was gonna do the same thing to Zack, but I decided it was better to just tell the truth."
114906,443,218,1120000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Bart, you deserve a reward for telling the truth, and that reward will be in the form of a severe punishment."
114907,443,219,1127000,Bart Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Doesn't matter, as long as Edna gets her job back."
114908,443,220,1130000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Sorry, Bart. But I can't just get rid of a teacher if he's doing a good job. Or an adequate job. Or just shows up and doesn't touch anyone."
114909,443,221,1138000,Zack,Skinner's Office,I hate child-ren! I hate child-ren! Chil-dren suck! Chil-dren suck!
114910,443,222,1144000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,What the-- faculty lounge talk out in the halls?
114911,443,223,1150000,Zack,Skinner's Office,Who do I hate? I hate--

114915,443,227,1166000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,I didn't. I swear!
114916,443,228,1168000,Zack,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"No, he's right. I mixed a little vodka in with my Blue Bronco."
114917,443,229,1171000,Zack,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,Does anybody else want to ride the Indigo pony!
114918,443,230,1176000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,Is there extra credit in it?

114924,443,236,1198000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,It's always the good ones that go crazy the fastest.
114925,443,237,1201000,Zack,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Get off me! You can get rid of me, but you can't get rid of the truth, man! This school is a glorified hamster wheel run by incompetent bureaucrats who can get you through a test -- but you will fail the test of life!"
114926,443,238,1213000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Children! Fingers in your ears and makes the ""la-la"" sound."
114927,443,239,1215000,Zack,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Every class is a joke. English, a joke! Homeroom, a joke! Free period, a joke! Nutritious lunch, a joke!"

114929,443,241,1224000,Zack,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,Only alcohol can make life bearable! You must drink! Always drink!
114931,443,243,1232000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Well, class, I've gotta say I'm glad to be back."

114933,443,245,1235000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Nope. Now, everyone enjoy one of my yummy muffins."
114934,443,246,1242000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,But it's stale.
