53095,222,9,111000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm serious. You never finished painting the garage.
53096,222,10,116000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And you could at least get that snake out of the piano...
53097,222,11,130000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fine. I'll drop everything I'm doing just for you. But you'll have to live with the guilt of ruining my Saturday. Can you live with that, Marge? Huh? Can ya?"

53109,222,23,180000,Seymour Skinner,Hardware Store,"Edna, look. A dimmer switch could ratchet up the romance in our love nest."
53110,222,24,185000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Hardware Store,You mean the janitor's closet? Ha!
53112,222,25,188000,Seymour Skinner,Hardware Store,"What's the matter, Edna? Lately you just say ""Ha!"" to everything."

53117,222,30,210000,Tv Handyman,Hardware Store,"But today I'm here as a ""tool"" of Global Dynamics Corp. You know, installing your own barbecue pit is no harder than adding an aviary, or Olympic-sized swimming pool. In fact, it's a snap!"
53118,222,31,220000,Tv Handyman,Hardware Store,Or if you're not into chicken...
53119,222,32,225000,Homer Simpson,Hardware Store,"No, no, I'm into chicken."

53138,222,51,305000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why?! Why must life be so hard? Why must I fail in every attempt at masonry?

53165,222,80,427000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll handle this.

53167,222,82,437000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah? Prove it.
53168,222,83,439000,Astrid Weller,Simpson Home,"That's your license plate, isn't it?"
53169,222,84,443000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh... All right! Just go ahead and sue me. Everybody else does! The average settlement is $68,000."
53170,222,85,453000,Astrid Weller,Simpson Home,I'm not here to sue you. My name is Astrid Weller. I own an art gallery and I'd love to display your piece.
53171,222,86,462000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean this hunka junk? This isn't art. Just a barbecue that pushed me over the edge. Didn't you? Didn't you?! You stupid so...
53172,222,87,471000,Astrid Weller,Simpson Home,"Art isn't just pretty pictures. It's an expression of raw human emotion. In your case, rage."
53173,222,88,478000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I got that, lady."
53174,222,89,480000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Is everything okay? I got worried when I didn't hear any shots.
53175,222,90,484000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This lady says I'm an artist.
53176,222,91,486000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You, an artist?"
53177,222,92,488000,Astrid Weller,Simpson Home,"Your husband's work is what we call ""Outsider Art."" It could be by a mental patient or a hillbilly or a chimpanzee."
53178,222,93,497000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"In high school I was voted ""Most Likely to be a Mental Patient, Hillbilly, or Chimpanzee!"""
53179,222,94,497000,Astrid Weller,Simpson Home,"Well, you should be very excited, because outsider art couldn't be hotter."
53180,222,95,508000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,So you'd better catch the fever. Catch it...
53183,222,98,521000,Lisa Simpson,GALLERY,"Dad, chew with your mouth closed. You're losing your mystique."
53184,222,99,525000,Homer Simpson,GALLERY,"Lisa, all great artists love free food. Check out Jasper Johns."
53185,222,100,531000,Jasper Johns,GALLERY,"You squeal on me, I'll kill you."
53186,222,101,534000,Marge Simpson,GALLERY,"Hmm, I don't know. I studied art for years, but I just don't get this."
53187,222,102,540000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,Sounds like somebody's jealous.
53188,222,103,543000,Marge Simpson,GALLERY,No I'm not. I just can't believe some people are paying hundreds of dollars for something a hillbilly pulled out of the trash.
53189,222,104,551000,Cletus Spuckler,GALLERY,"Hey, I done studied for years on how to get over that junkyard fence! Then I learnt the gate was open."
53190,222,105,560000,C. Montgomery Burns,GALLERY,"Smithers, I think I'm in love!"
53191,222,106,560000,C. Montgomery Burns,GALLERY,With this sculpture!
53192,222,107,566000,Waylon Smithers,GALLERY,"Sir, that's by Homer Simpson. I don't think you want to buy it."
53193,222,108,570000,C. Montgomery Burns,GALLERY,"Smithers, years ago, I blew the chance to buy Picasso's ""Guernica"" for a song. Luckily, that song was ""White Christmas,"" and by hanging onto it, I made billions."
53194,222,109,580000,C. Montgomery Burns,GALLERY,"Anyway, I love this hideous thing. Young lady, I'll take it!"
53195,222,110,585000,Astrid Weller,GALLERY,"Congratulations, Homer -- you're now a professional artist!"
53196,222,111,590000,Homer Simpson,GALLERY,"Woo hoo! Look, Marge, my first sale! In your face, Jasper Johns!"
53197,222,112,605000,Jasper Johns,GALLERY,Huh?
53200,222,114,605000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Where are you going with that junk, Dad?"
53201,222,115,607000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm gonna be an outsider artist! That way, I can turn all these old baseball cards, Disney memorabilia, and antiques into something valuable."
53202,222,116,614000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I'm really happy you sold your sculpture -- but don't you think it may have been a fluke?"
53203,222,117,620000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I've always had an interest in art, dating back to my schoolgirl days when I painted portrait after portrait of Ringo Starr."
53204,222,118,627000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's my life you're describing.
53205,222,119,629000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I think I remember my own life, Marge."
53206,222,120,633000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Astrid said the key to my art is anger. But you know me, I'm Mister Mellow."
53207,222,121,639000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So I'm giving you kids permission to get me mad. C'mon, gimme what you got."
53208,222,122,643000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if it'll help - Um, Mom found out her engagement ring is made of rock candy."
53209,222,123,651000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good work, honey. Keep it comin'."
53210,222,124,653000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm flunkin' math, and the other day I was a little attracted to Milhouse."
53213,222,127,663000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, this is Astrid, my ""dealer."" And these are my fans, Gunter, Kyoto, and Cecil Hampstead-on-Cecil-Cecil."
53214,222,128,670000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"So, uh, you guys are Eurotrash, huh? How's that, uh, workin' out for ya?"
53215,222,129,674000,Gunter,Moe's Tavern,"Eh, to be honest, we are adrift in a sea of decadent luxury and meaningless sex."
53216,222,130,681000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Uh-huh. So, ah, where might this sea be located?"
53217,222,131,686000,Cecil Terwilliger,Moe's Tavern,I must get back to my hotel and practice my affectations for tomorrow. Bon soir.
53218,222,132,691000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"What do we owe you, Moe?"
53219,222,133,693000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Nothin', nothin'. Just gimme a priceless sketch with a certificate of authenticity."
53220,222,134,697000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,All right.
53221,222,135,699000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, Moe, can I pay with a drawing?"
53222,222,136,702000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, nice try there, Twelve-Step."
53225,222,139,710000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, Homer, you're, uh, makin' us a little bit uncomfortable."
53226,222,140,713000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Relax, big guy. He's just doin' this for his art, right Homer?"
52455,222,141,717000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh yeah... art.
52850,222,143,722000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why won't you be art?!
53227,222,144,725000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here he is. This is where the... ""magic"" happens."
53228,222,145,729000,Astrid Weller,Simpson Home,"Wonderful news, Homer."
53229,222,146,731000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Is it about pies?
53230,222,147,732000,Astrid Weller,Simpson Home,"Uh, no. We're going to hold a show devoted entirely to you."
53231,222,148,738000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow. It's like Marge's dream come true... for me! Isn't that great, Marge?! For me!"
53233,222,150,749000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look Marge, they're advertising my show in ""Art in America."" It's the first time I've been mentioned there, that I know of."
53234,222,151,756000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm happy for you. Now g'night.
53235,222,152,758000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Good night.
53236,222,153,760000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're upset about something. Is this about that trip Barney and I took to Machu Picchu?
53237,222,154,765000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Homer, being an artist was my dream. But now, without even trying, you've accomplished more in a week than I have in my whole life."
53238,222,155,774000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, honey, I've always liked your art. Your paintings look like the things they look like."
53239,222,156,780000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's sweet, but, well, how would you like it if I, I don't know, entered a belching contest?"
53240,222,157,786000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Frankly, I'd be a little turned on."
53241,222,158,789000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't understand.
53242,222,159,791000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I've screwed up everything I've ever done. I mean, look at Bart. But I finally found something where people worship me for screwing up. And that feels pretty good."
53243,222,160,803000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I guess nothing else matters as long as you're happy."
53244,222,161,806000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now you're making sense. Good night.
53247,222,164,821000,The Rich Texan,Art Gallery,And now for a Rembrandt...
53248,222,165,821000,Astrid Weller,Art Gallery,"Homer is the most dangerous artist on the Springfield scene. Now, let's see what surprises he has for us tonight."
53249,222,166,835000,Homer Simpson,Art Gallery,"I give you ""Botched Hibachi."" The tricycle is on loan from the Maggie Simpson collection."
53250,222,167,840000,Homer Simpson,Art Gallery,"This piece I call ""Failed Shelving Unit with Stupid Stuck Chainsaw and Applesauce."""
53251,222,168,840000,Homer Simpson,Art Gallery,"And finally, my thing de resistance, ""Attempted Birdhouse I."""
53252,222,169,849000,Homer Simpson,Art Gallery,"Shall we start the bidding at, say, ten thousand dollars?"
53253,222,170,863000,Homer Simpson,Art Gallery,"All right, how about a million?"
53254,222,171,866000,Moe Szyslak,Art Gallery,"I'll give you two bucks for the bird, if it's still alive."
53255,222,172,871000,Homer Simpson,Art Gallery,What's going on here? You weirdos love this stuff.
53256,222,173,874000,Astrid Weller,Art Gallery,"Homer, I'm afraid they only love what's new and shocking. These pieces are just like your earlier work."
53257,222,174,880000,Gunter,Art Gallery,You've gone from hip to boring. Why don't you call us when you get to kitsch.
53258,222,175,887000,Cecil Terwilliger,Art Gallery,"Come on, Gunter, Kyoto. If we hurry we can still catch the heroin craze."
53259,222,176,892000,Homer Simpson,Art Gallery,"Wait! Come back! I'm a God to you! Worship me -- or fear my wrath! Please fear my wrath, please... Call me."
53261,222,178,908000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't get it. Why don't people like my art anymore?
53262,222,179,912000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I know you worked hard, but all of your... things were kind of the same."
53263,222,180,917000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Ray J. Johnson never changed his act and he's more popular now than he's ever been."
53264,222,181,922000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Who?
53265,222,182,923000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You can call him Ray / Or you can call him J. / Or you can call him Ray J. / But you doesn't have to call him...
53266,222,183,930000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm sick of him already.
53267,222,184,931000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"The point is, great artists are always trying new things, like Michelangelo or Shaquille O'Neal. You just need some inspiration."
53270,222,187,942000,Marge Simpson,Museum,It's so exciting to do something cultural together.
53271,222,188,946000,Homer Simpson,Museum,Matt Groening? What's he doing in a museum? He can barely draw.
53272,222,189,951000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"Ow! Oh no, I'm being erased!"
53273,222,190,954000,Workman,Museum,"Move it, bub!"
53274,222,191,955000,Workman,Museum,We got an installation to installate.
53275,222,192,958000,Marge Simpson,Museum,A Claes Oldenburg. He's a European who defied convention and embraced American popular culture.
53276,222,193,967000,Homer Simpson,Museum,He must be a hundred feet tall.
53277,222,194,971000,Marge Simpson,Museum,"Now this is a Joseph Turner. In an era when everyone else painted portraits, he broke away by painting the Venetian Canals."
53278,222,195,980000,Homer Simpson,Museum,It's glorious! The streets are paved with water. You could ride a walrus to work!
53280,222,196,985000,Marge Simpson,Museum,"And Picasso started out painting realistically, then moved on to cubism. By the end of his life, he was just painting crank letters to the editor. They call it his ""angry jerk"" period."
53281,222,197,999000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"Mmmm, split-pea."
53282,222,198,1001000,Homer Simpson,Museum,With ham!

53284,222,200,1005000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"No, these guys are geniuses. I could never think of something like soup or a pencil."
53285,222,201,1012000,Homer Simpson,Museum,I'm just gonna rest for a minute.
53286,222,202,1025000,Homer Simpson,Museum,What the?! Who the?! Hey!
53288,222,204,1032000,Homer Simpson,Museum,Ow! Ah! No! Ow! Ow! Hey! Ow! Ow! You're mean.
53289,222,205,1037000,Cubist Musician,Museum,"Hasta la vista, baby."
53291,222,207,1047000,Homer Simpson,Museum,Eww...
53293,222,209,1052000,Andy Warhol,Museum,"Soup's on, fat boy!"
53294,222,210,1058000,Homer Simpson,Museum,Ow! Hey! No! No! Ow! N-No! Ow!
53295,222,211,1058000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"No, no, Andy, no!"
53296,222,212,1061000,Marge Simpson,Museum,Homer... Homer...
53297,222,213,1063000,Homer Simpson,Museum,Marge! Why does Art hate me? I never did anything to Art.
53298,222,214,1068000,Homer Simpson,Museum,"Oh, let's get out of here."
53300,222,216,1071000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Dad, if the museum didn't inspire you, maybe you should do something really radical, like Christo."
53301,222,217,1077000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Is he that jerk that revealed the magicians' secrets?
53302,222,218,1080000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Christo is a conceptual artist who does huge outdoor projects. He once wrapped the Reichstag in plastic."
53303,222,219,1087000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Not the Reichstag!
53304,222,220,1089000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, yes, and he also set up hundreds of yellow umbrellas along the California highway..."
53305,222,221,1093000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why'd he do that?
53306,222,222,1095000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"To make the world a more magical place, I guess. Although they did blow over and kill some people."
53307,222,223,1100000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Killer umbrellas? Of course. Exquisite.
53308,222,224,1105000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Dad, no. My point is you have to do something big and daring."
53309,222,225,1109000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Big? Daring? Lisa, that's it! I've got an idea for a wonderful art project that'll make everyone love me again. Step one: steal all the doormats in town."
53279,222,227,1120000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Streets,"Hit the road, ""Welcome Home."""
53311,222,228,1120000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"Adios, ""Casa de Flanders."""
53312,222,229,1120000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Streets,"See you in hell, ""God Bless This House."""
53313,222,230,1120000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"So long, The Simpsons!"
53315,222,232,1133000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Zoo,Step two: snorkel the animals.
53316,222,233,1140000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Zoo,"It wasn't easy, but I got all the grizzlies."
53317,222,234,1143000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Zoo,Great. I'll do the pony while you do the lions.
53318,222,235,1146000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Zoo,Make sure you strap 'em on real tight.
53320,222,237,1149000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"Now, step three..."
53321,222,238,1152000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Streets,"Are you sure this is art, not vandalism?"
53322,222,239,1155000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"That's for the courts to decide, son."
53325,222,242,1164000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wake up! Wake up, Springfield!"
53326,222,243,1167000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've got a surprise for youuu!
53327,222,244,1170000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh Lord. What now?
53328,222,245,1173000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that can't be good."

53330,222,247,1179000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, what have you done?"
53331,222,248,1181000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's conceptual art -- the Grand Canals of Springfield. Just like Venice without the black plague. What do you think?
53332,222,249,1188000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I think some people are going to be upset.
53333,222,250,1191000,Astrid Weller,Simpson Home,"I love it, Homer. You've turned this town into a work of art. I just wish Jasper Johns hadn't stolen my boat..."
53334,222,251,1200000,Jasper Johns,Simpson Home,"So long, suckers."
53335,222,252,1201000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, they're in the business. Real people might not be so understanding."
53336,222,253,1206000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,What the flood?!
53337,222,254,1208000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Maude, it's a miracle! The Lord has drowned the wicked and spared the righteous!"
53338,222,255,1215000,Maude Flanders,Simpson Home,Isn't that Homer Simpson?
53339,222,256,1216000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Looks like Heaven's easier to get into than Arizona State.
53341,222,258,1222000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Ohhh, I hate these flood pants."
53342,222,259,1229000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Hey, they're working! My feet are soaked, but my cuffs are bone dry! Everything's comin' up Milhouse!"
52000,222,261,1240000,Burn Victims,Springfield,Ahhhh.
53344,222,263,1254000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Streets,"Edna, I'm gonna pop you a question and... I hope the answer is yes."
53345,222,264,1260000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Streets,Do you think Mother would like this hat pin?
53346,222,265,1262000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Streets,Oh. Yes.
53347,222,266,1264000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Streets,"Oh, you've made me the happiest man on earth."

53350,222,269,1284000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I'm just a nut who couldn't build a barbecue. You'll always be the artist in the family."
53351,222,270,1290000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Ohh...
53352,222,271,1292000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Is that our house?

53355,222,274,1293000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's us.
53356,222,275,1296000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Are we kissing?
53357,222,276,1298000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, I don't know. Could be. I need some inspiration."
