18026,94,18,113000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Homer's Hospital Room,"Well, sir, Homer's illness was either caused by ingesting spoiled food or uh, some sort of voodoo curse."
18027,94,19,129000,Patty Bouvier,Homer's Hospital Room,"Hey, we've just been workin' the eyes."
18029,94,21,134000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Your old meat made me sick!
18030,94,22,137000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,I'm so sorry. Please accept five pounds of frozen shrimp.
18031,94,23,140000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,This shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.
18032,94,24,145000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Okay, ten pounds."
18033,94,25,145000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Woo hoo!
17938,94,28,147000,Announcer,Simpson Home,Brought to you by...
17970,94,30,147000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That dog can sell anything.
18036,94,31,166000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Good evening. Here's an update on last week's nursing home expose: ""Geezers in Freezers."" It turns out the rest home was adequately heated, the footage you saw was of a fur storage facility. We've also been told to apologize for using the term ""Geezers."" Now coming up next, ""The Case of the Cantankerous Old Geezer."""
18037,94,32,176000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ooh. Rancid meat attack. Stupid parasites. Is there no way I can find justice?
18038,94,33,192000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"If you have a consumer complaint, just call this number..."
18039,94,34,196000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bor-ing.
18040,94,35,196000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, you should blow the whistle on the Kwik-E-Mart."
18041,94,36,199000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,...and now a message from the Church of Latter Day Saints.
18043,94,38,202000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, are you listening to me?"
18044,94,39,202000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Shhhh, Lisa. The dog is barking."
18046,94,41,210000,Kent Brockman,CHANNEL 6 TV STATION,"All right, are you willing to go undercover to nail this creep?"
18047,94,42,213000,Homer Simpson,CHANNEL 6 TV STATION,"No way, man No way, man. Get yourself another patsy, man. No way am I wearing a freakin' wire."
18048,94,43,218000,Kent Brockman,CHANNEL 6 TV STATION,"All right, all right, all right. Would you be willing to wear a hidden camera and microphone?"
18049,94,44,221000,Homer Simpson,CHANNEL 6 TV STATION,"Oh, that I'll wear."
18052,94,47,227000,Kent Brockman,THE VAN,We've come up with a camera so tiny it fits into this oversized novelty hat.
18053,94,48,231000,Kent Brockman,THE VAN,"Now, go get us some incriminating footage. And remember, you have to get in and out in ten minutes, or you'll suffer permanent neck damage."
18054,94,49,231000,Technician,THE VAN,He's not kiddin'.
18056,94,51,242000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Don't be alarmed, Apu. Just go about your daily routine like I'm not wearing the hat."
18057,94,52,261000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Your headgear seems to be emitting a buzzing noise, sir. Perhaps you have a bee in your bonnet."
18058,94,53,267000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Bee? Aah!
18060,94,55,267000,Kent Brockman,Van,"Homer, that hat's been with the station for twenty years. He had one day left 'til retirement."
18061,94,56,280000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Van,"La, la, la, la, la."
18062,94,57,280000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Van,"Well, time to replenish the hot dog roller."
18063,94,58,284000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Van,"La, la, l- Oop."
17996,94,59,289000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Van,"Oh no, it is encrusted with filth."
18064,94,60,292000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Van,"Oh, well... let's sell it anyway."
18065,94,61,295000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Van,"Now this is just between me and you, smashed hat."
18066,94,62,295000,Kent Brockman,Van,"Hot diggity dog! We've got him, Mr. Simpson. Now lets -- Mr. Simpson?"
18067,94,63,306000,Homer Simpson,Van,One hot dog please.
18070,94,66,308000,Kent Brockman,Simpsons,"Apu, will you ever stop selling spoiled meat?"
18071,94,67,314000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpsons,"No! I mean, yes! I mean... uh-oh."
18073,94,69,317000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,I think I come off very well.
18074,94,70,317000,Woman,Kwik-E-Mart,"Monster! Run, children!"
18075,94,71,322000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,"Apu Nahasapeemapetilan, you have disgraced the Kwik-E-Mart corporation."
18076,94,72,328000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"But sir, I was only following standard procedure."
18077,94,73,330000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,"Ah, true. But it's also standard procedure to blame any problems on a scapegoat, or ""sacrificial lamb."""
18078,94,74,336000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Uh huh. And if I can obtain for you these animals...
18079,94,75,339000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,"I'm sorry, Apu, I have no choice. You can no longer wear this name patch."
18081,94,77,341000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,And you can no longer tell people about our fried pickles.
18082,94,78,348000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,Now turn in your pricing gun.
18083,94,79,352000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Ooh.
18084,94,80,356000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,The other one too.
18085,94,81,363000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Fired after all these years of loyal service. I don't want to live anymore!
18086,94,82,368000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,Give me that wiener.
18087,94,83,371000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"No, I don't want to live, sir."
18088,94,84,371000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,"Give me that wiener! No, Apu, it's not worth it!"
18090,94,86,376000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Bridge,What do I do now? I've been drummed out of my profession. I am a disgrace.
18091,94,87,383000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Bridge,Even this babbling brook sounds almost like mocking laughter.
18092,94,88,387000,Bum #1,Bridge,Who needs money when we got feathers?
18095,94,91,405000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Springfield,This is all because of Homer Simpson.
18097,94,93,416000,Comedian,Simpson Home,"Yo, check this out. Black guys drive a car like this. Yeah, but white guys, see they drive a car like this."
18098,94,94,419000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's true, it's true. We're so lame."
18099,94,95,432000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,It is time to settle the score.
18102,94,98,440000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, don't kill me! I didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! I was unaware! I WAS UNAWAAARE!"
18103,94,99,462000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"Mr. Simpson, you misunderstand me. In my village this is the traditional pose of apology."
18104,94,100,468000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh.
18105,94,101,468000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,"You know, now that I think about it, it may be a little confusing. Many have died needlessly. I have come to make amends. At first I blamed you for squealing, but then I realized it was I who wronged you. So I have come to work off my debt. I am at your service."
18106,94,102,484000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're selling what now?
18107,94,103,487000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,I am selling only the concept of karmic realignment.
18108,94,104,490000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You can't sell that. Karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos.
18109,94,105,494000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,He's got me there.
18111,94,107,498000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Is he still out there?
18112,94,108,498000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, he's raking leaves."
18113,94,109,502000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What? That's your job. If he starts doing Lisa's wood chopping...
18114,94,110,506000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"If he wants to make it up to you so badly, I think you should let him."
18115,94,111,509000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, okay I'll let him. But then I get a chipwich, okay?"
18117,94,113,513000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpsons,"It is an honor to begin repaying my debt to you. Back in Rhamatpur, I was considered quite the gourmet."
18118,94,114,520000,Marge Simpson,Simpsons,It certainly is exotic.
18119,94,115,524000,Marge Simpson,Simpsons,"Lisa, is that too spicy for you?"
18120,94,116,526000,Lisa Simpson,Simpsons,I can see through time.
18121,94,117,528000,Homer Simpson,Simpsons,"Stop being such babies. You can't be afraid to try new things. For instance, tonight I'm using a... Apu, what do you call this thing again?"
18122,94,118,537000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpsons,A napkin.
18123,94,119,537000,Homer Simpson,Simpsons,Outrageous.
18125,94,121,543000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,"Alright, why do you want to become part of the Kwik-E-Mart family?"
18126,94,122,547000,Barney Gumble,Kwik-E-Mart,"Because I like people, and I need a place where I'll be out of the sun."
17186,94,123,550000,Female Executive,Kwik-E-Mart,Thank you.
18127,94,124,550000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hm, he's head and shoulders above everyone else."
18128,94,125,555000,Female Executive,Kwik-E-Mart,Wait. There's one more applicant.
18129,94,126,555000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,Name?
18130,94,127,558000,James Woods,Kwik-E-Mart,James Woods.
18131,94,128,558000,Female Executive,Kwik-E-Mart,Previous job experience?
18132,94,129,561000,James Woods,Kwik-E-Mart,"Ooh, uh, ""True Believer,"" uh, ""Salvador,"" ""Onion Field,"" ""The Hard Way..."""
18133,94,130,566000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,"Wait, wait a minute -- those aren't convenience stores. That sounds like the resume of a Hollywood movie star."
18134,94,131,568000,James Woods,Kwik-E-Mart,Well.
18135,94,132,572000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,James Woods!
18136,94,133,574000,Female Executive,Kwik-E-Mart,Why would you want to work at a Kwik-E-Mart?
18137,94,134,577000,James Woods,Kwik-E-Mart,"Well, to be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm gonna be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and you know, I, kinda like to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, ""True Believer,"" I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then the film ""Chaplin,"" I had a little cameo in that, I actually traveled in time back to the 1920s where... I've, uh, said too much."
18138,94,135,596000,Manager,Kwik-E-Mart,Welcome aboard.
18141,94,138,605000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Bathroom,"Good morning, sir!"
18143,94,140,605000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Bathroom,"Relax, please. You do not have anything I have not seen before. What the...?"
18144,94,141,612000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Bathroom,"Uh, I like to keep a lollipop there."
18146,94,143,617000,Marge Simpson,Simpsons,"Apu, We usually store our cans in the cupboard."
18147,94,144,617000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpsons,"Well, they'll never move that way."
18148,94,145,625000,Lisa Simpson,Simpsons,Mmm corn. Haven't had that in awhile.
18149,94,146,628000,Bart Simpson,Simpsons,"Yeah, delicious corn."
18150,94,147,630000,Lisa Simpson,Simpsons,Bye!
18151,94,148,630000,Marge Simpson,Simpsons,"Hmm. Oh, we're low on milk for Maggie. You wanna come with me to the Kwik-E-Mart?"
18152,94,149,637000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpsons,"Please, Mrs. Simpson. I... I can not go there. That is the scene of my spiritual depantsing."
18153,94,150,644000,Marge Simpson,Simpsons,"Well, I guess we could go to that new Monstromart..."
18155,94,152,651000,Marge Simpson,Monstromart,Ooh. That's a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg.
18156,94,153,661000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Monstromart,Great selection and rock bottom prices. But where is the love?
18157,94,154,666000,Announcer,Monstromart,Attention Monstromart shoppers. Just a reminder that we love each and every one of you.
18158,94,155,676000,Barney Gumble,Monstromart,"Excuse me, ma'am, where are the lampshades? Ma'am?"
18159,94,156,683000,Barney Gumble,Monstromart,"Oh, I've killed her. It's all happening again."
18160,94,157,694000,Stockboy,Monstromart,"Help me! Help m-- Mmm, it's crantastic!"
18161,94,158,705000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Monstromart,"Oh, Mrs. Simpson, the Express Line is the fastest line - not always. That old man up front, he is starved for attention. He will talk the cashier's head off."
18162,94,159,715000,Grampa Simpson,Monstromart,"Ah, there's an interesting story behind this nickel. In 1957, I remember it was. I got up in the morning and made myself a piece of toast. I set the toaster to ""three,"" medium brown..."
18163,94,160,733000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Monstromart,Let's go to that line.
18164,94,161,733000,Marge Simpson,Monstromart,But that's the longest.
18165,94,162,736000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Monstromart,"Yes, but look - all pathetic, single men - only cash, no chit-chat."
18168,94,165,747000,James Woods,Kwik-E-Mart,"Seventy-five, eighty-five, ninety and a dollar. Thank you and come again."
18169,94,166,750000,James Woods,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey! Wait a minute. Hey, can I just ask you a question?"
18170,94,167,756000,James Woods,Kwik-E-Mart,"Did you, did you believe that?... I mean the way I gave you the change... Did I sound like a real Kwik-E-Mart, you know, kinda guy?"
18171,94,168,765000,Jimbo Jones,Kwik-E-Mart,"Actually, I thought it was a little labored."
18172,94,169,765000,James Woods,Kwik-E-Mart,Huh?
18173,94,170,768000,Jimbo Jones,Kwik-E-Mart,"You gotta lose yourself in the moment, man."
18174,94,171,771000,James Woods,Kwik-E-Mart,"Yeah, like... Yeah, okay, great. Okay, let's let's just try that again, okay? C'mon! Hey, c'mon. Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Get over here. Okay. Now you're you I'm me."
18175,94,172,779000,Jimbo Jones,Kwik-E-Mart,I'm me?
18176,94,173,779000,James Woods,Kwik-E-Mart,"Hey, don't jerk me around, fella."
18178,94,175,783000,Homer Simpson,Simpsons,Pass the chutney.
18179,94,176,783000,Marge Simpson,Simpsons,"Apu, you've been so helpful. If it weren't for him, we'd still be in line at the Monstromart."
18180,94,177,793000,Lisa Simpson,Simpsons,And he taught me how to play the shenai.
18181,94,178,793000,Homer Simpson,Simpsons,That's even worse than the album Grampa released.
18182,94,179,800000,Bart Simpson,Simpsons,And he taught me how to do this.
18183,94,180,800000,Bart Simpson,Simpsons,I got out of school because I told them I was mangled in a car wreck.
18184,94,181,807000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpsons,Thank you all for the kind praise.
18185,94,182,807000,Homer Simpson,Simpsons,Well you deserve it. All these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.
18186,94,183,815000,Homer Simpson,Simpsons,Ub. Apu friend me good.
18187,94,184,824000,Lisa Simpson,Simpsons,I think what my father's saying is you're like a member of the family now.
18188,94,185,827000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpsons,"I feel that way too. You see, whether igloo, hut, or lean-to/ or a geodesic dome / There's no structure I have been to / which I'd rather call my home..."
18189,94,186,839000,Grampa Simpson,Simpsons,Hello.
18190,94,187,841000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpsons,WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED YOU WERE ALL SUCH JERKS / BUT NOW I'VE COME TO LOOOVE YOUR QUIRKS/

18192,94,189,858000,Homer Simpson,Simpsons,That's okay.
18193,94,190,861000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpsons,WHO NEEDS THE KWIK-E-MART?/ NOW HERE'S THE TRICKY PART / OH WON'T YOU RHYME WITH ME? / WHO NEEDS THE KWIK-E-MART...
18194,94,191,873000,Marge Simpson,Simpsons,THEIR FLOORS ARE STICKY-MART.
18195,94,192,875000,Lisa Simpson,Simpsons,THEY MADE DAD SICKY-MART.
18196,94,193,877000,Bart Simpson,Simpsons,LET'S HURL A BRICKY-MART!

18201,94,198,895000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpsons,NOT ME!
18202,94,199,901000,Homer Simpson,Simpsons,Everything really wrapped up nicely. Much quicker than usual.
18203,94,200,906000,Marge Simpson,Simpsons,I guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.
18204,94,201,909000,Homer Simpson,Simpsons,And we've all found happiness... Every one of us.
18205,94,202,914000,Homer Simpson,Simpsons,"Hey, what's that sound?"
18207,94,204,920000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,WHO NEEDS THE KWIK-E-MART? I DO.
18208,94,205,933000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, he's not happy at all. He lied to us through song. I hate when people do that."
