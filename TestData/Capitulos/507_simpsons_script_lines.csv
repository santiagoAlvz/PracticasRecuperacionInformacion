131718,507,205,815000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Flanders Home,"Ned, I know I should have consulted you, but that school is beneath them. Take my word as a teacher of fifteen years."
131719,507,206,821000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Well, sir... when we got married, I knew I'd find some spices in my chili. I guess they can go to Springfield Hellementary."
131722,507,209,841000,Talking Dog,Flanders Bedroom,"Why are we here, Neddy?"
131723,507,210,843000,Older Flanders,Flanders Bedroom,"Well, first of all, I think talking dogs are the spawn of the devil. Secondly, we are watching my little Toddy graduate from college."
131724,507,211,851000,Talking Dog,Flanders Bedroom,Awww. Now aren't you glad you let Edna take charge of the boys' education?
131725,507,212,855000,Older Flanders,Flanders Bedroom,"Yep, it's lucky she's not my taxes, 'cause I underestimated her. Wait a minute. Liberal professors... feminist workshops... abstract sculptures?!"
131726,507,213,864000,Older Flanders,Flanders Bedroom,This isn't a Midwestern bible college. This is an elite East Coast university!
131727,507,214,871000,College Grad Todd,Flanders Bedroom,"It's okay, Daddy, I majored in religious studies!"
131729,507,216,875000,College Grad Todd,Flanders Bedroom,Comparative religious studies.
131732,507,219,886000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Gimme your keys!
131733,507,220,887000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,Maybe I'll just park it myself.
131734,507,221,890000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Why are you parking yourself? Why are you parking yourself?
131735,507,222,893000,DOLPH,Simpson Home,We haven't taken in one car all day.
131736,507,223,900000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You really put on a great reception, Marge. It's like the happy flashback in a gritty cop thriller."
131737,507,224,905000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Thank you! Everyone's having a great time.
131738,507,225,912000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Helen, have a canapé! There's enough for everyone, but not too much."
131741,507,228,923000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No weird hookups!
131742,507,229,924000,Lindsay Naegle,Simpson Home,Call me!
131743,507,230,926000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Simpson Home,"I'm married to the sea. And I'm seein' two of the great lakes on the side. I won't say which ones, but it's eerie how superior they are."
131744,507,231,936000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, how do the boys like Springfield Elementary?"
131745,507,232,940000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Simpson Home,"Marge, it's wonderful. They're opening up, they've seen a wider world..."
131746,507,233,945000,Todd Flanders,Simpson Home,I wrote with a flair pen!
131747,507,234,947000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, that's just great, boys. Now, come over here so Mrs. Simpson can take a photo."
131748,507,235,952000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,Make sure our temporary tats are in the picture.
131749,507,236,954000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,Mine's a sassy princess who speaks her mind.
131751,507,238,958000,Todd Flanders,Simpson Home,Mine's a duck with no pants!
131752,507,239,960000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,What if we were raptured right now?
131753,507,240,961000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Simpson Home,"Ned, I said it was okay."
131754,507,241,964000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,"Yeah, chillax, Daddy."
131755,507,242,966000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Chillax?! Young man, in the Flanders house, we speak the King's Diddily."
131756,507,243,969000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Time for cake! Let's finish this sucker up.
131759,507,244,972000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"You get my boys tattoos, you change their school, you buy Rod sneakers that light up like Times Square...shoes are shoes and lights are lights! Now, just when do I get a say in how my boys are raised?! This marriage isn't perfect!"
131760,507,245,987000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No video... party over... caaaake!
131761,507,246,991000,Helen Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"Too late, Marge."
131762,507,247,995000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Simpson Home,"Ned, these boys trust me to be their mother. You'd better decide whether you do."
131763,507,248,1004000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"And that's that. Another story in the classic, infallible three-act structure. Good enough for Aristotle, good enough for the Simpsons."
131764,507,249,1011000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mr. Szyslak, I have a feeling there's going to be one more act to this story."
131765,507,250,1015000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm not hangin' around for that."
131766,507,251,1017000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Four acts...
131768,507,253,1022000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ned, how did you sleep?"
131769,507,254,1024000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Fine, I guess. Thanks for loaning me your pajamas, Homer. And Marge, thank you for those helpful chip bag clips."
131770,507,255,1033000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"I just felt so ashamed I just couldn't go home. Today, I gave in to the one thing I vowed I would never have in my marriage: strong feeling."
131771,507,256,1043000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here's your lunches. With some cake. You'll be having cake for a long, long, time."
131772,507,257,1049000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, aren't you gonna tell Mom and Dad about the problem you have?"
131773,507,258,1053000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Shut up!
131774,507,259,1054000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm just saying it won't get better unless you talk to an adult.
131775,507,260,1057000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Maggie knows how to keep a secret. Why can't you?
131776,507,261,1063000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, is there something you want to tell us?"
131777,507,262,1065000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Marge, let the kid have his embarrassing secrets and lies."
131778,507,263,1069000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That is totally irresponsible parenting!
131779,507,264,1071000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Not according to the internet!
131780,507,265,1073000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Where on the internet?
131781,507,266,1075000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me.
131782,507,267,1078000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why would you believe him?
131783,507,268,1080000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because his avatar is Darth Maul! The second-coolest Darth!
131784,507,269,1085000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And what he says is true because it's in all caps. Are you gonna argue with caps?
131757,507,270,1090000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why does that make him right?
131758,507,271,1091000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"He took the time to press the shift key, Marge! I think he knows what he's talking about."
131785,507,272,1096000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"So after all this time together, you two still haven't agreed on how to raise your kids?"
131786,507,273,1101000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ned, I realized long ago, there are some things Homer and I will never completely agree on."
131787,507,274,1106000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but we make sure never to go to bed hungry."
131788,507,275,1110000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's angry.
131789,507,276,1110000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't tell me what our thing is.
131790,507,277,1113000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's about not agreeing on something.
131791,507,278,1115000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've always said ""hungry""!"
131792,507,279,1117000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, just tell us the problem!"
131793,507,280,1122000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm keeping a dolphin in my bathtub!
131794,507,281,1124000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought I heard clicks and pops!
131796,507,283,1128000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Children, your test scores are down because we've been having so many assemblies, you haven't had time to study. This assembly will remedy that."
131797,507,284,1135000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"We've invited a few friends over to give you some ""musical cues."""
131798,507,285,1140000,Sally Scantron Sheet,Springfield Elementary School,I'm Sally Scantron Sheet.
131799,507,286,1143000,Peter Pencil,Springfield Elementary School,"And I'm Peter Pencil! Now, you didn't hear it from us, but the answers to the test are:"
131800,507,287,1148000,SALLY/PETER,Springfield Elementary School,A.B.D.D.C.A.B.
131801,507,288,1153000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,Are you just giving them the answers?
131802,507,289,1155000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,They still have to sign their names properly so we're not totally out of the woods.
131803,507,290,1158000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Pause the assembly! I have to talk to my wife!
131804,507,291,1163000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Ned?
131805,507,292,1163000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,My rival.
131806,507,293,1164000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Some rivalry. It's like Secretariat versus a can of dog food.
131807,507,294,1169000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Edna, I'm sorry and I'll say it in front of God or Groundskeeper Willie!"
131808,507,295,1173000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh Ned, I'm sorry too. I overstepped your boundaries. I guess I never really, truly cared about children before."
131810,507,297,1181000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, get over it. And Ned, I'll be exactly as much mom as you want me to be."
131811,507,298,1186000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, the Simpsons make it up as they go along, and they're as happy as a ribbon in a bible. What do you say, sweetie?"
131812,507,299,1191000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Ha!
131814,507,301,1196000,Sleazy Sam,STRIP MALL,"Now in our fiftieth location in Springfield, Sleazy Sam would like to welcome our special grand opening star, Jesus."

131816,507,303,1214000,Homer Simpson,STRIP MALL,Are you gonna do that every time I open one of these?
