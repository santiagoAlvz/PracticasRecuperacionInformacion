71301,281,63,321000,COWBOY,Mansion,Don't worry about these critters. They're just props from my movies.
71302,281,64,324000,COWBOY,Mansion,"This one's from ""Gunfight at the Museum of Natural History."""

71307,281,69,342000,Bart Simpson,Mansion,"No kiddin'. Anyway, I climbed over your gate. A dog was after me."
71308,281,70,347000,BUCK,Mansion,I'll show you a trick that you can use on dogs. Also worked on David O. Selznick.
71309,281,71,352000,Bart Simpson,Mansion,Who?
71310,281,72,355000,BUCK,Mansion,"Yeah, that's right. The David O. Selznick."

71312,281,74,363000,BUCK,Mansion,"Trust me, son. You'll be fine."

71314,281,76,374000,Bart Simpson,Mansion,"Whoa, it worked!"
71315,281,77,378000,Bart Simpson,Mansion,Where did you learn that?
71316,281,78,380000,BUCK,Mansion,"Ah, you pick things up. Do you know how to catch a wild boar with a teaspoon?"

71318,281,80,387000,BUCK,Mansion,Well what do you kids do all day?

71321,281,82,391000,BUCK,Mansion,"School? Huh, why bother? I quit after fourth grade and I ain't not no un-dummy."
71323,281,84,399000,Bart Simpson,BUCK'S MANSION,It's like you're living in a steakhouse!
71324,281,85,402000,BUCK,BUCK'S MANSION,Why thank you! Most people just mutter that.
71325,281,86,408000,Bart Simpson,BUCK'S MANSION,Is that horse vacuuming?
71326,281,87,409000,BUCK,BUCK'S MANSION,If you can call it that. He soils as much as he cleans. Frank the Wonder Horse was in twenty-four of my pictures.
71327,281,88,419000,BUCK,BUCK'S MANSION,And directed one.
71328,281,89,422000,BUCK,BUCK'S MANSION,"And he got the ""film by"" credit."
71329,281,90,432000,Bart Simpson,BUCK'S MANSION,Five o'clock? I better get home for dinner.
71330,281,91,435000,BUCK,BUCK'S MANSION,"Well, come back anytime, pardner. To the laundry room!"

71333,281,94,446000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hi, honey. Where's that vicious dog? I made him a biscuit."
71334,281,95,451000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, he's not bothering me any more. Buck McCoy helped me."
71335,281,96,453000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Buck McCoy? He was the greatest of them all. He was bigger than opium!
71336,281,97,459000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I met one of my heroes today. She started the f--
71337,281,98,462000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Buck McCoy! I still carry this.

71339,281,100,469000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Cool.
71342,281,103,472000,BUCK,BUCK'S HOUSE,"After that, I starred in ""Wyatt Earp Meets the Mummy,"" then ""Six Brides for Seven Brothers..."""
71343,281,104,480000,BUCK,BUCK'S HOUSE,"They were pictures that the whole family could enjoy. No drugs, no nudity, no cussin'. Just drinkin', fightin' and trippin' horses with wires."
71344,281,105,490000,Bart Simpson,BUCK'S HOUSE,What's this lunchbox made of?
71345,281,106,492000,BUCK,BUCK'S HOUSE,"Well back in my day we had a thing called metal. Everything was made of it. Lunchboxes, cars, you name it."
71346,281,107,500000,Bart Simpson,BUCK'S HOUSE,"Met-tal. Hey, can you still do cowboy tricks?"
71347,281,108,506000,BUCK,BUCK'S HOUSE,"Here's one I did in ""The Wild Lunch""."
71348,281,109,514000,Bart Simpson,BUCK'S HOUSE,Everything tastes better when it's lassoed.
71349,281,110,517000,Milhouse Van Houten,BUCK'S HOUSE,Would you lasso me a banana?
71350,281,111,519000,BUCK,BUCK'S HOUSE,Now how the hell would I do that?
71352,281,113,524000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess you're not going to have an adventure this week.
71320,281,114,527000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Just you wait!
71353,281,115,529000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey boy, where'd you get that hat?"
71354,281,116,531000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Buck gave it to me. He's just about the greatest guy who ever lived. I wanna grow up to be just like him.
71355,281,117,537000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No kidding? Hey, speaking of achievers, they're thinking of spraying your old man's work space for ticks."
71356,281,118,544000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's great, champ. I know you've been wantin' that. Well, gotta mosey. Homer. Ma'am."
71357,281,119,552000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart sure is fond of that cow gentleman.
71358,281,120,554000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's just not fair. This Buck fella's had all the advantages --horse-riding lessons, the finest makeup, delicious studio food..."
71359,281,121,563000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, Homie, you'll always be my western hero."
71360,281,122,566000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Swell.
71361,281,123,570000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't wait till I get good.
71362,281,124,574000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Buck's here!
71363,281,125,576000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, why are you wearing that?"
71364,281,126,578000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because I want to be your hero. On top of which I don't look bald.
71365,281,127,582000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks for coming, Mr. McCoy. We cooked your favorites: rattleJailbird meat, varmint kabobs, and refried whiskey."
71366,281,128,590000,BUCK,Simpson Home,I like the sound of that last one.
71367,281,129,593000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't listen to 'em, Buck. It's an ambush. They're trying to jump your claim!"
71368,281,130,598000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Take him outside.
71369,281,131,601000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I love you, Buuuck!"
71370,281,132,608000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Gee Buck, your old films are as violent as today's!"
71371,281,133,611000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,One of the wheels broke off my chair today. But I didn't make a movie about it.
71373,281,135,618000,BUCK,Simpson Home,"In the '50s, I did a TV show."
71374,281,136,620000,BUCK,Simpson Home,"It only lasted a year, but we did three hundred and sixty episodes. All of them great. I did the commercials myself."
71375,281,137,628000,BUCK,Simpson Home,"Remember kids, Drunken Cowboy Brand Whiskey is smooth as milk."
71376,281,138,634000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm not sure I approve of selling whiskey to children.
71377,281,139,637000,BUCK,Simpson Home,"Well, that ad was aimed at children who were already heavy drinkers."
71378,281,140,640000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh.
71379,281,141,646000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"Tonight's episode: ""'Scuse Me While I Kill The Sky."""
71380,281,142,648000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why are you driving a car?
71382,281,143,652000,BUCK,Simpson Home,"Yeah, in the seventies, westerns were out and detective shows were in. It seems like all I did was shoot hippies."
71383,281,144,665000,BUCK,Simpson Home,They wrote me out of the show and it became Room 222.
71384,281,145,670000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,So that's how you ended your career?
71385,281,146,671000,BUCK,Simpson Home,"Yeah, well what can you do? The western went the way of the evening newspaper and polio."
71386,281,147,678000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I think westerns are due for a comeback."
71387,281,148,680000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, we can have showdowns at the schoolyard and use nerds as Indians!"
71390,281,151,696000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, you look so cool."
71391,281,152,699000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I was thinkin' this could be A new fad.
71392,281,153,701000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,What about Hawaiian shirts?
71393,281,154,704000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, you're not fun, you're fat."
71394,281,155,707000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, listen up. When I come back tomorrow you'd better have cowboy suits. And they'd better be adorable."
71396,281,157,717000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"This is Kent Brockman, here at Springfield Elementary where a new Western ""craze"" is sweeping the campus."
71397,281,158,723000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,I'm Annie Oakley!

71400,281,161,730000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School Yard,So I guess you could say this barely qualifies as news. I'm Kent Brockman.
71402,281,163,735000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"OH, GIVE ME LAND, LOTS OF LAND / UNDER STARRY SKIES ABOVE..."

71414,281,174,772000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Dressing Room,"Forget it. I'm not putting some western star on, just 'cause it's the flavor of the month. I want my show to have a timeless quality."

71421,281,181,793000,BUCK,BUCK'S MANSION,I ain't going on some clown show. I'm retired.
71422,281,182,796000,Lisa Simpson,BUCK'S MANSION,No one expects you to do anything difficult. They understand you're too old.
71423,281,183,801000,BUCK,BUCK'S MANSION,"Listen, missy. The last two city-slickers who used reverse psychology on me are pushing up daisies."
71424,281,184,808000,Bart Simpson,BUCK'S MANSION,They're dead?
71425,281,185,809000,BUCK,BUCK'S MANSION,"No, they've just got lousy jobs."

71427,281,187,815000,BUCK,BUCK'S MANSION,"I can't, eh? You two wait right here."

71436,281,196,874000,BUCK,Krustylu Studios,"Yeah, things sure have changed since the '50s."
71437,281,197,877000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,I don't care.

71463,281,222,1017000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, I couldn't help noticing Buck is a total fraud. So I took the liberty of creating a new hero for your wall."
71465,281,224,1026000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That is just grotesque.
71466,281,225,1028000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I thought if you were looking to worship someone, maybe it could be your old man?"

71470,281,229,1045000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You care about Bart's feelings.
71471,281,230,1047000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Stop saying that.
71472,281,231,1048000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I think we should try to restore Bart's faith in Buck. And we could start by getting Buck to quit drinking.
71474,281,233,1060000,BUCK,BUCK'S MANSION,"I'm sorry I let your son down, but I'm too old to change."
71443,281,234,1065000,Homer Simpson,BUCK'S MANSION,"Oh, listen to you. ""Ooh, ooh, I'm too old to change. "" How old are you?"
71475,281,235,1071000,BUCK,BUCK'S MANSION,Seventy-six.
71476,281,236,1074000,Homer Simpson,BUCK'S MANSION,Nice old man. Don't break a hip.
71477,281,237,1077000,Marge Simpson,BUCK'S MANSION,Have we gotten all the liquor?
71478,281,238,1079000,BUCK,BUCK'S MANSION,That painting is made of liquor.
71480,281,240,1086000,Sad Cowboy,Clinic,I was drinking so much I forgot what life was about -- gold!
71481,281,241,1093000,Sad Cowboy,Clinic,He does a crazy dance.
71482,281,242,1093000,Sad Cowboy,Clinic,Gold! Beautiful gold! Nuggets as big as your fist!
71483,281,243,1097000,BUCK,Clinic,You guys are sick. I don't belong here.
71484,281,244,1101000,Doctor,Clinic,"Buck, if you walk out that door, you'll be branded a quitter forever."
71485,281,245,1110000,Homer Simpson,Clinic,"Mmmm, something smells delicious."
71486,281,246,1113000,BUCK,Clinic,"Well, that's it. This place ain't for me."
71487,281,247,1116000,Marge Simpson,Clinic,"Well, we're not giving up. We're going to cure you of drinking."
71488,281,248,1120000,BUCK,Clinic,"Look, I worked long and hard, got rich, and now I'm retired. Why shouldn't I be able to drink all I want?"
71489,281,249,1127000,Marge Simpson,Clinic,"Well, I don't know. I just naturally assumed it was some of my business."
71490,281,250,1131000,BUCK,Clinic,"Well, I don't see how it is. Nobody's even told me your name yet."
71492,281,252,1136000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm still not givin' up on Buck. There must be some hare-brained half-assed way...
71493,281,253,1142000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,This just in: a robbery is in progress at the National Bank of Springfield. The robbers are equipped with the latest in high-tech weaponry and body armor.
71494,281,254,1152000,Snake Jailbird,Simpson Home,Stay back coppers!
71495,281,255,1156000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Ah, please, everyone, stay away. We don't want anyone to be a hero. A hero. A hero!"
71496,281,256,1164000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Get me Buck McCoy.
71497,281,257,1167000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I'm on the LINE."
71499,281,259,1169000,Homer Simpson,Bank,Here you go. Just stop this bank robbery and you'll be a hero again. I'll wait in the car.
71500,281,260,1174000,BUCK,Bank,Are you crazy? I'm a movie cowboy. And you're no Howard Hawks.
71501,281,261,1179000,Homer Simpson,Bank,That hurts. But I just have one question: do you want my son to be disappointed in you?
71502,281,262,1187000,BUCK,Bank,Fine.
71503,281,263,1191000,Homer Simpson,Bank,You don't need that.
71504,281,264,1195000,Bart Simpson,Bank,"Way to go, Buck. I feel my faith growing anew."
71505,281,265,1198000,BUCK,Bank,Better get rid of this too.
71506,281,266,1200000,BUCK,Bank,Not to mention this.
71508,281,267,1202000,Homer Simpson,Bank,Whoa. There's nothing wrong with a little hey-hey!
71509,281,268,1208000,BUCK,Bank,"Fun's over, boys. Now drop the hardware and mosey."
71510,281,269,1215000,Bank Robber,Bank,"I'm firing at the lasso, but the bullets just go through the middle."
71511,281,270,1220000,Snake Jailbird,Bank,It's the ultimate weapon!
71512,281,271,1234000,Lou,Bank,"Wow, that sure made us look bad."
71513,281,272,1238000,Chief Wiggum,Bank,"Slink away, boys. Slink away."
71515,281,274,1243000,Bart Simpson,Street,"Buck, you're my hero again."
71516,281,275,1245000,Homer Simpson,Street,Aren't you forgettin' someone?
71517,281,276,1247000,Bart Simpson,Street,"Well, there's Krusty, Itchy, Scratchy, Poochie, America's firefighters and then you, Dad."
71518,281,277,1254000,Homer Simpson,Street,And don't you forget it.
71519,281,278,1259000,BUCK,Street,Goodbye Bart!
