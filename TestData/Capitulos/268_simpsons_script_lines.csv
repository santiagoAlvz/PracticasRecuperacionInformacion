67373,268,60,336000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Mmmaybe a little morphine would refresh my memory.

67381,268,68,377000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Maybe a little morphine would get me there quicker.
67384,268,71,386000,Lisa Simpson,Operating Room,So many times we've seen our father go under the knife.
67385,268,72,389000,Marge Simpson,Operating Room,One more and I get a free hysterectomy.
67387,268,74,395000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Now Homer, you'll have a full recovery from your spinal cord injury."
67388,268,75,398000,Marge Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,What spinal cord injury?
67389,268,76,400000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Oh, he fell off the gurney."
67390,268,77,401000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,But it will take plenty of time and rehab before you can go back to work.
67391,268,78,405000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Miss work? But my life would be nothing without the nucleon plant.
67392,268,79,409000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Oh, you're also responsible for this hefty hospital bill. You shouldn't have ordered all those hospital haircuts and porno films."
67393,268,80,416000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"But ""Dr. Screwlittle"" sounded like a delightful romp. Well, you don't have to worry about the bill. We've never welshed on a... Look, a bear!"

67395,268,82,438000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Now Homer, I want you to stay off that leg for two weeks."
67396,268,83,441000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Two weeks?! Well, what am I supposed to do? Just sit on my ass and watch TV? That ain't my style, man!"
67397,268,84,448000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Now, Homer, there are people right through that door that have it much worse than you."
67398,268,85,454000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,No they don't.
67400,268,87,456000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Everyone's having fun but me.

67403,268,90,464000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homer won't be able to play for a long time."
67404,268,91,470000,Barney Gumble,Simpson Home,Could you make me some Jell-O?

67429,268,116,567000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Living Room,"It's gonna be one wholesome evening. So, do you think Marge could take care of rowdy Roddy and Typhoon Todd?"
67430,268,117,573000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Well, Marge isn't here. She had to identify a body at the morgue."
67432,268,119,579000,Marge Simpson,MORGUE,"That's not my Uncle Lou, and this man's not dead."
67433,268,120,583000,Hans Moleman,MORGUE,That's what I've been trying to tell you!

67453,268,140,668000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oh, Roddy, he's not runnin' a day care center."
67454,268,141,671000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't tell me what I'm not doing.
67455,268,142,673000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,So you are running a day care center?
67456,268,143,675000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?"
67457,268,144,677000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, I sure would. It would give the boys a place to go after school."
67458,268,145,680000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Then I'll do it, just to see the look on your face."
67459,268,146,684000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's the one.
67460,268,147,690000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why did you put my name on the sign?
67461,268,148,693000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's just a legal thing, to protect me."
67462,268,149,696000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Is your knee really gross under there?
67463,268,150,698000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,See for yourself.

67475,268,162,730000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Why, Homer, your surgical incision is completely healed."
67476,268,163,734000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"I owe it all to my rewarding work with children, and not picking at it."
67477,268,164,738000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Ah, yes. How is your day care center doing?"
67478,268,165,741000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Wonderful. Being with those kids gives me a high only morphine can top. Ya got any?
67479,268,166,747000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Always with the morphine.
67481,268,168,750000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo!
67482,268,169,758000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad's been doing that for two hours!
67483,268,170,760000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I've never seen the baby get tired of it before the adult.
67484,268,171,765000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Peek-a-boo!
67485,268,172,768000,Rod Flanders,Simpson Home,"Uncle Homer, will you sing that crazy song we love?"
67486,268,173,772000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay. IS THAT ALL THERE IS? / IS THAT ALL THERE IS? / IF THAT'S ALL THERE IS / MY FRIEND / THEN LET'S KEEP DANCING...
67488,268,175,788000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't remember the last time Dad sang us a torch song.
67489,268,176,792000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah. Hey, Homer, I thought you were only gonna do this day care thing till your knee was better."
67490,268,177,797000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, but then I discovered the joys of raising children."
67491,268,178,801000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What about us?
67492,268,179,802000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry honey, you'll have children of your own someday. Then you'll know my joy."
67494,268,181,813000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, Bart, your Dad gave me this temp tattoo."
67495,268,182,816000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,It's so cool!
67496,268,183,823000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,You have the bestest Dad. He read me a story about Chinese food.
67497,268,184,828000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You haven't seen the real Homer. It's all burping and neglect.
67498,268,185,832000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"I think we know your Dad a little bit better than you do, Bart."
67499,268,186,835000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Is that my jacket?
67500,268,187,837000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,He said it looked better on me.
67504,268,191,842000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,If you're happy and you know it say a swear!
67505,268,192,845000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Living Room,Boobs!

67509,268,196,851000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,They're always laughing. Laughing at nothing.
67510,268,197,854000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,How come parents are always nicer to other kids than they are to their own?
67511,268,198,858000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess Dad just takes us for granted.
67512,268,199,860000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, don't worry. This'll give his heartstrings a much needed plucking."
67514,268,201,870000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh?
67515,268,202,873000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, what a beautiful frame. Perfect for my day care permit. Sweet."

67521,268,208,895000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,That was tree-mendous! Where's Ralph?
67522,268,209,900000,Ralph Wiggum,Bart's Treehouse,I almost died.
67523,268,210,902000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Homer, this man is from the ""Good Guy"" awards."
67524,268,211,904000,Dave Shutton,Bart's Treehouse,"We honor people who make life better for the community. Like you, with your day care center."
