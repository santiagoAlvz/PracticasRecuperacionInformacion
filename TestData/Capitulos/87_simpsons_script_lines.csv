15946,87,17,111000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, it's public TV! They never have anything good. Where are the Geraldos? Where are the Eubankses-es?"

15957,87,30,166000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You promised. You can't back out like when you volunteered for that Army experiment to avoid dinner at my sisters'.
15958,87,31,177000,Scientist,Simpson Home,"Mr. Simpson, you do realize this may result in hair loss, giddiness, and the loss of equilibrium?"
15959,87,32,182000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum."

16014,87,87,392000,RUTH,Coffee Shop,"If you ever met my ex-husband, you'd understand. All he ever did was eat, sleep and drink beer."
16015,87,88,398000,Marge Simpson,Coffee Shop,Your point being?

16018,87,91,408000,Barney Gumble,Coffee Shop,"Hey, can I throw up in your bathroom? I'll buy somethin'."
16020,87,93,411000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I know you didn't believe me about the vending machines. That's why I had the fireman write me a note."

16053,87,125,524000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry. You'll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover, Homina..."
16055,87,126,530000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that would be delightf... Quiet, boy! There's nothing to feel ashamed of here. Women have a right to a night out. Right, Lisa?"

16068,87,139,567000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Dad, I think state and federal laws require us to have a baby-sitter."
16069,87,140,571000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Lisa, haven't you seen ""Home Alone?"" If some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation."
16070,87,141,578000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're absolutely right, Homer. We don't need a baby-sitter."

16167,87,239,902000,RUTH,Ruth's Car,Remember when I said my ex-husband was behind on his child support?
16168,87,240,906000,Marge Simpson,Ruth's Car,Mmm hmm.
16169,87,241,906000,RUTH,Ruth's Car,"Yeah, well to even things up, I kind of stole his car."
16170,87,242,909000,Marge Simpson,Ruth's Car,Didn't you realize all you had to do was report him to the police?
16171,87,243,912000,RUTH,Ruth's Car,"Marge, you're the level-headed friend I never had."
16174,87,246,912000,Chief Wiggum,WIGGUM'S CAR,"We're in pursuit of two female suspects. One is wearing a green dress, pearls and has a lot of blue hair."
16175,87,247,925000,Homer Simpson,WIGGUM'S CAR,"""A lot of blue hair?"" Heh-heh. What a freak."
16176,87,248,932000,Homer Simpson,WIGGUM'S CAR,"It's Marge! She's become a crazed criminal, just because I didn't take her to the ballet."
16177,87,249,937000,Chief Wiggum,WIGGUM'S CAR,That's exactly how Dillinger got started.
16178,87,250,937000,Homer Simpson,WIGGUM'S CAR,Really?
16180,87,252,941000,Marge Simpson,Ruth's Car,"I don't want to be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give yourself up."
16181,87,253,944000,RUTH,Ruth's Car,"Marge, it's a matter of principle. I just can't let that deadbeat win again. You're with me, aren't ya?"
148654,87,254,951000,Marge's Thoughts,Ruth's Car,I should say something reassuring yet noncommittal.
16183,87,256,953000,RUTH,Ruth's Car,"Look, Marge, there's no reason for you to get dragged into this. Once we lose the cops, I'll let ya out."
16184,87,257,961000,Marge Simpson,Ruth's Car,"Oh, I don't think they're gonna be that easy to lose. I mean these are professional lawmen and..."
16185,87,258,965000,Chief Wiggum,Ruth's Car,"Oh my God, it just disappeared! It's a ghost car!"
16156,87,259,971000,Chief Wiggum,Ruth's Car,There are ghost cars all over these highways ya know.
15211,87,260,976000,Homer Simpson,Ruth's Car,Hold me.
16186,87,261,976000,Chief Wiggum,Ruth's Car,Only if you hold me.

16189,87,264,980000,Marge Simpson,Diner,"Well, bye."
16190,87,265,991000,RUTH,Diner,Sorry about all this. But you gotta admit we did have some fun.
16191,87,266,996000,Marge Simpson,Diner,Yeah. Everything before the high-speed chase was just lovely.
16192,87,267,1000000,RUTH,Diner,"Hey, you're a good friend, Marge."
16193,87,268,1011000,Woman #1,Diner,This cross country flight from the law would be hell if we didn't stick together.
16194,87,269,1018000,Woman #2,Diner,"Hey, friends stick together."
16195,87,270,1020000,Woman #3,Diner,It's amazing how through all this adversity we managed to stick together.
16196,87,271,1024000,Woman #4,Diner,"If there's one thing decent folk do, it's stick together."
16197,87,272,1028000,Waitress,Diner,I hate it when the waffles stick together.
16198,87,273,1030000,Fry Cook,Diner,Sticking together is what good waffles do.
16199,87,274,1032000,RUTH,Diner,"Thanks, kid."
16200,87,275,1045000,RUTH,Diner,"Marge, what are you doing?"
16201,87,276,1046000,Marge Simpson,Diner,"Ruth, I've done a lot of thinking, and I really consider you a friend. And an important part of friendship is..."
16203,87,278,1053000,Diner Owner,Diner,You stupid kid! You know that drives away all my business!
16204,87,279,1057000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Diner,"See you tomorrow, loser."
16206,87,281,1065000,Chief Wiggum,Highway,"Mmmm, engine block eggs. If we can keep these down, we'll be sittin' pretty."
16207,87,282,1071000,Homer Simpson,Highway,That's them!
16208,87,283,1071000,Chief Wiggum,Highway,Quiet. I can't hear the eggs.
16210,87,285,1074000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, it's morning, and Mom and Dad aren't home yet."
16211,87,286,1081000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Mr. Hutz is still here to take care of us."
16212,87,287,1085000,Lionel Hutz,Simpson Home,"Hey, don't touch my stuff! Hey, this isn't the YMCA."
16215,87,290,1089000,Chief Wiggum,WIGGUM'S CAR,"Dispatch, this is Chief Wiggum back in pursuit of the rebelling women."

16225,87,300,1128000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"At the risk of editorializing, these women are guilty, and must be dealt with in a harsh and brutal fashion. Otherwise, their behavior could incite other women, leading to anarchy of biblical proportions. It's in Revelations, people!"

16233,87,308,1183000,Chief Wiggum,Ruth's Car,"Oh no, they're headed right for the Grand Chasm."
16234,87,309,1186000,Homer Simpson,Ruth's Car,Oh my God. They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. And it's all my fault!

16245,87,320,1239000,Homer Simpson,GRAND CHASM,"Mmmmm... Ewwww.... Mmmmm...Ohhh... Mmmmm... Ahhhh. Ooh, I think this was pizza."
16247,87,322,1248000,Announcer,DRAGNET-STYLE LIMBO,"Ruth Powers was tried in Springfield superior court. The judge dismissed her ex-husband's auto theft charges and forced him to pay all back child support. Mr. Powers blamed the outcome on his lawyer, one Lionel Hutz."
