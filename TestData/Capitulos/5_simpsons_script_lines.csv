150100,5,61,187000,Weasel #1,NEAR SCHOOL ENTRANCE,"Nelson, you're bleeding."
150101,5,62,189000,Nelson Muntz,NEAR SCHOOL ENTRANCE,Nah. This happens all the time. Somebody else's blood splatters on me.
150102,5,63,194000,Nelson Muntz,NEAR SCHOOL ENTRANCE,"Hey, wait a minute. You're right. You made me bleed my own blood."
150103,5,64,201000,Bart Simpson,NEAR SCHOOL ENTRANCE,"Uh, it was an ACCIDENT, man. A terrible ghastly mistake! Ask anybody!"
150104,5,65,209000,Bart Simpson,NEAR SCHOOL ENTRANCE,"Uh, oh. A cold wind!"

150124,5,84,286000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"You've gotta tell Principal Skinner, Bart."
150125,5,85,289000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,But I can't squeal. It would violate the code of the school yard.
150127,5,87,293000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria,"Hey, everybody. Here comes my brother, Bart the bullyÂ­ killer!"

150143,5,103,368000,Marge Simpson,MORTUARY,"That's better, Homer. Be brave. Bye bye, Bart. You were always my special little guy."
150145,5,105,380000,Lisa Simpson,MORTUARY,"Bart, here's that cupcake you wanted. I can't help but think if I had just given it to you in the first place, this whole horrible tragedy could have been avoided. I know you can't eat it now, so I'll just place it lovingly on your forehead. ."
150146,5,106,396000,Nelson Muntz,MORTUARY,"Hey, look! They got food at this thing. And here's one for the road, dude. ."

150159,5,119,474000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tough day at school, boy?"
150160,5,120,475000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, what happened to you?"
150161,5,121,477000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Let's just say I paid the inevitable price for helping out my sister.
150162,5,122,481000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So you had a little scuffle, eh? Hope you won."
150164,5,124,488000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm gonna miss you, big guy."
150165,5,125,494000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, your mother has the fool idea that you're upset about something."
150166,5,126,500000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad... I need help... Please...
150167,5,127,504000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Bart, we don't want your mother to see you crying. Here, let me help you dry those tears."
150168,5,128,516000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, what's the problem, son?"
150169,5,129,518000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I had a run-in with a bully.
150170,5,130,521000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,A bully?!
150171,5,131,523000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Come on, Marge. I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa."
150172,5,132,525000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Bart, I hope you're going straight to the principal about this."
150173,5,133,528000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess I could do that.
150174,5,134,530000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What? And violate the code of the school yard? I'd rather Bart died.
150175,5,135,535000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"What on earth are you talking about, Homer?"
150176,5,136,536000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The code of the School yard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Let's see... Don't tattle... Always make fun of those different from you... Never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... Hmmm, what else... ?"
150178,5,137,552000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Homer, that's ridiculous. Bart, instead of fighting, why don't you try a little understanding?"
150179,5,138,558000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"What do you mean, Mom?"
150180,5,139,560000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, right! This ought to be good for a laugh."
150181,5,140,562000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Shh! This bully friend of yours... Is he a little on the chunky side?
150182,5,141,566000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, - he's pretty chunkified, all right."
150183,5,142,568000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Huh huh. And I'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies either.
150184,5,143,572000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No. He's pretty dumb. He's in all the same special classes I am.
150185,5,144,575000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's why he lashes out at the world.
150186,5,145,578000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, Marge."
150187,5,146,578000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. You'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go."
150188,5,147,584000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi. Let's go, boy."
150190,5,149,590000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now here's that bully of yours. Show me your stuff.
150191,5,150,593000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no! Not like that! Like this!"
150192,5,151,608000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"See, that boy? You didn't expect that, did you? And neither will he."
150193,5,152,612000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"You mean I should fight dirty, Dad?"
150194,5,153,614000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own."
150195,5,154,614000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Amen.
150196,5,155,619000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes, and then you sock him when he's staggering around, blinded..."
150197,5,156,628000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah!
150198,5,157,629000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
150199,5,158,632000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Gotcha.
150200,5,159,634000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And if you get the chance, get 'em right in the family jewels. That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations."
150201,5,160,641000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, Pop."
150203,5,162,647000,Nelson Muntz,PLAYGROUND,Put 'em up.
150204,5,163,653000,Homer's Image,PLAYGROUND,"Remember the family jewels, son."
150205,5,164,662000,Bart Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"Whoa! Ouch! Ow! Ooh! Oh no, boys, not the can, please."
150207,5,166,673000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, you can't go on like this."
150177,5,167,676000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I know.
150208,5,168,677000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you go see Grampa?
150209,5,169,679000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What can he do?
150210,5,170,680000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,He'll give you good advice. He's the toughest Simpson alive.
150211,5,171,683000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,He is?
150212,5,172,685000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, remember the fight he put up when we put him in the home?"
150214,5,174,690000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,I'm here to see Grampa.
150215,5,175,693000,Receptionist,Springfield Retirement Castle,Half the people here are named Grampa.

150220,5,180,705000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa's Room at Springfield Retirement Castle,"Dear Advertisers: I am disgusted with the way old people are depicted on television. We are not all vibrant, fun-loving sex maniacs. Many of us are bitter, resentful individuals who remember the good old days when entertainment was bland and inoffensive.

150221,5,181,739000,Bart Simpson,Grampa's Room at Springfield Retirement Castle,"Hi, Grampa!"
