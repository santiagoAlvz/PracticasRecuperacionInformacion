120747,466,6,178000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,I have an important announcement to make. I've had a lot of time to think since my hands got too shaky to play cards...

120755,466,14,220000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,This won't even cover the vig on what I owe!

120758,466,17,240000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,WHAT DO I DO / WITH THIS DAMN LITTLE MAN / HIS STRIKE ZONE'S THE SIZE / OF A TUNA FISH CAN!
120760,466,19,252000,Homer Simpson,Costington's,HIS STRIKE ZONE'S THE SIZE / OF A TUNA FISH CAN...
120761,466,20,256000,Marge Simpson,Costington's,Now remember what Grampa said: you can spend the money any way you want.
120762,466,21,261000,Bart Simpson,Costington's,I just paid some loser fifty bucks to walk up the down escalator all day.
120763,466,22,268000,Gil Gunderson,Costington's,I bet it's eleven o'clock. I bet it's eleven o'clock. Nine fifteen?!
120765,466,23,274000,Marge Simpson,Costington's,"Hm, I think I'll look for a new handbag..."
120766,466,24,280000,Marge Simpson,Costington's,"Ooo, so many celebrities have their own label: Princess Penelope, Booberella, The Real Housewives of Ogdenville, even Scratchy."
120767,466,25,289000,Marge Simpson,Costington's,"Ooo, I wonder how much that one is. Gotta look without looking like I'm looking."
120768,466,26,296000,Marge Simpson,Costington's,Yes!
120769,466,27,298000,Marge Simpson,Costington's,"I'd like this bag, please!"

120771,466,29,305000,Marge Simpson,Costington's,Why wouldn't I?
120772,466,30,306000,Helen Lovejoy,Costington's,Well... those bags are pretty pricey.
120773,466,31,309000,Marge Simpson,Costington's,"Hey, my husband makes good money, and we can certainly afford..."
120774,466,32,313000,Cashier,Costington's,That'll be five hundred dollars.
120775,466,33,313000,Marge Simpson,Costington's,"Oh, I didn't realize..."
120776,466,34,319000,Bernice Hibbert,Costington's,"What's the matter, Marge? Just remembered your husband's not a doctor?"
120778,466,36,323000,Julio,Costington's,Oh my God you are so burned.
120779,466,37,325000,Marge Simpson,Costington's,I'll take it!

120782,466,40,338000,Julio,Costington's,Uh-oh-ohhh.
120784,466,42,341000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Five hundred dollars? That's, like, ten dead Grampas! Some of us stuck to our limit, Marge. And I would've loved to rent this carpet cleaner another day!"
120785,466,43,351000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Is that the cat in there?!
120786,466,44,353000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it's a cat -- I'm not sure it's the cat."
120787,466,45,358000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Homer -- I'll return the handbag first thing tomorrow."
120788,466,46,365000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know what, honey? Just because we can't afford to keep that handbag, doesn't mean that you two can't have one night at the most glamorous place in town."
120790,466,48,378000,Maitre D'ess,FANCY NIGHTCLUB,Right this way.
120791,466,49,391000,Marge Simpson,FANCY NIGHTCLUB,Well at least it's a good place to see celebrities.
120792,466,50,395000,Krusty the Clown,FANCY NIGHTCLUB,It's not what you think. I'm researching a movie where I play myself.

120798,466,56,426000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,So I want to honor Grampa by giving my inheritance to charity. But which one?
120799,466,57,434000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, what's this?"
120801,466,59,438000,Announcer,"LARGE, PILLARED, IMPOSING-LOOKING BANK","Most banks are for the haves, not the have-nots."

120804,466,62,447000,Goat,Bank,"I am just a goat, but even I know that a peasant in an emerging economy can't get a break. She needs a microloan."
120805,466,63,456000,Goat,Bank,"A guilty first-worlder lends fifty dollars or more to the Microloan Bank, who uses it to help my owner finance her business."
120806,466,64,462000,Goat,Bank,"Working together, we can help people help themselves! And now, apparently I am a girl."
120809,466,67,474000,Homer Simpson,Asia de Cuba de Springfield,"Come on, Marge -- let's hit the buffet."
120810,466,68,477000,Marge Simpson,Asia de Cuba de Springfield,"You go ahead, I'll stay here. If I get something on this handbag, I won't be able to return it."

120815,466,73,496000,Chief Wiggum,Asia de Cuba de Springfield,"Oh, it's like that, huh? The minute you go undercover, you act like you don't know me. He'll turn on you too, Fat Tony -- you just wait."
120817,466,75,509000,Marge Simpson,Asia de Cuba de Springfield,I suppose I should get something to eat.
120820,466,78,524000,Marge Simpson,Asia de Cuba de Springfield,Thank God!

120834,466,91,578000,Muhammad Yunus,Simpson Home,It's up here!
120836,466,93,580000,Muhammad Yunus,Simpson Home,Now down here! Too slow!
120838,466,95,581000,Muhammad Yunus,Simpson Home,"Okay, I will hold still. No, I won't! Ha ha!"

120847,466,104,621000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I will. I'll take a chance on you, Nelson Muntz."
120848,466,105,626000,Mrs. Muntz,Simpson Home,"Nelson! I gotta take this computer to the pawn shop, so's we can get White Castle for your birthday."
120850,466,107,637000,Lisa Simpson,Nelson's Trailer,"So Nelson, I see you started a small business."
120851,466,108,641000,Nelson Muntz,Nelson's Trailer,"Yeah, some anonymous dude sent me fifty bucks. Probably someone cool like Famous Amos or Ba Ba Booey. And I'm gonna justify his faith in me."

120859,466,117,682000,Nelson Muntz,Nelson's Trailer,"Wow, my first job. Tonight I'm having peanut butter and jelly. No more ""PB or J"" for me."

120868,466,126,729000,Homer Simpson,Costington's,"You got to enjoy that bag for nothing! We can buy stuff we can't afford, temporarily own the hell out of it, and then indignantly bring it back for a full refund."
120869,466,127,739000,Homer Simpson,Costington's,"Hide a sandwich in this hat. ""Mary Poppins"" myself to work with this umbrella."

120895,466,153,833000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S BIKE SHOP,"Here again, huh, Lis? I guess now that I'm a success, you want to get back together with me. Dolph called it."
120896,466,154,841000,Lisa Simpson,NELSON'S BIKE SHOP,"No, but there is something I can't hold back any more. I'm your microfinance donor!"

120902,466,160,868000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S BIKE SHOP,Droppin' it like a melon off an overpass.
120903,466,161,871000,Lisa Simpson,NELSON'S BIKE SHOP,But don't you know that people who don't go to college make three percent less than people who do?
120904,466,162,876000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S BIKE SHOP,"Lisa, thanks to you, and Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus, I can do... this!"

120908,466,166,891000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Principal Skinner, I need to convince Nelson to come back to school."
120909,466,167,895000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Seriously? Why? With Nelson gone, lunch money's finally making its way to the cafeteria. Nurples are returning to their natural, non-purple hue. Besides, I hear he's doing quite well with his bicycle pimpery."
120910,466,168,906000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,He is. He's paying people eleven dollars an hour to work for him.
120911,466,169,909000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Eleven dollars an hour? That's night watchman money. Maybe I should have a chat with him.
120912,466,170,915000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Which of these ties says ""confidence?"""
120913,466,171,917000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,Isn't that a Christmas tie?
120914,466,172,919000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"It's a conversation starter! Lisa, this conversation is over. It's not you I'm trying to impress, it's Nelson. I know he likes the sleeveless look..."
120915,466,173,926000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,Skin-ner!
120916,466,174,928000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"Oh, oh, so you also heard about the eleven dollars an hour."
120917,466,175,933000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,I heard about it first.
120918,466,176,934000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"Yes, well, you see the thing about that is..."
120920,466,178,942000,Homer Simpson,Costington's,"Good afternoon. I'd like to return this merchandise. Wrong size, wrong color, not as pictured, and other reason please explain."
120921,466,179,945000,Cashier,Costington's,"Sir, this suitcase has an airline tag on it, these ping-pong balls have been served and volleyed, and this hot plate's still warm."
120922,466,180,961000,Homer Simpson,Costington's,Yes... uh... maybe I'll just come back during someone else's shift... Is Claire working today? She's a real sucker.

120928,466,186,986000,Chris Hansen,Costington's,People like you?
120929,466,187,986000,Homer Simpson,Costington's,Yes! I mean no! I mean... You'll never get me!
120930,466,188,993000,Homer Simpson,Costington's,"I have to sign a release so you can broadcast this, right?"

120935,466,193,1014000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,"Oh, I don't know. I thought one of these super-successful people might tell you how important it is to stay in school. Why look, it's Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook!"
120936,466,194,1025000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,"Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm Lisa, and this is Nelson."
120937,466,195,1028000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Convention Center,"S'up, Zuck?"

120940,466,197,1031000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,"That's great, Mr. Zuckerberg, but I was hoping you could tell us how education was instrumental to your success."
120941,466,198,1041000,Mark Zuckerberg,Springfield Convention Center,"Well, the truth is... I dropped out of Harvard."
120942,466,199,1044000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,You did?
120943,466,200,1044000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Convention Center,Better earnin' than learnin'!
120944,466,201,1046000,Mark Zuckerberg,Springfield Convention Center,"Hell yeah! I'll get the best kind of degree... honorary, baby!"
120945,466,202,1050000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,"Well, clearly, you're an exception."
120946,466,203,1053000,Mark Zuckerberg,Springfield Convention Center,"Am I, Lisa?"
120947,466,204,1053000,Mark Zuckerberg,Springfield Convention Center,Bill Gates -- dropout. Virgin Airlines' Richard Branson -- dropout.
120948,466,205,1058000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,Didn't anybody here stay in school?
120949,466,206,1062000,Man,Springfield Convention Center,I did! Graduated magna cum lade!
120950,466,207,1066000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,"There, you see?"
120951,466,208,1067000,Janitor,Springfield Convention Center,I'm afraid I haven't done too well for myself. But I can certainly appreciate the irony of it.
120954,466,211,1083000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"So, how did everyone do with their fifty dollars?"
120955,466,212,1087000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Well, I learned a valuable lesson about wanting more than I could afford."
120956,466,213,1091000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Marge, you couldn't have fun if you were a monkey on a banana boat!"
120957,466,214,1095000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,I used Grampa's money to try to help someone in need. But it didn't go the way I expected.
120958,466,215,1100000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Dining Room,"Aw sweetie, money can't change people. It can just help them be who they are. I gave a bum a dollar once and he used it to buy an Ellery Queen mystery. But there was one mystery Ellery Queen couldn't solve: why a man was named Ellery. But my point is, whatever I said before I started talking about Ellery Queen."
120960,466,217,1125000,Lisa Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Nelson, I just wanted to say that I realize now you can't be anyone else other than who you are, and..."
120961,466,218,1133000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Look, everyone. Just chill out!"
120962,466,219,1137000,Dewey Largo,NELSON'S HOUSE,"My ""Wizard of Oz"" bike fell apart! In the middle of the Pride parade!"
120963,466,220,1141000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,What kind of pride?
120964,466,221,1142000,Dewey Largo,NELSON'S HOUSE,Never-you-mind what kind! Fix my bike!
120965,466,222,1145000,Ralph Wiggum,NELSON'S HOUSE,I want my money back!
120938,466,223,1147000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,Fine. Here's exactly what you paid me.
120465,466,224,1150000,Ralph Wiggum,NELSON'S HOUSE,Thank you
120764,466,225,1152000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,Why is this happening?
120966,466,226,1155000,Seymour Skinner,NELSON'S HOUSE,This epoxy you've been using is water soluble.
120967,466,227,1155000,Seymour Skinner,NELSON'S HOUSE,Which means that it's not weather-resistant.
120968,466,228,1161000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,Dumb it down for me.
120969,466,229,1163000,Seymour Skinner,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Uh... bike, sticky, water go bye-bye?"
120970,466,230,1167000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,Some sticky water stay-stay?
120971,466,231,1169000,Seymour Skinner,NELSON'S HOUSE,All bye-bye.
120973,466,233,1170000,Lisa Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Hi, Nelson."
120974,466,234,1173000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Lisa, I've been thinking and..."
120975,466,235,1173000,Milhouse Van Houten,NELSON'S HOUSE,It fell apart when I was trying to impress this cute girl... my gramma!
120976,466,236,1181000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,...Maybe I could use a little more school.
120977,466,237,1183000,Seymour Skinner,NELSON'S HOUSE,You can't break us up. We're like a family here.
120978,466,238,1186000,Seymour Skinner,NELSON'S HOUSE,Kearney and I are having brunch on Sunday.
120979,466,239,1188000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,NELSON'S HOUSE,If I'm up.
120980,466,240,1189000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Listen, what say we go back to the school? I'll help you out with a little micro-financing of my own."
120981,466,241,1196000,Seymour Skinner,NELSON'S HOUSE,Fifty dollars! I can buy paint for the art class instead of crushed-up berries I find in the woods!
120982,466,242,1201000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"And Lisa, I've got a little left that I'd like to spend on you."
120984,466,244,1207000,Lisa Simpson,ROLLER RINK,"This is really fun. But we're still just friends, right?"
120985,466,245,1212000,Nelson Muntz,ROLLER RINK,Right. Friends.
120986,466,246,1213000,Lisa Simpson,ROLLER RINK,Can I hold your hand... for balance?
120987,466,247,1215000,Nelson Muntz,ROLLER RINK,Sure... for balance.
