104879,404,40,204000,Jimbo Jones,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,"Oh, man, they just keep kicking off awards season earlier and earlier."
104880,404,41,215000,DOLPH,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,"Yeah, the whole thing's just a scam to sell ad space in the school paper."
104881,404,42,219000,Jimbo Jones,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,That's the place that did both my Grandmas.
104882,404,43,222000,DOLPH,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,I did both your grandmas.
104883,404,44,224000,Jimbo Jones,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,Shut up!
104884,404,45,226000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,Shall we look at the next one?

148664,404,49,239000,Marge's Thoughts,First National Bank of Springfield,Darn these long bank lines. Although it does give me a moment with my thoughts. Darn these long bank lines.
104888,404,50,254000,Marge Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,That old man over there isn't even making a transaction. He just wants someone to talk to!
104889,404,51,259000,Old Jewish Man,First National Bank of Springfield,"Before this was The Bank of Springfield, this was the Midwest Savings and Loan, and before that, it was an abandoned theater. And before that it was a theater!"
104890,404,52,270000,Dwight,First National Bank of Springfield,Where's Doctor Kevorkian when you need him?
104891,404,53,272000,Marge Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,"Well, if I know doctors, he's probably golfing."
104892,404,54,277000,Dwight,First National Bank of Springfield,Excuse me for a moment.
104893,404,55,279000,Dwight,First National Bank of Springfield,"Everyone down on the floor, now!"

104874,404,65,309000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,"Hmmm. Well, Marge, who's the unfit parent now?"
104903,404,66,316000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,"You know, a principal's dream would be to have a school with nothing but Lisa Simpsons. Unfortunately, the rest of you exist."
104904,404,67,324000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,From her grade grubbing to her apple polishing...
104906,404,69,331000,Leon Kompowsky,First National Bank of Springfield,"She's got a cell phone! We didn't plan for this, man! We didn't plan for this!"
104907,404,70,336000,Gil Gunderson,First National Bank of Springfield,Ol' Gil's here for his first day as security guard. Oh boy--

104914,404,77,370000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,And now the reason we're all here today... Lisa Simpson!
104915,404,78,379000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,"Oh, hello, Marge. I'm at the most important event of our daughter's life, and you're totally late. Am I disappointed? Yes. Am I surprised? No."
104917,404,80,390000,Marge Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,Homer! I'm a hostage in a bank robbery.
104918,404,81,394000,Homer Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,"What?! Oh my God, my sweet Margie! Okay, listen very carefully: don't do anything they say, remain panicky, and above all, try to be a hero."
104919,404,82,404000,Marge Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,"Homer, I have to go. If I don't make it, feel free to remarry -- from anyone on the list in the bulletin board in the closet."
104921,404,84,415000,Marge Simpson,Bank,"Goodbye, my love!"
104923,404,86,421000,Dwight,First National Bank of Springfield,"Okay, this isn't the way I planned it, but you can make it out alive as long as there's no funny stuff."
104924,404,87,426000,Krusty the Clown,First National Bank of Springfield,Don't worry about me. I was voted America's least funny clown.
104925,404,88,430000,Krusty the Clown,First National Bank of Springfield,"Worse than Scuzzo, Scummo, Oopsie, Carlos Mencia, Stinko, Blumpy... even worse than Sergeant Serious! How could I do worse than him?! I stole all his jokes!"
104926,404,89,443000,Homer Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,"Chief, you gotta do something -- my current wife is in there!"
104929,404,90,447000,Chief Wiggum,First National Bank of Springfield,"Maybe you should take over, 'cause I got no stake in this. This isn't even my bank. I'm over at First Federal."
104931,404,92,457000,Dwight,Bank,Dye pack! Man that stings.
104932,404,93,461000,Dwight,Bank,Dammit!
104933,404,94,463000,Dwight,Bank,What're you looking at? Huh?
104934,404,95,467000,Dwight,Bank,Is anyone else a dye pack? Tell me now and I won't shoot you.
104935,404,96,474000,Jasper Beardly,Bank,"You said ""diabetic"", right?"
104937,404,98,480000,Chief Wiggum,First National Bank of Springfield,"Finally! The help we need. A DVD of ""The Negotiator."""

104940,404,101,501000,Dwight,Bank,"Oh man, oh man -- what the hell's taking them so long? They must be getting ready to kill me!"
104941,404,102,506000,Agnes Skinner,Bank,"It's no fair, I shouldn't die. I just came here to check the date!"
104942,404,103,515000,Marge Simpson,Bank,"Dwight, use your noodle. If you surrender now, you're only looking at a few years in jail. I'll tell them you're a good guy."
104943,404,104,523000,Dwight,Bank,"Marge... I can't go back to prison. I've got no wife, I've got no family. I've got nothing!"
104944,404,105,535000,Dwight,Bank,If I give myself up... will you come visit me in the joint?
104945,404,106,543000,Krusty the Clown,Bank,"Hey, if I can say ""yes"" to Chinese toys that kill kids, you can say ""yes"" to him."
104946,404,107,550000,Marge Simpson,Bank,"Okay. I'll visit you, Dwight."
104948,404,109,562000,Homer Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,"Oh Marge, I was afraid I was going to lose you! Ohhh! Now let me help you make your slow transition back to society."
104949,404,110,571000,Marge Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,I just want to go home.
104950,404,111,574000,Homer Simpson,First National Bank of Springfield,You have a new home now... with us.
104951,404,112,578000,Dwight,First National Bank of Springfield,"See ya soon, Marge. Real soon! Just like you promised!"
104954,404,115,594000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetheart, what's wrong?"
104955,404,116,596000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I promised that bank robber that I'd visit him in jail. But I just can't do it.
104957,404,117,601000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't owe him anything. Moe was in the hospital for three weeks and I didn't visit him once.
104958,404,118,605000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You said you visited him every night.
104959,404,119,608000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Moe the tavern, not Moe the person."
104960,404,120,610000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, promises mean more to me."
104963,404,123,615000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,"Okay, you gave your word, you're going to visit him, no excuses."
104964,404,124,619000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,Ooh! Shlomo's Judaica is having a blowout on dreidels.
104965,404,125,628000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,"All right, this time I'm going. I'm really going to visit a bank robber. A man who held a gun on me. Going to see him in prison, where guards will frisk me, paw through my purse, and... Oooh, there's apple picking just up the road!"
104968,404,128,647000,Dwight,Springfield Prison,I'm getting a visitor today. I'm so nervous it feels like I keistered a bunch of butterflies.
104969,404,129,652000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Prison,"Dude, I highly doubt you're getting a visitor. People don't like you -- you come off needy and bug-eyed."
104970,404,130,658000,Dwight,Springfield Prison,You're wrong! Marge is coming. She is!
104971,404,131,661000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Prison,"Easy, bro, it's not like she's your mother."
104972,404,132,663000,Dwight,Springfield Prison,I wish she was. My real mother abandoned me in an amusement park. All I have left is a caricature from that day.
104973,404,133,669000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Prison,"Ooh, that's harsh."
104974,404,134,675000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Prison,"Hey, baby. Listen carefully. Someone's been editing my biography on Wikipedia. I want you to kill him."
104975,404,135,683000,Gloria,Springfield Prison,"No problem, sweetie. I'll dump his body in the same lake as your lousy lawyer. Then when you get out, we can have a picnic there!"
104976,404,136,690000,Snake Jailbird,Springfield Prison,"So, sweet..."
104977,404,137,695000,Dwight,Springfield Prison,Anyone for me?
104979,404,139,700000,Marge Simpson,APPLE ORCHARD,"I really shouldn't show up without an apple pie for Dwight. In fact, I really shouldn't show up without an apple pie for everyone at the prison."
104980,404,140,709000,Marge Simpson,APPLE ORCHARD,"Oh my, it's five o'clock! I missed visiting hours."
104982,404,142,718000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Perfect!
104984,404,143,720000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Look, Lisa. I put new filaments in all our burned-out light bulbs. Your father the millionaire thought we should throw these away."
104985,404,144,727000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Mom, I think there's something you're trying to avoid. Or someone."
104986,404,145,732000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Don't be silly, Lisa. In fact --"
104988,404,147,748000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Damn these sturdy foreign-built phones!

104993,404,152,760000,Ted Nugent,Springfield Prison,"Hello, this is Ted Nugent, the Motor City Madman, urging you to vote ""no"" on Proposition Eighty-seven. If we outlaw crossbows in our public schools, who's gonna protect our children from charging elk? Thank you for your time, and as always I say Wango! I say Tango!"
104996,404,155,779000,Announcer,Simpson Living Room,"We now return to ""A Kiss Before Frying."""
104998,404,157,784000,Father Donnelly,Prison Cell,"It's almost midnight. They'll be coming soon, Johnny. Coming to take you to the electric chair."
104999,404,158,790000,JOHNNY,Prison Cell,"I ain't afraid of old sparky, the hot seat, the kilowatt couch, the death davenport, the electric lap, the crook cooker, the scorch stool! I ain't afraid, see."
105000,404,159,799000,Father Donnelly,Prison Cell,"No Johnny, I don't see. You're goin' straight to Hell, you know."
105001,404,160,802000,JOHNNY,Prison Cell,"I ain't afraid 'cause my sainted Ma is comin' to visit before I go. And when I sit down on the jolt throne, I'll be lookin' into Ma's sweet face as my tongue explodes in my mouth and the goo boils in my eyes."
105002,404,161,814000,Marge Simpson,Prison Cell,"Oh, poor Johnny Stabbo..."
105004,404,163,842000,Dwight,Springfield Prison,Dammit!
105006,404,165,856000,JOHNNY,Simpson Home,"Ma! Ma! Where are ya, Ma?"
105007,404,166,858000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't give up hope, Johnny!"
105008,404,167,860000,Father Donnelly,Simpson Home,"Give up hope, Johnny. Your Ma ain't comin'."
105009,404,168,863000,Father Donnelly,Simpson Home,Now if I may do the honors...
105010,404,169,867000,JOHNNY,Simpson Home,Ma! Ma! Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--aaaaaaaa!

104956,404,175,938000,Senate Mouse,Simpson Home,You're disgracing America's pastime. You should be ashamed of yourself... what the...?
105015,404,176,974000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,We interrupt this Annie Award-winning cartoon for an important bulletin: convicted bank robber Dwight David Diddlehopper has escaped from Springfield Penitentiary.

105027,404,188,1041000,Marge Simpson,Street,Dwight?! I was just on my way to see you in prison.
105028,404,189,1047000,Dwight,Street,"Really, Marge? Look me in the eye and say that."
105029,404,190,1049000,Marge Simpson,Street,"Okay... they're so buggy, I can't!"
105031,404,192,1059000,Marge Simpson,Freeway,"Dwight, please, don't do anything crazy."
105032,404,193,1062000,Dwight,Freeway,Just pull over there.
105034,404,195,1067000,Marge Simpson,Freeway,"Um, What are we doing here?"
105035,404,196,1070000,Dwight,Freeway,This is where my Mom abandoned me.
105036,404,197,1073000,Marge Simpson,Freeway,"Oh, that's so sad."
105037,404,198,1075000,Dwight,Freeway,Ya think?
105039,404,200,1080000,Dwight,Amusement Park,"Marge, can you please give me the day my mother didn't? Ride some rides, eat some cotton candy... then I'll let you go home."
105040,404,201,1086000,Marge Simpson,Amusement Park,Okay. But I-I'd feel better about it if you got rid of the gun.
105041,404,202,1090000,Dwight,Amusement Park,I'd like to... but then you'll leave like she did.
105042,404,203,1092000,Marge Simpson,Amusement Park,Can you at least put it in your jacket?
105043,404,204,1095000,Dwight,Amusement Park,Fine. But I'm still gonna make that pointy shape.
105045,404,206,1101000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Park,Krusty! I haven't see you since that terrifying day.
105046,404,207,1105000,Krusty the Clown,Park,UH... You'll have to be way more specific.
105047,404,208,1109000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Park,We were hostages at the bank.
105048,404,209,1110000,Krusty the Clown,Park,Oh yeah. Sorry I offered your life for my safety.

105051,404,212,1126000,Krusty the Clown,Park,"Wait, something's screwy here. I'm callin' the cops."
105052,404,213,1130000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Park,"Don't bother, they're right over there."
105053,404,214,1132000,Chief Wiggum,Park,"Easy... easy. Line up your shot, then squeeze it off."
105054,404,215,1140000,Lou,Park,"Uh Chief, I think we got a hostage situation over there."
105055,404,216,1142000,Chief Wiggum,Park,Can't a man spend one minute with his stuffed monkey? One minute?
105056,404,217,1147000,Lou,Park,Monkey would make a better chief.
