24097,117,1,34000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"And now, to top off our most propane-explosion-free Science Week ever, our grand finale! The launching of a weather balloon."
24098,117,2,43000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Yay! Go weather balloon! Hurrah for science! Woo!
24099,117,3,47000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Hurrah for science, woo? I can't say I approve of the woo, but the hurrah was quite heartening. Release the balloon."
24100,117,4,56000,Nerds,Springfield Elementary School,Yayyyy!
24102,117,6,72000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Nooooooo!
24103,117,7,78000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I don't think I really captured the eyes.
24104,117,8,80000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, if you have a failing, it's that you're always demanding perfection. If you have a failing."
24105,117,9,86000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Whoever brings down that balloon doesn't have to learn fractions!
24106,117,10,94000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,Yayyy!
24107,117,11,94000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Careful children, that's my car."
24108,117,12,100000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Destroy that balloon.
24109,117,13,102000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Aye.
24111,117,15,105000,Pilot,FIGHTER COCKPIT,"Tango Fourteen, we're being fired at. I'm gettin' an exact ID on the bogie now."
24112,117,16,112000,Pilot,FIGHTER COCKPIT,Iraqis again. Launching Sidewinder missile.
24114,117,18,119000,Pilot,FIGHTER,Missed him. Launching second Sidewinder missile.
24116,117,20,127000,Pilot,Springfield Elementary School,This is what happens when you cut money out of the military and put it into health care.
24117,117,21,131000,Pilot #2,Springfield Elementary School,"It's a good program. Just give it a chance, that's all I ask."
24118,117,22,141000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,It won't come down for months. Curse the man who invented helium. Curse Pierre Jules Cesar Janssen! Now to find out who did this.
24119,117,23,150000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Bart? Empty your pockets.
24121,117,24,152000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Empty my pockets you say? Well, certainly, but I fail to see how..."
24122,117,25,158000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Hmmm... blueprints of the dummy, ... notarized photos of you making the dummy... and an alternate wording for the banner: ""Buttzilla."""
24123,117,26,166000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Race you to Utah, Milhouse."
24124,117,27,168000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Okay.
24125,117,28,170000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I am going to punish you for this, Bart. And it won't just be a simple caning this time."
24126,117,29,175000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Because you have impeded science, you must now aid science. Yes. Starting tomorrow, you will assist me with my amateur astronomy. Taking down coordinates, carrying equipment and so forth. Four-thirty in the morning."
24127,117,30,189000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,There's a four-thirty in the morning now?
24129,117,32,194000,Radio Announcer,Simpson Home,"Top of the hour. Time for the morning news. But, of course, there is no news yet. Everyone's still asleep. In their comfy, comfy beds. Good night everybody."
24130,117,33,207000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, will you make me breakfast?"
24131,117,34,209000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,There's a stuffed pepper in the trash from last night. Just rinse it good...
24132,117,35,216000,Small Boy,Simpson Home,"Come home, Lassie! Here boy! C'mon girl! Atta boy!"
24133,117,36,233000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Still dark. Better use the generator.
24135,117,38,250000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah, there's nothing more exciting than science. You get all the fun of sitting still, being quiet, writing down numbers, paying attention... Science has it all!"
24136,117,39,260000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Is that the telescope we're gonna be looking through?
24137,117,40,262000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, but you won't be looking through it. I forbid it. But you don't need a telescope to enjoy astronomy, Bart. There are all the constellations you've heard so much about."
24138,117,41,271000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,There's Orion... the Swan...the chariot race...
24139,117,42,275000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Why don't they look anything like their names?
24140,117,43,277000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, you do have to use your imagination. Look, there's the Three Wise Men."
24141,117,44,282000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Who names these things anyway?
24142,117,45,284000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Whoever discovers them. I've been hoping I could find something that would be named after me.
24120,117,46,288000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,And you've never found anything?
24144,117,47,290000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Once. But by the time I got to a phone, my discovery had already been reported by Principal Kohoutek. I got back at him though. Him and that little boy of his. Anyway... that's why I always keep a cellular phone next to me. Now, this morning we're gonna be mapping a small square of sky that's thought to be empty. It's my hope that it's not."
24145,117,48,310000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,So what am I supposed to do exactly?
24146,117,49,313000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Just write down my findings as I give them to you. Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, twenty-two minutes declination... No sighting."
24147,117,50,322000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Uh huh.
24148,117,51,323000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, twenty-three minutes declination... No sighting."
24149,117,52,331000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Uh huh.
24150,117,53,332000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Six hours, nineteen minutes right ascension, fourteen degrees fifty-eight minutes declination... No sighting. Did you get that one, Bart?"
24151,117,54,341000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Hell no.
24152,117,55,342000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Good... My stars! Give me the phone! Quick!
24154,117,57,348000,Female Astronomer,OBSERVATORY,Check out six-nineteen-fourteen-fifty-nine.
24156,117,59,359000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"No, no there's no need for that... it's already named after me."
24157,117,60,364000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"It's coming pretty close to the ground. Maybe I can catch it. Don't touch the telescope, Bart. Even a slight change in elevation can destroy a whole morning's work."
24158,117,61,378000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Woo! All hands on deck! Pirates off the port bow! Hey!
24159,117,62,391000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Observatory? This is Bart Simpson. I see something in the sky at... four, twelve, eight, and the last number is seven."
24160,117,63,403000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah got you, my rumpy doppelganger."
24161,117,64,409000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I've got it! What are you doing? Give me that phone.
24163,117,66,412000,Female Astronomer,OBSERVATORY,"Congratulations, Bart. You've just discovered a comet."
24165,117,68,416000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,NOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
24166,117,69,419000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,NOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
24167,117,70,426000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,NOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
24168,117,72,437000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,...And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.
24169,117,73,440000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sounds like you had a good day today, Dad."
24170,117,74,442000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, except I forgot to go to work."
24171,117,75,445000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"What did you do today, Bart?"
24172,117,76,448000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What didn't I do.
24173,117,77,450000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Boy Discovers Comet.
24174,117,78,450000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What!?
24175,117,79,453000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""A young Springfieldianite has discovered a new comet to be known as 'The Bart Simpson Comet.'"" Oh honey, I'm so proud of you."
24176,117,80,461000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"But then, you've always been proud of me."
24177,117,81,463000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes.
24179,117,83,471000,Ham,Springfield Elementary School,"Won't you join us, Bart?"
24180,117,84,476000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Uh... I guess so.
24181,117,85,479000,Database,Springfield Elementary School,"As the first student at Springfield Elementary to discover a comet, we're very proud to make you a member of our very select group. Welcome to SuperFriends!"
24182,117,86,491000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Huh?
24183,117,87,492000,Nerds,Springfield Elementary School,"Welcome, SuperFriend!"
24184,117,88,494000,Ham,Springfield Elementary School,"I am called ""Ham,"" since I enjoy ham radio. This is ""E-Mail,"" ""Cosine,"" ""Report Card,"" ""Database"" and ""Lisa"". Your nickname will be ""Cosmos."""
24185,117,89,510000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Well I'm done eating. Goodbye.
24186,117,90,512000,Nerds,Springfield Elementary School,Goodbye Cosmos! / Bye-bye!
24187,117,91,515000,Database,Springfield Elementary School,Perhaps some night you could show us your comet.
24188,117,92,517000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,There it is right there.
24189,117,93,518000,Database,Springfield Elementary School,"I make it a point never to turn my head unless I expect to see something, Bart. Naturally we can't see your comet in broad daylight and without a telescope."
24190,117,94,527000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,But you don't need a stupid telescope. It's right there.
24191,117,95,532000,E-Mail,Springfield Elementary School,Oh no no no no! This isn't right at all!
24192,117,96,535000,Database,Springfield Elementary School,It must be coming toward us at a fantastic speed.
24193,117,97,539000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Huh?
24194,117,98,539000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't you realize what's happening, Bart? Your comet is gonna collide with the earth and every living thing in its path will be killed."
24195,117,99,545000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I knew you'd try to find something wrong with my comet Lisa. You've always been petty and small. Right from the beginning.
24196,117,100,551000,Report Card,Springfield Elementary School,We must alert the proper authorities.
24197,117,101,553000,E-Mail,Springfield Elementary School,To the observatory!
24199,117,103,560000,SUPERFRIENDS,OBSERVATORY,We are the SuperFriends...
24200,117,104,562000,Bart Simpson,OBSERVATORY,"Hey, shut up."
24201,117,105,569000,Male Astronomer,OBSERVATORY,Dear God.
24202,117,106,570000,Female Astronomer,OBSERVATORY,"Warren, we've talked about you hogging the eyepiece."
24204,117,108,578000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield,Sounds like the Doomsday Whistle. Ain't been blown for nigh on to three years.
24205,117,109,585000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield,Trouble a brewin'.
24207,117,111,588000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Fellow citizens, when I learned about the impending crisis, I caught the very next plane to Springfeld - field."
24208,117,112,598000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"First of all, yes, there is a comet in the sky, and yes, it is going to hit Springfield."
24209,117,113,606000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"You uh, don't need to applaud that. Now, here's what we think the impact might look like. Show them, Jerry."
24210,117,114,618000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"Oh dear God, no!"
24211,117,115,623000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Fortunately we have a plan. Professor Frink?
24212,117,116,626000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Town Hall,"Good evening, ladies and..."
24213,117,117,628000,Panicked Man,Springfield Town Hall,Quit stalling! What's the plan?!
24214,117,118,630000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Town Hall,"Alright, just take your seat, just take your seat."
24215,117,119,632000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Town Hall,"Now, working with former Carter Administration officials and military men who were forced into early retirement for various reasons, which we won't go into here , we have planned this defense for the city."
24216,117,120,643000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Springfield Town Hall,"As the comet hurtles toward the city, our rocket will intercept it and blow it to smithereens."
24217,117,121,651000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"Oh, dear God, no!"
24218,117,122,653000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,...and that will be the end of Mr. Comet.
24219,117,123,653000,Townspeople,Springfield Town Hall,Yay! / We're saved! / Etc.
24222,117,126,669000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed. Didn't you hear what the guy in the building said?
24223,117,127,675000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"But, Dad, don't you think..."
24225,117,128,677000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rain forest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. Didn't they?"
24226,117,129,689000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"No, Dad, I don't think..."
24227,117,130,691000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,There's that word again.
24230,117,133,715000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, what if this doesn't work?"
24231,117,134,717000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well then, I have a back-up plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
24232,117,135,731000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, the plan!"
24233,117,136,733000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm getting to that. So anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
24234,117,137,743000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad!
24235,117,138,743000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
24236,117,139,753000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Daaad, they're firing the rocket!"
24237,117,140,757000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right!
24238,117,141,774000,Townspeople,Simpson Home,YAYYYY!
24239,117,142,774000,Townspeople,Simpson Home,Gllllll.
24240,117,143,774000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It blew up the bridge!
24241,117,144,775000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,We're doomed!
24242,117,145,777000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's at times like this I wish I were a religious man.
24243,117,146,780000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"It's all over, people! We don't have a prayer!"
24244,117,147,798000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"And, like Icarus, the rocket foolishly soared too high and lost control of its servo-guidance mechanism, leaving us with some... six hours to live. So! Let's go live now to the charred remains of the only bridge out of town, with Arnie Pye and ""Arnie In The Sky."""
24245,117,148,816000,Arnie Pye,Simpson Home,"With the bridge gone, and the airport unfortunately on the other side of the bridge, a number of citizens are attempting to jump the gorge with their cars."
24246,117,149,823000,Arnie Pye,Simpson Home,"It's a silent testament to the ""never give up"" and ""never think things out"" spirit of our citizens."
24247,117,150,830000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"With our utter annihilation imminent, our Federal Government has snapped into action. We go live now via satellite to the floor of the United States Congress ..."
24224,117,153,839000,Congressman #1,House Of Representative,Then it is unanimous. We are going to approve the bill to evacuate the town of Springfield in the great state of...
24251,117,154,848000,Congressman #2,House Of Representative,"Wait a second, I want to tack on a rider to that bill. Thirty million dollars of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts."
24252,117,155,854000,Congressman #1,House Of Representative,All in favor of the amended Springfield-slash-Pervert bill?
24253,117,156,860000,Congress,House Of Representative,Boo!
24254,117,157,860000,Congressman #1,House Of Representative,Bill defeated.
24255,117,158,862000,Kent Brockman,House Of Representative,"I've said it before and I'll say it again. Democracy simply doesn't work. Now, over the years, a newsman learns a number of things that, for one reason or another, he just cannot report. It doesn't seem to matter now, so... the following people are gay."
24256,117,159,873000,Marge Simpson,House Of Representative,Turn it off.
24257,117,160,880000,Homer Simpson,House Of Representative,Just a second.
24258,117,161,885000,Homer Simpson,House Of Representative,"What's everyone so worked up about? So there's a comet. Big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head."
24259,117,162,894000,Bart Simpson,House Of Representative,"Wow, Dad. Maybe you're right."
24260,117,163,896000,Homer Simpson,House Of Representative,"Of course I'm right. If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow."
24262,117,165,903000,Homer Simpson,House Of Representative,"Okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb shelter."
24263,117,166,908000,Lisa Simpson,House Of Representative,We have a bomb shelter?
24264,117,167,910000,Homer Simpson,House Of Representative,Homer Simpson takes care of his family.
24266,117,169,914000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Backyard,Flanders! Open up!
24267,117,170,917000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Backyard,"Hi-de-ho-e-roonie, neighbor. What can I do you for?"
24268,117,171,920000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Backyard,Get out of there. My family needs to use your bomb shelter.
24269,117,172,923000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Backyard,Homer!
24270,117,173,924000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Backyard,"I kinda figured this might happen, so I built the shelter big enough for both our families."
24271,117,174,928000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Backyard,No deal. Out.
24272,117,175,929000,Marge Simpson,Flanders Backyard,"Get in the shelter, Homer."
24274,117,177,957000,Marge Simpson,BOMB SHELTER,One more hour.
24275,117,178,958000,Homer Simpson,BOMB SHELTER,An hour! I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet?
24276,117,179,965000,Homer Simpson,BOMB SHELTER,THERE it is.
24277,117,180,969000,Ned Flanders,BOMB SHELTER,"Well, Howdilly doodilly neighbors. Shouldn't you be in your sheltereenees by now?"
24278,117,181,975000,Moe Szyslak,BOMB SHELTER,We haven't got sheltereenees. We want in yours.
24279,117,182,978000,Ned Flanders,BOMB SHELTER,"Well sorry, the shelter's kinda full."
24280,117,183,981000,Moe Szyslak,BOMB SHELTER,"Really? Oh. Well, we'll just go off someplace and die then. Thanks."
24281,117,184,989000,Ned Flanders,BOMB SHELTER,Wait!
24282,117,185,990000,Ned Flanders,BOMB SHELTER,"I may regret this when our air runs out and we can't whistle or stay alive, but oh, what the hey..."
24284,117,187,1002000,Krusty the Clown,BOMB SHELTER,All right!
24285,117,188,1002000,Homer Simpson,BOMB SHELTER,I can't get the... I can't get the door closed. Somebody's going to have to get out.
24286,117,189,1008000,Lisa Simpson,BOMB SHELTER,"I'd get out, but I don't know where I am."
24287,117,190,1011000,Barney Gumble,BOMB SHELTER,"Hey, somebody's touching me."
24288,117,191,1013000,Seymour Skinner,BOMB SHELTER,I am.
24289,117,192,1014000,Barney Gumble,BOMB SHELTER,"Oh, okay."
24290,117,193,1015000,Krusty the Clown,BOMB SHELTER,"Okay, okay, let's figure out who should stay. Let's see... the world of the future will need laughter, so I'm in."
24291,117,194,1024000,Moe Szyslak,BOMB SHELTER,"And it will need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. me. Um, and someone will have to run the power. Uh, you can do that, Homer."
24292,117,195,1031000,Homer Simpson,BOMB SHELTER,"Uh, yeah. I can do that."
24293,117,196,1038000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,BOMB SHELTER,"Okay, let's start again. We'll need laughter, religious enlightenment, gossip -- that's Mrs. Lovejoy..."
