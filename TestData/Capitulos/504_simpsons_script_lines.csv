130786,504,44,251000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Mall,"Well count me out, Jimbo. I don't need to hear how every chick in the movie got what was coming to them."
130787,504,45,257000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Mall,"Shauna, food for thought: if we don't watch movies about torture in crawl spaces, how will we know what to do if someone puts us in a torture crawl space?"
130788,504,46,266000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Mall,"Not if, when."
130789,504,47,268000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Mall,"Nah, I'm gonna go see one of those Jennifer Aniston movies where she rolls her eyes on the poster."
130790,504,48,274000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Mall,"Babe, you know I don't want you watching a movie by yourself. You're a total perv magnet."

130802,504,60,323000,Jennifer Aniston,"""ALL THE WRONG REASONS"" MOVIE THEATER",Are you telling me the real reason you started dating me was so you could buy my flower shop?
130803,504,61,329000,Handsome Funny Guy,"""ALL THE WRONG REASONS"" MOVIE THEATER",Yes. Your lease was the last thing stopping me from tearing this place down and building the biggest horse crematorium in Manhattan. But none of that matters now.
130804,504,62,340000,Shauna Chalmers,"""ALL THE WRONG REASONS"" MOVIE THEATER","All right, we've seen his ass. Let's go."

130808,504,66,353000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Hey, nametag! Do you know who her boyfriend is? Jimbo Jones!"
130809,504,67,358000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Springfield Mall,I gotta go sort tortillas.
130810,504,68,359000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Springfield Mall,"Corn, flour, corn, corn, no gluten, corn, two stuck together?! Now I've gotta fill out a form."
130811,504,69,366000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Listen lady, you do not two-time the man with the skull t-shirt."
130812,504,70,369000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Mall,Jimbo doesn't care about me -- he didn't even notice my side braid!
130813,504,71,374000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Oh, that is cool. Looks like two snakes trying to kill each other on your head."
130814,504,72,378000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Mall,"That's what I was going for! You know, for a second grader, you're pretty sharp."
130815,504,73,382000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"I'm actually in fourth grade, but I read at a second grade level. They think I might have a ""problem."""
130817,504,75,390000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Mall,Why did I see that movie the day before I have to clean the crawlspace?
130818,504,76,394000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"C'mon, boy. We've gotta go home. I saved big bucks on the delivery charges."
130820,504,78,402000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,I gotta go -- he's my ride.
130821,504,79,405000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Mall,"Not so fast, Simpson. F.Y.I., you got another ""date"" tomorrow with Shauna."
130822,504,80,411000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Why can't you do it?
130823,504,81,412000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Mall,"We're going to a seminar: ""Extracting Lunch Money from a Cashless Society."""
130824,504,82,412000,DOLPH,Springfield Mall,We're gonna rob the guy givin' the seminar.
130825,504,83,419000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Mall,Bart and I'll figure out something.

130827,504,85,426000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,Ahhh. Doesn't get any better than this.
130829,504,87,431000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Huh, that's weird, my armpits are gettin' wet."
130830,504,88,436000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, the TV's hooked up to the internet! You can stream whole seasons of old TV shows."

130838,504,96,447000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Stranded?"" What's that?"
130839,504,97,448000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Stranded"" was a show about people marooned on a mysterious island that's riddled with religious and scientific paradoxes. It was huge! Well, the first season and the last season."
130840,504,98,458000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, islands are always entertaining, from Gilligan to Iwo Jima."
130841,504,99,467000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A plane crash!
130843,504,101,471000,Homer Simpson,BASEMENT,Wait a minute... that flashback raised more questions than it answered?!

130851,504,109,521000,Guard,Springfield Mall,"Young lady, I need to check your purse."
130852,504,110,523000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Mall,I didn't steal nothin'.
130853,504,111,525000,Thought Bubble Jimbo,Springfield Mall,If anything happens to her I'll beat you up from inside your brain.
130854,504,112,534000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,I stole this...
130855,504,113,535000,Guard,Springfield Mall,You stole perfume?
130856,504,114,536000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Uh, yeah, me. I use it all the time."
130857,504,115,540000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,MI-MI-MI-MI-MI...
130858,504,116,542000,Guard,Springfield Mall,YOU-YOU-YOU-YOU and I are taking a trip to mall jail.
130859,504,117,546000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Isn't that what used to be the Beanie Baby store?
130860,504,118,548000,Guard,Springfield Mall,Shut up!
130862,504,120,555000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Mall,This is so cool. You took a fall for me. No one's done anything for me before. Uh-oh.
130863,504,121,561000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Don't worry. I made sure he can't get too far.
130864,504,122,565000,Guard,Springfield Mall,I'd use my legs but I've forgotten how!
130865,504,123,566000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Mall,Come with me.
130867,504,125,569000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Hey, the first time we lost Maggie was in this store."
130868,504,126,572000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Mall,"Bart, here's my thank-you gift."
130869,504,127,575000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,What could a girl have that I--
130889,504,128,578000,Bart's Thoughts,Springfield Mall,Oh my God! It's just like Dad's!
130871,504,130,589000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, you haven't touched your mashed potatoes."
130872,504,131,593000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,More breast?
130873,504,132,595000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No!
130874,504,133,596000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm offerin' ya a chicken breast, ya boob!"
130875,504,134,599000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Doesn't anyone here realize I'm only ten years old?
130876,504,135,602000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, no dinner means no dessert."
130877,504,136,605000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm just not ready for cookies!
130878,504,137,607000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, I should get back to the treadmill."
130880,504,139,612000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"He exercises so much, but he looks the same. I guess the weight will all come off at once some day in the future."
130881,504,140,619000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't you believe anything Homer says. His first word was a lie!
148187,504,141,625000,Young Grampa,Simpson Home,Who did this?
130882,504,142,627000,1-Year-Old Homer,Simpson Home,Mommy.
148188,504,143,628000,Young Grampa,Simpson Home,She did?! Then I'm gonna withhold affection without telling her why!
130883,504,144,647000,Strange Man,Simpson Home,"Don't believe anything you were told by me in the past, because that was not me! But this is me now, but in less than a second I will be gone forever."
130884,504,145,655000,Strange Man,Simpson Home,I might be back!
130885,504,146,661000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The lava being! That's why they showed a clip of it on ""previously on."""
130886,504,147,662000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer!
130887,504,148,667000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're using your expensive new treadmill just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago? And when I wanted to watch it with you then, you said it was pretentious and repetitive!"
130888,504,149,678000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, there're so many mysteries that I need to have solved."
130890,504,150,681000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, if the Korean couple can't speak English, why were they doing a crossword puzzle where the answer to twenty-three down was ""enigma"" spelled backwards? What does it mean?"
130891,504,151,692000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It means use the treadmill for running or take it back!
130892,504,152,696000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And where will I watch TV?
130893,504,153,698000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,On the TV!
130894,504,154,699000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And where will I walk?
130895,504,155,701000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,On the ground!
130896,504,156,702000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And where...
130897,504,157,702000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This is the stupidest fight ever!
130898,504,158,706000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We've had stupider!
130899,504,159,707000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think so.
130901,504,161,711000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Hey Fart-tholomew, you did a sweet job watching my woman yesterday."
130903,504,163,719000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"So, what do you want to do now?"
130904,504,164,721000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,What any boy would: push you in a puddle and run away.
130905,504,165,723000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Maybe I should be faithful to Jimbo. He's bought me a lot of gum over the past couple months.
130906,504,166,728000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Listen... I could get wedgied for this, but Jimbo's a jerk. You can do better."
130907,504,167,734000,Shauna Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Wow. You told me what's best for me... at risk to yourself. Come with me.
130908,504,168,739000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Shauna, I forgot to grope you goodbye."
130911,504,171,751000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,At last! This episode promises to finally answer one question!
130912,504,172,757000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie!
130914,504,174,757000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The kids are away and Maggie's napping...
130915,504,175,763000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, that's great! Can it wait another hundred and four hours?"
130916,504,176,767000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,She walked away and slammed the door. What does it mean? What does it mean?
130917,504,177,773000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It means I'm mad!
130918,504,178,775000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh that's such a first-take answer!
130919,504,179,798000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"This one's yours, Ralphie."
130920,504,180,836000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,"Simpson, I guess you don't have much respect for me."
130922,504,181,840000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, who wears a wool hat to a pool?"
130923,504,182,848000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not fair! You know that's hilarious!
130924,504,183,855000,Lifeguard,Simpson Home,No horseplay in the pool area!
130925,504,184,857000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,"This isn't ""play"" -- this is some serious payback."
130926,504,185,861000,Lifeguard,Simpson Home,"Well that's, um... Alright, you may have found a loophole. I, I better check... Hello, Abby? I'm not calling about the shift change. God! But, well, since you bring it up, if there's a way to flip Saturday with next Wednesday..."
130927,504,186,874000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,"Simpson, prepare to--"
130928,504,187,874000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,We see Bart running frantically toward the exit.
130929,504,188,878000,Lifeguard,Simpson Home,"Hey, no running on the deck!"
130930,504,189,880000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm on the grass apron!
130931,504,190,883000,Lifeguard,Simpson Home,Everyone's a swimming pool lawyer.
130933,504,192,912000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Oh, thank God! Mom will pound them!"
130934,504,193,914000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Why, if it isn't Jimbo, Dorf and Ernie."
130935,504,194,918000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Evergreen Terrace,Dorf.
130936,504,195,920000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Bart's not home yet, but I'm always looking to encourage non-Milhouse play-dates. Stick around!"
130937,504,196,927000,Shauna Chalmers,Evergreen Terrace,"Hey, Bart."
130938,504,197,928000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Oh, it's you."
130939,504,198,928000,Shauna Chalmers,Evergreen Terrace,Why do men always think with their tongue? I came to help you.
130940,504,199,934000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Then go back to Jimbo and show him every boob you've got.
130941,504,200,937000,Shauna Chalmers,Evergreen Terrace,But you told me he was a jerk and that I could do better!
130942,504,201,945000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"All right. Follow me, to a place where nerds, dorks and dweebs can gather in safety."
130943,504,202,950000,Shauna Chalmers,Evergreen Terrace,"This isn't, like, some creepy place under an off-ramp?"
130944,504,203,954000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Okay, we'll go to my second choice."
130945,504,204,957000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Now you be careful with Bart's undies.
130946,504,205,960000,Jimbo Jones,Evergreen Terrace,"We will, Mrs. Simpson."
130948,504,207,964000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Think of this as your personal Asgard, and I, the all-seeing Heimdall, guardian of the gate."
130949,504,208,969000,Shauna Chalmers,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"All-seeing? Yeah, when's the last time you saw your feet?"
130950,504,209,973000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Oh, that's it!"
130951,504,210,974000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Fellow bullies -- I've got them!
130952,504,211,977000,Jimbo Jones,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,We'll be right there.
130953,504,212,979000,Bart Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,You're a bully?
130954,504,213,981000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"A cyber bully. In anything I do, it's important that I can lie down while doing it."
130956,504,215,986000,Shauna Chalmers,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,You just got yourself in a flame war with... a teenage girl.
130957,504,216,991000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Oh, flame on!"
130958,504,217,1002000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Ooh! Ooh! You have cloven me from my ponytail to my slipper shoe! Get out. And never return! Oh, unless you want to buy old Archie comics. Twenty-pound bricks are a dollar."
130960,504,219,1016000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thank you all for coming to my ""Stranded"" discussion group!"
130961,504,220,1020000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I loved that show. Wasn't it awesome when Colonel Darkwater--"
130962,504,221,1024000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Spoiler alert! I've only seen up to season three, episode seventeen: ""Coconut Cream Die."""
130963,504,222,1025000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,So you don't know that Season Five was a complete wank.
130964,504,223,1033000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Spoiler!
130965,504,224,1035000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"Homer, calm down. It's not like any of this stuff really took place."
130966,504,225,1041000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Spoil-er!
130967,504,226,1042000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, for God sakes, I'm trying to put Maggie to sleep!"
130968,504,227,1046000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, sweetie. It's just a Strandie discussion group. Yes it is! We discuss why airplane go crash-crash, but people don't die-die."
130969,504,228,1057000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You wanna know what happens on your stupid show? Firstly, the ""mysterious island"" is fifteen miles from Long Beach. Also, Doorway Three led to Hell despite the series creators' repeated insistence it did not lead to Hell, and the entire Strandedverse is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box!"
130970,504,229,1076000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, Marge. You ruined my show. Now I'm going to give you a spoiler about our marriage: it's not great right now."
130972,504,231,1088000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"Well, since this is a discussion group... uh, let's discuss."
130973,504,232,1091000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,I think they're having a spat.
130974,504,233,1093000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,I'd say it's more of a tiff.
130975,504,234,1094000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"So I'm a moron, am I?"
130977,504,235,1096000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"Fellas, fellas, I know where this is going. Give me all your weapons now."
130978,504,236,1103000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,Now it's time to talk about what Carl wants.
130979,504,237,1117000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Man, they have every entrance covered. You'd have to be a Navy Seal to get in or out."
130980,504,238,1122000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, lovebirds."
130981,504,239,1124000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you doing here?
130982,504,240,1127000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've been following your storyline from afar, Bart, waiting for that inevitable point where you get into trouble you couldn't get out of. Perhaps I could broker a settlement."
130983,504,241,1136000,Shauna Chalmers,Simpson Home,"Well, that's my boyfriend, but he's a wad. And your brother's not a wad, he's a dink on the road to doofus."
130984,504,242,1141000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hear, hear!"
130985,504,243,1144000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,The lamb has returned to the slaughter.
130987,504,245,1147000,DOLPH,Bart's Treehouse,"You should write that down, man."
130988,504,246,1149000,Jimbo Jones,Bart's Treehouse,I'll remember it.
130989,504,247,1152000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I don't think Shauna should choose any of you. Shauna should choose Shauna.
130990,504,248,1156000,Shauna Chalmers,Bart's Treehouse,"Your older sister's right, Bart."
130991,504,249,1159000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,You don't want me?
130992,504,250,1160000,Shauna Chalmers,Bart's Treehouse,I wanna find out who I am. And that's something only an inappropriately older man can tell me.
130993,504,251,1166000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Well, that is one lucky creepy guy."
130994,504,252,1170000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Lisa, are you out there in your slippers? Come inside!"
130995,504,253,1174000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Well Bart, I guess that's our cue to skedaddle..."
130996,504,254,1176000,Jimbo Jones,Bart's Treehouse,"Not so fast, Simpson... What was that thing I was gonna do to him?"
130997,504,255,1180000,DOLPH,Bart's Treehouse,Told you you should've written it down.
130998,504,256,1182000,Jimbo Jones,Bart's Treehouse,"If I wrote down everything you told me to write down, I'd have no time for punching."
130999,504,257,1188000,DOLPH,Bart's Treehouse,"Whoa, you should write that down, man."
131001,504,259,1192000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lousy Marge... ruining the delicate relationship between a man and his TV show... I'd tell my best friend, but that's Marge too..."
131002,504,260,1202000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, come in the bedroom."
131005,504,263,1207000,Marge Simpson,Bedroom,"Care to join me in a private ""last episode party""?"
131006,504,264,1212000,Homer Simpson,Bedroom,Well...
131007,504,265,1214000,Bart Simpson,Bedroom,"It's okay, Dad. He's just putting the fear of God in me."
131008,504,266,1218000,Homer Simpson,Bedroom,"Okay, but if this house starts a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'."
131009,504,267,1221000,Jimbo Jones,Bedroom,"Have a wonderful evening, sir."
131011,504,269,1241000,Giant Cat,Bedroom,"Purr-plexing, isn't it?"
