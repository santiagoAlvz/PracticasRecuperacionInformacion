117723,455,10,90000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, that concludes... I don't really know what that was. Now please take out your homework."
117724,455,11,96000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Homework? What homework?
117726,455,12,98000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,We had to build a Hopi Indian pueblo.
117727,455,13,100000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,Mine features indigenous Hopi songs.
117728,455,14,103000,Hopi Singers,Springfield Elementary School,NA HI HIE HO HEY...!
117729,455,15,107000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,What's this? A promoter has arrived to entice the tribe to perform in a wild west show!
117730,455,16,115000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"Unfortunately, the chief doesn't read the contract very carefully."
117731,455,17,121000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"The good news is, over a hundred years later, a brilliant little boy receives an ""A"" for his amazing presentation."
117733,455,19,132000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Bravo, Martin! Bravo!"
117734,455,20,134000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Well let's see what the rest of you dullards have to offer.
117735,455,21,140000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Uh-oh.
117737,455,23,146000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Dammit! Okay, don't panic. I can build one of those things from the crap in my desk."
117738,455,24,152000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart Simpson, you've had three months to do this project, you started thirty seconds ago."
117739,455,25,156000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Thank you. Thank you.
117740,455,26,158000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm not complimenting you! You've destroyed every ideal I've had about teaching since I saw ""To Sir, With Love"" as a little girl."
117741,455,27,165000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Haw haw, you're old!"
117742,455,28,167000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,I saw it on video in the '80s!
117743,455,29,169000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Outdated medium -- I stand by my ""haw haw."""
117744,455,30,172000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, I'm sending your parents a letter."
117745,455,31,174000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"""Irresponsible..."" ""unprepared..."" ""bad seed..."""
117746,455,32,174000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Good guy...
117747,455,33,179000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,...bad guy. Signed... ...stamped...and sealed.
117748,455,34,185000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"So, can I deliver that to the office for you?"
117749,455,35,189000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Ha! I wasn't born yesterday.
117750,455,36,192000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Ha! Tell me about it!
117751,455,37,195000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Martin?
117752,455,38,197000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Outgoing mail slot. Now.
148679,455,39,200000,Bart's Thoughts,Springfield Elementary School,Gotta stop that letter!
117753,455,40,207000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Fire alarm! Ooo, that means firemen!"
117725,455,42,220000,Bart Simpson,Hallway,Sixth-graders! Nooooooo!
117754,455,43,223000,6th Graders,Hallway,Training bra. / I have an unwanted boner.
117757,455,46,242000,Bart Simpson,Hallway,Yes!
117758,455,47,246000,Groundskeeper Willie,Hallway,"Hoistin' a bag. Ay, there's no better feelin' on earth."
117760,455,49,254000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Now what are you up to?
117761,455,50,256000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whatever happened to ""hi?"""
117762,455,51,258000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hi. Now what are you up to?
117763,455,52,260000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,A letter's comin' from school and I need to be home to keep Mom and Dad from getting it.
117764,455,53,265000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Mommm! I have a fever!
117765,455,54,272000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, a hundred and three! No school today."
117766,455,55,278000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Then again, there's only one way to get a truly accurate reading."
117767,455,56,281000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, pants."
117768,455,57,282000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Just close your eyes and think of Milhouse.
117769,455,58,289000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Yup. One-oh-three on the dot. You're stayin' home.
117770,455,59,291000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How did you--
117771,455,60,291000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't want to talk about it.
117772,455,61,294000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I've gotta get that letter before Mom and Dad do. Stay focused...
117773,455,62,300000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Focused...
117774,455,63,302000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Focused...
117775,455,64,304000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Focused...
117778,455,67,315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Credit card offer, overdue bill... credit card offer, overdue bill... huh, what's this?"
117779,455,68,322000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What the... you're a month behind on homework?!
117780,455,69,325000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I tried really hard to stop you from finding out. Does that help?
117781,455,70,329000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A little!
117783,455,72,331000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"These are Bart's uncompleted homework assignments for the last month: worksheets, problem sets, book reports, math jumbles, dioramas, topic sentences, conclusions, bibliographies, synonyms, mean-the-sames, define-a-likes, word twins and one Thanksgiving hand-turkey."
117784,455,73,346000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,One month? That's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.
117785,455,74,349000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I say this boy needs more homework.
117786,455,75,351000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I don't have to do it with him, do I?"
116684,455,76,354000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,No.
117787,455,77,355000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Pile it on! I want him to be Korean by the time he's done.
117789,455,79,365000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm. Clean dishes. I either have to unload them, or, uh..."
117791,455,81,380000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Thanks for doing the dishes.
117792,455,82,384000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No problem. You can unload.
117793,455,83,386000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Y'know -- I think Bart might have too much homework. If they keep overwhelming him, he might be turned off school forever."
117794,455,84,393000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh my! A child who doesn't enjoy school? Hello? Hollywood?! You want to buy the movie rights to this incredible story? A million dollars? Deal! Now I have to write it.
117795,455,85,408000,Anime Kid,Simpson Home,Digibot! Go-go-goman has the crystal life ball!
117797,455,87,414000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, how does this show stay so fresh?"
117798,455,88,416000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey! You're supposed to be doing your homework! No more TV for you!
117799,455,89,427000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Until your homework is done, the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair."
117800,455,90,438000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's okay, Bart. Just do a couple vocabulary words, then come have some milk and cookies."
117801,455,91,443000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But Dad said I had to finish--
117802,455,92,445000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Never mind what he said. You just listen to me.
117804,455,94,451000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Hey Lis. Mom and Dad just told me two different things. How is that possible?
117805,455,95,456000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Well, sometimes people who agree on most things have one issue that they disagree strongly about. In politics it's called a ""wedge issue"" -- like illegal immigration or gay marriage."
117806,455,96,465000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Wait a minute. Can I play them against each other so I don't have to do any homework at all?
117807,455,97,471000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,You would mess up Mom and Dad's marriage just to get out of doing some homework?
117808,455,98,476000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Hey, hey, I would end all life on this planet just to get out of doing fractions."
117809,455,99,480000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Fractions aren't that hard, you just have to find a common denominator. For example: one half plus one third equals..."
117810,455,100,486000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,End. All. Life. On. This. Planet.
117811,455,101,492000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,You'll need to know fractions to make that explosion!
116803,455,102,495000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,I don't care!
117812,455,104,506000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,So much homework... childhood slipping away...
117814,455,106,514000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! Put down those books and go play this instant!
117815,455,107,517000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,If you say so.
117816,455,108,524000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Right on time. Grape soda -- shaken, not stirred."
117817,455,109,530000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Let's roll.
117819,455,111,534000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Dear Lord, please give my stubborn husband the wisdom to see that I am right as usual."
117820,455,112,541000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Too late, Marge. I already used a ""prayer block"" on your prayer."
117821,455,113,545000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,There's no such thing as prayer blocks!
117822,455,114,547000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Yeah, right."
117825,455,117,592000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, why aren't you doing your homework!"
117826,455,118,594000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I said he could take a break.
117827,455,119,596000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The violence really relaxes me.
117828,455,120,598000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't get to relax till you get to the bottom of this homework stack.
117829,455,121,602000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't contradict me in front of our son!
117830,455,122,604000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Well don't be wrong in front of our son!
117832,455,124,608000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah? Well .
117834,455,126,608000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Let's have lunch at ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Eggroll."""
117835,455,127,620000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,No line... near the men's room... I see no reason to question your choice.
117836,455,128,626000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Smooth move, Mom -- tricking Dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn't serve beer."
117837,455,129,631000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,What the?! Then I wanna eat at Moe's Express!
117838,455,130,634000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Mall,"By ""express"" I mean you express your anger and hatred."
117839,455,131,638000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,The last time you ate there you spent three nights in the mall jail!
117840,455,132,641000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"That was last week, and you're still bringing it up!"
117841,455,133,644000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper!"
117842,455,134,647000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,Well how could I ever hit the hamper if you don't let me practice!
117843,455,135,650000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,You practiced all day on my birthday!
117844,455,136,652000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Fine. I was gonna apologize, but now I'm not going to!"
117845,455,137,655000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,You were never going to apologize!
117846,455,138,657000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,I was too! The words were in my brain!
117847,455,139,658000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,You're wrong! And whenever you're wrong you just sprout gibberish.
117849,455,141,668000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,Congratulations. You're officially a sociopath.
117850,455,142,672000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Hey, at least I'm on a path."
117852,455,144,674000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't mind if you pee in the shower, but only if you're taking a shower!"
117853,455,145,677000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No freedom! I have no freedom around this house! After sex, I'm not talking to you!"
117854,455,146,683000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well then there won't be any sex!
117855,455,147,685000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You can't sex fire me, I sex quit!"
148633,455,149,696000,Homer's Thoughts,Master Bathroom,Got to stay mad. The next morning is where the fight is won or lost.
117874,455,150,700000,Marge's Thoughts,Master Bathroom,"Freeze him out. It's cold in Marge's doghouse, baby."
117858,455,152,706000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I just think when two people disagree, the big jerk ought to apologize."
117859,455,153,711000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"You know Marge, Maude and I had a fight right before she died..."
117861,455,155,716000,Maude Flanders,Flanders Home,"Neddy, when you're drying your hands with our monogrammed towels, can you use the ""NF"" towel, not the ""MF""?"
117862,455,156,723000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"You know, maybe I should use a towel marked ""B.D.D."" -- big diddily deal!"
117864,455,158,729000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,I play that fight over in my mind a thousand times a day.
117866,455,160,735000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Must win fight... must win fight...
117867,455,161,740000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Let me say to you all: I'm pretty sure this is not a dream!
117868,455,162,746000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh my God, I killed her!"
117871,455,165,749000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Office,"I've got to apologize. Once again, sleeping at work has saved my marriage!"
117873,455,167,755000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,Compromise has no place in a marriage. Stick to your guns!
117875,455,168,759000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,"And if he leaves, you'll be free and happy like us."
117876,455,169,763000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,Yes. Happy.
117877,455,170,765000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,So happy.
117878,455,171,773000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I'm going to find my husband. But don't depress the kids.
117879,455,172,780000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Living Room,That pacifier's the last true friend you'll have.
117881,455,174,785000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Must apologize. Must apologize.
117882,455,175,799000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,I'm sorry we ever fought.
117883,455,176,801000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,We can't let Bart drive us apart. He's the reason we had to get married.
117884,455,177,806000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,"Till the two of us are back on track, Bart can fend for himself."
117885,455,178,810000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Bart? Bart who? I'm being cute.
117886,455,179,814000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,It's working!
117887,455,180,820000,Chief Wiggum,Homer's Car,"Put down some flares, boys. We're gonna be here a while."
117889,455,182,831000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Awesome breakfast, Marge! Breakfast in bed is so much better than breakfast in a chair."
117890,455,183,839000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna go paste your heads back into the family photos. I've got them right here.
117891,455,184,846000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I know you're gonna say no, but Mom would say..."
117892,455,185,849000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Whatever. Knock yourself out.
117893,455,186,850000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What do you mean?
117894,455,187,852000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You may not realize this, Bart, but your mother and I have been fighting about you a lot lately. And I've realized our marriage is more important than your future. From now on, you're on your own."
117895,455,188,861000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Really? Okay.
117896,455,189,867000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, Marge? I don't want to ruin the moment, but you got something stuck between your-- ohhh..."
117898,455,191,876000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"Ah, a peaceful Saturday afternoon, with no Bart Simpson -- and no Milhouse, for that matter. Nothing on my agenda but to sit here and watch hummingbirds."
117899,455,192,890000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,Sugar water? Now why would someone...
117900,455,193,892000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,Their tiny tongues are like knives!
117902,455,195,898000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Street,"Big mistake, attacking me outside school hours and property! Legally, I can spank your bare bottoms!"
117903,455,196,904000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Street,Follow me!
117904,455,197,912000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Street,You can't hide forever and I'm a very patient man! I once waited an hour and a half for a haircut.
117906,455,199,919000,Bart Simpson,SUBWAY STAIRWELL,"Whoa, what is this place?"
117908,455,201,922000,Milhouse Van Houten,SUBTERRANEAN TUNNEL,Remember that time I was carried off by groundhogs? This is where I wound up.
117910,455,203,929000,Milhouse Van Houten,Abandoned Subway Station,"Behold, an ancient subway station!"
117911,455,204,938000,Bart Simpson,Abandoned Subway Station,I never knew Springfield had a subway.
117912,455,205,940000,Bart Simpson,Abandoned Subway Station,It's like a Thomas The Tank Engine we can go inside!
117913,455,206,943000,Milhouse Van Houten,Abandoned Subway Station,With no Sir Topham Hatt to tell us what we can and can't do!
117918,455,211,950000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Which flavor do I save -- the Radical Red or the Blueberry Blast? Curse this Squishee's choice!
117921,455,214,982000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I love watching you knit. It reminds me of watching pictures download on our old dial-up modem. Remember that day we brought it home and it was all eee, ooo, eee, ooo, onnnggg!"
117922,455,215,999000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my God, Homie -- we're having a real conversation!"
117923,455,216,1003000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah.
117924,455,217,1009000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You won't believe how I got home.
117925,455,218,1011000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't know, don't care."
117926,455,219,1013000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't even want to know if I have anything to do with this mysterious seismic activity of late?
117927,455,220,1017000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Nope.
117928,455,221,1018000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm saving my yelling for where it does some good. Lisa! You're a wonderful child! Keep up the good work!
117929,455,222,1027000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, Dad. But you're so loud it's hurting my ears."
117930,455,223,1031000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sorry!
117932,455,225,1033000,Bart Simpson,PARK PLAYGROUND,It's weird -- I just made an entire town lose its lunch...
117933,455,226,1037000,Nelson Muntz,PARK PLAYGROUND,...And...
117934,455,227,1039000,Bart Simpson,PARK PLAYGROUND,...and I'm not feeling the rush.
117935,455,228,1041000,Nelson Muntz,PARK PLAYGROUND,Tell me more.
