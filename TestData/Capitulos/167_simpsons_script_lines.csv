37312,167,6,77000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're missing the Itchy and Scratchy Show! Don't you like it anymore?
37313,167,7,80000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure, we love it! But how can we watch TV when it's so beautiful out?"
37314,167,8,85000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, Mom. I mean, we love you and Dad too, but God knows we don't need to see you every day."
37315,167,9,90000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,An occasional hug is all I ask.
37316,167,10,92000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mo-om, you can hug me when I'm asleep."

37324,167,18,117000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Krustylu Studios,What happened here? Lightning hit the transmitter?
37325,167,19,119000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"See, that's what I thought at first, but then-- Hey, shut up! That crater is where your lousy cartoon crash-landed! It's ratings poison."
37326,167,20,127000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Krustylu Studios,But Itchy and Scratchy is critically acclaimed-
37327,167,21,130000,Krusty the Clown,Krustylu Studios,"Acclaimed? I oughtta replace it right now with that Chinese cartoon where the robots turn into, blingwads. But I'm a lazy, lazy man, Roger...So I'll give you one more chance. Now get out! Don't come back 'til you've fixed Itchy and Scratchy!"
37329,167,23,150000,Miss Lois Pennycandy,Krustylu Studios,"Okay, Mel, you can go in now."
37330,167,24,153000,Sideshow Mel,Krustylu Studios,"Krusty, I've come to solicit donations for the Rock and Roll Museum-- I'll come back later."
37332,167,26,163000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,I need to purchase a brassiere. You kids wait over here in the credit department.
37333,167,27,167000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Can't we just wander around and meet you back here later?
37334,167,28,170000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,Mmm... okay. Just be careful.
37335,167,29,177000,Man,Springfield Mall,Would you kids like to come with me?
37336,167,30,179000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,Ok. / Guess so. / Sounds good to me./ Let's go.
37339,167,33,183000,Moderator,Springfield Mall,"Hi. Thanks for participating in our focus group, kids. Today, we're going to show you some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons."
37340,167,34,190000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,Wow! / Alright! / Cool!
37341,167,35,191000,Moderator,Springfield Mall,"We want you to tell us what you think -- and be honest, because no one from the show is here spying on you."
37342,167,36,199000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,Why is that mirror sneezing?
37343,167,37,201000,Moderator,Springfield Mall,"Uh, look, it's just an old, creaky mirror. Y'know, sometimes it sounds a little like it's sneezing or coughing or talking softly."
37344,167,38,210000,Moderator,Springfield Mall,"Now you each have a knob in front of you. When you like what you see, turn the knob to the right."
37345,167,39,216000,Moderator,Springfield Mall,"When you don't like what you see, turn it left."
37346,167,40,219000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Mall,My knob tastes funny.
37347,167,41,221000,Moderator,Springfield Mall,Please refrain from tasting the knob.
37349,167,43,242000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Mall,"Hey, quit it!"
37350,167,44,246000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Springfield Mall,They like Itchy. They like Scratchy. One kid seems to love the speedo man. What more do they want?
37351,167,45,254000,Moderator,Springfield Mall,"Okay. How many of you kids would like Itchy and Scratchy to deal with real-life problems, like the ones you face every day?"
37352,167,46,260000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,Me! / I would! /
37353,167,47,262000,Moderator,Springfield Mall,"And who would like to see them do just the opposite, getting into far-out situations involving robots and magic powers?"
37354,167,48,269000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,Me! / I would! /
37355,167,49,273000,Moderator,Springfield Mall,"So you want a realistic, down-to-earth show that's completely off-the-wall and swarming with magic robots."
37357,167,51,281000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Mall,And also you should win things by watching.
37359,167,53,286000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Springfield Mall,You kids don't know what you want! That's why you're still kids -- 'cause you're stupid. Just tell me what's wrong with the freakin' show!
37360,167,54,298000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Mall,Mommy!
37361,167,55,299000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Um, excuse me, sir. The thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the Itchy and Scratchy show -- it's as good as ever. But after so many years, the characters just can't have the same impact they once had."
37362,167,56,312000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Springfield Mall,"That's it. That's it, little girl!! You've saved Itchy and Scratchy!"
37364,167,57,317000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Springfield Mall,Please sign these papers indicating that you did not save Itchy and Scratchy.
37367,167,60,321000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"I have figured out how to rejuvenate the show. It is so simple, you egghead writers woulda never thought of it. What we need is... a new character! One that today's kids can relate to!"
37368,167,61,336000,Writer #1,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Are you absolutely sure that's wise, sir? I mean, I don't want to sound pretentious here, but Itchy and Scratchy comprise a dramaturgical dyad."
37369,167,62,343000,Krusty the Clown,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Hey, this ain't art, it's business! What do you got in mind -- sexy broad? Gangster octopus?"
37370,167,63,348000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"No, no. The animal chain of command goes mouse, cat... DOG. D-O-G."
37371,167,64,357000,Writer #2,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,A dog? Isn't that a tad predictable?
37372,167,65,359000,Executive,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,In your dreams. We're talking the original dog from hell.
37373,167,66,363000,Writer #1,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,You mean Cerberus?
37374,167,67,366000,Executive,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"We at the network want a dog with attitude. He's edgy. He's in-your-face. You've heard the expression ""Let's get busy?"" Well this is a dog who gets biz-zay. Consistently and thoroughly."
37375,167,68,378000,Krusty the Clown,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"So he's proactive, huh?"
37376,167,69,379000,Executive,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Oh God, yes. We're talking about a totally outrageous paradigm."
37377,167,70,384000,Writer #3,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Excuse me, but ""proactive"" and ""paradigm"" -- aren't these just buzzwords that dumb people use to sound important? Not that I'm accusing you of anything like that. I'm fired, aren't I?"
37378,167,71,395000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Oh, yes. The rest of you writers start thinking up a name for this funky dog. I don't know, something along the lines of, say... Poochie. Only more proactive."
37379,167,72,404000,Krusty the Clown,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,Yeah.
37380,167,73,408000,Writer #1,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"So, Poochie okay with everybody?"
37381,167,74,410000,Writing Staff,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Yeah / Whatever / You know, it's good /"
37382,167,75,415000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"No, no, no. He was supposed to have attitude."
37383,167,76,419000,Head Animator,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Um, wh-wh-what do you mean, exactly?"
37384,167,77,422000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Oh, you know, attitude, attitude! Sunglasses."
37385,167,78,427000,Executive,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,Can we put him in more of a hip-hop context?
37386,167,79,430000,Krusty the Clown,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,Forget context. He's gotta be a surfer. Gimme a nice shmear of surfer.
37363,167,80,434000,Executive,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,I feel we should rasta-fy him by ten percent or so.
37387,167,81,442000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Mmm, I think he needs a little more attitude."
37389,167,83,449000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,I love it!
37391,167,85,454000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Lis, look! They're adding a new character to Itchy and Scratchy! ""Poochie the Dog?"""
37392,167,86,459000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings.
37393,167,87,463000,Roy,Simpson Home,"Yo yo! How's it hangin', everybody?"
37394,167,88,466000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"'Morning, Roy!"
37395,167,89,467000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, hi, Roy. Hey, they're having open casting for the voice of Poochie."
37396,167,90,471000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You should try out, Dad. You have a funny voice."
37397,167,91,474000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I do not!
37398,167,92,475000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?
37399,167,93,477000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.
37400,167,94,479000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, here. Say something."
37401,167,95,481000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin' ""Howdy"" to all the girls out there in radioland."
37402,167,96,490000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin'-- I don't sound like that, do I? Oh, I don't like having such a hilarious voice."
37403,167,97,499000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom.
37405,167,99,507000,Otto Mann,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Whoa, a talking dog! What were you guys smoking when you came up with that?"
37406,167,100,515000,David Cohen,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"We were eating rotisserie chicken. Can you just read the line, please?"
37407,167,101,519000,Otto Mann,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"""Ruff, Ruff! I'm Poochie the rockin' dog!"""

37411,167,105,544000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Take a hike, you bum!"
37413,167,107,548000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,Ruff Ruff! I'm Poochie the rockin' dog.
37414,167,108,548000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Now that's just bad. You got no attitude, you're barely outrageous, and I don't know what you're in, but it's not my face. Next."
37415,167,109,559000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Oh, ""no attitude,"" eh? Not ""in-your-face,"" huh? Well, you can cram it with walnuts, Ugly!"
37416,167,110,565000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,That's it! That's the Poochie attitude!! Do that again!
37417,167,111,568000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,Huh? I can't. I don't remember what I did.
37418,167,112,571000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,Then you don't get the job. Next!
37419,167,113,573000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well, boo-hoo, I don't get to be a cartoon dog."
37420,167,114,581000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,That's it! You've got the job!
37421,167,115,583000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Oh, now I got the job, huh? Oh. Thank you."
37422,167,116,592000,Sound Engineer,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Okay, Homer. Let's get a level check on your voice."
37423,167,117,595000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"She smells sheet smells by the sheet store. Wait, wait. Lemme try it again."
37424,167,118,602000,June,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Relax, Homer, you'll do fine. I'm June Bellamy. I do the voices of Itchy and Scratchy."
37425,167,119,607000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,You? But you're a lady.
37426,167,120,610000,June,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"She's a lady, all right. A beauuutiful lady."
37427,167,121,617000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so good?"
37428,167,122,621000,June,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Oh, just experience, I suppose. I started out as Road Runner -- ""Meep!"""
37429,167,123,625000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"You mean ""meep meep""?"
37430,167,124,627000,June,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"No, they only paid me to say it once,"
37431,167,125,627000,June,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,then they doubled it up on the soundtrack. Cheap bastards.
37432,167,126,632000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,You folks ready to begin?
37433,167,127,632000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live?"
37434,167,128,636000,June,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"No, Homer. Very few cartoons are broadcast live -- it's a terrible strain on the animators' wrists."
37437,167,131,655000,Nerd #1,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Hi. Question for Miss Bellamy: In episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib twice in succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to believe that this is some sort of magic xylophone or something? Boy, I really hope someone got fired for that blunder."
37438,167,132,675000,June,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Uh... Er...
37441,167,133,677000,Homer Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question: why would a man whose shirt says ""Genius At Work"" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?"
37442,167,134,688000,Nerd #1,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,I withdraw my question.
37443,167,135,692000,Database,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Uh, excuse me, Mr. Simpson. On the Itchy and Scratchy CD-Rom, is there a way to get out of the dungeon without using the wizard key?"
37444,167,136,701000,Homer Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,What the hell are you talking about?
37445,167,137,703000,June,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"You're a lifesaver, Homer. I can't deal with these hardcore fans."
37446,167,138,707000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Your attention please.

37489,167,183,918000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, it's not your fault, dad. You did fine. It's just that Poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking. You can't be cool just by spouting a bunch of worn-out buzzwords."
37490,167,184,928000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't have a cow, Lis."
37491,167,185,929000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart's right -- let's none of us have a cow. All that matters is that the fans of the show liked it.

37497,167,191,954000,Bart Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? I mean, if anything, you owe them."
37498,167,192,959000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Worst episode ever.
37499,167,193,962000,Kent Brockman,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"It looks like the beginning of the end for the venerable Itchy and Scratchy program. For years, TV critics such as yours truly, Kent Brockman, have waited impatiently for cracks to appear in the show's hilarious facade. Yesterday, our prayers were finally answered when Poochie the Dog made his howlingly unfunny debut. Far be it from me to gloat at another's downfall, but I have a feeling no children are going to be crying when this puppy is put to sleep."
37501,167,195,993000,Krusty the Clown,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,What the hell happened?!
37502,167,196,995000,Executive,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Well, I'd attribute the product failure to fundamental shifts in our key demographic, coupled with the overall crumminess of Poochie."
37503,167,197,1001000,Krusty the Clown,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Whoa, you gotta stop this thing! Please, I'm gettin' egged on the street! Do something! DO SOMETHING!!"
37504,167,198,1016000,Krusty the Clown,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Uh, hi, Mr. Myers. I've been doing some thinking and I've got some ideas to improve the show. I got it right here Uh, one: Poochie needs to be louder, angrier and have access to a time machine. Two: Whenever Poochie's not on screen, all the other characters should be asking ""Where's Poochie?"" Three--"
37505,167,199,1029000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Great, great. Just leave them right there on the floor on your way out."
37508,167,202,1057000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Hallway,"Listen guys, we gotta do something about Poochie."
37509,167,203,1059000,Krusty the Clown,Hallway,There's only one thing we can do.
37512,167,206,1065000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Then they said they were gonna kill Poochie off!
37513,167,207,1068000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Really?! Oh, how terrible!"
37514,167,208,1070000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes. Terrible.
37515,167,209,1072000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's not your fault, Homer. It's those lousy writers. They make me madder than a, um... yak in heat!"
37518,167,210,1080000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're right, Marge! It's not my fault! I'm not gonna let 'em treat Poochie like dirt anymore just 'cause he's the new guy!"
37519,167,211,1087000,Roy,Simpson Home,"Right on, Mr. S.!"
37520,167,212,1088000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Put a sock in it, Roy."
37522,167,214,1091000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Okay, so here's where Itchy lunges at Poochie with a rusty chain saw... Cue sound effects!"
37523,167,215,1098000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,Rustier!
37524,167,216,1102000,June,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Are you prepared to die, Poochie?"
37525,167,217,1105000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,No I am not.
37526,167,218,1107000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Oh, cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Just stick to the script as written, Homer. You're supposed to say ""Please, cut off my head, I don't deserve to live."""
37527,167,219,1116000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,Never!
37528,167,220,1123000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"You can't just kill off a classic TV character. Poochie could be bigger than curly fries, but first he has to win back the audience. That's why I'm gonna read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands."
37529,167,221,1134000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Forget it, Homer! We can do the show without you if we have to."
37530,167,222,1138000,June,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,But not without me!
37531,167,223,1140000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Aw, geez..."
37532,167,224,1142000,June,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,Let him try the new lines.
37533,167,225,1145000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"All right, all right. We'll try it. Action."
37534,167,226,1149000,June,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Hi, Poochie! You look like you've got something to say. Do you?"
37535,167,227,1154000,Homer Simpson,Itchy & Scratchy Studios,"Yes. I certainly do. Hello there, Itchy. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away, but I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted, I know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together."
37536,167,228,1182000,"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Itchy & Scratchy Studios,And... cut!
37538,167,230,1196000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, kids -- I know you loved the old Poochie...but the new one's going to be better than ten Superbowls. I don't want to oversell it. Judge for yourselves."
37539,167,231,1209000,Scratchy,Simpson Home,"Well, look who's here!"
37540,167,232,1210000,Itchy,Simpson Home,"Hi, Poochie! You look like you've got something to say. Do you?"
37541,167,233,1215000,Poochie,Simpson Home,Yes. I certainly do.
37516,167,234,1217000,Poochie,Simpson Home,I have to go now. My planet needs me.
37543,167,235,1224000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Wow -- Poochie came from another planet?
37544,167,236,1227000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess...
37545,167,237,1229000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! Those finks double-crossed me!"
37546,167,238,1233000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Poochie's dead!
37548,167,240,1239000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Now, kids, we all know that sometimes when cartoon characters die, they're back again the very next week. That's why I'm presenting this sworn affidavit that Poochie will never, ever, ever return."
37549,167,241,1250000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Simpson Home,This document conforms to all applicable laws and statutes.
37551,167,243,1260000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tough break, dad. I guess people just weren't ready for Poochie. Maybe in a few years."
37552,167,244,1265000,Roy,Simpson Home,"Good news, everybody! I'm moving into my own apartment with two sexy ladies."
37553,167,245,1272000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, then I guess this is goodbye, Roy. Maybe we'll see you in a few years..."
37555,167,247,1278000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing is, I lost creative control of the project. And I forgot to ask for any money. Well, live and learn."
37556,167,248,1300000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's back to the basics. Classic Itchy and Scratchy!
37557,167,249,1304000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We should thank our lucky stars they're still putting out a program of this caliber after so many years.
37558,167,250,1311000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What else is on?
