48227,206,52,234000,Nelson Muntz,FUN CENTER,"Yeah, sure. Never hurts to have a second set of prints on a gun."
48228,206,53,238000,Bart Simpson,FUN CENTER,"Wow, thanks, Nelson! I'll come by your house later --"
48229,206,54,241000,Marge Simpson,FUN CENTER,"Oh, no you won't."

48232,206,57,245000,Marge Simpson,FUN CENTER,"Nelson's a troubled, lonely, sad little boy. He needs to be isolated from everyone."

48239,206,64,260000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Fake mustache.
48240,206,65,261000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Wanna comb it?
48241,206,66,262000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,This sucks. It's time to punch outta this yawn factory. I'm going to Nelson's.
48242,206,67,267000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But Mom said not to!
48243,206,68,268000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"She doesn't scare me. I do what I want, when I want. Oh God, inchworms!"
48245,206,70,275000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,Won't you get in trouble if your Mom sees you doing that?
48246,206,71,277000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Nah, my Mom's got bigger problems. She doesn't give a crap what I do."
48247,206,72,281000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Wow, you are so lucky."
48248,206,73,283000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"C'mon, let's lock and load."
48249,206,74,285000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"You're not going out without a scarf, are ya?"
48250,206,75,287000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Eh, I don't need one."
48251,206,76,289000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Hmm, it's your health."
48252,206,77,293000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,Think I can hit that bottle?
48253,206,78,294000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Yeah, probably."
48254,206,79,296000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Shows what you know. Hey, check this out."
48255,206,80,305000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"That's my Dad's shootin' car. Just three more payments, and it's ours."
48256,206,81,309000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Oh, cool. Can I get a shot now?"
48257,206,82,311000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Hang on. First, how 'bout I try and peg you in the stomach?"
48258,206,83,315000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Mmm. No, thanks."
48259,206,84,316000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,Or what about you put on these nerd glasses and I shoot 'em off?
48260,206,85,320000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,"No way. C'mon, quit hoggin' the gun."
48261,206,86,325000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,Bet you can't hit that bird from here.
48262,206,87,327000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,Are you crazy? I don't wanna shoot a stupid bird.
48263,206,88,330000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,That's 'cuz you know you can't. You're not a superstud like me.
48264,206,89,334000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,Am too.
48265,206,90,335000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Are not. You're an octo-wussy. Ohh, look at me. I'm Bart Simpson. I'm scared to use a gun. I want to marry Milhouse. I walk around like this. La la la la la la la..."
48266,206,91,348000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Hey, quit it!"
48267,206,92,368000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,Oh my God...
48268,206,93,369000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Whoa-oa, major shot! You even compensated for the crooked sight!"
48269,206,94,374000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,Crooked sight?
48270,206,95,376000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"You are one cold-blooded killer, dude!"
48271,206,96,379000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,"But, but I wasn't... I didn't..."
48272,206,97,379000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Right through the neck! Doesn't get any sweeter than that, Simpson. Savor the moment."
48274,206,99,397000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I rolled up all the socks.
48275,206,100,399000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What's next?
48276,206,101,400000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"While I deal with this, why don't you start on that basket?"
48277,206,102,403000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right.
48278,206,103,404000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I hate folding sheets.
48279,206,104,407000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's your underwear.
48280,206,105,409000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, whatever it is, it's a two-man job. Where's Bart?"
48281,206,106,412000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He's up in his room. Bart?
48282,206,107,414000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's okay, Marge. I'll get him. BA-ART!"
48283,206,108,418000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What the heck's going on?
48284,206,109,420000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"We need Bart to help fold your father's underpants. Where is he, anyway?"
48285,206,110,424000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart? Uhh, he went to play with a friend."
48286,206,111,428000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"He didn't go to Nelson's, did he?"
48287,206,112,430000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no. I'm pretty sure he's with Milhouse."
48288,206,113,435000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,MILHOUSE!
48289,206,114,437000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,What?
48290,206,115,439000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,TELL BART TO COME HOME!
48291,206,116,443000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I think he's at Nelson's!
48292,206,117,446000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,WHO'S NELSON?
48293,206,118,449000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nelson?! I explicitly forbade Bart from playing with that little monster. Ooo, Bart is in deep, deep trouble."
48294,206,119,459000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, yes. And punish Lisa for lying to us."
48295,206,120,463000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, young lady. I want you to march yourself directly to the Kwik-E-Mart and get me some chips and a beer."
48297,206,121,469000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And get a little something for yourself, sweetheart."
48299,206,123,473000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Should we bury it, or chuck it into a car full of girls?"
48300,206,124,476000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Hey, leave it alone."
48301,206,125,477000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Okay, okay. Don't kill me, killer."
48302,206,126,480000,Bart Simpson,NELSON'S HOUSE,Don't call me that!
48303,206,127,481000,Nelson Muntz,NELSON'S HOUSE,"Relax, Simpson. It was either him or you. No court would convict you."
48305,206,129,489000,Eagle,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"Bart Simpson, do you know why you've been summoned before this tribunal?"
48306,206,130,494000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"Yes, sir. Because I killed an innocent bird."
48308,206,132,497000,Vulture,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,Dear Lord! We just wanted you to put fresh newspaper on the tribunal floor!
48309,206,133,502000,Eagle,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,We're knee-deep in our own droppings. It's disgusting.
48310,206,134,506000,Toucan,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"But since you've confessed to bird-slaughter, we have no choice but to peck your face off!"
48311,206,135,511000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,No! Not the face!
48313,206,137,519000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,Ow! What are you doing?
48314,206,138,521000,Nelson Muntz,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"I got bored, so I started slapping you."
48315,206,139,523000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,Uh-oh.
48316,206,140,528000,Marge Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"Young man, you're coming home with me this minute."
48317,206,141,531000,Nelson Muntz,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"All right! Finally, a real home."
48318,206,142,533000,Marge Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,Not you. Bart.
48319,206,143,536000,Nelson Muntz,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"Oh. See ya later, killer."
48320,206,144,539000,Marge Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,Killer? Why did he call you killer?
48321,206,145,541000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"Mom, you were right. Nelson is bad news. Can we go home?"
48322,206,146,544000,Marge Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,What are you hiding there?
48323,206,147,547000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,Nothing.
48324,206,148,548000,Marge Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,What are those cats doing behind you?
48325,206,149,551000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"Uh, cats like me."
48326,206,150,555000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"Get off, get off!"
48327,206,151,558000,Marge Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,Bart! Did you kill that poor bird?
48328,206,152,562000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"I didn't mean to, Mom. The gun pulled to the left --"
48329,206,153,562000,Marge Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"You disobeyed me, snuck over here, and murdered a helpless animal?"
48330,206,154,570000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"I know, I really screwed up. I deserve to be punished."
48331,206,155,573000,Marge Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"What's the point, Bart? I punish and I punish and I punish, but it never sinks in. So you know what? Do what you want. You want to play with little hoodlums? Fine. Have fun killing things."
48332,206,156,587000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"Mom, wait..."
48333,206,157,604000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"Oh, my God."
48334,206,158,608000,Bart Simpson,EERILY-LIT COURTROOM,"Hi, little eggs. I'm not sure how to tell you this, but... Y-Your mom was involved in an incident. Mistakes were made. By me. But don't worry, I'll take care of you."
48336,206,160,628000,Troy McClure,Springfield Library,"Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such nature films as ""Earwigs: Eww,"" and ""Man vs. Nature: The Road to Victory."""
48337,206,161,640000,Troy McClure,Springfield Library,"In all the animal kingdom, no mother is more devoted than the Blue Jay."
48338,206,162,645000,Troy McClure,Springfield Library,"Valuing her eggs above even her own life, the mother bird bravely fights off such fearsome predators as the badger and the mongoose."
48339,206,163,654000,Troy McClure,Springfield Library,"Of course, one thing mother Blue Jay can't defend against is a set of steel tongs."
48340,206,164,661000,Troy McClure,Springfield Library,"Eggs. Precious eggs. If they're to survive, they require the gentle warmth and tender love that only a mother can provide. Or better yet, a 75-watt bulb."
48342,206,166,673000,Troy McClure,Laboratory,"Oh, hello. In a few days, our eggs will hatch into nestlings, like these over here."
48343,206,167,679000,Billy,Laboratory,"They look awfully hungry, Mr. McClure."
48344,206,168,681000,Troy McClure,Laboratory,"They sure are, Billy. In nature, their mother would regurgitate food for them to eat."
48345,206,169,686000,Billy,Laboratory,That's gross.
48346,206,170,689000,Troy McClure,Laboratory,"It sure is, Billy. It sure is."
48347,206,171,702000,Library Lady Tress,Laboratory,You've checked this Bible out every weekend for the last nine years. Wouldn't it be easier to just buy one?
48348,206,172,709000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Laboratory,Perhaps on a librarian's salary.
48351,206,175,722000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Hey, fellas, good news. I found an extra 75-watt bulb lyin' around."
48355,206,179,730000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Check it out, guys. I've been working on this regurgitation thing."
48356,206,180,743000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Oh, yeah. Hope you like PopTarts."
48357,206,181,746000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"I think I'll call you Chirpy Boy, and you Bart Junior. And you can call me Mother. No, wait, that sounds kinda fruity. Just call me Mom."
48359,206,183,773000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Mmm. What do you think he's doing up there?
48360,206,184,795000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'unno. Drug lab?
48361,206,185,796000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Drug lab?!
48362,206,186,797000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Or reading comic books. What am I, Kreskin? You tell me what he's doing."
48363,206,187,801000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't know, and I don't want to know. And I'm going to find out!"
48364,206,188,805000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my good, gray extension cord."
48366,206,190,811000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Oh, no!"
48367,206,191,814000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I've gotta keep these warm.
48368,206,192,818000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Bart, stop whatever you're doing and come down here."
48369,206,193,822000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Can't right now. Come back later.
48370,206,194,824000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Oh, I'll come back later."
48371,206,195,829000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,How's this for later?!
48372,206,196,830000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Mom, listen--"
48373,206,197,830000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Why are you sitting like that? What are you hiding this time?
48374,206,198,840000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Eggs?
48375,206,199,842000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"That bird I killed was their mother. I don't want her babies to die, too."
48376,206,200,849000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Ohhh, oh, honey. Oh, come here."
48377,206,201,855000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Oh my goodness! Look!
48380,206,204,860000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, man. This is the most exciting thing I've seen since Haley's Comet collided with the moon!"
48381,206,205,867000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"That never happened, Dad."
48382,206,206,869000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sure it didn't.
48383,206,207,872000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Is the nest still warm enough, Mom?"
48384,206,208,874000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hmm... it's starting to cool down. I'll bake another pie.
48385,206,209,881000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, how 'bout cherry this time? And would it kill you to make some coffee?"
48386,206,210,885000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why is this taking so long? Bart was born in about five minutes.
48387,206,211,890000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, it took fifty-three hours."
48388,206,212,893000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Really? Well, the time just flew by, didn't it?"
48391,206,214,899000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Everybody come quick! They're hatching!
48392,206,215,909000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I see a foot!
48393,206,216,909000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I see an eye!
48394,206,217,911000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I see a neck!
48395,206,218,911000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I see a horn!
48396,206,219,913000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,A horn?
48398,206,221,925000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Man, those are some funky-lookin' birds."
48399,206,222,930000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aww... Ohh, you look like a little tiny dinosaur."
48400,206,223,936000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That is one vicious baby bird.
48401,206,224,938000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, they aren't birds."
48402,206,225,939000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure they are. They came from eggs in a bird's nest. Therefore, they're birds. Ixo fatso."
48403,206,226,943000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"One, they don't have beaks, two, they don't have feathers, and three, they're lizards."
48404,206,227,950000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're a lizard.
48405,206,228,951000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Enough bickering. I know how to settle this.
48406,206,229,953000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No kickboxing!
48408,206,231,956000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If anyone wants me, I'll be eating alone in the basement."
48410,206,233,960000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,"Now, uh, people, there's been some confusion about our bird-sighting rules. You cannot count birds that you've seen at the zoo, on stamps, or in dreams."
48411,206,234,975000,Moe Szyslak,Municipal Building,"Well, I'm back to square one."
48412,206,235,980000,Jasper Beardly,Municipal Building,"Hmmm. My God, a pigeon! That's the last bird on my list! Huh. So long, suckers."
48413,206,236,991000,Bart Simpson,Municipal Building,Excuse me. Can you tell us what kind of birds these are? They hatched from eggs I found in a nest.
48414,206,237,996000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,"Good heavens! I'm very glad you brought those in, Bart."
48415,206,238,1000000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,I'll just get those killed and you can be on your way.
48416,206,239,1004000,Bart Simpson,Municipal Building,Wait! What the heck are you doing?!
48417,206,240,1006000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,"My civic duty, that's what."
48418,206,241,1008000,Lisa Simpson,Municipal Building,Bolivian Tree Lizard?
48419,206,242,1010000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,"Mm-hm. It's a vicious ovoraptor. It feasts on bird eggs, and lays its own eggs in the nest. The unsuspecting mother bird cares for them until the babies hatch and devour her, too."
48420,206,243,1020000,Moe Szyslak,Municipal Building,What a chump.
48422,206,244,1023000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,"It's already wiped out the Dodo, the Cuckoo, and the NeNe. And it has nasty plans for the booby, the titmouse, the woodcock, and the titpecker."
48423,206,245,1030000,Marge Simpson,Municipal Building,How vile.
48424,206,246,1032000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,"Well, the one thing that mystifies me is how a Bolivian lizard made it to Springfield."
48425,206,247,1038000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Municipal Building,That is a puzzlement.
48427,206,249,1055000,C. Montgomery Burns,Kwik-E-Mart,"Look, Skinner, we haven't got all day. Kill the horrid beasts, then do away with their lizards."
48428,206,250,1062000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,No! Don't hurt them! I'll just keep them as pets.
48429,206,251,1065000,Seymour Skinner,Kwik-E-Mart,"No, they might escape and breed. The law is very clear on this: they must be exterminated as quickly and as gruesomely as possible."
48430,206,252,1072000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Nooo! They're mine.
48431,206,253,1075000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,I'm sure we can work this out. He's just a child. Let me talk to him.
48432,206,254,1081000,Seymour Skinner,Kwik-E-Mart,All right. I'll give you a moment. That will give us time to prepare for the splatter.
48434,206,256,1088000,Marge Simpson,Municipal Building,"Bart, I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do. Your lizards are banned by federal law."
48435,206,257,1094000,Bart Simpson,Municipal Building,"Everyone thinks they're monsters, but I raised them and I love them. I know that's hard to understand."
48436,206,258,1101000,Marge Simpson,Municipal Building,Not as hard as you think.
48437,206,259,1109000,Marge Simpson,Municipal Building,Run for it.
48438,206,260,1111000,Bart Simpson,Municipal Building,Really?
48439,206,261,1118000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,"Okay, that's exactly one moment. It-- Oh my God, he's getting away!"
48441,206,263,1124000,Moe Szyslak,Municipal Building,What?
48442,206,264,1124000,Waylon Smithers,Municipal Building,Stop him!
48443,206,265,1125000,Moe Szyslak,Municipal Building,"Outta the way, Midge!"
48444,206,266,1127000,Marge Simpson,Municipal Building,"Oh, am I in the way?"
48445,206,267,1128000,C. Montgomery Burns,Municipal Building,"Yes, yes, you're in the way! Are you daft, woman?"
48446,206,268,1132000,Marge Simpson,Municipal Building,Sorry. I didn't realize I was in the way.
48447,206,269,1134000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,You're still in the way. You don't seem to be moving at all.
48448,206,270,1138000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Municipal Building,"Oh, for cryin' out loud. Just knock her ass down!"
48449,206,271,1140000,Moe Szyslak,Municipal Building,"Way to shove, Edna."
48450,206,272,1141000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Municipal Building,Let us roll.
48452,206,273,1142000,Bart Simpson,Municipal Building,"Guys, is it really true? Are you cold-blooded egg-murderers?"
48453,206,274,1149000,Bart Simpson,Municipal Building,Don't use that look on me. I invented that look.
48454,206,275,1154000,C. Montgomery Burns,Municipal Building,"There he is, off in the distance!"
48456,206,277,1164000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,"Okay, Bart. This is where it ends. Relinquish the lizards."
48457,206,278,1170000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,I said relinquish!
48459,206,280,1178000,Bart Simpson,Municipal Building,Oh no! You killed 'em.
48460,206,281,1185000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,Good riddance to bad lizards.
48462,206,283,1192000,Bart Simpson,Municipal Building,"Whoa, look at 'em."
48463,206,284,1196000,Bart Simpson,Municipal Building,"Go, Chirpy Boy! Go, Bart Junior!"
48464,206,285,1198000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,"Oh, nuts."
48465,206,286,1200000,Lisa Simpson,Municipal Building,Wow. Did you know they had those web flaps for gliding?
48466,206,287,1203000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,"Yes, but I was hoping they didn't know that."
48467,206,288,1211000,Seymour Skinner,Municipal Building,"Well, I hope you're happy, Bart. You have no idea what kind of plague you've unleashed upon this town."
48468,206,289,1221000,Kent Brockman,Municipal Building,"Our top story: the population of parasitic tree lizards has exploded -- and local citizens couldn't be happier! It seems the rapacious reptiles have developed a taste for the common pigeon, also known as the feathered rat, or gutter bird."
48469,206,290,1235000,Kent Brockman,Municipal Building,"For the first time, citizens need not fear harassment by flocks of chattering disease-bags."
48471,206,292,1246000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Park,"For decimating our pigeon population, and making Springfield a less oppressive place to while away our worthless lives, I present you with this scented candle."
48472,206,293,1259000,Townspeople,Springfield Park,/ Yay! / Woo-hoo! / All right!
48473,206,294,1261000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Park,"Well, I was wrong. The lizards are a godsend."
48474,206,295,1264000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,But isn't that a bit short-sighted? What happens when we're overrun by lizards?
48475,206,296,1269000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Park,No problem. We simply unleash wave after wave of Chinese Needle Snakes. They'll wipe out the lizards.
48476,206,297,1274000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,But aren't the snakes even worse?
48477,206,298,1276000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Park,"Yes, but we're prepared for that. We've lined up a fabulous type of gorilla that thrives on snake meat."
48478,206,299,1281000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,But then we're stuck with gorillas!
48480,206,300,1283000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Park,"No, that's the beautiful part. When wintertime rolls around, the gorillas simply freeze to death."
48482,206,302,1290000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Park,"I'm proud of you, boy. Mmmm, loganberry."
48483,206,303,1298000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,"I don't get it, Bart. You got all upset when you killed one bird, but now you've killed tens of thousands and it doesn't bother you at all."
48484,206,304,1305000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Park,"Hey, you're right. I call the front seat!"
48485,206,305,1308000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Park,You had it on the way over!
