109072,420,17,125000,Drew Carey,SOUND STAGE,"Thank you! Thank you! Wow, four thousand episodes -- seems like just yesterday Krusty stole his first joke from me. Seriously, though, I remember watching him as a kid, and I thought ""I could do that -- and I'm a kid!"" What I love about Krusty is, he's always on... but to find out what, you've gotta test his pee!"

109134,420,79,398000,Sideshow Mel,Backstage,"Over the years, show business has been home to scoundrels and saints, thespians and harlequins, Abbots and Costelli. And they all had one thing in common -- an underpaid assistant."
109135,420,80,410000,Krusty the Clown,Backstage,"Cancel my one o'clock. Move my two o'clock to one o'clock and cancel that. Oh, and go to my joke file, and make all the ""Sophia Lorens"" into ""Lindsay Lohans""."

109154,420,100,498000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe you're working for Krusty and I'm not. I know everything about that clown. Favorite blintz -- blueberry. Favorite horse in the 2004 Belmont -- Smarty Jones. Krusty lost a bundle and had to endorse baby wipes in Norway. Which I have a case of!

109165,420,109,539000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son, the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of Krusty...which appears to be everything. Hey, maybe we should give Lisa this room. You know she works for Krusty now."
109168,420,112,553000,Bart Simpson,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Okay, here's my offer -- all this primo Krusty merchandise for that copy of ""Radioactive Man vs. Muhammad Ali""."
