87026,337,1,10000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"We now return to ""Blackula Meets Black Dracula."""
87027,337,2,34000,Owner,Simpson Home,I'm turning this disco into a hockey rink.
87028,337,3,37000,Blackula,Simpson Home,You mean a honky rink!
87030,337,5,45000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, Black Dracula is now a Congressman from Virginia."
87031,337,6,50000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, where did you get those?"
87032,337,7,52000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,There's an open house next door. They're giving out cookies and business cards!
87033,337,8,56000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Check it out, I'm a business jerk!"
87036,337,10,60000,Homer Simpson,HOUSE NEXT DOOR,"Marge, I don't want to buy this house. I'd have to live next door to myself."
87037,337,11,68000,Homer Simpson,HOUSE NEXT DOOR,Turn that down!
87038,337,12,69000,2nd Homer,HOUSE NEXT DOOR,Screw you!
87039,337,13,73000,Marge Simpson,HOUSE NEXT DOOR,"Relax, we're just looky-loos. We're only here to compare our lifestyle to our neighbors."
87040,337,14,78000,Homer Simpson,HOUSE NEXT DOOR,"Oh c'mon, Marge. It's not fair to compare us to an American household."
87041,337,15,84000,Marge Simpson,HOUSE NEXT DOOR,"It's so beautiful and modern. Ooh, a Sub-Zero fridge..."
87042,337,16,92000,Homer Simpson,HOUSE NEXT DOOR,A slightly colder fridge? In my lifetime? Amazing.
87044,337,18,98000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,"This is the kitchen I've always wanted. Ooh, a bread maker-maker!"
87045,337,19,108000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,And check this out.
87046,337,20,110000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"A walk-in microwave! Hey Marge, can you press stop when my popcorn's done?"
87047,337,21,117000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,Uh-oh.
87049,337,23,128000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, when I married you, I knew we wouldn't live in luxury."
87050,337,24,132000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And I kept that vow.
87051,337,25,135000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves.
87052,337,26,141000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll build you a new kitchen, sweetie."
87053,337,27,143000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie... that's so thoughtful, but maybe we should hire a professional contractor."
87054,337,28,149000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"A contractor? Those guys are the biggest crooks around. They charge for materials and labor! Pick one, jerks!"
87055,337,29,171000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Man, that hurt. And now to do the exact same thing again."
87056,337,30,178000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe you should turn off the power.
87057,337,31,181000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right.
87058,337,32,185000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't demolish along the way!
87059,337,33,187000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine.
87060,337,34,188000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Easy... easy...
87061,337,35,193000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Playdude"" magazines? Have you been hiding bosom rags from me?"
87062,337,36,198000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Trying to.
87063,337,37,199000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,These magazines are from before we were married. Maybe you should throw them away.
87064,337,38,204000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But I need them for the articles!
87065,337,39,206000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"The articles, eh? So you wouldn't mind if I cut out all the erotic nudes?"
87067,337,40,213000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of course not. Why would I want to look at a nude woman I'm not even married to? I mean, I wouldn't even know how she could improve me."
87068,337,41,224000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm not wearing any clothes. So why don't I just splay myself on a pool table!
87069,337,42,231000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Steady, steady..."
87070,337,43,236000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, here's your precious articles."
87071,337,44,238000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks, Marge. I can't wait to read about ""Sport Fishing With Sonny Jurgensen."""
87072,337,45,238000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What man would want you now?
87073,337,46,251000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoa -- Playdudes!
87074,337,47,253000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Let the blossoming of Milhouse begin.
87076,337,49,257000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I gotta be honest -- I don't see what all the hubbub is about.
87077,337,50,261000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,"Hey, the lady in this picture is hot. She can calamine my hives anytime."
87078,337,51,267000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,That's Congresswoman Bella Abzug.
87079,337,52,269000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,Ciao Bella.
87080,337,53,271000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,The grown-ups in this magazine are pretty cool.
87081,337,54,274000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"I could make the treehouse look like this. Then we could have orgies, whatever they are."
87082,337,55,281000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,We'll be Playdude Playmates!
87083,337,56,283000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,We are Playdude Playmates! We are Playdude Playmates!
87085,337,58,287000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"There it is, nice and smooth. I'd like to see your boyfriend the contractor do a better job."
87086,337,59,294000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I think you used too much plaster.
87087,337,60,297000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, now you tell me."
87088,337,61,299000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I never stopped telling you.
87089,337,62,300000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,So that's what that white noise was.
87090,337,63,303000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm calling a contractor.
87091,337,64,309000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Thanks for taking the job. I'm sorry my husband is being so difficult.
87092,337,65,315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Get lost, crook!"
87093,337,66,316000,Contractor,Simpson Home,"That's all right, Mrs. Simpson. Many husbands feel emasculated when their wife must turn to a professional to satisfy her remodeling needs."
87094,337,67,324000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you just kiss her?
87095,337,68,325000,Contractor,Simpson Home,I'm gay. But I have a subcontractor that does that sort of thing for me.
87066,337,69,329000,Angelo,Simpson Home,I like-a to kiss.
87096,337,70,333000,Contractor,Simpson Home,"Now, don't you worry. Your kitchen will be done in three weeks."
87097,337,71,340000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"When Virginia Woolf wrote ""every woman needs a room of one's own,"" she must have been talking about the kitchen."
87098,337,72,346000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What's the first thing you're gonna make in your new kitchen?
87099,337,73,348000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How 'bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars.
87100,337,74,356000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I was thinking of chicken wings.
87101,337,75,358000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Those are good too.
87103,337,77,362000,Moe Szyslak,First Church of Springfield,"Same old stuff: meatloaf, casserole, tunaloaf, loaferole, casseloaf..."
87104,337,78,369000,Carl Carlson,First Church of Springfield,Marge Simpson's Wasabi Buffalo Wings!

87111,337,85,406000,Crowd,First Church of Springfield,Huzzah!
87112,337,86,407000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,And how 'bout a huzzah for my husband who paid for our new kitchen?
87113,337,87,411000,Sideshow Mel,First Church of Springfield,Never!
87115,337,89,413000,Ned Flanders,Kwik-E-Mart,"Marge, you know I thought I was Springfield's wing ding king, but uh, you make my chicken look like cock-a-diddily doo doo."
87116,337,90,419000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Great stuff, Ned."
87117,337,91,421000,Ned Flanders,Kwik-E-Mart,"You know I was gonna enter this here Ovenfresh Bakeoff... but up against you, I wouldn't have a Hindu's chance in Heaven."

87120,337,94,439000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,I guess it would be a hoot to have my face on everything.
87121,337,95,443000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh Mrs. Simpson, you must pursue your dreams. Like my old dream of coming to America and starting a family. Or my new dream of ditching my family and sneaking back to India in disguise."
87122,337,96,454000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Apu? Never heard of him. My name is Steve Barnes.
87124,337,98,462000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"So, when do they start singing?"
87125,337,99,465000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, the Playdude Advisor says this music will get a stewardess to give you a layover."
87126,337,100,470000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I hope it's in Omaha. My Grammy lives there.
87127,337,101,473000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, can you come in here for a second?"
87128,337,102,477000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Your mother's about to show us her new recipe.
87129,337,103,481000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Outtasight! Lay it on me, Mama."
87130,337,104,484000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"In the Ovenfresh Bakeoff, clever presentation is as important as taste. So I'm entering my dessert dogs!"
87131,337,105,492000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's deep fried cookie dough with meringue buns, cherry ""ketchup"" and caramel ""mustard."""
87132,337,106,492000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's dessert, but it's hot dogs, so it's good for you!"
87133,337,107,508000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I don't want to freak you out, but I think I love you."
87134,337,108,514000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I hope the Ovenfresh Bake-off likes them as much as you do.

87143,337,117,553000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"Sorry, Ralphie. The Bake-off rejected your recipe."
87144,337,118,557000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,I wanna be in the bakeoff!
87145,337,119,559000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,"There, there. I think your grilled crayon sandwich was delicious."

87159,337,129,602000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah Nelson, your debonair wit reminds me of a young Mort Sahl."

87161,337,131,608000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Listen up, ring-a-ding-dingers. I'm throwin' a little sip 'n' quip at the Playdude Treehouse. Saturday night, at the top of the ladder. Be there or be square."

87170,337,140,650000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,"Well... Stuart, I'm making a dessert that looks like a hot dog, but it isn't."
87171,337,141,656000,STUART,Springfield Convention Center,"You're making a ""tasty fake?"" That is so nineties. Why don't we all move to Seattle and use slow modems?"
87172,337,142,667000,Luigi,Springfield Convention Center,"Yo, Marge! Your recipe, she is-a pathetic."

87195,337,163,752000,Luigi,Springfield Convention Center,"No no no no no no, my English she's a-not so good. I was, how you say, ""ruining your food so I win?"" Yes?"
87196,337,164,759000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,Why is everyone at this bakeoff such a meanie-bo-beanie?
87197,337,165,764000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Convention Center,These muffin-huffin' batter biddies can smell weakness a mile away. Weakness named Marge!
87198,337,166,770000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,Why can't everyone just play fair and... Did you just dunk your hair in my mixing bowl?
87199,337,167,777000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Convention Center,You're weak! Weak!
87201,337,169,780000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Listen here, Simpson. Your son has been exposing our kids to adult themes, unabashed dictionaries, and the lesser short fiction of John Cheever!"
87202,337,170,789000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Adult themes? What are you talking about?
87203,337,171,791000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, my Roddy told a joke about an octopus and a set of bagpipes -- and the punchline implied that they fornicated!"
87204,337,172,797000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Ralphie wants to go on the pill!
87205,337,173,799000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Stupid Bart. Bagpipes getting down with an octopus... that's classic.
87207,337,175,805000,STUART,Springfield Convention Center,Hot bananas coming through.
87151,337,176,806000,STUART,Springfield Convention Center,Ooops.

87208,337,180,820000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,"You're right. If I can feed a family of five on twelve dollars a week, I can do anything."
87209,337,181,827000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,You feed us on twelve dollars a week?
87210,337,182,829000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,I stretch your father's meatloaf with sawdust.

87214,337,186,858000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,I guess I was the last one.
87215,337,187,860000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Convention Center,Dammit!
87217,337,189,865000,Marge Simpson,JUDGING ROOM,These other dishes look so pretty. And those cheaters blackened my sugar wieners. I'd like to give those Betty Crookeds a taste of their own medicine. Yes... medicine.
87218,337,190,880000,Marge Simpson,JUDGING ROOM,Baby ear medicine.
87219,337,191,889000,Marge Simpson,JUDGING ROOM,Even the Pope couldn't forgive this pizza... and he's letting a lot of things slide these days.
87220,337,192,894000,Marge Simpson,JUDGING ROOM,"Don't worry, there's plenty for all of you! Now who's laughing? Huh? Huh? Me! I'm laughing!"
87222,337,194,916000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,I can't believe my Mom would cheat.
87223,337,195,918000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,"Hey sweetie, is Mom winning?"
87224,337,196,920000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,"Oh, she'll win the contest, but she'll lose her soul."
87225,337,197,923000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,But she'll still win the contest?
87226,337,198,925000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Convention Center,And lose her soul.

87244,337,215,987000,Brandine Del Roy,Springfield Convention Center,Just 'cause it was cooked in a garbage can don't make it garbage.
87246,337,217,997000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Canned and frozen juices are more popular than ever these days. But most bachelors we know would prefer to squeeze their own tomatoes.
87248,337,219,1001000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,Bachelors are always squeezin' stuff!
87249,337,220,1012000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Would you excuse us, Milton?"

87252,337,223,1020000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Maybe I was a little hard on him. Oh, well. Bart, I know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son. But what's going on up here?"

87259,337,230,1049000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Good. That'll save us some time. Okay... why do you think your mother and I sleep in the same bed?
87260,337,231,1055000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Because we're poor?
87261,337,232,1057000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Exactly. And we're poor because we have kids. And the biological method by which children are created by a man and a woman is...
87264,337,235,1070000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,And then the man...
87266,337,237,1074000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,And then the woman...

87275,337,249,1120000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, I'll be a winner with feet of clay... like Mickey Mantle. Everyone loves the Mick."
87276,337,250,1126000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't want Mickey Mantle, I want my Mom."
87277,337,251,1129000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, plenty of kids are gonna look up to me when I'm Auntie whatever it is. Right now people just know me as the wife of the guy who doesn't go to work. Can't you understand that I need this?"
