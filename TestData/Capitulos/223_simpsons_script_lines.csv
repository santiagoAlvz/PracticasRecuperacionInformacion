53361,223,2,87000,French Representative,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,"Ah, but Paris would make a tr√®s bon site for the next Olympic Games."
53362,223,3,91000,Ioc Chairman,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,"And, ah, why is that?"
53363,223,4,93000,French Representative,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,We don't have to explain ourselves to the likes of you!
53364,223,5,97000,French Representative,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,I await your reply.
53365,223,6,99000,Russian Representative,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,"I recommend Moscow, where the American dollar buys seven rubles."
53366,223,7,103000,Russian Representative,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,Twelve rubles. Sixty rubles. One thousand Rubles? I must go!
53367,223,8,109000,Representative,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,I suggest Motown.
53368,223,9,109000,Ioc Chairman,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,Detroit?
53369,223,10,111000,Representative,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,"No, no. Mongolia Town. Home of the Motown Sound:"
53370,223,11,118000,Latin Representative,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,You are all crazy! The answer is Buenos Aires.
53371,223,12,121000,OTHER REPRESENTATIVES,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,Hokkaido! / Cleveland! / Uganda! / Bangkok!
53372,223,13,123000,Ioc Chairman,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,"People, people, please! You're forgetting what the Olympics are about: giving out medals of beautiful gold, so-so silver, and shameful bronze."
53375,223,14,134000,Ioc Chairman,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,"I have here a letter from a little girl named Lisa Simpson. She says her town might not be important enough to host the Olympics, but she asks if the torch could just pass by so she can experience the glow that we feel every day."
53376,223,15,152000,Ioc Chairman,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,"Well, I say we don't bring her the torch. I say we bring her the Olympic Games! Who is with me?"
53377,223,16,164000,Ioc Chairman,INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OFFICE,"Well, I don't care, it's my decision."
53379,223,18,165000,Kent Brockman,Simpson TV Room,Springfield was shocked today to learn it will host the next Olympics. Economists predict our city will experience the same boom that Sarajevo enjoyed after the 1984 games.
53380,223,19,175000,Marge Simpson,Simpson TV Room,"And it's all because of your letter, Lisa."
53381,223,20,177000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson TV Room,"Well, actually, I just wrote it for a school assignment. Everyone else wrote to the Back Street Boys."

53384,223,23,190000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A mascot contest?! I'm sure to win that. Unless one of you jinxes me.
53385,223,24,203000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No one's gonna jinx you, Homer. In fact, we're rooting for you."
53386,223,25,206000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, go for the gold, Dad!"
53387,223,26,208000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
53388,223,27,212000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you said I couldn't do it, but here it is! Meet Abby the Olympic Tabby."
53389,223,28,218000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,How'd you get the eyes to move?
53390,223,29,221000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You papier mache'd my cat?!
53391,223,30,223000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just for the prototype, honey."
53392,223,31,230000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Knowing you always hate my first idea, I prepared a backup. How about a big Olympic hello for Springy, the Springfield Spring!"
53393,223,32,239000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Those aren't the dog's eyes, are they?"
53394,223,33,241000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, that's cute."
53395,223,34,243000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good work, Dad."
53396,223,35,244000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's fun for the whole family. And the ends are razor sharp to protect our nation and its interests.

53373,223,38,269000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Hit the road, Lefty. You too, Rizzo."
53400,223,39,272000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Aw, Cinnamon. Don't make this harder than it already is."
53402,223,41,287000,Ioc Chairman,Springfield Town Square,"Bravo, Springfield! I've never seen such a clean sewer."
53403,223,42,292000,JAPANESE REPRESENTATIVE,Springfield Town Square,And we are positively inspired by your solar power plant.

53407,223,46,314000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Square,And that's not all. We've just chosen our official Olympic mascot.
53408,223,47,322000,Crowd,Springfield Town Square,Oh! / Springs!

53414,223,53,351000,Kids,Springfield Town Square,"""Children, children, future, future..."""

53427,223,66,411000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Town Square,Wait! Wait! We have one more act! The patriotic comedy stylings of Bart Simpson!
53374,223,67,418000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Thank you! Thank you!
53428,223,68,419000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"So, uh, you're from Russia, huh?"

53432,223,72,424000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Poland, eh? Ha. Too easy. How you doin', Germany? Here's my impression of an East German woman, ""Kiss me or I'll crush you."""
53433,223,73,437000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,He says what we're all thinking.
53434,223,74,439000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Square,I'm not thinking that!
53435,223,75,440000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Hey, Swiss Miss. There's no missin' you, babe. Heh, heh. Lay off the cocoa."
53437,223,77,449000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Now I'd like to say one last thing to our Olympic representatives: if there was a medal for horrible audiences, you'd get the gold. Peace out."
53438,223,78,468000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Town Square,Skin-ner!! How could you put this boy on with that horrible material?
53439,223,79,473000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Town Square,"Well, it really did seem funny in rehearsal."
53440,223,80,476000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Town Square,And he didn't even get to his Ubangi routine.
53442,223,82,481000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Town Square,"Ha, ha, ha. Laugh it up, ya punks. 'Cause you and Jan Murray here just cost our town the Olympics!"
53443,223,83,488000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Hey, Chalmers, where are you from?"
53444,223,84,489000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Town Square,"I-- Oh. Well, I was born in Queens, went to Ball State, then made the move to Intercourse, Pennsylvania. Eh, why do you ask?"
53445,223,85,496000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Town Square,"Uh, don't worry, sir, I'll teach these children some respect for their town. I'm assigning each of you twenty hours of community service."
53446,223,86,503000,Kids,Springfield Town Square,"/ Oh, community service?! / Nooo! / Intercourse?"
53447,223,87,507000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Town Square,What if we refuse?
53448,223,88,509000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Town Square,You won't pass to the next grade.
53449,223,89,511000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Town Square,I fail to see the threat.
53450,223,90,513000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Town Square,"Skin-ner! Good idea. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to my vacation at Lake Titticaca. Let's see you make a joke out of that, Mr. Smart Guy!"
53452,223,92,525000,Seymour Skinner,School Bus,"All right, Martin. For your community service, you'll be setting up a midnight basketball program for inner-city street gangs."
53453,223,93,536000,Martin Prince,School Bus,"All right, gang. Shirts and skins. Let's hustle!"
53454,223,95,543000,Seymour Skinner,Bus,"Milhouse, do you like the beach?"
53455,223,96,545000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bus,Who doesn't?
53456,223,97,546000,Seymour Skinner,Bus,"Good, I want you to pick up all this medical waste that's washed up on the shore here."
53457,223,98,555000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bus,Ow! I pricked myself.
53458,223,99,557000,Seymour Skinner,Bus,"Well, just keep working. You'll prick yourself with the antidote sooner or later."
53459,223,100,564000,Bart Simpson,Bus,What are you gonna do to me?
53460,223,101,566000,Seymour Skinner,Bus,"Bart, not all community service is gang warfare and dangerous infection. And to illustrate that point, here's where you'll be working."
53461,223,102,574000,Bart Simpson,Bus,"The Fireworks, Candy and Puppy Dog Store?!"
53462,223,103,579000,Seymour Skinner,Bus,"No, no, no. Next to it."
53463,223,104,584000,Grampa Simpson,Bus,Settle a bet. Boil or mole?
53464,223,105,593000,Bart Simpson,Bus,Ewwww.
53466,223,107,593000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Okay. Just breathe through your mouth and don't ask how they're feeling.
53467,223,108,604000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, man..."
53468,223,109,612000,Seniors,Springfield Retirement Castle,Aren't you a cutie-petutie. / Let's pull his skin. / I'm gonna touch his head.
53469,223,110,616000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Yahhh!
53470,223,111,617000,Sweet Elderly Lady,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, be a dear and snap my support hose to my girdle."
53472,223,113,622000,Nurse,Springfield Retirement Castle,Two o'clock. Recreation time.
53473,223,114,625000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Phew, saved by the bell."
53474,223,115,627000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Whoa!
53475,223,116,627000,Sweet Elderly Lady,Springfield Retirement Castle,Where do you think you're goin'?
53477,223,118,634000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh no, Lis! They got you, too?"
53478,223,119,636000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"""Got me?"" What are you talking about? I've been volunteering here for a year."
53479,223,120,639000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Hello, let's hear some numbers. I got a nice diagonal goin'."
53480,223,121,645000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,B-3.

53482,223,123,650000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,G-52.
53483,223,124,651000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,You sunk my battleship!
53484,223,125,655000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, I got a bingo! What do I win?"
53485,223,126,658000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,A banana!
53486,223,127,659000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,A whole one?
53487,223,128,660000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Yep!
53489,223,129,661000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,That's the prize?! A banana?
53490,223,130,663000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Their natural mushiness prevents choking and promotes regularity.
53491,223,131,667000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"They're not babies, Lisa. Give 'em something fun, like cigars or booze."
53492,223,132,671000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"We tried giving them eggnog at Christmas, but it led to widespread de-shawling."
53493,223,133,675000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,And that's what they get for wearing such tight little shawls.
53496,223,136,682000,Nurse,Springfield Retirement Castle,Okay. Four o'clock. Nap time.
53497,223,137,685000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,You tell them when to sleep?
53498,223,138,687000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Shhh. Don't wake them.
53499,223,139,692000,Nurse,Springfield Retirement Castle,"While they sleep, we suck up excess dirt and crumbs."
53500,223,140,696000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Here you go. Make sure you get into every crevice.
53501,223,141,701000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Cool. Grampa, Homer. Grampa, Homer."
53502,223,142,707000,Nurse,Springfield Retirement Castle,Don't play with the faces.
53504,223,144,712000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, Bart, how was your first day of forced volunteerism?"
53505,223,145,715000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That place sucks! The nurses don't let Grampa do anything. They practically chew his food for him.
53506,223,146,722000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lucky stiff. I'm working my ass off here. Good steak, honey."
53507,223,147,727000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"The elderly aren't like you or me, Bart. They thrive on consistency, predictability, and a life with no surprises."
53508,223,148,733000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Sounds good to me!
53509,223,149,736000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'llgetit.
53510,223,150,738000,Delivery Man,Simpson Home,Delivery for Homer Simpson.
53511,223,151,744000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo! My springs! They finally came!
53512,223,152,747000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But we lost the Olympics to Shelbyville.
53513,223,153,750000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but I should have no problem selling a thousand springs."
53514,223,154,753000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,To who?
53515,223,155,754000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Idiots! Ooh, these are fun!"
53517,223,157,760000,Scarlett,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, Rhett. Rhett! Oh, Rhett. Where will I go? What will I do?"
53518,223,158,767000,Rhett,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Frankly, my dear... I love you. Let's remarry."
53519,223,159,774000,Sweet Elderly Lady,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Oh, what a lovely ending."
53488,223,160,775000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yes, sweeet."
53520,223,161,777000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,They cut out the best word!
53521,223,162,779000,Hans Moleman,Springfield Retirement Castle,Didn't that movie used to have a war in it?
53522,223,163,782000,Orderly,Springfield Retirement Castle,C'mon. You've been warned.
53523,223,164,785000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Picture yourself on a beautiful sailboat. Ahhh, can't you just feel the sea breeze in your hair?... or scalps?"
53524,223,165,795000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Say, I hear a foghorn. BOR-ING..."
53525,223,166,800000,Nurse,Springfield Retirement Castle,"C'mon, Bart, we don't want to over-stimulate these people. They just had pudding."
53527,223,168,807000,Homer Simpson,Skinner Home,"Hello, little girl, is your mommy home? You'll need to ask her for five dollars to buy Mr. Bouncy Best-Friend."
53528,223,169,813000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,I know you. Your little smart-mouthed boy cost this town the Olympics!
53529,223,170,819000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,"Who is it, Mother?"
53530,223,171,820000,Agnes Skinner,Skinner Home,Bart Simpson's father.
53531,223,172,822000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner Home,Oh! I'll be right down.
53534,223,175,831000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Boy, Lenny, you sure look hungry. Have some nuts."
53535,223,176,835000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, thanks."
53536,223,177,835000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Ow! My eye! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
53537,223,178,841000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Now if you want to be the life of the party like Lenny here, just place your order for this hilarious novelty item."
53538,223,179,849000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, get outta here."
53539,223,180,850000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Boy, Moe, you sure look angry. Here, have some nuts."

53543,223,184,861000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Don't pull! Don't pull! I said don't pull! Don't!
53545,223,186,867000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Now we're pulling into port. And who's waiting for us at the dock? Why, it's all your childhood dogs! I see Petey and Blackie and Schnoodle and..."
53546,223,187,878000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Oh no! Pirates!
53547,223,188,879000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,Pirates?!
53548,223,189,880000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Ahoy mateys, it's me, Long Bart Silver and I'm gonna rip you a new I.V. hole."
53550,223,191,885000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Bart, what are you doing?"
53552,223,192,886000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,I'm just trying to liven things up around here. These people need to ride motorcycles and play rockin' electric guitars like the old people on TV.
53553,223,193,893000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Excuse me, but when those pirates boarded, I swallowed my wedding ring for safekeeping. Get me some ipecac. I'd like to expunge it."
53554,223,194,903000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Okay, she's gone. Let's break out of here and have some fun!"
53556,223,196,907000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"If I get up, somebody'll take my chair."
53557,223,197,909000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,Got that right. It's the only one left with padding.
53558,223,198,912000,Other Seniors,Springfield Retirement Castle,Padding...
53559,223,199,915000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"What about you, Chief? Don't you want to be free like the eagle?"
53560,223,200,919000,Native-american Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,I don't live here. I'm just dropping off Indian casino pamphlets. Vote yes on Prop 217.
53561,223,201,930000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,"You know, the door was open! Chief Break-everything!"
53562,223,202,935000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Come on, people. You don't want to stay in a place where they vacuum you while you sleep."
