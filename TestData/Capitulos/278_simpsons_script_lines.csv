70458,278,67,341000,Drederick Tatum,Springfield Mall,Excellent bout. Now we go party.
70461,278,70,349000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Homer, you've suffered a broken jaw."
70462,278,71,351000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Broken jaw?
70463,278,72,356000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,He won't be able to talk for quite some time. I've wired his jaw shut -- it's all explained in this pamphlet.

70465,278,74,362000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Oh dear, you can't eat solid foods. Those are his favorites."
70467,278,76,375000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Stop it, Homer!"
70468,278,77,376000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Oh, don't worry. On a man his size, that just provides sexual release."
70472,278,81,395000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh.
70473,278,82,399000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Dad. I'm gonna make a human yo-yo. If you object, clearly say ""no""."

70481,278,90,428000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, it's Duffman!"
70482,278,91,429000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Newsweek said you died of liver failure.
70483,278,92,431000,Duffman,Moe's Tavern,Duffman can never die. Only the actors who play him. Oh yeah!
70484,278,93,437000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, you must be here for the uh, Duff trivia challenge."
70485,278,94,440000,Duffman,Moe's Tavern,"That's right, local distributor. One of you could win a lifetime supply of Duff."
70487,278,96,447000,Duffman,Moe's Tavern,"Okay, chug-monkeys. What beverage, brewed since ancient times, is made from hops and grains?"
70488,278,97,449000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"How about ""Ancient Hop Grain Juice""?"
70489,278,98,460000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Wait, wait, wait, Homer's tryin' to make a guess..."
70491,278,100,466000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, oh, what are you doing? You're gettin' some kind of booze all over."
70493,278,102,472000,Duffman,Moe's Tavern,"Time's up. The answer is beer! Ooh, Duff luck."
70494,278,103,478000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,I never woulda figured that out.
70495,278,104,479000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Hm. Now, that's the kinda thing you just gotta know."
70498,278,107,489000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I am not gonna make you another sparerib smoothie. Most people with their jaws wired shut don't gain weight.
70499,278,108,504000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""How was your day?"" Do you really want to know?"
70501,278,110,509000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, let's see... I was in the kitchen, counting the corncobs on the curtains..."
70503,278,112,516000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,When who should ring the doorbell but Ned Flanders.
70504,278,113,523000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It seems he wants to ban culottes in the schools.
70506,278,115,527000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Pardon my French, but sometimes that man's a goofy-doofy."
148612,278,116,531000,Homer's Thoughts,Simpson Home,Marge thinks Flanders is annoying. This marriage just got interesting.
148613,278,118,547000,Homer's Thoughts,Simpson Home,She's so cute...
70508,278,121,576000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You wanna know what happened?
70509,278,122,580000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Really?
70510,278,123,585000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"We were playing four square, and I called no double taps, and Ralph double taps. And I said ""You're out"". And he says ""I can do a sum-ber-salt"" which has nothing to do with anything."
70511,278,124,598000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Aww... maybe a hug will cork her cry-hole.
70512,278,125,602000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thanks for listening, Dad."
70513,278,126,610000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We gotta coordinate on this thing.
70515,278,128,614000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So the substitute teacher comes in and says her name is Mrs. Doody. And everyone's looking at me like ""Take it, Bart. Run with it"". And it hits me: I've become a clown... a class clown. And it sickens me."
148614,278,129,630000,Homer's Thoughts,Simpson Home,Wow. Bart has feelings. Mrs. Doody.
70516,278,130,635000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Three wars back, we called sauerkraut Liberty Cabbage, and we called Liberty Cabbage super slaw. And back then, a suitcase was known as a Swedish lunchbox. 'Course, nobody knew that but me."
70517,278,131,649000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Anyway, long story short... is a phrase whose origins are complicated and rambling."
70518,278,132,658000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, tomorrow is the Annual Springfield Formal Event. We weren't going to go, after last year's... unpleasantness."
70519,278,133,667000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That donkey is such a bad influence on you.
70520,278,134,671000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But breaking your jaw has made you so sweet. Maybe we can go.
70521,278,135,676000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Mm hmm.
70522,278,136,676000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmm, I'd better polish those jaw wires for tomorrow."
70525,278,139,693000,Marge Simpson,Mansion,A formal. The one place you can wear a tiara and not look crazy.
70527,278,141,701000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"So, how are we enjoying the festivities?"
70528,278,142,705000,C. Montgomery Burns,Mansion,"Yes, the music is from Southern Hungary. That's quite an ear -- have some money."
70529,278,143,713000,Society Man,Mansion,Your husband is quite the gentleman. Most people laugh at my googly eye.
70531,278,145,726000,Society Matron,Mansion,"Well, I've never seen a man politely pass up so many hors d'oeuvres. My husband, Maxtone Witherball, has already had three shrimp."
70533,278,146,736000,Society Matron,Mansion,Someone's done her henpecking. You two are quite the couple. You must dine with us at Toad Hall.
70534,278,147,743000,Marge Simpson,Mansion,"Mm, thank you."
70535,278,148,756000,Marge Simpson,Mansion,This has been one of the most magical evenings of my life.
70536,278,149,761000,Homer Simpson,Mansion,I'm horny!
70537,278,150,764000,Marge Simpson,Mansion,"I don't know what you said, but I'm sure it was beautiful. Oh Homer, this is the kind of night I thought we could never have together: incident free."
70539,278,152,791000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Mansion,Oh Homer! Drop by my office tomorrow and I can remove those jaw wires. You'll be just the way you used to be.
70540,278,153,801000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Mansion,"And Reverend, I'll put in those pec implants on Thursday."
70541,278,154,806000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Mansion,Super.
70543,278,156,814000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Homer, your breath smells terrible. I'll have to take off my shoes to cover the odor."
70544,278,157,820000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Nicely done.
70546,278,159,821000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"And when I couldn't talk, I learned to listen."
70547,278,160,824000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I learned so much about my family. You'd be surprised how much you hear if you just listen once in a while.
70548,278,161,831000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Really? Let's try it.
70549,278,162,833000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hello? Yeah, I'd like to arrange for an escort please."
70550,278,163,837000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"To where? How 'bout ""Orgasmville""? Hello? Hello?"
70551,278,164,843000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, hey, how ya doin'?"
70552,278,165,845000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I was just tellin' all the guys how losing the power of speech made me a better man.
70553,278,166,849000,Lindsay Naegle,Moe's Tavern,"I couldn't agree more. You're today's modern, enlightened man -- the kind we television producers have been booking since the mid-seventies."
70554,278,167,857000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, what are you doing in here?"
70555,278,168,858000,Lindsay Naegle,Moe's Tavern,"I'm an alcoholic. Homer, will you appear on my show?"
70556,278,169,862000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Sure thing, Alky."
70558,278,171,866000,Barbara Walters,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Welcome to Afternoon Yak. Today, we will meet a man who couldn't open his mouth... so he learned to open his heart. Please welcome Homer and Marge Simpson."
70559,278,172,882000,Joy Behar,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"So Marge, tell. What's it like kissing a man with a mouth full of metal?"
70560,278,173,888000,Gen X Girl,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,My boyfriend has a metal tongue stud.
70561,278,174,890000,Star Jones,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,Who cares what's on his tongue -- long as he's a stud where it counts! I'm talkin' downtown!
70562,278,175,899000,Barbara Walters,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Marge, what was Homer like before he broke his jaw?"
70563,278,176,902000,Marge Simpson,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Well, he would eat all the time. We'd be making love, and he'd have a mouth full of Hershey's Miniatures."
70564,278,177,910000,Homer Simpson,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,Krackle was my favorite.
70565,278,178,912000,Gen X Girl,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,I hope that was the only miniature in the bedroom!
70566,278,179,915000,Star Jones,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,I'm talkin' downtown!
70567,278,180,919000,Marge Simpson,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"And before he broke his jaw, he never listened, but now he takes to heart everything I say."
70569,278,182,926000,Homer Simpson,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Well, as much as humanly possible."
70571,278,184,929000,Barbara Walters,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Well Marge told us when you didn't listen, it led to reckless, criminal behavior."
70572,278,185,935000,Marge Simpson,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,He did such crazy things -- roll clip.
70573,278,186,937000,Homer Simpson,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,Ostrich burgers! Get your ostrich burgers!
70574,278,187,940000,Lenny Leonard,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,I'll take one.
70575,278,188,941000,Homer Simpson,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Okay, you pick one out and I'll punch it to death."
70576,278,189,953000,Homer Simpson,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Dude, I thought we were friends."
70577,278,190,956000,Homer Simpson,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,I'm not proud of that clip.
70578,278,191,958000,Joy Behar,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Homeleh, it's easy to change. But what's hard is not changing back."
70579,278,192,963000,Barbara Walters,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Do you promise not to wevive your weckless, weckless ways?"
70580,278,193,967000,Homer Simpson,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Well, I don't know. The demolition derby is next month..."
70581,278,194,971000,Marge Simpson,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Please, Homie? No more craziness -- for me?"
70582,278,195,975000,Homer Simpson,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Well, okay. For you I'll be as dull as Dilbert."
70583,278,196,979000,Barbara Walters,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,"Very good. Our next topic: ""My Son Still Wets the Bed."""
70584,278,197,981000,Milhouse Van Houten,TV TALK SHOW STUDIO,You told me we were going to Red Lobster!
70586,278,199,992000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, all clean, just the way I left it."
70587,278,200,995000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna kill you!
70588,278,201,997000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, so much for new Homer."
70589,278,202,1001000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's going on?
70590,278,203,1003000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,We're rehearsing a play.
70591,278,204,1004000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, and I was merely reading the title: ""I'm gonna kill you."""
70532,278,205,1004000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh. It's just a false alarm.
70592,278,206,1012000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yep. Nothin' to get excited about.
70593,278,207,1015000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'll be in the kitchen if you need me."
70594,278,208,1018000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Professor Van Doren, so good to see you."
70595,278,209,1021000,Professor Van Doren,Simpson Home,"Ah, rehearsing a play I see."
70597,278,211,1026000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,This place is so dull. The nine-one-one button is covered with dust.
70598,278,212,1031000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,I just poured myself a new glass of milk. The old one sat out for a little while. Are you comin' to bed?
70599,278,213,1037000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,It's seven-thirty!
70600,278,214,1038000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Marge, I could stand here and argue with you, but then I'd have to get a new glass of milk. Goodnight, honey."
70601,278,215,1045000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Boy, things are going really good. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Hmm, look at that freckle. I should dig that out."
70602,278,216,1057000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Good, good, that feels good."
148659,278,218,1065000,Marge's Thoughts,Simpson Home,"This place is so boring. If somebody doesn't do something interesting, I'm gonna have to. But what?"
70604,278,219,1080000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The Demolition Derby? That'll scratch my itch.
70605,278,220,1086000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge? Marge is gone! But at least the Demolition Derby form is...
70606,278,221,1092000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What?! Nooo!
70608,278,223,1104000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Civic Center,Listen to all that revving!
70609,278,224,1107000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Civic Center,"Drivers, start your engines!"
70610,278,225,1114000,Derby Announcer,Springfield Civic Center,"Vendors, start your gouging!"
70611,278,226,1118000,Derby Announcer,Springfield Civic Center,"And now... smashie, smashie!"
70612,278,227,1125000,Derby Announcer,Springfield Civic Center,"Lookin' good, Mrs. S!"
70613,278,228,1128000,Otto Mann,Springfield Civic Center,"Uh-oh. C'mon old girl, show 'em what ya got!"
70614,278,229,1134000,Otto Mann,Springfield Civic Center,Whooa!
