75897,297,76,388000,Sideshow Bob,WARDEN'S OFFICE,What could you possibly offer me?
75898,297,77,390000,Chief Wiggum,WARDEN'S OFFICE,Your pick of roles in the prison musical. This year I think it's Man of La Mancha.
75899,297,78,394000,Lou,WARDEN'S OFFICE,"Yeah, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, Doctor Carrasco, they're all great parts."
75900,297,79,401000,Chief Wiggum,WARDEN'S OFFICE,"What a great show. I wish it was today. So, what do you say, Bob?"
75901,297,80,404000,Sideshow Bob,WARDEN'S OFFICE,Fair enough.
75902,297,81,409000,Sideshow Bob,WARDEN'S OFFICE,"Now I will need round-the-clock access to all the Simpsons, especially Bart."
75903,297,82,414000,Homer Simpson,WARDEN'S OFFICE,"Well then, you might as well stay with us. We serve the same meat the prisons do!"
75904,297,83,419000,Bart Simpson,WARDEN'S OFFICE,Wait. Wait. Wait. Bob can't stay with us. This man has tried to kill me so much it's not funny anymore.
75905,297,84,424000,Chief Wiggum,WARDEN'S OFFICE,"Don't worry son, we have ways of making him compliant."
75907,297,85,428000,Bart Simpson,WARDEN'S OFFICE,"Dad, I can't believe you're putting my life at risk to save your own."
75908,297,86,433000,Homer Simpson,WARDEN'S OFFICE,You'll understand someday when you have kids.
75910,297,88,440000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Now if he even looks at you funny, this ""shock garter"" will set him straight. And don't try taking it off because it's taped to your leg hair. And that really hurts."
75911,297,89,450000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Oh come now. As gentlemen, surely we can just agree to... God D...!"
75912,297,90,455000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Sorry.
75913,297,91,455000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Fair enough. But now that we know what it can do, there's no need to... Mother F...!"
75914,297,92,460000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, you don't even have to point it at him."
75916,297,94,466000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Homer, think carefully. Of all the people you have known, who might have reason to do you ill?"
75917,297,95,472000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hmm... Well, there's Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, The Emperor of Japan, ex-President Bush."
75918,297,96,479000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The late Frank Grimes...
75919,297,97,481000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"PBS, Stephen Hawking, the fat little Dixie Chick..."
75920,297,98,485000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And the state of Florida.
75921,297,99,487000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,How can one ordinary man have so many enemies?
75922,297,100,489000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm a people person. Who drinks.
75923,297,101,492000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,Ah.
75924,297,102,493000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Homer, in order to identify your assailant, I must follow you through the course of a normal day. Just do what you usually do and the killer will reveal himself."
75925,297,103,503000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Gotcha.
75927,297,105,507000,Sideshow Bob,MOUNTAIN CLIFF,This is a normal day?
75928,297,106,508000,Homer Simpson,MOUNTAIN CLIFF,I just wanted to impress you.
75930,297,108,512000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Welcome to your Springfield Mardi Gras headquarters. Cast your vote now for this year's king!
75931,297,109,518000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Mardi Gras, eh? Didn't last year's king have to abdicate because he married a commoner?"
75932,297,110,524000,Cletus Spuckler,Kwik-E-Mart,And I'd do it again. But I do miss the Royal Crown cola.
75933,297,111,529000,Sideshow Bob,Kwik-E-Mart,"Ah yes, the Kwik-E-Mart. I haven't been here since I robbed it dressed as Krusty. My one successful crime."
75934,297,112,536000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"You were quite the gentleman. Today's robbers, they are all smash and grab. You understood the dance."
75935,297,113,543000,Sideshow Bob,Kwik-E-Mart,"Our time is passing, old friend."
75936,297,114,546000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Uh, if you two country hens are finished clucking, I'd like to buy a copy of Jugs and Ammo."
75938,297,116,556000,Sideshow Bob,Street,"Well, we've settled that argument. You can't read a magazine and drive."
75939,297,117,560000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Look, Junior. I expect this to be fixed with quality GM parts."
75940,297,118,565000,Junior,Street,But your car was built in Croatia. It's made from old Soviet tanks.
75941,297,119,570000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Just fix it, Mr. Sasswrench."
75942,297,120,573000,Sideshow Bob,Street,"Homer please, the last thing you need is more enemies."
75943,297,121,576000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Right, right. I'm countin' the pennies in the ashtray. There's two!"
75945,297,123,587000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"The trap is set. The killer will think this dummy is you, out for an evening stroll. Now we lie in wait, like hungry Cassius for noble Caesar."
75946,297,124,598000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're so smart. Shock him.
75947,297,125,612000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,Odds Bodkins!
75949,297,127,612000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, someone's coming!"
75950,297,128,616000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Now who's the sociopath? Huh?
75951,297,129,619000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Moe! He's got a dark side I've never dreamed of.
75952,297,130,624000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Well, mystery solved. Wait a moment..."
75953,297,131,630000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"He's hurt. Go, go, go!"
75954,297,132,633000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"These are Homer's friends and family. They don't want him dead, they just want him to suffer."
75956,297,134,644000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"Thank you, Lord."
75957,297,135,649000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Once I kill you everyone will think I'm the real Homer!
75958,297,136,653000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,None of this seems odd to you?
75961,297,139,663000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Say, Bob, how come you were never able to kill Bart?"
75962,297,140,666000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, a kid should be real simple to kill."
75963,297,141,668000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,I'd just come up behind him with a knife and slit his throat real quick-like.
75964,297,142,671000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Guys, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think."
75965,297,143,675000,Sideshow Bob,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, if I could write Haikus while skinheads beat me with soap, I can concentrate anywhere."
75967,297,146,696000,Homer Simpson,Bar,Oh my God! He's getting closer!
75968,297,147,698000,Moe Szyslak,Bar,"My poor jar. Oh, why didn't I take more photos?"
75970,297,149,718000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,Here's an interesting clue. Homer's assailant left a black smudge on the spa invitation.
75971,297,150,723000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,This could be the breakthrough we...
75972,297,151,727000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,I thought I could get it while it was in the re-charger I... was... wrong.
75973,297,152,737000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know how we ever had fun without him.
75974,297,153,740000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"We now return to ""That '30s Show""."
75975,297,154,743000,Boy,Simpson Home,"Hey Pop, where's the crank on this Victrola?"
75976,297,155,746000,Dad,Simpson Home,"Why it's the latest model! From now on, the only crank in this house is your Aunt Gladys."
75977,297,156,751000,Aunt Gladys,Simpson Home,"For your information, I'm cranky because I've got polio."
75979,297,158,759000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,Tom Shales gave this show a good review. And I'm the one in prison!
75980,297,159,764000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, Bob... I know you're enjoying fall preview week, but I was wondering if you made any progress towards finding Homer's killer?"
75981,297,160,771000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,No I haven't.
75982,297,161,773000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Go ahead, shock me."
75983,297,162,774000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, just a little one."
75984,297,163,780000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my, it's stuck!"
75985,297,164,794000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,"Listen Homer, I don't know who your killer is, but I do know he'll strike again. Your only hope is to stay completely out of sight."
75986,297,165,801000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Very well. I am gone!
75987,297,166,809000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't look at me!
75988,297,167,810000,Man,Simpson Home,Homer Simpson?
75989,297,168,813000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Right here.
75990,297,169,816000,Man Dressed As Jester,Simpson Home,You've been elected King of Mardi Gras!
75991,297,170,819000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo! Good things do happen to bad people!
75992,297,171,823000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, the king of Mardi Gras has to ride around on a float all day. You'll be a sitting duck."
75993,297,172,828000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you're embarrassing me in front of the drag queen."
75995,297,174,839000,Kent Brockman,Newsroom,It's Mardi Gras time in Springfield!
75996,297,175,842000,Kent Brockman,Newsroom,This year's Mardi Gras king is none other than local hothead Homer Simpson.
75997,297,176,842000,Kent Brockman,Newsroom,"Long live the King! In a related story, Homer Simpson may not have long to live."
75998,297,177,851000,Sideshow Bob,Newsroom,"Homer, it's a trap. You only won because somebody stuffed the ballot box with these."
75999,297,178,859000,Homer Simpson,Newsroom,"Nonetheless, the people have spoken."
76000,297,179,861000,Marge Simpson,Newsroom,But I'm afraid you'll get hurt.
76001,297,180,862000,Homer Simpson,Newsroom,"Marge, this is a way to flush this killer out once and for all -- and get drunk on a Tuesday."
76002,297,181,867000,Marge Simpson,Newsroom,Today's Tuesday and you've had six beers.
76003,297,182,870000,Homer Simpson,Newsroom,But I'm not drunk!
76005,297,184,877000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Street,The killer is out there. I would stake my entire fortune of cigarettes on it.
76006,297,185,883000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Now Bob, I know you're concerned, but don't worry. I have operatives working the crowd."
76007,297,186,889000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Street,"So, uh, you're from Tempe? I'm from Chicago!"
76008,297,187,893000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Street,"Whoa, I'm so drunk I'm gonna puke. You ever get that feeling, beautiful?"
76011,297,190,904000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"America loves its Kings, from George the third to Larry."
76013,297,192,911000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Phew, just Italians."
76014,297,193,916000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Street,His float's already moving? I didn't even hear the engine start!
76015,297,194,920000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Street,"Yeah, it's really running quiet. Some mechanic tuned it up right before the parade."
76016,297,195,924000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Street,A mechanic...?
76017,297,196,940000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Street,"My God, that's it!"
76018,297,197,944000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Street,"Homer, you must get off that float! The brake line has been cut!"
76019,297,198,949000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Oh my God! Attention drunken idiots: this is your king! Sacrifice yourselves to slow me down!
76020,297,199,964000,Reveler,Springfield Street,"Hey, how 'bout some beads?"
76021,297,200,965000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,They're not for dudes!
76022,297,201,967000,Reveler,Springfield Street,That's cool.
76023,297,202,971000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,Dad's heading straight for the Museum of Swordfish!
76024,297,203,974000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,That museum has been nothing but trouble since it opened.
76025,297,204,977000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Street,Must... save... buffoon.
76027,297,206,996000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,I did it!
76028,297,207,1001000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,You saved my life!
76029,297,208,1004000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Street,"I've saved a life... and it feels wonderful. And yet, I could just as easily drop you to your death."
76030,297,209,1013000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Don't be so sure. I've got my legs wrapped around your ass pretty tight.
76031,297,210,1020000,Duffman,Springfield Street,"Everything going dark... like Duff Stout, the beer that made Ireland famous. I love you, Doris! I..."
76032,297,211,1029000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,We're up so high. Where could that shot have come from?
76033,297,212,1035000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Street,There's your killer!
76034,297,213,1037000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Well, duh."
76035,297,214,1042000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Your king needs these stilts!
76036,297,215,1044000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Street,Jesus is our only King.
76037,297,216,1046000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Not anymore!
76038,297,217,1049000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Street,There he is!
76040,297,219,1068000,Homer Simpson,Alley,"Hey, I know you. You're my mechanic, Junior."
