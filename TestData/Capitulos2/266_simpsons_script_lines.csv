66703,266,12,139000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll get us out of this. Say Dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?"
66704,266,13,145000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, Lisa, but I sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast."
66705,266,14,155000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Meet Linguo, the grammar robot. I built him all by myself. If you misuse language, he'll correct you."

66762,266,72,333000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"I'm sorry, Homer. Your H.M.O. doesn't cover this type of injury."
66763,266,73,337000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,But I have finger insurance!
66764,266,74,339000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,A thumb is not a finger.
66765,266,75,341000,Marge Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Isn't there anything you can do?
66766,266,76,342000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Well, I could cut off the other thumb for a sense of symmetry."
66767,266,77,346000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Symmetry, eh?"
66769,266,79,347000,Marge Simpson,FERRARI,Hibbert's really losing it. We're going to Dr. Nick's.
66772,266,82,351000,Homer Simpson,FERRARI,We need more ice! My thumb is fading fast.
66774,266,84,355000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Quick, Moe! Marge cut off my thumb!"
66775,266,85,358000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,No problem. Just stick the ol' eye-gouger in the pickle brine. That'll keep your thumb fresh and delicious.
66776,266,86,364000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Thanks, Moe."
66777,266,87,366000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, ah, hey, ain't you gonna have a beer?"
66778,266,88,368000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss and all... Although I do like the occasional beer..."
66780,266,90,376000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Did you ever see that ""Blue Man Group?"" Total rip-off of the Smurfs. And the Smurfs? They suck."
66781,266,91,385000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Uh-oh. I smell gangrene. We gotta wake him up.
66782,266,92,388000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,A little coffee'll do the trick.
66784,266,93,394000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I've gotta get to Dr. Nick's!
66786,266,95,396000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Where's Marge?! That is so rude. I know, I'll hitchhike."

66859,266,170,697000,Lisa Simpson,West Springfield Elementary School,Sorry. I was rushing because I'm in the wrong school. Can you believe that?
66860,266,171,702000,BOOKISH BOY,West Springfield Elementary School,It's understandable. All the schools in this area were built from identical plans. I guess they didn't have enough money to hire I.M. Pei.

66870,266,181,744000,Lisa Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"We've been spinning for hours! I've got to get to my school and hand in Linguo. Oh, but I don't want to leave you."
66871,266,182,752000,Thelonious,PLAYGROUND,You must. You can't sacrifice grades for romance. That's not the girl I fell for.
66872,266,183,756000,Lisa Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Will I ever see you again?

66880,266,191,784000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, no can do, Dollface. I've got an informant wearing a wire."
66881,266,192,787000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,"Heh, just like on ""Nash Bridges."" We're tryin' to get the goods on some smugglers."
66882,266,193,792000,VOICE ON TRANSMITTER,Moe's Tavern,"Why, I'd be delighted to sell you some illegally smuggled goods."
66883,266,194,796000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,That sounds like Fat Tony.
66884,266,195,797000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,"Hm, only one way to be sure."
66885,266,196,799000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,"Fat Tony, is that you? Fat Tony?"

66890,266,201,819000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,Oh.
66891,266,202,821000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Quick, Moe! Marge cut off my thumb."

66894,266,205,831000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I stole it from McBain after I cut off your father's thumb.
66895,266,206,834000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Can you take me to school? Please?
66896,266,207,836000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Not right now. Your father's in there and --

66900,266,211,853000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Oh, no. We're out of gas. I couldn't figure out this stupid Italian gas gauge."
66901,266,212,859000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,I've gotta get to school.
66902,266,213,864000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Hm, let's hitch a ride with that hick."
