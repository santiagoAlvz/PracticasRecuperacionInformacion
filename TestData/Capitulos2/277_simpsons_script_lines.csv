70123,277,33,161000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,That's a great idea. Do you think I could run a mile in three and a half minutes?
70124,277,34,165000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Only on Mars.

70141,277,50,221000,Male Executive,Duff World Records Office,All the individual records were set by crackpots who half-killed themselves. The only way someone new can get in the book is with some kind of group stunt.

70143,277,52,229000,Female Executive,Duff World Records Office,Like that town that made the world's largest omelet.

70205,277,116,523000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Kwik-E-Mart,Damn it! When they come in you call me at this number.
70206,277,117,529000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Nine one one.

70215,277,126,571000,Marge Simpson,MOTHERLOVING SUGAR,"I want you to stop putting so much sugar in everything, or at least warn people that it's so unhealthy."
70216,277,127,578000,MOTHERLOVING,MOTHERLOVING SUGAR,"Hm, that'll boost sales. While we're at it, why don't I just change my name back to Hitler?"
70217,277,128,583000,Marge Simpson,MOTHERLOVING SUGAR,Don't you have any sense of corporate responsibility?
70218,277,129,589000,Marge Simpson,MOTHERLOVING SUGAR,Hey!

70224,277,135,609000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you looked up meanie-beanie-fo-feanie in the dictionary, you'd see his picture."
70225,277,136,614000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wait. You went to a sugar factory? Were there Oompa-Loompas?
70226,277,137,619000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"There was one in a cage, but he wasn't moving."
70228,277,139,624000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That company's ruining the whole town's health, and I don't know how to stop them."
70229,277,140,629000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't you file a class-action suit?
70230,277,141,631000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh yeah, like Erin Brockovich."
70231,277,142,635000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The prostitute with a heart of gold.
70234,277,145,639000,Marge Simpson,Car,I'm not sure I can afford a fancy lawyer.
70235,277,146,641000,Lisa Simpson,Car,"That's okay, Mom. Today's law schools are churning out two point one lawyers for every person in America. Look."
70236,277,147,649000,Lawyers,Car,"Pick me! / No, pick me!"
69720,277,148,651000,Male Lawyer,Car,Me so litigious.

70241,277,153,664000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"We have to sign up plaintiffs, and take depositions from the townspeople."
70242,277,154,668000,Gil Gunderson,Simpson Home,"Aw, geez. You don't want ol' Gil going door-to-door. Oh, I've made too many enemies selling suckless vacuum cleaners and Rick James Bibles."
70243,277,155,676000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't worry. I'll do the legwork.
70246,277,158,678000,Marge Simpson,Wiggum Home,I'm filing a class action lawsuit against Big Sugar. Would you like to give a deposition?
70247,277,159,684000,Chief Wiggum,Wiggum Home,Sure I'll join your lawsuit. Sugar's made my Ralphie hyperactive.
70248,277,160,689000,Ralph Wiggum,Wiggum Home,I'm happy and angry!
70250,277,162,692000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,"Oh shoot, I'll sign. Figure them sugar folk owe me fer wut they done ta my cousin, Dia-Betty."

70253,277,165,710000,Cletus Spuckler,Cletus's Shack,Now let's see if I can remember how to make my mark.
70255,277,167,718000,Disco Stu,DISCO STU'S '70S-STYLE BACHELOR PAD,I'll get down with your lawsuit. Disco Stu got hooked on the white stuff back in the seventies.
70258,277,170,748000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, hello Homer."
70259,277,171,749000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, well. If it isn't the woman who's too busy saving the world to save her own marriage."
70260,277,172,755000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you talking about? Is that dinner?
70261,277,173,758000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It was dinner.
70262,277,174,761000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why didn't you just turn off the oven?
70263,277,175,764000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I was hoping we could do that together.
70264,277,176,773000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Hello?
70265,277,177,775000,ELECTRONICALLY-ALTERED VOICE,Simpson Home,Marge Simpson?

70267,277,179,785000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Professor Frink?
70268,277,180,787000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,"Oh, what gave me away? Out of curiosity, was it the hoyvin or the mayvin or the whole go-hoy-vy thing that I do?"
70270,277,182,794000,Gil Gunderson,Courtroom,"So Professor, tell us about operation ""hoyvin-mayvin."""
70271,277,183,799000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Courtroom,Well we knew perfectly well it was addictive. Candy was just a sugar delivery system. We thought we were God. Hoyvin-mayvin.
70272,277,184,809000,MOTHERLOVING,Courtroom,"Frink, you little weasel, I'll kill you."
70273,277,185,812000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,May I remind you we're in open court?
70274,277,186,813000,MOTHERLOVING,Courtroom,I'll kill you too.
70275,277,187,814000,MOTHERLOVING,Courtroom,I'll kill you all!
70276,277,188,816000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Mr. Motherloving, that could be interpreted as a threat."
70277,277,189,819000,MOTHERLOVING,Courtroom,I'll kill you while you sleep.
70278,277,190,820000,Gil Gunderson,Courtroom,Objection!
70279,277,191,821000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,Mm... I'll allow it.
70280,277,192,823000,Gil Gunderson,Courtroom,"Now, Count Fudge-ula, how long were you spokes-vampire for Motherloving's breakfast cereals?"
70281,277,193,836000,Count Fudge-ula,Courtroom,Now all my victims have to be mashed up.
70282,277,194,839000,Audience,Courtroom,Awww...
70283,277,195,840000,MOTHERLOVING,Courtroom,"Your Honor, I admit it looks bad for me."
70284,277,196,843000,MOTHERLOVING,Courtroom,But I think you might be turned around by some surprising taste-imony.
70285,277,197,852000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"Sir, this is a house of justice, not a sugar-shack. It's Hershey highwaymen like you who made me fat."
70286,277,198,858000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"Well, your honor, the court carries it well."
70287,277,199,860000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,Silence! I rule in favor of Marge Simpson.
70288,277,200,866000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Oh, I am so proud of you."
70289,277,201,869000,Judge Snyder,Courtroom,"And, thanks to Marge's Simpson's damning evidence... I hereby ban all sugar products from Springfield -- forever!"
70290,277,202,876000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Get in the car.
70291,277,203,880000,Kent Brockman,Courtroom,"Good evening. Our top story: Springfield's cake-hole has been shut, forever. Under what has been dubbed ""Marge's Law,"" all forms of sugar are now illegal."
70293,277,205,888000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Thank you, Erin Choco-snitch. That was a group effort."
70294,277,206,893000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I was just trying to make this a healthier place to live.
70295,277,207,896000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, good work, Blue-hair 'n' Brocko-witch. Okay, that was mine."
70296,277,208,903000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"So say a bittersweet farewell to such old friends as: Mud Pies, Bite 'ems, Éclairios, Chew 'ems, Kellogg's All-Fudge, Big Red Snack Foam, Milk Chuds, Eat 'ems..."
70299,277,209,903000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,And all sugar pills will be changed back to highly-concentrated opiates.
70301,277,211,922000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"That's it, boys. Burn it all."
70302,277,212,924000,Lou,Springfield,"Even this promotional Johnny Depp from the movie ""Chocolat""?"
70303,277,213,927000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,We melted for him. Now he's gonna do likewise.
70304,277,214,934000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"All right, time to throw in the Butterfingers."
70305,277,215,942000,Eddie,Springfield,Hm. It's not even singed.
70306,277,216,944000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,Even the fire doesn't want them.
