49450,210,73,328000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Why don't you play with one of Bart's video games instead? Hugh Downs says they're the latest craze.

49514,210,137,554000,Lisa Simpson,Hallway,"We've got a test, and I didn't read the book. I'll get a zero for sure, Bart! What do I do?"
49515,210,138,559000,Bart Simpson,Hallway,"Well, if it was me, I'd just take the zero. Ah, but, that's not for everyone. There's one other possibility."

49571,210,197,748000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, it just turned up in the course of my daily rummaging. By the way, I oiled the hinge on your diary."

49576,210,202,764000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Aw, cheer up, Lis. You got a good grade without even reading the book. That's win-win."
49577,210,203,768000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,Can't you see the difference between earning something honestly and getting it by fraud?
49578,210,204,773000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Hmmm... I suppose maybe if, uh... no. No, sorry, thought I had it there for a sec."

49592,210,217,848000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Stop it! I cheated! Cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated!"
49593,210,218,853000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Lisa, what are you trying to say?"
49594,210,219,856000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,I cheated!
49596,210,221,862000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"You cheated? Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy. Why didn't Miss Hoover tell me?"
49597,210,222,867000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,She doesn't know. You're the only one I've told.
49598,210,223,871000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Well... then, one could make the argument... that... there really is no problem."
49599,210,224,878000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,But what I did was wrong.
49600,210,225,880000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Oh, very much so, but as long as we handle this in a mature and, above all, quiet manner, we'll still get that grant money. Oh, you really scared me there."
49601,210,226,891000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,But we can't accept that money. It's tainted.
49602,210,227,894000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Now, now, leave the money out of this. It's not the money's fault you cheated. Besides, I've already started spending it. Check out the new scoreboard!"
49603,210,228,905000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,I'm still learning all the buttons.
49604,210,229,906000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Well, if you're gonna cover this up, I'll just have to go over your head to Super--"
49605,210,230,911000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,Intendent--
49606,210,231,913000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,Chalmers.
49607,210,232,918000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,Skinner!! I am outraged that you've kept this from me!
49608,210,233,922000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"You were supposed to call as soon as the new scoreboard was in. Tell me, does it play that song ""Charge""?"
49609,210,234,927000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Ohhh, does it ever!"
49610,210,235,929000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,You can't keep this scoreboard -- because there's not gonna be any grant money! Because I cheated!
49611,210,236,938000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"Lisa, let's take a walk. A little traveling music, Seymour."
49613,210,238,945000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Good Lord, what a dump. It's not surprising this school was once classified the most dilapidated in all of Missouri."
49614,210,239,955000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,That's why it was shut down and moved here brick by brick.
49615,210,240,957000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Look around, Lisa. That grant money could do a lot of good."
49616,210,241,961000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Don't you think those youngsters deserve a regulation tetherball?
49617,210,242,965000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Ow!
49618,210,243,966000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Ooh!
49619,210,244,967000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,We could buy real periodic tables instead of these promotional ones from Oscar Mayer.
49620,210,245,972000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, who can tell me the atomic weight of Bolognium?"
49621,210,246,974000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"Ooo, delicious?"
49622,210,247,976000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Correct. I would also accept ""snacktacular."""
49624,210,249,977000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"And for the first time ever, our computer lab actually has a computer in it."
49626,210,251,988000,Ralph Wiggum,CLASSROOM,"Hi Lisa, hi SuperNintendo Chalmers."
49627,210,252,995000,Ralph Wiggum,CLASSROOM,I'm learnding!
49628,210,253,996000,Lisa Simpson,CLASSROOM,"Aww. Way to go, Ralph."
49629,210,254,998000,Gil Gunderson,CLASSROOM,"Ah, she's a beaut. You can't beat a Coleco. How many can I put you down for? A lot? Please say a lot. I need this."
49630,210,255,1005000,Seymour Skinner,CLASSROOM,I don't know. I'm not even sure we can keep this one. It's up to Lisa.
49631,210,256,1010000,Gary Chalmers,CLASSROOM,"What do you say, Lisa? Will you keep our little secret for the good of your classmates and your school?"
49632,210,257,1015000,Gil Gunderson,CLASSROOM,"And let's not forget old Gil, huh? The wolf's at old Gil's door."
49633,210,258,1027000,Lisa Simpson,CLASSROOM,I guess I don't have much choice.
49634,210,259,1030000,Gil Gunderson,CLASSROOM,"Oh, thank God! Now let's talk rustproofing. These Coleco's will rust up on you like that. Ah-- Shut up, Gil. Close the deal. Close the deal."
49636,210,261,1041000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Public Beach,"Relax, boy, we're not gonna cook you. Enjoy your day at the beach! Ooh, look."
49637,210,262,1047000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Public Beach,Here's a little playmate for you.
49638,210,263,1051000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Public Beach,"Hey, you don't have to take that from no punk-ass crab. What's wrong with you?"
49639,210,264,1056000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Springfield Public Beach,"Arr, it's not his fault he's a sissy. Someone's been coddling him."
49640,210,265,1060000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Public Beach,Don't look at me! I wanted to eat him!
49641,210,266,1063000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Springfield Public Beach,"Eh, sorry, it's usually the mother. You know, I run a small academy for lobsters like this one. We stress tough love -- daily chores and the like..."
49642,210,267,1073000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Public Beach,No! We're not sending the lobster away to some snobby boarding school.
49643,210,268,1077000,Captain Horatio McCallister,Springfield Public Beach,"Yarr, I understand, i-it's hard to let go. Eh, tell me this, then -- do ya have any spare change?"
49644,210,270,1087000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"And now, to present the grant money, a legendary figure in educational disbursement: State Comptroller Atkins."
49645,210,271,1097000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Wooo!!
49646,210,272,1101000,Comptroller Atkins,Springfield Elementary School,Thank you. I'm here tonight to honor the girl whose unprecedented test score has set a new standard in excellence.
49647,210,273,1107000,Comptroller Atkins,Springfield Elementary School,Lisa?
49648,210,274,1112000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Thank you. I know this giant check is very important to everyone here. But, what's even more important is the truth."
49649,210,275,1123000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Because after all, education is the search for truth..."
49650,210,276,1125000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"No, no it isn't! Don't listen to her! She's out of her mind!"
49651,210,277,1128000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"... And the truth is, we don't deserve this grant, and I don't deserve your applause. I cheated on that test."
49652,210,278,1136000,Comptroller Atkins,Springfield Elementary School,Wait! How dare you condemn this girl? Who among you can honestly say you've never cheated... on your wives? Or your husbands?
49653,210,279,1146000,Comptroller Atkins,Springfield Elementary School,"What she just did took courage. And where I come from, Canada, we reward courage. So I hereby decree that you keep the grant. And let's give this brave girl the ovation she deserves!"
49654,210,280,1165000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you. You got the highest grade in the class."
49655,210,281,1169000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"But, Mom--"
49656,210,282,1170000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,The highest grade.
49657,210,283,1173000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, Lisa's gone!"
49658,210,284,1175000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Places, people!"
49659,210,285,1177000,Otto Mann,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, man, acting is tough. I'll be in my trailer."
49660,210,286,1183000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, good old predictable Lisa! I knew her conscience was a ticking time bomb."
49661,210,287,1189000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Heads up! Here comes the real Comptroller.
49663,210,289,1192000,REAL COMPT. ATKINS,Springfield Elementary School,This grant ensures...
49665,210,291,1192000,REAL COMPT. ATKINS,Auditorium,"... a lightbulb in every classroom, and a high-definition TV for the teachers' lounge."
49666,210,292,1203000,REAL COMPT. ATKINS,Auditorium,"Now, where's the little girl who made this grant possible? Where's Lisa Simpson?"
49667,210,293,1212000,REAL COMPT. ATKINS,Auditorium,"Come on up here, Lisa."
49670,210,294,1215000,REAL COMPT. ATKINS,Auditorium,"Well, how 'bout that? Smart and modest. Well, I should be going now. These giant checks don't hand themselves out."
49671,210,295,1222000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,"Okay, people, let's have a round of applause for the real Comptroller."
49672,210,296,1230000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,I know a liquor store where we can cash this right now.
49675,210,299,1240000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's one grade I truly earned.
49676,210,300,1243000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Who left these muddy claw prints on my clean floor?
49677,210,301,1246000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Marge. Pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. But don't worry. I put him in a nice hot bath."
49678,210,302,1254000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, what smells so good?"
49679,210,303,1255000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah... Pinchy?... Pinchy?!... Oh... Pinchy!!!
49682,210,306,1273000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh, man, that's good. Pass the butter."
49683,210,307,1282000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Are you gonna eat that all by yourself?
49684,210,308,1284000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Uh-huh. Pinchy would have wanted it this way. My dear, sweet Pinchy. No more pain where you are now, boy."
49685,210,309,1301000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh God, that's tasty. I wish Pinchy were here to enjoy this. Ohhh, Pinchy!"
