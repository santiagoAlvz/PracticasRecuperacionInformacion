110706,427,20,140000,Lisa Simpson,Mapple Store,It's so sterile! MyPods... MyPhones... A Brainiac Bar!
110708,427,21,146000,Comic Book Guy,Mapple Store,My question is the following statement: Operating System Four Point Two has sloppier architecture than a Tijuana anthill.
110709,427,22,154000,Brainiac Bar Man,Mapple Store,Did you get peanut butter in your Ethernet port again?
110710,427,23,157000,Comic Book Guy,Mapple Store,No. I got mayonnaise in the C.D. drive.
110712,427,25,161000,Smug Salesman,Mapple Store,I see you're admiring our MyCube. It's fueled by dreams and powered by imagination.
110713,427,26,166000,Homer Simpson,Mapple Store,What does it do?
110714,427,27,168000,Smug Salesman,Mapple Store,"You should ask yourself, ""What can I do for it?"""

110716,427,29,174000,Smug Salesman,Mapple Store,"Sir, it's not even turned on yet."
110717,427,30,175000,Homer Simpson,Mapple Store,But it's glowing.
110718,427,31,176000,Smug Salesman,Mapple Store,That light confirms that it's off.
110719,427,32,180000,Lisa Simpson,Mapple Store,"I can't afford any of your products, but can I buy some fake white earbuds, so people will think I have a MyPod?"
110720,427,33,186000,Saleswoman,Mapple Store,"Sure -- those are called ""MyPhonies."""
110721,427,34,186000,Saleswoman,Mapple Store,"Oh, and they cost forty dollars."

110727,427,40,221000,Krusty the Clown,Mapple Store,"Here kid, you take it."
110728,427,41,222000,Lisa Simpson,Mapple Store,"Thank you, Krusty!"

110739,427,49,248000,Steve Mobbs,Mapple Store,"Greetings, it is I, your insanely great leader, Steve Mobbs! I'm speaking to you from Mapple headquarters deep below the sea, with an announcement that will completely change the way you look at everything..."
110741,427,51,261000,Steve Mobbs,Mapple Store,And that announcement is...
110742,427,52,262000,Bart Simpson,Mapple Store,You're all losers!
110744,427,54,266000,Bart Simpson,Mapple Store,"You think you're cool because you buy a five hundred dollar phone with a picture of a fruit on it?! Well, guess what? They cost eight bucks to make and I pee on every one!"
110746,427,56,275000,Bart Simpson,Mapple Store,I have made a fortune off you chumps -- and I've invested it all in Microsoft! Now my boyfriend Bill Gates and I kiss each other on a pile of your money!

110748,427,58,285000,Comic Book Guy,Mapple Store,Traitor! Your heart is blacker than your turtleneck!
110749,427,59,299000,Saleswoman,Mapple Store,Who dares question the boss we fired ten years ago and then brought back?
110750,427,60,303000,Lisa Simpson,Mapple Store,It was my brother Bart!
110751,427,61,305000,Saleswoman,Mapple Store,Flay him with your earbuds! Flay him I say!
110752,427,62,310000,Bart Simpson,Mapple Store,MyCube! Take me away!
110753,427,63,318000,Saleswoman,Mapple Store,Get him!
110755,427,65,322000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD STREET - EARLY EVENING,Stupid angry mob... chasing me because I shine a harsh light on modern society. Now I know how Dane Cook feels.
110756,427,66,330000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD STREET - EARLY EVENING,"Mmm, what's that exotic aroma? It smells like a hamburger cooked at a rug store."
110758,427,68,340000,MIDDLE EASTERN BOY,Backyard,Hello.
110759,427,69,341000,MIDDLE EASTERN BOY,Backyard,Would you like some lamb?
110760,427,70,345000,Bart Simpson,Backyard,Whoa. All these years I've been petting lambs when I should've been shoving them in my mouth. I'm Bart.
110761,427,71,351000,Bashir,Backyard,"I'm Bashir. My family and I just moved here, from Jordan."
110762,427,72,355000,Bart Simpson,Backyard,"Jordan. That's on some map somewhere, right?"
110763,427,73,357000,Mina,Backyard,"Bashir, introduce me to your new friend."
110764,427,74,360000,Bart Simpson,Backyard,"Bashir, you didn't tell me you had a sister."
110765,427,75,363000,Mina,Backyard,Such a charmer. Would you like to stay for dinner?
110766,427,76,368000,Bart Simpson,Backyard,"Hey, I never refuse food from strangers."

110769,427,79,371000,Groundskeeper Willie,SPRINGFIELD - MORNING,"Ah, that's not clever. And I have so many aspects you can mock! I'm poor, I'm dirty, I can't read nor write, I think movies are real..."
110770,427,80,391000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD - MORNING,"Okay, next, here's the food at the cafeteria that will make you sick: coleslaw, tuna, all chowders and gumbos. The only thing that's safe is the pork chops."
110771,427,81,400000,Bashir,SPRINGFIELD - MORNING,My religion says I can never eat pork.
110772,427,82,403000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD - MORNING,"A different religion? Do not tell anyone that, because if the bullies around here find out that you're different--"
110773,427,83,408000,Jimbo Jones,SPRINGFIELD - MORNING,Who's different?
110774,427,84,411000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,SPRINGFIELD - MORNING,"What's your name, sweat stain?"
110775,427,85,414000,Bashir,SPRINGFIELD - MORNING,"Uh, Bashir."
110776,427,86,416000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,SPRINGFIELD - MORNING,"""Bash here?"" I love a kid that comes with directions."
110778,427,88,425000,Jimbo Jones,Evergreen Terrace,"Okay, ""Bashir"". Tell us where you came from so we can punch you back there."
110779,427,89,430000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Evergreen Terrace,I'm gonna punch you extra hard 'cause I secretly think you're cute.
110780,427,90,433000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't just whale on him because he's... what religion are you anyway?"
110781,427,91,438000,Bashir,Evergreen Terrace,Muslim.
110782,427,92,438000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Hoo boy.
110783,427,93,440000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Evergreen Terrace,You're the reason I can't carry toothpaste on an airplane!
110784,427,94,443000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Evergreen Terrace,Ow!
110785,427,95,445000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Look guys, everyone's different. Jimbo, you're Christian. Dolph, you're Jewish. And Kearney, your family's in that cult Moe started."
110786,427,96,452000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Evergreen Terrace,"I had to join. My Mom's doin' the savior. I mean, the one true Moe."
110787,427,97,457000,Jimbo Jones,Evergreen Terrace,You're the one true mo.
110789,427,99,465000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Evergreen Terrace,"Help me, almighty Moe!"
110790,427,100,468000,Moe Szyslak,Evergreen Terrace,Can't. I'm not really a God. I was just acting crazy to get out of jury duty.
110791,427,101,476000,Sherri Mackleberry,Evergreen Terrace,"Look at Lisa Simpson, over there by herself."
110792,427,102,479000,Terri Mackleberry,Evergreen Terrace,"Not talking to us, her best friends. Do we hate her?"
110793,427,103,483000,Terri Mackleberry,Evergreen Terrace,Yes.
110736,427,105,484000,Terri Mackleberry,PLAYGROUND,"Lisa, we came to tell you that we-- Is that a MyPod?"
110737,427,106,489000,Lisa Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Yeah.
110796,427,107,489000,Lisa Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"I've already downloaded so much incredible music! Check out ""Moon Dreams"" from Miles Davis' ""Birth of the Cool."""
110797,427,108,505000,Lisa Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"Or, check out this MyTunes-exclusive episode of ""Itchy and Scratchy."""
110799,427,110,545000,Octopus,PLAYGROUND,Why?
110800,427,111,562000,Scratchy,PLAYGROUND,Stop!
110802,427,113,586000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I installed all the low energy bulbs!"
110803,427,114,588000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What have you done with the old ones?
110804,427,115,590000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Disposed of them in an environmentally friendly manner!
110806,427,117,597000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Salaam alaikum.
110807,427,118,598000,Bashir,Simpson Home,Salaam alaikum!
110808,427,119,599000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Milhouse is lookin' good -- he's got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... Salaam alaikum!"
110809,427,120,607000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, that's Bashir -- my new friend."
110810,427,121,612000,Bashir,Simpson Home,"Bart forgot this, sir."
110811,427,122,613000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sir? That's the kind of respect you'd have to strangle out of an American kid.
110812,427,123,619000,Bashir,Simpson Home,"You know, Bart never told me he had a handsome teenage brother."
110813,427,124,624000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm really thirty-eight.
110814,427,125,626000,Bashir,Simpson Home,Thirty-eight waist I might believe.
110817,427,128,632000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Hey Carl, got any idea what direction Mecca's in?"
110818,427,129,634000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Why don'tcha ask Homer? He oughtta know, by dint of his son's new friend."
110820,427,131,640000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, Bashir's great. If Derek Jeter married Mariah Carey, it wouldn't last, but I bet they'd have a kid like him."
110821,427,132,648000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, this is serious. This Bashir kid is Muslim, and therefore up to something."
110822,427,133,652000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, I can't believe that till I see a fictional TV program espousing your point of view."
110823,427,134,659000,Fbi Agent,Moe's Tavern,"For the last time, Fayed, where did you hide the nerve gas!"
110824,427,135,662000,Arab Man,Moe's Tavern,Under your Statue Of Liberty's dress!
110825,427,136,665000,Arab Man,Moe's Tavern,And she loved it!
110826,427,137,667000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Oh my God. What can I do?
110828,427,138,669000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, if you want to stop Bashir and his war on American principles, you could discriminate against his family, in employment and housing."
110829,427,139,676000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"That's pretty patriotic, but I got a better idea -- invite 'em over."
110830,427,140,679000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"A little dinner, a little dessert, then you Jack Bauer 'em into giving you all their secrets."
110832,427,142,685000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I guess I have no choice.
110834,427,144,691000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, it's very open-minded of you to have Bart's Muslim friend's Muslim family over."
110835,427,145,697000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here's the plan, Marge. You keep 'em talking. I'll be listening... and quietly judging."
110836,427,146,705000,Thought Bubble Lenny,Simpson Home,The doorbell will tell you when they're here.
110837,427,147,709000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, how did you two meet?"
110838,427,148,712000,Amid,Simpson Home,We met while studying at Jordan University of Science and Technology.
110839,427,149,717000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, interesting. Why just the other day I was reading that science is used to make bombs."
110840,427,150,727000,Thought Bubble Lenny,Simpson Home,Now bait the trap.
110841,427,151,729000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why don't I get us dessert?
110842,427,152,735000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I made us a little cake.
110843,427,153,737000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Care to cut? Watch this, Lenny."
110844,427,154,741000,Thought Bubble Lenny,Simpson Home,Not now! I got soap in my eyes.
110845,427,155,744000,Amid,Simpson Home,"No, thank you."
110846,427,156,745000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What's the matter? Don't like the taste of freedom?
110847,427,157,749000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad! These people are my friends! Don't fear them just because they have a different religion, a different culture, and their last name is Bin Laden!"
110848,427,158,756000,Amid,Simpson Home,"Young man, you do not respect us by disrespecting your father."
110849,427,159,759000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I like the way you Italians think.
110850,427,160,761000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Shut up, old man."
110851,427,161,763000,Mina,Simpson Home,I think it is time for us to go.
110852,427,162,766000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it! Ruin a perfect evening!
110853,427,163,769000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're teaching Bart a terrible lesson of intolerance!
110854,427,164,773000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm sorry -- it's just so fun and easy to judge people based on religion.
110855,427,165,778000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I want you to go over to their house and apologize!"
110827,427,166,781000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But we're the more powerful country for a few more years.
110856,427,167,786000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, I'll apologize."
110857,427,168,789000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Up-bup-bup! Don't eat that, sweetie, it's poison."
110859,427,170,801000,Homer Simpson,STREETS OF SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,I am sorry I suspected you of being soulless murderers of innocent children. I hope we can move past this and...
110860,427,171,812000,Homer Simpson,STREETS OF SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,Dynamite?! They are terrorists! Must leave quietly.
110861,427,172,827000,Homer Simpson,STREETS OF SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,So far so good.
110863,427,174,833000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge! I was right! Everybody is whatever I think they are.
110864,427,175,838000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I saw them unloading dynamite!
110865,427,176,841000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, I'm sure you didn't see anything. Go to sleep."
110866,427,177,845000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, sweetie. But if I wake up tomorrow we'll discuss it."
110867,427,178,859000,Bashir,Simpson Home,"Hi, Homer!"
110868,427,179,866000,Blue Genie,Simpson Home,"You rubbed? You must like me. You really, really like me! Good Morrrning, Ramadan! Come to Crazy Fayeddie's! Our prices are Hussein!"
110869,427,180,878000,Blue Genie,Simpson Home,Heeeeere's Genie!
110870,427,181,881000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now do Flanders!
110871,427,182,881000,Blue Genie,Simpson Home,"No, now I will destroy your decadent Western society."
110872,427,183,901000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Nooooooo!
110873,427,184,903000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hm. Usually that ends the dream.
110874,427,185,909000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The power of dreaming has convinced me the threat is real!
110875,427,186,916000,Mail Lady,Simpson Home,Delivery for Lisa Simpson.
110876,427,187,920000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's a gift from Mapple!
110877,427,188,922000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, such beautiful packaging! I never thought a company could be my soul mate!"
110878,427,189,927000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, it's my first MyBill. Twelve hundred dollars?! But I only downloaded... twelve hundred and twelve songs!"
110880,427,191,943000,Homer Simpson,BASHIR'S HOUSE,Gotta prove the genie was right...
110881,427,192,946000,Amid,BASHIR'S HOUSE,Off to work.
110882,427,193,948000,Mina,BASHIR'S HOUSE,Sometimes I wish you would quit that awful business.
110883,427,194,951000,Amid,BASHIR'S HOUSE,But I love blowing up buildings.
110884,427,195,954000,Homer Simpson,BASHIR'S HOUSE,Oh my God!
110885,427,196,956000,Amid,BASHIR'S HOUSE,"Safely and legally, in order to make room for new buildings."
110886,427,197,959000,Mina,BASHIR'S HOUSE,"Darling, I think you're working much too hard."
110888,427,198,963000,Amid,BASHIR'S HOUSE,"Yes, I am killing myself. But it is all for the profit. After the explosion I will be in a better place."
110889,427,199,972000,Amid,BASHIR'S HOUSE,That corner office with the downtown view!
110890,427,200,985000,Mina,BASHIR'S HOUSE,"Oh, it's you. What do you want?"
