57015,234,140,674000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,If you'd've been awake you would have said no. You can see the bind I was in.

57040,234,165,786000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I think it's great you've chosen to ""crash"" here, but do you have to be so messy?"
57041,234,166,791000,Ramrod,Simpson Home,"Yeah, it's part of being a lowlife."
57042,234,167,800000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, police? Can you send a SWAT team to 742 Evergreen Ter..."
57044,234,169,807000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Forget it, Simpson. Those pig noises you made really hurt my feelings -- looking like a pig as I do."
57045,234,170,813000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,But you have so much inner beauty.
57046,234,171,815000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Well, uh, be that as it may, ah, the gang is wanted in eight other states and we have a little saying around here: ""Let Michigan handle it""."

57053,234,178,859000,Meathook,Simpson Home,"Marge, how did you get my jacket so clean? I've tried everything to get those blood and puke stains out. I've tried hitting 'em. I've tried yelling at 'em..."
57054,234,179,868000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,All it takes is the right cleanser and a little elbow grease.
57055,234,180,871000,Ramrod,Simpson Home,"Do you have anything that will get this emblem back on my jacket? I tried spitting at it, ya know, but..."
57056,234,181,875000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just put it on my sewing pile. Okay, I'm doing another load of bandanas!"
57057,234,182,885000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey! Hey! That's a leave-in conditioner!
57058,234,183,888000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're done. Next!
57059,234,184,890000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I'm tired of bathing in the yard. Plus, I think Rod and Todd are watching."

57061,234,186,900000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, bikers, that's it. Benjamin Franklin once said that house guests are like fish at... huh? They're gone! Woo hoo!"
57062,234,187,910000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,... And those bikers saw that hard look in my eye -- you know that hard look I get sometimes? -- and they ran away like schoolgirls with their tails between their legs.
57063,234,188,922000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Way to go Dad. Hey, where's the food?"
57065,234,189,925000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,And why aren't I at school?
57066,234,190,927000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, someone really dropped the ball here. Marge? Marge?!"
57067,234,191,932000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, there's a note on the back of your head."

57085,234,209,984000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Korean Love Brides""?!"
57086,234,210,986000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I just don't want to be alone.
57089,234,213,1003000,Homer Simpson,POPPA WHEELIE'S,"Excuse me, has anyone seen a woman wearing..."
57090,234,214,1010000,Homer Simpson,POPPA WHEELIE'S,That's more like it. I'm looking for...
57093,234,217,1012000,Homer Simpson,Bar,I'll show you.
57094,234,218,1027000,Homer Simpson,Bar,"Okay, we kinda got off on the wrong foot there. Long story short, my ""old lady"" was..."
57095,234,219,1038000,Homer Simpson,Bar,"Oh, goodness. Mmm, some people never learn."
57098,234,222,1041000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,"All right, Satans, we roll out at dawn."
57099,234,223,1044000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,Where are we going?
57100,234,224,1045000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,"To the Biker's Jamboree in South Dakota. You'll love it. Mickey Rourke's comin', and we're gonna jump him."
57101,234,225,1051000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,"You know, there's more to life than boozing and roughhousing."
57102,234,226,1056000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,Haven't any of you ever had a dream?
57103,234,227,1058000,Ramrod,GANG'S CAMP,"Yeah, I had a dream. I was in this beautiful garden, pounding the crap out of a shopkeeper then..."
57104,234,228,1065000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,"No, no, I mean the dream of a good job, a loving family, and a home in the suburbs."
57105,234,229,1071000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,"Oh man, to get all that, you'd have to kill like fifty people."
57106,234,230,1075000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,"No, you don't have to kill anyone. Not if you have jobs."
57107,234,231,1079000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,And the first step is an eye-catching resumé.
57108,234,232,1079000,Ramrod,GANG'S CAMP,I believe it's pronounced resumé.
57109,234,233,1085000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,"Actually, both are acceptable."
57111,234,235,1087000,Attendant,Rural Gas Station,"Yeah, I did see some bikers ride by here with a blue-haired woman, 'bout ten minutes ago. Said they were gonna spend the night at Crystal Lake Campground, Section K, Space 217. I'm sorry I can't be of more help."
57112,234,236,1100000,Homer Simpson,Rural Gas Station,I guess I'll never find her.
57114,234,238,1105000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,"And when you get a job interview, try not to call your employer a ""punk"" or a ""skank."""
57115,234,239,1110000,Bikers,GANG'S CAMP,"Makes sense. / Oh, don't call them skanks."
57116,234,240,1114000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,"Uh, Mrs. Simpson? I killed my pencil."
57117,234,241,1118000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,Broke! You broke your pencil.
57118,234,242,1121000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,"I ""broke"" him."
57119,234,243,1124000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,That's right. And what else have we learned?
57120,234,244,1126000,Ramrod,GANG'S CAMP,"Ooo, ooo. That, uh, violence is wrong."
57121,234,245,1130000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,"Excellent, Ramrod. Civilized people solve their disputes with words."
57123,234,247,1136000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,"Homer, stop! No, you don't understand!"
57124,234,248,1145000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,"Marge! What do we do here, Marge? He's using violence."
57125,234,249,1150000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,Talk to him. Use your words.
57126,234,250,1152000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,"Homer, Homer, stop it! We've given up our violent ways. We just want to live peacefully, with your wife."
57127,234,251,1160000,Homer Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,"No! My wife is not a doobie, to be passed around. I took a sacred vow on my wedding day, to bogart her forever."
57128,234,252,1169000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,"Oh, Homie."
57130,234,253,1171000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,"There's only one reasonable way to settle this -- you and me, in the Circle of Death."
57131,234,254,1178000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,"Ohh, I just swept the Circle of Death!"
57132,234,255,1187000,Bikers,GANG'S CAMP,Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
57133,234,256,1198000,Homer Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,Uh-oh.
57134,234,257,1207000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,We both knew it would come to this.
57135,234,258,1209000,Homer Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,"You and me, chopper to chopper."
57136,234,259,1223000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,You know what I'm gonna do after I kill you?
57138,234,261,1225000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,Take your wallet.
57139,234,262,1227000,Homer Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,Never! It was a gift from Newsweek!
57140,234,263,1232000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,Homer!
57141,234,264,1241000,Homer Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,Give me back my wife!
57142,234,265,1244000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,"Okay, okay! You win."
57143,234,266,1249000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,I don't blame you for wanting her back so bad. A woman like that only comes along every couple of miles.
57145,234,268,1256000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,"Hey, can we at least keep her till the orgy in San Berdoo?"
57146,234,269,1259000,Homer Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,"Whaddaya say, honey?"
57147,234,270,1260000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,No!
57148,234,271,1262000,Homer Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,No dice!
57149,234,272,1265000,Marge Simpson,GANG'S CAMP,Goodbye everybody!
57150,234,273,1267000,Bikers,GANG'S CAMP,"Bye, Mrs. Simpson. / Bye, Mrs. Simpson. / Bye Mrs. Simpson / Bye bye Mrs. S."
57151,234,274,1271000,Meathook,GANG'S CAMP,We'll stop at the nearest town and mail our resumés.
57152,234,275,1271000,Ramrod,GANG'S CAMP,"""Resumés."" It still sounds weird to me."
57154,234,277,1288000,Marge Simpson,Road,Why are we stopping here?
57155,234,278,1290000,Homer Simpson,Road,Taking care of some unfinished business.
