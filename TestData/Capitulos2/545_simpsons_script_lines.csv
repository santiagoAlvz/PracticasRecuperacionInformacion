141727,545,2,12000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Guinea pig?
141734,545,8,32000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey Homer, did you know that guinea pigs are self-groomers?"
141735,545,9,35000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,And when they get excited they jump straight up -- it's called popcorning!
141736,545,10,37000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Lisa got to you. I don't know how, but she got to you."
141737,545,11,45000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Emojis. Now she's gone too far.
141739,545,13,50000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, your father and I are very concerned about all this hinting."
141740,545,14,56000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've never had a pet of my very own! My clock is ticking! I don't wanna be one of those girls who waits till she's sixteen to decide if she's ready, and then it's too late."
141741,545,15,65000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we've talked about it, and if you really want a guinea pig, you'll have to sign this contract."
141742,545,16,71000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""I, Lisa Simpson, hereby promise to take full responsibility for this dog, cat, other."
141743,545,17,71000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Circle ""other."""
141744,545,18,71000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""This includes feeding; bathing; cleaning of droppings and barfings; and, when the time comes, burying or flushing."""
141745,545,19,71000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boilerplate, boilerplate, boilerplate... we can skip all this litter box stuff... if pet becomes internet superstar, all rights revert to father... Sign here, here, initial here, one more over here, and... done."
141746,545,20,96000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my God -- I'm getting a guinea pig! Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!"
141747,545,21,100000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The kid-parent contract -- unenforceable, yet you feel like you didn't completely cave."
141750,545,24,118000,Carla,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"You're doing the right thing adopting a rescue pig. You know, most of these guys are rejects from the big guinea-pig mills in the Midwest. Oh, I can't tell you how many mill pigs we get here who have bumblefoot or the slobbers."
141751,545,25,131000,Homer Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"You don't have children, do you?"
141752,545,26,133000,Lisa Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,This one whistled at me!
141753,545,27,135000,Marge Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"Ooo, that could be the one."
141754,545,28,137000,Lisa Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"Oh, but that orange guy looks like a pumpkin! But this fella is so fuzzy!"
141755,545,29,143000,Marge Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"Well, they all have their charms..."
141758,545,30,147000,Lisa Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"This one's nibbling a sunflower seed! Look at that hair -- Oh, I just wanna comb it forever! Have you seen a pinker nose? I have now!"
141759,545,31,156000,Marge Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,Lisa! You've just gotta choose one. Lisa!?
141760,545,32,160000,Homer Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"She's gone, honey. She's gone."
141761,545,33,162000,Lisa Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"That one's fur looks like a tuxedo! A Band-Aid on its tail, awww! Albino!"
141762,545,34,171000,Lisa Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"I'm definitely getting this one. Oh, but I forgot about this one! Oh my God I never even saw this one!"
141763,545,35,179000,Lisa Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"Maybe I should get that sick one. If I don't, no one else will. Bart, list your top five, best to worst. No, no, no, no -- worst to best!"
141764,545,36,188000,Lisa Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,I just wish the grey one had the brown one's personality!
141765,545,37,191000,Lisa Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"Dad, give me your phone. I need to look at the pictures again!"
141766,545,38,199000,Lisa Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"Okay, this is the guinea pig that will make me happy."
141767,545,39,203000,Homer Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,She thinks she's decided. Don't say a thing. Don't blow this!
141768,545,40,208000,Carla,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,"Okay now, you sure you only want just one? They tend to do better in pairs."
141769,545,41,214000,Lisa Simpson,GUINEA PIG RESCUE,I could get two...?
141771,545,43,218000,Homer Simpson,Rural Road,Fighting Tweakers rule!
141773,545,45,221000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I've tried to give Pokey a perfect replica of his natural habitat:
141774,545,46,225000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Peruvian feather grass, an Incan sleeping mat, and a portrait of Marisol Espinoza, the Vice President of Peru."
141775,545,47,231000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you sure you didn't create a perfect habitat for you?
141776,545,48,234000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I wish I could live in there.
141777,545,49,236000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Well there's plenty of room... because Pokey's gone.
141778,545,50,239000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Where'd he go?
141779,545,51,248000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,This looks like a job for... fireplace tongs.
141780,545,52,255000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Nooooo!
141781,545,53,262000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my God, he's in the walls!"
141782,545,54,264000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I hear chewing!
141783,545,55,266000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, that's a much bigger animal."
141784,545,56,270000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Kettle corn... the heroin of the farmer's market.
141785,545,57,274000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I've lost my guinea pig!
141786,545,58,284000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Pokey!
141733,545,59,286000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Our boat painting!
141756,545,60,290000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, Mom."
141787,545,61,292000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's okay sweetheart. Your pig thingy didn't mean it. It's just... it felt comforting to know that while we watched TV, there was art going on behind us."
141788,545,62,304000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting."
141789,545,63,309000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sure we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money. Or...
141791,545,65,313000,Kirk Van Houten,VAN HOUTENS' YARD,Milhouse played the violin for years until it turned out the vibrations were screwing up his bones.
141792,545,66,322000,Homer Simpson,VAN HOUTENS' YARD,"Yeah, these seem great. Oh, too bad someone used cello rosin."
141793,545,67,334000,Marge Simpson,VAN HOUTENS' YARD,"Oh my gosh, that's beautiful! I've never seen a painting with a lighthouse before."
141794,545,68,340000,Luann Van Houten,VAN HOUTENS' YARD,"Oh that, that was on the wall of Kirk's bachelor pad, back when we were separated."
141795,545,69,347000,Kirk Van Houten,VAN HOUTENS' YARD,"Yeah, it's a great piece. I didn't have a mirror so I shaved in the reflection of the chrome frame."
141796,545,70,353000,Marge Simpson,VAN HOUTENS' YARD,This could be our new living room painting!
141797,545,71,355000,Homer Simpson,VAN HOUTENS' YARD,I don't know. How 'bout this poster of a really rockin' jukebox?
141798,545,72,360000,Homer Simpson,VAN HOUTENS' YARD,You know it's rockin' 'cause music notes are coming out of it.
141799,545,73,363000,Kirk Van Houten,VAN HOUTENS' YARD,Painting's only twenty bucks.
141800,545,74,365000,Marge Simpson,VAN HOUTENS' YARD,"Oh please, Homie..."
141801,545,75,367000,Kirk Van Houten,VAN HOUTENS' YARD,I'll throw in the tiny violins...
141803,545,77,375000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, it looks great!"
141804,545,78,379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, to me, it looks like... garbage salad, but that's the great thing about art: everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks."
141805,545,79,390000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I've got to get rid of this ugly chrome frame from Kirk's bachelor bad. I hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected.
141806,545,80,398000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, look... there's a signature that the frame covered up: ""Johan Oldenveldt."""
141807,545,81,403000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Here he is! ""Johan Oldenveldt, painter, lived in Amsterdam, Paris... prolific early 20th century naturalist... I think this was painted by someone famous. Maybe it's valuable."
141808,545,82,419000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We should have it appraised!
141809,545,83,422000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You guys are crazy. I've never even heard of that guy. It's not like it was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.
141810,545,84,429000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, ere's what makes art valuable: 1. Nudity. 2. Holograms. 3. Something terrible happening to Jesus."
141813,545,87,439000,Duncan,Springfield Art Auction House,"Ah yes, seascape... marvelous natural light... classic use of gouache... You're right. This is an early-career Oldenveldt. Quite valuable."
141814,545,88,451000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Art Auction House,Oh my God!
141815,545,89,453000,Duncan,Springfield Art Auction House,I expect it to go somewhere between eighty to one hundred thousand dollars.
141816,545,90,457000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Art Auction House,"Nobody touch it! Bart, stop looking at it!"
141817,545,91,460000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Art Auction House,But I want to see it!
141818,545,92,461000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Art Auction House,"No, you'll wear it out!"
141819,545,93,463000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Art Auction House,"Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right."
141820,545,94,466000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Art Auction House,"Wow, the Van Houtens owned this for years and never knew how much it was worth. Think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them."
141821,545,95,475000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Art Auction House,"Split it? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
141823,545,97,482000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
141825,545,99,487000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
141827,545,101,487000,Homer Simpson,KIDDIE PLAYGROUND,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
141830,545,104,490000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
141833,545,107,497000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... split it with them?"
141834,545,108,502000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Kirk and Luann didn't know what the painting was worth when they sold it.
141835,545,109,505000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, they sold it to us. So now it's our painting. We can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people, or... sell it for lots of money which we keep."
141836,545,110,518000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,For ourselves?
141837,545,111,520000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This dude gets it.
141839,545,113,523000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But the Van Houtens are our friends!
141841,545,114,526000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Are they, Marge? If you think about it, aren't they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid?"
141842,545,115,532000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,All our friends are like that!
141844,545,117,535000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Well how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable?
141845,545,118,539000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"I would feel: A). Happy for their good fortune, B). Proud to know rich people, and C). Grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake."
141847,545,120,548000,Marge Simpson,"""PAY & LEAVE"" SUPERMARKET",How about this... what if we give the Van Houtens twenty-five percent of the money?
141848,545,121,553000,Homer Simpson,"""PAY & LEAVE"" SUPERMARKET",Then they'll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that we're keeping!
141850,545,123,558000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, you like kindness, right?"
141851,545,124,561000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Sure.
141852,545,125,562000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So even if we gave Kirk and Luann some of money, the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them, like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti."
141853,545,126,573000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer looks into Marge's eyes.
141854,545,127,573000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's kinder never to tell them.
141855,545,128,576000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay... I see your point. We should sell the painting, keep all the money, and never, ever tell the Van Houtens."
141856,545,129,592000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What'll it take to buy your silence?
141858,545,131,595000,Homer Simpson,Toy Store,"Okay Milhouse, the guys in back are putting your new bike together."
141859,545,132,598000,Milhouse Van Houten,Toy Store,And all I have to do is not say anything about some painting to my Mom and Dad?
141860,545,133,603000,Marge Simpson,Toy Store,"Oh sweetie, you want your parents to be happy, don't you?"
141861,545,134,607000,Milhouse Van Houten,Toy Store,I guess.
141862,545,135,608000,Homer Simpson,Toy Store,"""I guess."" You're funny! No wonder Lisa's in love with you."
141863,545,136,614000,Milhouse Van Houten,Toy Store,She is?
141864,545,137,615000,Lisa Simpson,Toy Store,She is?
141865,545,138,617000,Milhouse Van Houten,Toy Store,"...so if I keep my mouth shut, you get me new wheelie sneakers, and Bart agrees to promote and encourage use of my new cool nickname, ""C.J.""..."
141866,545,139,617000,Bart Simpson,Toy Store,"You got it, Ceej."
141868,545,141,631000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"You found out that painting was worth big bucks, and you weren't gonna tell us?!"
141840,545,142,636000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know what you're talking about. Hide the treasure!
141757,545,143,640000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, Mr. S. I cracked!"
141869,545,144,643000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We had a deal. And now we've got nothing...
141870,545,145,651000,Luann Van Houten,Simpson Home,We considered you our friends... we trusted you... I let Homer use our master bathroom! Then you stab us in the back!
141871,545,146,660000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"If you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing, how could you live with yourselves? We were just trying to be... kind."
141872,545,147,668000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,Kind!? You call it kind to give us nothing?
141873,545,148,671000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"We were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why, but now forget it!"
141874,545,149,677000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Oh, so that's how it is!"
141875,545,150,678000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's exactly how it is.
141876,545,151,680000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,Oh is it?
141877,545,152,681000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh it is.
141878,545,153,683000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Luann, I hope we're still on Thursday for collecting used cellphones for the troops."
141879,545,154,689000,Luann Van Houten,Simpson Home,I don't think you need any help. You're so good at... collecting.
141881,545,156,696000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that was cold, Luann. So cold! BRRRRR! SARCASTIC BRRRRRR!"
141882,545,157,706000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,See what happens when we get greedy?
141883,545,158,709000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, there's something I wanna show you."
141884,545,159,711000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,An ATM receipt?
141885,545,160,713000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't know whose this is. I found it next to the cash machine, and I've always kept it. Look at the balance."
141886,545,161,718000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Five figures!
141887,545,162,720000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"With that painting we could have what these people have. A money cushion. No more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter."
141888,545,163,731000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I could write a check with... today's date on it.
141889,545,164,734000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's the cushion.
141891,545,166,751000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Oh, definitely betrayal, Kent."
141892,545,167,753000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,Interesting.
141893,545,168,755000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"So if you see the Simpsons walking down your street, lock your doors and hide... your friendship."
141894,545,169,760000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Great! Now we're raccoons -- the masked bandits of the animal world!
141895,545,170,764000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't worry. No one's gonna see this stupid show.
141896,545,171,772000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Give back the painting!"" The whole town's turned against us!"
141897,545,172,781000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""You have no obligation to share the money from that painting."" Ooo, a support rock!"
141898,545,173,783000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"This one's against us. This one's for us. For, for, against, for, against..."
141899,545,174,789000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We don't even get this many Christmas cards.
141901,545,176,796000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Street,"There they are, the Masterpiece Thievers!"
141902,545,177,799000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Street,"Ah, shut your bone hole! That painting belongs to the Simpsons!"

141907,545,182,812000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Just close your eyes and think of the cushion.

141932,545,206,910000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Thanks for taking me in, man..."
141933,545,207,912000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess I can't help but feel fully responsible.
141934,545,208,916000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,Oh Luann... I'll never gaze from my thick eyeglasses into your thick eyeglasses ever again.
141935,545,209,922000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What you need, my friend, is a Canadian Duff. Beauty, eh?"
141936,545,210,927000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, why does that chick think she owns the painting?"
141937,545,211,931000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,Dawn and I went on a vacation to a resort island called Isla Verde. I bought the painting in a café... but that night she ran off with a parasailing instructor.
141938,545,212,941000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not your fault, man. Those parasailing guys take whatever they want."
141939,545,213,946000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,It was never her painting. That woman will say anything to keep herself in electric cigarettes. And I'd go back to that Café Artiste to prove it... but nothing's gonna get me Luann back.
141941,545,215,962000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Okay, all I gotta do is take a quick ferry to Isla Verde, find Café Artiste, and they'll back up Kirk's story. That will prove the painting was his -- and now ours."
141942,545,216,972000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,"Oh, Homer Simpson, that painting has torn the town apart, destroyed Kirk and Luann's marriage, and everyone's very worried about Milhouse."
141943,545,217,982000,Bart Simpson,KITCHEN,"He's been playing Dancing Revolution for hours, but the TV is off."
141944,545,218,989000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,But our cushion...
141945,545,219,991000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,That picture has brought out the worst in everyone! Please... just let it go!
141946,545,220,1000000,Bart Simpson,KITCHEN,"You're not gonna let it go, are you?"
141947,545,221,1002000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,I wish I knew how.
141949,545,223,1006000,Lisa Simpson,Harbor,This is so exciting! My first time establishing provenance!
141950,545,224,1010000,Homer Simpson,Harbor,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just remember, if your mother asks, I took you to a wine tasting."
141951,545,225,1016000,Lisa Simpson,Harbor,That's a terrible thing for a father to do.
141952,545,226,1019000,Homer Simpson,Harbor,That's why she'll believe it.
141954,545,228,1022000,Lisa Simpson,ISLA VERDE,Hmm... this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy.
141928,545,229,1032000,Homer Simpson,ISLA VERDE,"Excuse me, we're trying to find ""Café Artiste."""
141956,545,230,1035000,Speedo Salesman,ISLA VERDE,"Ah, yes. Top of the hill. Three discos up, four gelatos on the left. You can't miss it, it's right between the disco and the gelato place."
141958,545,232,1048000,Sabine,CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO,"Welcome to Café Artiste! Would you like a glass of Strupo? It's a liqueur made of fermented capers, the official drink of the island."
141959,545,233,1056000,Homer Simpson,CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO,"Sounds delicious. It's not. Hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here."
141960,545,234,1063000,Sabine,CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO,"Oh, yes, I remember that painting. And that is the man I sold it to."
141961,545,235,1067000,Homer Simpson,CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO,And that man sold it to me!
141962,545,236,1070000,Homer Simpson,CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO,That proves the painting is mine! And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!
141963,545,237,1077000,Homer Simpson,CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO,I love art!
141964,545,238,1078000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO,Art? What do you know about art? You don't even know who painted that picture.
141965,545,239,1084000,Lisa Simpson,CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO,Yes we do. It's a Johan Oldenveldt.
141966,545,240,1087000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO,Wrong! It's a me!
141967,545,241,1089000,Lisa Simpson,CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO,What?
141968,545,242,1089000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO,"I painted it! Me, Klaus Ziegler!"
141969,545,243,1093000,Homer Simpson,CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO,Who?
141973,545,247,1098000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,This is where I painted your so-called Oldenveldt.
141974,545,248,1100000,Homer Simpson,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,Prove it.
141975,545,249,1104000,Homer Simpson,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,Oh... crap.
141976,545,250,1105000,Lisa Simpson,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,You're a... forger?
141977,545,251,1107000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,Forger is such a cruel word. I'm an art forger.
141978,545,252,1111000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,"Your painting was an early, clumsy effort which I gave to the café owner to pay off my Strupo tab."
141980,545,254,1121000,Homer Simpson,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,Then why did the auction house say it was real?
141981,545,255,1123000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,I have fooled galleries around the world with my loving imitations.
141982,545,256,1128000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler!
141983,545,257,1134000,Lisa Simpson,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,What you do is horrible: ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles.
141984,545,258,1140000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,Perhaps you are the one who is horrible.
141985,545,259,1142000,Lisa Simpson,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,What!?
141987,545,260,1142000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous.
141988,545,261,1147000,Lisa Simpson,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,"Well... no, but now when I look at it all I'll see is a fraud."
141989,545,262,1153000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,"Beauty is beauty. My ""forgeries"" give pleasure to people all over the world."
141990,545,263,1159000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,"The only real question to ask about art, whether it's in the Louvre or on a freshman's wall at Cal State Fullerton, is ""Did it move you?"""
141991,545,264,1159000,Lisa Simpson,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,"But, you still, I mean... I suppose you're right."
141992,545,265,1174000,Homer Simpson,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,"What if I never liked the painting, and only wanted it for money?"
141993,545,266,1177000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,"Then you, I respect."
141995,545,268,1180000,Homer Simpson,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,"Oh, great. The painting is worthless...this was all for nothing. And when Marge finds out she's gonna kill me."
141996,545,269,1186000,KLAUS ZIEGLER,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,"Well, on that front, perhaps I can be of assistance. If there's one thing art is good for, it's to melt the frost which often hardens a woman's heart."
141997,545,270,1196000,Homer Simpson,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,While you're at it... could you make me a couple more?
141998,545,271,1200000,Homer Simpson,ZEIGLER'S STUDIO,I'll pay you in Strupo...
142001,545,274,1214000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, perfect. Now that's art."
142002,545,275,1217000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Rockin'
142003,545,276,1239000,Narrator,Simpson Home,"The Gray Troll, Brine of Madness, Angel's Urine... All names for the mysterious elixir known as Strupo. Though this fermented caper solution was originally used to dissolve seagull corpses, local alcoholics soon found Strupo to be a palatable drink of last resort. The noxious liqueur causes powerful olfactory hallucinations, gender confusion, and wandering mouth. So if you visit Isla Verde, be sure to say ""ahoy"" to the crushing addiction of Strupo. Strupo: lose everything."
