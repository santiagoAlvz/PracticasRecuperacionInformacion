94256,363,211,1011000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Burns' Mansion?! That's Mr. Burns' mansion!
94259,363,214,1023000,C. Montgomery Burns,Car,"Remind me, Smithers: while we're out, I need to get my eyes re-balled and my brain flushed out with vinegar."
94260,363,215,1027000,Waylon Smithers,Car,"Yes, sir. Oh, and your knees will be back from the shop tomorrow."
94261,363,216,1031000,C. Montgomery Burns,Car,Excellent.
94263,363,218,1049000,Tammy,DRAINAGE TUNNEL,"Okay Marge, you're the only one of us skinny enough to squeeze in this vent."
94264,363,219,1054000,Marge Simpson,DRAINAGE TUNNEL,That's my special skill?
94265,363,220,1056000,Tammy,DRAINAGE TUNNEL,"Well what'd you think, you're a master of disguise? Not with that do."
94266,363,221,1060000,Marge Simpson,DRAINAGE TUNNEL,I thought you liked my hair.
94267,363,222,1061000,Tammy,DRAINAGE TUNNEL,It's all right.
94269,363,224,1069000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,I gotta stop Marge from doing something reckless and irresponsible.
94270,363,225,1079000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Street,"Lou, we'd better go after him. Eddie, you direct traffic. You're the graceful one."
94271,363,226,1083000,Eddie,Springfield Street,"You got it, Chief."
94272,363,227,1090000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Street,Look at him tease that Subaru. And that guy can't find a girlfriend. I'll never figure it out.
94273,363,229,1097000,Agnes Skinner,Burns's Basement,I got the combination from Burns after I let him feel me up during the Depression. Zero to the right... zero to the left... back to zero.
94274,363,230,1117000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Basement,"Marge, I wanted to save you from the cops, but the cops followed me! Game over, man! Game over! So, are you gonna introduce me to your friends?"
94276,363,232,1131000,Lou,Burns's Car,"Don't worry, Mr. Burns. We'll get to the bottom of this."
94277,363,233,1133000,Chief Wiggum,Burns's Car,"Excuse me, Lou. I'm supposed to say that. Acting like the chief doesn't make you the chief."
94278,363,234,1138000,Lou,Burns's Car,"If I was acting like the Chief, I'd need size fifty-eight pants."
94279,363,235,1142000,Chief Wiggum,Burns's Car,"Oh here we go with the fat jokes. You know I just wish you could hit the easy targets on the firing range so well. Oh Lou, why do we hurt each other so?"
94280,363,236,1153000,Lou,Burns's Car,"Because sometimes it's easier to be cruel than to say what you really feel. Permission to hug, Chief?"
94281,363,237,1159000,Chief Wiggum,Burns's Car,"Permission... granted. Granted, Lou."
94282,363,238,1164000,Lou,Burns's Car,"Thank you, Chief."
94283,363,239,1165000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Car,"Enough! While you morons are canoodling, someone's burgling my miscellania!"
94285,363,241,1174000,C. Montgomery Burns,LAWN,"Try to take my eggs will you? Well, this rooster has a beak! A beak which calls out death-a-doodle-doo!"
94286,363,242,1184000,C. Montgomery Burns,LAWN,Why... you're all women!
94287,363,243,1185000,Homer Simpson,LAWN,I'm not!
94288,363,244,1186000,C. Montgomery Burns,LAWN,"I suppose, but you're certainly buxom and flirty."
94289,363,245,1190000,Homer Simpson,LAWN,"Oh, well... I try to have a good time."
94290,363,246,1193000,Marge Simpson,LAWN,All I wanted to do was join a group of women who wore the same outfits.
94291,363,247,1206000,C. Montgomery Burns,LAWN,"Oh, no jury on earth will convict a bunch of moist-eyed mothers. I'll tell you what, ladies, give me my eggs back and I'll let you go."
94292,363,248,1218000,Homer Simpson,LAWN,And tell me I'm not fat.
94295,363,251,1222000,Tammy,Burns Manor,"Well, I guess our fundraiser was a failure."
94296,363,252,1226000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,Don't be so sure.
94297,363,253,1230000,Tammy,Burns Manor,"Oh Marge, I love you. But to be safe, sweetie, I don't think we can ever see each other again."
94298,363,254,1236000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,I'll really miss you guys. I'll never forget the three activities we did together.
94300,363,255,1244000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Listen, Marge. No matter where you go in this life, you'll always have one friend who loves you body and soul."
94301,363,256,1255000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"And Marge, there are certain things I can do for you that no other friend can. Special things."
94302,363,257,1268000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,"Wow, this is special."
94303,363,258,1271000,Moe Szyslak,Burns Manor,I can't believe this happened to me twice.
