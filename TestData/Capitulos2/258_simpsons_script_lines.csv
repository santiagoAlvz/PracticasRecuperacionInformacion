64222,258,1,85000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, get up! Up, up, up!"
64223,258,2,98000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh no!
64224,258,3,104000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Whuzzit... My juice box!
64225,258,4,107000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Homie, but you promised to take me to the Apron Expo today."
64226,258,5,112000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Just give me ten more hours.
64227,258,6,114000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon. You and the kids always wanna do fun stuff, but today we're doing something I like."
64229,258,8,121000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"They're unveiling a combination apron/smock. It's called a ""Smapron."""
64230,258,9,127000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Did you say ""Smockron""?"
64231,258,10,128000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, ""Smapron."""
64232,258,11,128000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh.
64233,258,12,131000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, it'll be fun."
64235,258,14,131000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Man, that was a good Apron Expo."
64236,258,15,138000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,I'm gonna wear my apron on the Fourth of July.
64237,258,16,141000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,And this lead apron will keep me safe downstairs.
64238,258,17,145000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Heh, heh. ""Grill Power."""
64239,258,18,145000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Car,I'm a little disappointed. There were too many aprons.
64240,258,19,150000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"It was great, all right. But all I wanna do right now is hit the adjustable sack with a good juice box. Because when all is said and done... Prison rodeo!?"
64242,258,21,152000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Prison,Today!
64244,258,23,163000,Warden,Prison Rodeo Arena,Welcome to Waterville State Penitentiary.
64246,258,25,166000,Warden,Arena,"The contestants you'll see today are actual prisoners on a break from their telemarketing duties. Now, here comes our first outlaw!"
64247,258,26,177000,Convict,Arena,Yee-ha!
64249,258,28,181000,Warden,Arena,"Ooo, doggie! Well, don't feel too bad for him, folks. He's in here for erecting a Nativity scene on city property."
64250,258,29,190000,Marge Simpson,Arena,There's so much evil in the world.
64251,258,30,197000,Warden,Arena,Nexxxxt!
64252,258,31,197000,Warden,Arena,"No, Delbert. We're not slaughtering the animals."
64253,258,32,200000,Prisoner,Arena,"It's not like that, Warden."
64254,258,33,202000,Prisoner,Arena,We was just havin' a conversation. Ain't that right?
64256,258,35,206000,Warden,Prison Rodeo Arena,Next up's a real lowlife.
64257,258,36,208000,Warden,Prison Rodeo Arena,Bob Dylan wrote a song to keep him in prison... Say hello to Jack Crowley.
64258,258,37,215000,Jack,Prison Rodeo Arena,Yee-ha!
64259,258,38,217000,Bart Simpson,Prison Rodeo Arena,"Go, bull! Toss his salad!"
64260,258,39,223000,Warden,Prison Rodeo Arena,"Oooh, he's down. And it looks like Ol' Tornado wants to caramelize his creme brulée."
64261,258,40,229000,Moe Szyslak,Prison Rodeo Arena,Yeah! Do that!
64262,258,41,231000,Marge Simpson,Prison Rodeo Arena,Somebody help him!
64263,258,42,232000,Homer Simpson,Prison Rodeo Arena,"Relax, they've got rodeo clowns."
64265,258,44,235000,Rodeo Clown #1,CLOWN DRESSING ROOM,Is my lipstick even?
64266,258,45,237000,Rodeo Clown #2,CLOWN DRESSING ROOM,Go like this.
64267,258,46,239000,Marge Simpson,CLOWN DRESSING ROOM,"Hey! Hey, over here! Here, bully, bully, bully, bully, bully!"
64268,258,47,243000,Homer Simpson,CLOWN DRESSING ROOM,"That's not gonna do it, Marge. You need something red."
64269,258,48,247000,Homer Simpson,CLOWN DRESSING ROOM,"Hey, Toro! Here's something to gore!"
64270,258,49,250000,Lisa Simpson,CLOWN DRESSING ROOM,Da-ad!
64271,258,50,251000,Homer Simpson,CLOWN DRESSING ROOM,"Not now, honey. Daddy's busy."
64272,258,51,257000,Homer Simpson,CLOWN DRESSING ROOM,"Now, for a little calming blue."
64273,258,52,259000,Homer Simpson,CLOWN DRESSING ROOM,"Hey, where's your blue shirt?"
64274,258,53,261000,Bart Simpson,CLOWN DRESSING ROOM,I don't have a blue shirt.
64275,258,54,274000,Warden,CLOWN DRESSING ROOM,Maybe it's the tear gas or maybe this was the best damned prison rodeo ever.
64277,258,56,287000,Marge Simpson,Prison Infirmary,"How's your back, Homie?"
64278,258,57,288000,Homer Simpson,Prison Infirmary,I can't complain.
64279,258,58,292000,Warden,Prison Infirmary,"Naw, that's for the prisoners. You can complain all you want."
64280,258,59,295000,Homer Simpson,Prison Infirmary,"Oh God, my back! It hurts so much, and my job is so unfulfilling!"
64281,258,60,302000,Marge Simpson,Prison Infirmary,"Try to focus on something else. Umm... You like Jimi Hendrix, right?"
64282,258,61,307000,Homer Simpson,Prison Infirmary,Uh-huh.
64284,258,62,308000,Marge Simpson,Prison Infirmary,"Well, look at that painting."
64285,258,63,310000,Marge Simpson,Prison Infirmary,Wow. The artist really captured Jimi's passion and intensity.
64286,258,64,314000,Homer Simpson,Prison Infirmary,And his fondness for the guitar.
64287,258,65,316000,Jack,Prison Infirmary,"Thank you kindly, ma'am. They won't give us art supplies, so I had to paint it with pudding."
64288,258,66,321000,Marge Simpson,Prison Infirmary,A convict painted that?
64289,258,67,323000,Warden,Prison Infirmary,Yep.
64290,258,68,324000,Marge Simpson,Prison Infirmary,"Well, I studied art, and this guy's got a real gift."
64291,258,69,328000,Warden,Prison Infirmary,You kiddin'?
64292,258,70,330000,Warden,Prison Infirmary,"Look, he painted a unicorn in outer space. I'm askin' you, what's it breathin'?"
64293,258,71,335000,Homer Simpson,Prison Infirmary,Air?
64294,258,72,336000,Warden,Prison Infirmary,Ain't no air in space.
64295,258,73,338000,Homer Simpson,Prison Infirmary,There's an Air in Space Museum.
64297,258,75,340000,Homer Simpson,Prison Gate,"Oh God, my back..."
64298,258,76,343000,Marge Simpson,Prison Gate,Let's get outta this gosh-forsaken heck-hole.
64299,258,77,349000,Marge Simpson,Prison Gate,What a waste of talent.
64300,258,78,355000,Marge Simpson,Prison Gate,A sunset!
64302,258,80,374000,Lisa Simpson,PRISON WEIGHT YARD,"They are coming back for us, aren't they?"
64303,258,81,377000,Bart Simpson,PRISON WEIGHT YARD,I'unno.
64306,258,84,384000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"How's your back, Dad?"
64307,258,85,386000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, there's a dull ache, certainly. And overlaid on that is a club sandwich of pain. Only instead of bacon, there's agony. Marge, can I have a BLT?"
64308,258,86,396000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you looking at?
64309,258,87,400000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, nothing... How would you feel if I did some volunteer work at the prison?"
64310,258,88,405000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"First I'd feel like having a BLT, then proud of you."
64311,258,89,410000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie. I knew you'd support me."
64312,258,90,415000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,My back!
64314,258,92,422000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,Mrs. Marge Simpson. I'm here to teach an art class.
64315,258,93,427000,Guard #1,Springfield Prison,"Ooh, art class. La dee dah."
64316,258,94,433000,Guard #2,Springfield Prison,This is Ike Pross. He's going to solitary.
64317,258,95,436000,Guard #1,Springfield Prison,"Ooh, solitary. La dee dah."
64318,258,96,441000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Welcome to ""Freeing the Artist Within."" Not literally, of course."
64319,258,97,449000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Okay. Now, I wanted to paint fresh fruit, but the prison cafeteria would only give me sauerkraut."
64320,258,98,457000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,That's depressing.
64321,258,99,459000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,Let's let a little sunshine in.
64323,258,101,464000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,Question?
64324,258,102,466000,Convict,Springfield Prison,Can I smell your dress?
64325,258,103,469000,Jack,Springfield Prison,"Hey, you show some respect. This one here is not for smellin'."
64326,258,104,474000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Why, thank you, Jack."
64327,258,105,476000,Jack,Springfield Prison,"No problem. Now, let's paint."
64328,258,106,479000,Convict,Springfield Prison,"Hey, can I smell your clothes?"
64330,258,108,483000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Your spine is more twisted than Sinbad's take on marriage.
64331,258,109,487000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,So? Just gimme some drugs and surgery.
64332,258,110,490000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Oh, I'd love to. But, ah, to be honest, modern medicine has a lousy record of treating the back. We spend too much time on the front."
64333,258,111,499000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Yeah, there's some neat stuff on the front."
64334,258,112,501000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,I'm gonna send you to my chiropractor.
64335,258,113,503000,Homer Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Hey, I thought real doctors hated chiropractors."
64336,258,114,507000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Well, that is our official stance. But between you, me and my golf clubs, they're miracle workers."
64337,258,115,515000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"That's charming, Sardonicus, but try to use less of a stabbing action and more of a brushing stroke."
64338,258,116,523000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Yeah, see how much better that feels?"
64339,258,117,526000,Sardonicus,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Yes. Much better.
64340,258,118,529000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Oh Jack, that's so soulful. How did someone so sensitive end up here?"
64341,258,119,536000,Jack,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Well, if you really gotta know, I shot a guy named Apu."
64342,258,120,541000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Oh. Well, you know, lots of people shoot Apu. It's just a hundred-dollar fine now."
64343,258,121,549000,Jack,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Maybe I belong in here. I got a lotta anger.
64344,258,122,552000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"I don't see any anger. I see a yearning for freedom... Um, do you have a title?"
64345,258,123,560000,Jack,Dr. Hibbert's Office,A Time to Kill.
64346,258,124,560000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,Titles are hard.
64348,258,126,566000,Dr. Steve,CHIROPRACTOR'S EXAMINING ROOM,"Hello, Homer. I'm Doctor Steve. Please lie down."
64117,258,127,576000,Dr. Steve,CHIROPRACTOR'S EXAMINING ROOM,"Wake up, Homer."
64349,258,128,577000,Homer Simpson,CHIROPRACTOR'S EXAMINING ROOM,"Less yakkin', more crackin'."
64350,258,129,579000,Dr. Steve,CHIROPRACTOR'S EXAMINING ROOM,"Now Homer, we don't actually ""crack"" backs. It's merely an adjustment. Okay, you're gonna hear a loud cracking sound."
64351,258,130,587000,Dr. Steve,CHIROPRACTOR'S EXAMINING ROOM,There we go.
64352,258,131,588000,Homer Simpson,CHIROPRACTOR'S EXAMINING ROOM,"Hey, it feels a little better."
64353,258,132,591000,Dr. Steve,CHIROPRACTOR'S EXAMINING ROOM,"Mm-hmm, I thought it might. Now, I'll need to see you three times a week for... many years."
64355,258,134,600000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"So, how was it in the slammer?"
64356,258,135,602000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Terrific. Bart, Sideshow Bob says he'll be seeing you real soon."
64357,258,136,607000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,That Bob.
64358,258,137,609000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh, and guess who's up for parole? My diamond-in-the-rough."
64359,258,138,613000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,That scary guy?
64360,258,139,615000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Scary talented. And I'm gonna make sure the parole board knows it.
64361,258,140,619000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,You gonna bribe 'em?
64362,258,141,620000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I might grease the wheels of justice with some cookies.
64363,258,142,624000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Oh, can I have some?"
64364,258,143,626000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Not till you finish your sundae.
64366,258,145,631000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Is that enough?
64367,258,146,632000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Two more bites.
64369,258,148,637000,Jack,Springfield Prison,"I'm sure your macaroons are scrumptious, Marge. But I've seen this warden turn down brownies. Honest to goodness brownies."
64370,258,149,643000,Warden,Springfield Prison,Next.
64371,258,150,647000,Warden,Springfield Prison,"Oh, it's you. Well, just let me ink up my old ""denied"" stamp."
64372,258,151,652000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Warden, please. This man is a gentle soul. I know he's made mistakes, but someone with his talent belongs on a boardwalk doing caricatures. Not behind bars."
64373,258,152,664000,Warden,Springfield Prison,"Lady, I know he charmed you with some ""pleases"" and ""thank yous"", but he wasn't so polite to the guy he shot."
64374,258,153,670000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Springfield Prison,"Actually, he was. He waited with me till the ambulance came, then ran like a deer."
64375,258,154,675000,Warden,Springfield Prison,"Well, that's mighty nice. But, if I let this creep out, would you like him skulking around your neighborhood?"
64376,258,155,681000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Honestly, it wouldn't bother me."
64378,258,156,685000,Warden,Springfield Prison,"Well lady, I'm gonna call your bluff. The prisoner is hereby paroled into your custody."
64379,258,157,692000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Prison,"Oh, my Goodness!"
64380,258,158,693000,Jack,Springfield Prison,"I'm free? Oh, Mrs. Simpson..."
64382,258,160,697000,Jack,Springfield Prison,"Oh. Geez, I'm sorry. Sorry."
64383,258,161,702000,Jack,Springfield Prison,You won't regret this.
64385,258,163,707000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I hope this is okay. It's not very prison-y.
64386,258,164,710000,Jack,Simpson Home,"It's more than I deserve, ma'am. Now, which way is Mecca, 'cause I gotta do a little prayin'."
64387,258,165,715000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, Mecca? Well, let's..."
64388,258,166,719000,Jack,Simpson Home,I'm just yankin' your chain. I'm Jewish.
64389,258,167,727000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ow! Owww, my back. Dr. Steve didn't do anything."
64390,258,168,732000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Did you do those exercises he gave you?
64391,258,169,733000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, right. I did 'em while you were studying."
64393,258,171,740000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad!
64394,258,172,740000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you okay?
64395,258,173,742000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah... In fact...
64396,258,174,744000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I feel fantastic!
64397,258,175,748000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That trash can must have unkinked your back.
64398,258,176,750000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not ""trash can,"" son. Dr. Homer's Miracle Spine-O-Cylinder! Patent pending."
64399,258,177,756000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, okay."
64400,258,178,758000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And as you can see, the unique dents in my invention perfectly match the contours of the human vertebrains."
64401,258,179,765000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Patent pending... Patent pending... Patent pending... Hey, who's this guy?"
64402,258,180,769000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You remember Jack... He's that talented painter who had a little brush with the law.
64403,258,181,776000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You brought a convict to live here, near my unpatented idea?"
64404,258,182,780000,Jack,Simpson Home,I seen your idea and I don't want it. All I need is three squares and a job.
64405,258,183,784000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's right, a job."
64406,258,184,790000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I know just where you can get one.
64408,258,186,792000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Garage,"So, Homer, you think you can fix my sciatica?"
64409,258,187,796000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Hmm. I don't know what that is, so I'm gonna say yes. Now, go limp."
64410,258,188,800000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Garage,I'm limp.
64377,258,189,801000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"One, two, better-not-sue..."
64411,258,190,805000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Garage,"Hey, it worked! My searing leg pain is now a gentle numbness."
64412,258,191,810000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Next!
64413,258,192,811000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Garage,"Yes, uh, my car seems to have broken down and I was wondering if I could use your..."
64414,258,193,816000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Garage,That's a forcing motion...
64415,258,194,818000,Dr. Steve,Simpson Garage,"Simpson, you're not a licensed chiropractor. And you're stealing patients from me and Dr. Steffi!"
64416,258,195,823000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Boy, talk about irony. The AMA tries to drive you guys out of business. Now you're doing the same to me. Think about the irony..."
64417,258,196,834000,Dr. Steve,Simpson Garage,You've been warned. Stop chiropracting.
64418,258,197,837000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Not unless you think about the irony.
64420,258,199,841000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I read in the Daily Fourth Gradian that you need someone to paint a mural.
64421,258,200,844000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, school spirit is down 3.4 percent!"
64422,258,201,847000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, Jack here will do great work for you."
64423,258,202,850000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, any references?"
64424,258,203,851000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"Well... to be honest with ya, I've spent the last six years in Waterville State..."
64425,258,204,855000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,It's a small liberal arts college. Very law-abiding. No convicts at all.
64426,258,205,860000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, the only other one to apply was Moe Syszlak, and his stuff scares the hell out of me."
64427,258,206,864000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"How could anyone consider that making love? All right, Jack, you're hired. I'll clear you out a cubby."
64428,258,207,873000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,You told a lie for me.
64429,258,208,874000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I know... But the Lord will forgive me if it helps you get a second chance.
64430,258,209,879000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"Actually, Marge, it's the third if you count that farm couple."
64431,258,210,883000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Farm couple?!
64432,258,211,884000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"But I got a good feelin' about this one, Marge. I really do."
64434,258,213,893000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"That is awesome. Finally, art that doesn't suck!"
64435,258,214,897000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Dear Lord! What are you doing?
64436,258,215,899000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,You don't like it?
64437,258,216,900000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"No, no, it's all wrong. The shapely female form has no place in art."
64438,258,217,905000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"But, uh, what I thought is..."
64439,258,218,906000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I sketched out exactly what I wanted.
64440,258,219,909000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, I know. But see what I was going for here..."
64441,258,220,910000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Did you even look at the napkin?
64442,258,221,913000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, I was in the zone that day."
64443,258,222,917000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, ya see, I didn't wanna go so cutesy wootsy..."
64444,258,223,920000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Because...?
64445,258,224,921000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,Because it's not my style.
64446,258,225,923000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, if you want to keep this job, you'll make it your style."
64447,258,226,927000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"All right. You're the bossman, ain't ya."
64448,258,227,930000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Darn right, I'm the boss. Don't forget, I can send you back where you came from... college boy."
64450,258,229,942000,Jack,Simpson Home,That punk Skinner. I had more freedom back at the joint.
64451,258,230,948000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Jack. I know you hate to betray your artistic vision, but just do it."
64452,258,231,953000,Jack,Simpson Home,I guess I could bend a little.
64453,258,232,955000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just till you make it. Remember, I believe in you."
64454,258,233,962000,Jack,Simpson Home,"Thanks, Marge. Listen, if you're done with that washing machine, can I make some booze in it?"
64455,258,234,967000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Not until you finish your sundae.
64456,258,235,969000,Jack,Simpson Home,"Yes, ma'am."
64458,258,237,973000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's wrong with my sundaes?
64459,258,238,976000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Careful, I'm frail."
64460,258,239,981000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, that should do it, Moe."
64461,258,240,983000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Hey, it don't hurt no more. Heh. Now I can focus on my crippling emotional pain. Oh, Daddy, Daddy, why? Why won't you hug me? You hug the mailman."
64462,258,241,992000,Man #1,Simpson Home,"Excuse me, sir."
64463,258,242,994000,Man #1,Simpson Home,Is this El Clínico Magnífico?
64464,258,243,996000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ah, you saw our bus ad."
64465,258,244,998000,Man #2,Simpson Home,"We'd, uh, like to invest in your spinal adjustment device."
64466,258,245,1001000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We might be able to do business.
64468,258,247,1005000,Man #1,Simpson Home,We'll need to take some photographs.
64469,258,248,1007000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, where're you going with that?"
64471,258,249,1013000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait a minute, no investor could bend like that."
64472,258,250,1016000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,They're chiropractors!
64474,258,252,1019000,Dr. Steve,Street In Front Of Homer's House,"C'mon, c'mon, let's go!"
64475,258,253,1022000,Homer Simpson,Street In Front Of Homer's House,Nooo! My Spine-O-Cylinder!
64476,258,254,1026000,Homer Simpson,Street In Front Of Homer's House,They'll pay for what they did to my can.
64477,258,255,1031000,Moe Szyslak,Street In Front Of Homer's House,"Forget it, Homer. It's Chiro-town."
64479,258,257,1037000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"You know, when Superintendent Chalmers suggested a school mural, I almost thought he said a school Muriel. Muriel's his sister. And uh... Thank you, Bruce Vilanch."
64480,258,258,1053000,Bruce Vilanch,Springfield Elementary School,Whoopi would have made it work.
64481,258,259,1055000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"And now, I present ""Puma Pride"" by a college-educated artist..."
64483,258,261,1061000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Jack Crowley.
64484,258,262,1066000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Man, is that wimpy!"
64485,258,263,1068000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,What happened to the cool one?
64486,258,264,1070000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, my original idea was..."
64487,258,265,1071000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Jeepers, that's sugary, even for my taste."
64488,258,266,1074000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, but Skinner said I had to..."
64489,258,267,1076000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Skinner! How are we going to raise school spirit with this sappy hokum?
64490,258,268,1082000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I know, sir. It's an embarrassment."
64491,258,269,1084000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,This isn't what I wanted! Where's the edge?
64492,258,270,1087000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,I followed your napkin...
64493,258,271,1089000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,No napkin could wipe the crumbs of failure from your mouth.
64494,258,272,1094000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, don't fight. All great art is controversial at first. But years from now, people will point to these cuddly little creatures, and say, ""That's a Jack Crowley."""
64495,258,273,1096000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, ah, pizza's working well on Thursday, but I think the kids will follow it to Tuesday."
64496,258,274,1115000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"That's what you said about the stuffed peppers, and ye lost the young males."
64497,258,275,1119000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Principal Skinner! The school's on fire!
64499,258,277,1123000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,Spread! Spread! Spread! Spread! Spread! Spread!
64500,258,278,1125000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,It's crystal clear who did this: Jack Crowley.
64501,258,279,1129000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Now wait, you don't know that Jack did this. Just because he's an ex-con..."
64502,258,280,1134000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Crowley's an ex-con?! Dear Lord, I've peed in front of him!"
64503,258,281,1139000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, check it out!"
64505,258,283,1144000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Ha! Now that's a mural!
64506,258,284,1145000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,It's so passionate. It almost leaps off the wall.
64508,258,286,1152000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,That felon could have torched the whole school... were it not stuffed with asbestos.
64509,258,287,1156000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"We'll catch Crowley. And then he'll learn the ""fine art"" of police brutality."
64510,258,288,1166000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"Psst. Marge, over here."
64511,258,289,1171000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, Jack... You threw it all away, over a stupid feud with Skinner."
64512,258,290,1177000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"Look, I'll admit I hate Skinner. But I didn't start that fire."
64513,258,291,1181000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Then why are you hiding?
64514,258,292,1182000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"C'mon, Marge. With my rap sheet, they can't wait to send me back to prison. And you can't believe the foul language in that place."
64515,258,293,1189000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,So you really didn't do it?
64516,258,294,1192000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"Marge, look in my eyes. I swear to you, I did not do it."
64517,258,295,1197000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I believe you, Jack. Now let's get you out of here... Wait for my signal."
64518,258,296,1206000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, Chief! I found some evidence that points to the real arsonist."
64519,258,297,1211000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, let's see it."
64520,258,298,1212000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Not yet. You have to guess what it is.
64521,258,299,1215000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,We don't have time for guessing games.
64522,258,300,1217000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Nah, let's try it. It might be fun. Is it DNA?"
64524,258,302,1222000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"So, it's like DNA... Umm... A hatchet?"
64525,258,303,1224000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,You had a turn. I want to guess.
64526,258,304,1227000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, geez..."
64527,258,305,1229000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,My car!
64528,258,306,1234000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"Puma pride! Puma pride! Catch the fever, Skinner!"
64530,258,307,1247000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You crumb-bum. You looked me right in the eye and lied to me.
64531,258,308,1252000,Jack,Springfield Elementary School,"Marge, this is the God's truth. I burned the mural, but I did not burn Skinner's car."
64532,258,309,1258000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I just saw you! Get him outta here, Chief!"
64533,258,310,1262000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Yes ma'am.
64535,258,312,1264000,Chief Wiggum,Police Car,"My wife and I like watching that ""Oz"" show on HBO. Uh, is prison really like that?"
64536,258,313,1270000,Jack,Police Car,"Wouldn't know, we only get basic cable."
64537,258,314,1273000,Chief Wiggum,Police Car,"Ouch! I also like that ""Sex and the City."" None of those girls look like my wife."
64538,258,315,1280000,Jack,Police Car,Sportscenter's not bad.
64539,258,316,1282000,Chief Wiggum,Police Car,"Eh, I never got that show."
64540,258,317,1283000,Jack,Police Car,What's to get? They just tell the scores.
64541,258,318,1286000,Chief Wiggum,Police Car,"Yeah, I s'pose. Hey, you ever meet any mob guys? Are they really like ""The Sopranos""?"
64542,258,319,1291000,Jack,Police Car,"I told you, we just get basic cable."
64543,258,320,1294000,Chief Wiggum,Police Car,"Oh, right, right, right."
64544,258,321,1295000,Chief Wiggum,Police Car,"Listen, if I'm gettin' too chatty, just uh, just tell me to shut up."
64545,258,322,1299000,Jack,Police Car,"Nah, I'm enjoying it. Hey, you ever watch that strong man contest? They're pretty good. Those guys look strong. All the guys in prison say they're gay. But I don't know. They look strong to me."
