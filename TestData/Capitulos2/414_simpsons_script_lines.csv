107427,414,5,55000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Jeez Louise. Are you okay?
107428,414,6,58000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Just gimme a minute. But feel free to go nuts on me.

107433,414,11,85000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But I have all those old diets I still haven't finished.
107434,414,12,88000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Your lack of bedroom pizzazz last night started me worrying. So I hired this nutritionist, Betsy Bidwell."
107435,414,13,94000,Betsy,Simpson Home,"Homer, did you know I used to weigh four hundred pounds?"
107436,414,14,97000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll bet no man would touch you.
107437,414,15,100000,Betsy,Simpson Home,"Well, I went from fat to ""all that"" using my simple, foolproof diet. It's all about little substitutions. Instead of French toast for breakfast, why not eat a bell pepper? When you crave something sugary, eat a bell pepper. Want a beer? Bell pepper!"
107438,414,16,117000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's tangy like a pepper, but crunchy like a bell!"
106182,414,17,120000,Betsy,Simpson Home,Bell pepper!
107408,414,19,122000,HOTDOG VENDOR,BLEACHERS,Hot dogs! Getcher hot dogs!

107446,414,28,167000,Betsy,Simpson Home,You've gained seven pounds!
107447,414,29,170000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, they say muscle weighs more than fat."
107448,414,30,172000,Betsy,Simpson Home,"Homer, your body is all fat."
107449,414,31,174000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie... have you been cheating on your diet?!
107450,414,32,177000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What?! I'm not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.
107451,414,33,192000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whatcha doin', Mom? Goin' crazy?"
107452,414,34,194000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Searching for evidence. I know your father's cheating on his diet.
107453,414,35,198000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Marge, looking for something? I'm looking for something too -- a bell pepper I don't like. Maybe it'll be this one."
107454,414,36,208000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wrong again.
107456,414,38,213000,Bart Simpson,TELEVISION ROOM,See that fat lady with the moustache? That's you.
107457,414,39,216000,Lisa Simpson,TELEVISION ROOM,See that hippo rolling in dung? You're the dung.
107458,414,40,219000,Marge Simpson,TELEVISION ROOM,"Now that's enough, you each got one in."
107459,414,41,221000,Bart Simpson,TELEVISION ROOM,"Aw, But hers was better!"
107460,414,42,226000,Announcer,TELEVISION ROOM,"Meet Jennifer. She's worried her acupuncturist boyfriend is ""sticking it"" to someone else."
107461,414,43,232000,Sad-looking Woman,TELEVISION ROOM,"He used to be so loving. Now he says he's always working late. But when he comes home, his needles aren't even bloody! I've tried everything except talking to him. Help me, TV show!"
107462,414,44,244000,Announcer,TELEVISION ROOM,"We'll find out if Jennifer's boyfriend has been fooling around, on ""SNEAKERS."""
107463,414,45,249000,Zack,TELEVISION ROOM,"If you suspect a loved one of cheating on you, call the Sneakers Hotline. Also call if you don't suspect. Most cheating happens when you think everything is just great."
148665,414,46,257000,Marge's Thoughts,TELEVISION ROOM,Hm... could this show help me with eating cheating?
107464,414,47,261000,Marge Simpson,TELEVISION ROOM,"Out of the house, kids! I have to make an adult phone call."
107466,414,49,265000,Bart Simpson,TELEVISION ROOM,"Oh man, not again."
107467,414,50,267000,Marge Simpson,TELEVISION ROOM,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
107469,414,52,272000,Bart Simpson,Forest,"Hey, I didn't know this park was here."
107470,414,53,275000,Lisa Simpson,Forest,You wrote a report on it last week!
107471,414,54,277000,Bart Simpson,Forest,The internet wrote it -- I just handed it in.
107472,414,55,281000,Bart Simpson,Forest,"Whoa, check that out!"
107473,414,56,281000,Bart Simpson,Forest,"Cool, the strong kicking the weak's butt."
107474,414,57,286000,Lisa Simpson,Forest,It's disgusting!
107475,414,58,290000,Lisa Simpson,Forest,Now you two play nice!
107477,414,60,298000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This is my husband...
107478,414,61,300000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I think he's been Sneakering on his diet.
107479,414,62,303000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I didn't use to mind it when he'd lock the bathroom door and snack off, but when he's getting it regular, night after night after night..."
107480,414,63,313000,Zack,Simpson Home,"There, there."
107481,414,64,314000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm sorry I'm so emotional.
107482,414,65,317000,Zack,Simpson Home,"No, I mean cry to the camera over there. There."

107488,414,71,330000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,"Dude, it's Saturday, what kind of a freak wastes his--"
107489,414,72,332000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,May I join you?
107490,414,73,333000,Martin Prince,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,"Care to make it a trio, Bart? You can brush and I can blow!"

107492,414,75,339000,Martin Prince,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,Then it's a plan.
107493,414,76,340000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,"A lot of people blow, but no one blows like you."
107494,414,77,343000,Martin Prince,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,High praise indeed!
107495,414,78,345000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,When you look up blow in the dictionary--

107502,414,85,373000,Martin Prince,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,A bone?! It could be one of the major homo's!
107503,414,86,378000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,You're one of the major...
107504,414,87,379000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,Forget it.
107506,414,90,393000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,Martin!

107511,414,95,415000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,You're right.
107512,414,96,416000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,I can bike away much faster -- and ring the bell to drown out bad thoughts!
107513,414,97,421000,Lisa Simpson,SPRINGFIELD NATIONAL FOREST- DAY,But Bart...
107515,414,99,431000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, Martin could be seriously hurt, or worse."
107516,414,100,433000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're right. We have to do something. Let's watch TV!

107520,414,104,452000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"According to this pocket protector, the victim's name is Martin Prince."
107521,414,105,456000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Sadly, his pocket was protected, but nothing else. And we know exactly who is to blame..."
107523,414,107,464000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,No one. The boy clearly fell by accident.
107525,414,109,467000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"He crashed through the tree canopy there...and was presumably eaten by this cougar, who is still choking up parts of the boy's clothes."
107526,414,110,477000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Tragic, just tragic. Do you think this would fit little Ralphy?"
107527,414,111,480000,Lou,Simpson Home,"Chief, that's evidence."
107528,414,112,482000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"I know, but after it's evidence, it's a shirt again. Isn't it?"
107529,414,113,485000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"So Chief, what's your final word on the Prince boy?"
107530,414,114,488000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Dead. Definitely dead.
107531,414,115,490000,Lou,Simpson Home,"Uh, Chief, aren't we supposed to uh, notify the family first?"
107532,414,116,493000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,What do you think I'm doing right now?
107533,414,117,495000,Happy Little Elves,Simpson Home,HAPPY HAPPY SAFE AT HOME...

107542,414,125,522000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've been in trouble, but never like this. Guess I'll go turn myself in."
107543,414,126,532000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh... let's think about this. Martin's gone, but it was an accident. Ruining our lives won't bring him back."
107544,414,127,539000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa! You're saying we shouldn't tell the truth?
107545,414,128,543000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm saying this is worse than a million A-minuses!
107546,414,129,545000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, how was your outside time?"
107547,414,130,547000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We-were-never-outside-we-were-here-all-day.
107548,414,131,549000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That quick talking is never a good sign.
107549,414,132,551000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's-usually-true-but-in-this-case-it's-not.
148666,414,133,554000,Marge's Thoughts,Simpson Home,"Hm, the kids are acting awfully strange. Maybe I should sit down with them and-- Homer, where are you going?!"
107550,414,134,561000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Work.
107551,414,135,563000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's four o'clock on a Saturday.
107552,414,136,565000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I, uh, I have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant. Conservation of mass -- it's the law."
107553,414,137,576000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The load is on the road.
107556,414,140,583000,Zack,Black Van,"This episode's gonna be great. It'll finally win me the respect of my father, the Reverend Billy Graham, Junior."
107558,414,142,605000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Martin Prince was known by many names: Martin Priss, Martin Princess, Fartin' Prince, Martin the Brown-Nosed Reindeer..."
107559,414,143,613000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,That was mine.
107560,414,144,614000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Martin was a shy, awkward child who will never fulfill his promise to become a weird, unloved adult. The Audio-Visual Club has prepared a video tribute to their fallen associate."
107561,414,145,651000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Jimbo, stop that!"
107562,414,146,654000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Usually when I do something bad, I feel good. But not this time. Martin was like Jesus -- only real!"

107536,414,148,666000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'm filled with rue!
107564,414,149,667000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Don't you weasel out on me!
107565,414,150,667000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Y'know, something bugs me. Martin was afraid of heights. What's he doin' on a cliff? It don't add up."

107582,414,167,763000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"What do you mean ""what's up""? Why would something be up?"
107583,414,168,765000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, nothing's up and nothing's down -- except for Martin, who died."
107584,414,169,768000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Idiot!
107587,414,172,772000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Well... I certainly wasn't eating chips and salsa from this briefcase.
107588,414,173,777000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's up?

107605,414,190,856000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,But we're brother and sister.
107606,414,191,857000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Exactly.
107607,414,192,859000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Give me an Indian burn!

107613,414,198,864000,Nelson Muntz,Kwik-E-Mart,"Doing a little shopping, huh? Shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart. I like how ""Kwik"" is spelled with a ""k"". It's a quicker way of spelling ""quick"". Well, you're busy people, I'll let you get on with your day."
107614,414,199,879000,Nelson Muntz,Kwik-E-Mart,"Oh, there is one other thing. I was up in Springfield National Park, you know, where Martin bit the big one? Found this bone tied to a string."
107615,414,200,890000,Nelson Muntz,Kwik-E-Mart,Almost like someone was playing a prank on him.
107616,414,201,893000,Nelson Muntz,Kwik-E-Mart,"You like pranks, don't you, dingus?"
107617,414,202,896000,Bart Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,I like pranks. Everyone likes pranks. Even Dr. Hibbert.

107621,414,206,910000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, I have a plan: we go to the morgue and come back with a hand. Put its fingerprints all over the railing..."
107622,414,207,917000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why are you being so quiet, Bart? Are you judging me? Please don't judge me."
107623,414,208,925000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't live with the guilt. I'm going to Martin's house... to end it all!
107624,414,209,934000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, pick up, pick up! I know you're there."

107631,414,216,964000,Bart Simpson,PRINCE HOUSE,I'm tending to Martin's butterfly enclosure. His butterflies are emerging from their chrysalises tonight.
107632,414,217,969000,Bart Simpson,PRINCE HOUSE,You said you wanted to end it all.
107634,414,218,971000,Bart Simpson,PRINCE HOUSE,By which I meant bring Martin's butterfly project to completion.
