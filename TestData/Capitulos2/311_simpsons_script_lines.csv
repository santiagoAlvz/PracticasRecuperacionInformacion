79935,311,224,891000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've heard that from co-workers, strangers on the street, even my own children... but I never thought I'd hear it from you."
79936,311,225,900000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe we should see a counselor.
79937,311,226,902000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Who's ""we""? Got a mouse in your purse?"
79940,311,229,909000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Waiting Room,"Manjula, I'm so glad you have finally forgiven me for having an affair."

79942,311,231,918000,Counselor,Waiting Room,"Next, please."
79944,311,233,921000,Marge Simpson,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,I've been married to my husband for ten years and part of me wants to kill him.
79946,311,234,926000,Marriage Counselor,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,Perhaps you feel that your husband sees you as less of a partner and more of a doormat.
79947,311,235,930000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,Nothing could be farther from the...
79948,311,236,934000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"You could be on to something there, Doc..."
79949,311,237,941000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"Sorry, I got a lot on my mind."
79950,311,238,943000,Marriage Counselor,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"That's okay, take your time."
79951,311,239,947000,Marriage Counselor,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"All right, before you came in, I asked you each to make a list of the people that are most important to you. Homer, you first."
79952,311,240,954000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"There's Homer... Homer J. Simpson... and Commander Cool, a/k/a me."
79953,311,241,960000,Marge Simpson,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"That's us in a nutshell. I care so much about you, Homer, but I'm not even on your list. Excuse me."

79955,311,243,982000,Marriage Counselor,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,All right. I have an answer. You must perform for her one completely unselfish gesture.
79956,311,244,988000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,You mean... like give her full custody of the kids?
79957,311,245,991000,Marriage Counselor,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"Yeah, full custody, that's exactly what I... you're an idiot."
79958,311,246,996000,Marriage Counselor,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,You gotta knock her off her feet with something utterly romantic... something that says I care about you.
79959,311,247,1000000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,I see. Do you have any suggestions?
79960,311,248,1005000,Marriage Counselor,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"I do, but the hour is over."
79961,311,249,1007000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,Here's a dollar.
79962,311,250,1008000,Marriage Counselor,COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,Romantic dinner.
