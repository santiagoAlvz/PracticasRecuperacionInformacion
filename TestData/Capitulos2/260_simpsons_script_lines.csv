64833,260,3,96000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Cool!
64835,260,5,112000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Stop that! And get ready! We're going to the old folks' talent show. Now get washed up.
64836,260,6,120000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,With pleasure.
64839,260,9,128000,Old Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,Ever notice after dialysis you always get THE MUN-CHIES...
64840,260,10,135000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,He's saying the stuff we all forgot.
64841,260,11,137000,Old Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,And you know what I can't open...? Cabinets.
64842,260,12,142000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Can he say that?
64843,260,13,144000,Old Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,You know what else scares me? Everything!
64844,260,14,155000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Get that one! Faster! You got half time for the other ones. Oh, good. Oh no, that one's slowing up! Oh, good. Oh, that one's wobbling! Oh, up... you got that before I even said it."
64845,260,15,167000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT?
64846,260,16,169000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,OW! OW! OW! OWWW! / WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT?
64847,260,17,173000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"OH, GOD, NOOOO!"
64848,260,18,176000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Wasn't he great, folks? Now, all the contestants are gonna receive extra servings of honey-mush."
64850,260,20,186000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,"But there can only be one winner. And, eh, since Abe's already standing here, what the heck?..."
64851,260,21,192000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Wow, a free auto!"
64852,260,22,194000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,"No, keep reading."
64853,260,23,196000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Oh.
64854,260,24,197000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Hey, let's get this down to the funeral home before they try to back out."
64856,260,26,204000,Salesman,MORTUARY,"Hmm. Well, this autopsy coupon appears to be valid. What other funerary services may we provide for the pre-deceased?"
64857,260,27,213000,Homer Simpson,MORTUARY,"Oh, the whole deal. Coffin. Tombstone. Anti-stink spray."
64858,260,28,217000,Salesman,MORTUARY,"Sir, we prefer the term ""casket"" to ""coffin."" And ""monument"" to ""tombstone."" We have all the leading brands of anti-stink spray."
64859,260,29,224000,Homer Simpson,MORTUARY,What funny names.
64861,260,31,230000,Bart Simpson,MORTUARY,He's heading into Dead Man's Curve!
64862,260,32,232000,Bart Simpson,MORTUARY,"Hey, get me outta here! Hey!"
64863,260,33,234000,Salesman,MORTUARY,"Oh, the living... Well, fortunately, this model features the CadavaCam."
64864,260,34,236000,Grampa Simpson,MORTUARY,"Heh, heh, heh. Look at 'im go."
64865,260,35,245000,Homer Simpson,MORTUARY,That thing got picture-in-picture?
64866,260,36,246000,Salesman,MORTUARY,"Of course! This is the ""Contempo."""
64867,260,37,246000,Homer Simpson,MORTUARY,"Ah, geez. How come they never call traveling anymore?"
64869,260,39,254000,Salesman,Cemetery,"This is the deluxe area. The caskets are buried in unused, virgin graves; the monuments are completely self-cleaning and there is an optional ""weeping widow"" service."
64870,260,40,265000,Weeping Widow,Cemetery,"Wally, Wally, Wally..."
64871,260,41,273000,Weeping Widow,Cemetery,"Irving, oh, Irving..."
64872,260,42,276000,Grampa Simpson,Cemetery,"Ooh, bury me over here. Pleeeease?"
64873,260,43,279000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,"Whoa, whoa, this is gettin' kind of pricey."
64874,260,44,281000,Salesman,Cemetery,"Sir, what lies beyond this life is a mystery. But we do know for sure that God prefers people who travel in style."
64875,260,45,288000,Grampa Simpson,Cemetery,"Hear that? If you cheapskate me into Hell, I'll haunt you good. Imagine this when you're sittin' on the john:"
64876,260,46,300000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,Okay!
64878,260,48,303000,Salesman,MORTUARY,"O-kay, with mole insurance, your total comes to... seventeen thousand dollars."
64879,260,49,309000,Homer Simpson,MORTUARY,What?!
64880,260,50,310000,Salesman,MORTUARY,"Or, you could just toss him in the woods and let the wolves carry him off. It's really up to you."
64881,260,51,316000,Homer Simpson,MORTUARY,Mr. Salesman?
64882,260,52,317000,Salesman,MORTUARY,Yesss?
64883,260,53,318000,Homer Simpson,MORTUARY,We're gonna go with the wolves.
64885,260,55,321000,Grampa Simpson,MORTUARY,Beat it!
64887,260,57,325000,Homer Simpson,MORTUARY,"Dad, I love you this much."
64888,260,58,325000,Homer Simpson,MORTUARY,"But that's just under nine hundred dollars. I wish I could go seventeen thousand, but..."
64889,260,59,335000,Salesman,MORTUARY,"Sir, if I may, think of it as an investment in extravagance."
64890,260,60,339000,Salesman,MORTUARY,The Mauso-palooza can be seen from space. It will consume as much cement as a regulation-size tennis court.
64891,260,61,345000,Homer Simpson,MORTUARY,"Tennis court, eh?..."
64893,260,63,349000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I can't believe we went through all that, just to wind up with a tennis court."
64894,260,64,355000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll bet you didn't see that comin'.
64895,260,65,357000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,You don't care what happens to me when I die.
64896,260,66,360000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of course I do, Dad."
64897,260,67,363000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And if it were up to me, you wouldn't die at all..."
64898,260,68,366000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But try tellin' that to Killy McGee up there.
64899,260,69,373000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What on Earth are you doing?
64900,260,70,376000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Practicing tennis.
64901,260,71,377000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's tennis?! Then what's the one where the chicks whale on each other?
64902,260,72,383000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Foxy boxing?
64903,260,73,384000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes! That's what I wanted!
64904,260,74,395000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And finally, make sure the net is tight and springy."
64905,260,75,395000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That seems about right.
64906,260,76,404000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, a tennis court can really make your house look classy. I hear Mel Brooks has one. I mean, Sir Mel Brooks."
64907,260,77,413000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And it's bad news for the gophers.
64909,260,79,418000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And it's gonna do wonders for our social life.
64910,260,80,420000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, it'd be nice to entertain friends and have people over."
64911,260,81,424000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Hey, you got a tennis court."
64912,260,82,426000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Keep walkin', Flanders."
64913,260,83,427000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Will do.
64914,260,84,428000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fas-ter.
64916,260,86,436000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, I grunted way too early."
64917,260,87,439000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,We win again!
64918,260,88,441000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, this was a lot of fun, guys."
64919,260,89,444000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,Yeah. We never knew nobody with their own tennis rink.
64920,260,90,447000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"So, what happens now? Is the food free? Or do we pay someone?"
64921,260,91,450000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,Of course not. They send you a bill.
64922,260,92,453000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"Well, that's why I asked. That's how you learn -- by askin', you dumbass."
64924,260,94,462000,Marge Simpson,TENNIS COURT,Can you believe it? Kent Brockman playing on our court!
64925,260,95,467000,Stephanie,TENNIS COURT,Match point.
64926,260,96,468000,Homer Simpson,TENNIS COURT,And how about that Stephanie the weather girl?
64927,260,97,471000,Marge Simpson,TENNIS COURT,"Homer, ball!"
64928,260,98,475000,Kent Brockman,TENNIS COURT,"That's game, set, and match to us. But the real winners here are Marge's hors d'oeuvres."
64929,260,99,481000,Homer Simpson,TENNIS COURT,Wow. How do you come up with such witty remarks?
64930,260,100,485000,Kent Brockman,TENNIS COURT,Well...
64931,260,101,486000,Assistant Director,TENNIS COURT,"C'mon, c'mon. Hurry up."
64933,260,103,489000,Assistant Director,NEWS VAN,"I guess you could say, ""It's my racket!"""
64935,260,105,489000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"I guess you could say, ""I'm Iraqi!"""
64936,260,106,494000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Get off my property.
64937,260,107,499000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"...so from now on, all hats are banned from the school."
64938,260,108,502000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Even bonnets?
64939,260,109,504000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Especially bonnets.
64940,260,110,506000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've had it with that school!
64941,260,111,508000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Door.
64942,260,112,512000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Chief Wiggum! Are you here to make a bust of some kind?
64943,260,113,515000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"No, we're just uh... checking to make sure you're having a crime-free morning."
64944,260,114,520000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,As far as I know.
64945,260,115,522000,Lou,Simpson Home,"Hey, you know what'd be a real crime?"
64946,260,116,524000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"What's that, Lou?"
64947,260,117,525000,Lou,Simpson Home,"Uh, lettin' that tennis court go to waste."
64948,260,118,527000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Would you boys like to play tennis?
64949,260,119,530000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Why yes. Yes we would.

64952,260,122,537000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Take it, Lou."
64954,260,124,542000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Well hello, Marge. Lovely day for tennis, eh?"
64955,260,125,546000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought you had your own court.
64956,260,126,548000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,"He did, but he had it converted into a human chessboard."
64958,260,128,552000,Black Pawn,Burns Manor,"Hey, Burns has been gone for a while."
64959,260,129,554000,Black Rook,Burns Manor,Let's make a run for it.
64960,260,130,556000,Black King,Burns Manor,"Come back, fools! Protect me!"
64963,260,133,564000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Tennis Court,"Hey, check it out! I'm surfing the net!"
64964,260,134,570000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Tennis Court,His clowning around is putting me at ease.
64965,260,135,576000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Tennis Court,Yes! We win again!
64966,260,136,577000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Tennis Court,"Will you get serious, Homer? I'd like to win at least once."
64967,260,137,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Tennis Court,"Come on, Marge -- all sports have their lovable clowns: John Rocker, O.J. Simpson, Dorf..."
64968,260,138,588000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Tennis Court,"Hey, Homer. Here's a bloopie for ya."
64969,260,139,592000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Tennis Court,I've got it! It's in the bag!
64971,260,141,603000,Lou,Supermarket,"Hey Chief, we're gonna bust up that crackhouse tonight."
64972,260,142,605000,Chief Wiggum,Supermarket,We did that last night.
64973,260,143,606000,Lou,Supermarket,"Yeah, but this time we got the right address. Uh, you comin'?"
64974,260,144,608000,Chief Wiggum,Supermarket,"Well, I'd love to, Lou, but, ah, I'm playing tennis at the Simpsons' again."
64975,260,145,612000,Marge Simpson,Supermarket,"Ooh. Maggie, are your ears burning?"
64976,260,146,615000,Lou,Supermarket,The Simpsons? You mean the L.A. Clippers of backyard tennis?
64977,260,147,619000,Chief Wiggum,Supermarket,"Yeah, they're easier to beat than a suspect in shackles."
64978,260,148,622000,Lou,Supermarket,"Pretty easy to beat a suspect in shackles, Chief."
64979,260,149,624000,Chief Wiggum,Supermarket,"Well, that's the joke, Lou. It's on the Simpsons and their easy beatability."
64980,260,150,632000,Helen Lovejoy,Supermarket,I think they enjoy being humiliated.
64981,260,151,636000,Sideshow Mel,Supermarket,I don't know what's sadder about the Simpsons - the fact that we mock them or that they shall never know.
64982,260,152,644000,Sideshow Mel,Supermarket,"Never, ever, ever."
64983,260,153,646000,Sideshow Mel,Supermarket,Ever.
64986,260,156,651000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Do-I-have-cooties? No. Oh, this home testing kit saved me a fortune."
64987,260,157,657000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,You'll never guess what I heard in the supermarket today. I found out we're the laughingstock of the town.
64988,260,158,664000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Ohhh, well that's bad news for Dingbat Charlie. He's gonna be crushed."
64989,260,159,668000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"I thought our tennis court was bringing us a little respectability. Instead, people make fun of our lousiness."
64990,260,160,674000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Okay, now some of that is me."
64991,260,161,677000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,All of that is you. You've gotta take this more seriously.
64992,260,162,681000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Okay, honey. I can see this means a lot to you. I'll practice till my elbow is swollen and discolored."
64993,260,163,688000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,That's all I ask.
64995,260,165,695000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, it's a smooth motion... You follow through with your racket."
64996,260,166,703000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh.
64998,260,168,707000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"You know, this is such a beautiful day. I don't know why we don't operate outside more often."
64999,260,169,713000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,Time of death: 10:15.
65001,260,171,723000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good news, honey. I found a way to prove to the town we're not losers. I've entered us in a doubles tournament."
65002,260,172,730000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What? We're not ready to compete!
65003,260,173,733000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry. The tournament's not till tomorrow. Okay, get ready for the serve."
65004,260,174,741000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Get 'em off! Get 'em off!
65005,260,175,743000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"How embarrassing. You take over, Bart."
65006,260,176,749000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa! Lisa, beer me."
65007,260,177,752000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll be right out, honey."
65008,260,178,754000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that's okay. Bart's doing fine. You just have another beer."
65009,260,179,757000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now that's the kinda nagging I can live with.
65010,260,180,760000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So Barney's like ""you're on your own, dude,"" and I'm like ""not even."""
65011,260,181,760000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know what this has to do with the Civil War.
65012,260,182,767000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm getting to that.
65014,260,184,774000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Tennis Court,"Lookin' good, Honey. I think you and I might just win this tournament dealy."
65015,260,185,780000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Tennis Court,"Hey, Bart. Yeah, you got your daddy's hustle."
65016,260,186,786000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Tennis Court,"Too busy to reply, huh? I know how that goes. Well, I think I'll go lay out my clothes for the tournament."
65018,260,188,798000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Per-fect.
65019,260,189,805000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm ready for the big tournament."
65020,260,190,809000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey there, son!"
65021,260,191,810000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh. Hi Dad.
65022,260,192,812000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"With that little outfit on, everyone's gonna think you're playing in the tournament."
65023,260,193,816000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I am playing in the tournament.
65024,260,194,818000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's gonna be tough without a partner.
65025,260,195,820000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I've got a partner.
65026,260,196,820000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, good for you! Anyone I know?"
65027,260,197,823000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, you know her."
65028,260,198,825000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, hello, Homer."
65029,260,199,828000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good morning, partner!"
65030,260,200,830000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, there's something I should tell you."
65031,260,201,833000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The name of Bart's partner? I'm all ears.
65032,260,202,836000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, actually, the name of Bart's partner is..."
65033,260,203,842000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, darling?"
65034,260,204,844000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm Bart's partner.
65035,260,205,846000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No. No, no, no. You're my partner."
65036,260,206,849000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dude, I think the lady's made her decision."
65037,260,207,851000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm sorry, Homie. We'll talk about it later, okay?"
65038,260,208,855000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Nooo!
65039,260,209,862000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Traitors!
65040,260,210,865000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh.
65041,260,211,867000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think they saw me.
65042,260,212,872000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna put my trophy on the mantle. How 'bout you?
65043,260,213,874000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I was thinking mantle, too! Talk about being on the same wavelength."
65045,260,215,881000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Hello, Marge."
65046,260,216,883000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Hello, Bart. How are the tennis partners?"
65047,260,217,886000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Oh, Homey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings."
65048,260,218,889000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,Don't touch me. Your hands feel like salad tongs.
65049,260,219,893000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,I just wanted to win for once. Please don't take it as a threat to your manhood.
65050,260,220,899000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,My manhood? I never thought of that!
