130495,503,31,150000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah... but a weekend without drinking is no big deal. I did it when I was in that alcohol-induced coma.

130560,503,95,405000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Excellent.
130561,503,96,406000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, I'm afraid we do need to keep one human worker to sign for packages, a scapegoat for meltdowns, things that would be a waste of the robots' time."
130563,503,97,414000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,So we need one meat sock on the payroll. But who?
130564,503,98,418000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Mr. Burns, before I leave, I've got a few things to get off my chest: one: I liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push ""popcorn"". You don't have to know how long. Two: replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. Three: how about a farewell party with a caricature artist? You know, it's something both kids and adults can enjoy. So to sum up: nicely-done, we hate you, and food for thought."
130565,503,99,443000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Simpson, wait! As it turns out, there is one job available. But be forewarned, it promises naught but soul-crushing boredom."
130566,503,100,452000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Does the chair go back like this?
130567,503,101,455000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yes.
130568,503,102,456000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Woo hoo!
130569,503,103,462000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, it looks like we've found this plant's one remaining worker of bone and sinew."
130570,503,104,466000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, I believe there are two, including yours truly."
130571,503,105,470000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"It's one, excluding mine falsely!"
130572,503,106,472000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Surely no robot can replace me!
130573,503,107,484000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I can do that.
130575,503,109,488000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What about this?
130577,503,111,501000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Nice parking, idiot."
130578,503,112,509000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"So, uh, you guys are my new coworkers."
130579,503,113,512000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"So, workin' hard or hardly workin'?"
130580,503,114,516000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I said, workin' hard or hardly working? Working hard or hardly working?! WORKING HARD OR HARDLY WORKING?!"
130581,503,115,527000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It's a simple question! Are you A: Working hard or B:
130582,503,116,537000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I guess I just met the joker of the group. Better watch out for you on April Fool's Day, am I right? I said, am I right? Am I r--"
130584,503,118,545000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,So you guys have any luck finding a new job?
130585,503,119,550000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Does it look like I've got a job?

130587,503,121,553000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, show a little more sensitivity around these jobless washouts, huh?"

130591,503,125,573000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Oh my God! Where's the bow? I can't sell it without the bow!
130592,503,126,576000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Easy, easy there, Lenny. You can always play it pizzicato."
130593,503,127,579000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,The buyer clearly specified violin and bow!
130594,503,128,582000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Maybe I should be heading home.
130595,503,129,585000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Oh no, he stepped on the bow!"
130596,503,130,588000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Boy, this place has gotten so grim. I'm gonna do something I've never done: make myself a drink."
130597,503,131,595000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,You call this beer? This is watered-down swill! You got a problem? Well here's the complaint department!
130598,503,132,602000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"You know what I think, Moe? I think You ain't got the guts!"

130673,503,211,908000,Homer Simpson,Baseball Field,I said I've got it!
130675,503,212,913000,Homer Simpson,Baseball Field,That could've been my motherboard lying in the street!
130676,503,213,916000,Dying Robot,Baseball Field,Our primary directive... is to preserve human life.
130677,503,214,921000,Homer Simpson,Baseball Field,"And here I was waiting till you slept to rob you of your copper. You know, it's crazy, but..."
130678,503,215,926000,Dying Robot,Baseball Field,Homer... move away from me. You are still in the road.
130679,503,216,930000,Homer Simpson,Baseball Field,"Hush, bionic prince, as I cradle your waning form."
130680,503,217,936000,Homer Simpson,Baseball Field,Such a peaceful end.
130682,503,219,943000,Homer Simpson,Baseball Field,"Aw, jeez."
130684,503,221,961000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Axels to axels, rust to rust, amen."
130685,503,222,965000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Amen.
130686,503,223,966000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dearly beloved, we are not here to mourn their deactivation, but to celebrate their period of function."
130687,503,224,974000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Can I hollow out this one's head and use it as a turtle tank?
130688,503,225,977000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No! I'm already using it to put my keys in!
130689,503,226,980000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, let me raise this beer to toast..."
130691,503,228,983000,Robot #1,Simpson Home,Alcohol is harmful to humans.
130692,503,229,985000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, save your breath."
130693,503,230,987000,Robot #2,Simpson Home,We have no breath.
130694,503,231,988000,Robot #3,Simpson Home,We do vent nitrogen once a year. You do not want to be around for that.
130695,503,232,992000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I have some adjustments to make.
130697,503,234,998000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Garage,"Homer, when am I gettin' my power drill back?"
130698,503,235,1001000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,When I'm done with my robo-botomies.
130699,503,236,1006000,Robot,Simpson Garage,Primary directive deactivated.
130700,503,237,1009000,Robot #2,Simpson Garage,Our new primary directive becomes removing all impediments to the plant.
130701,503,238,1015000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Garage,"Uh, Homer, I'm afraid this is the part of God's perfect plan where you're murdered by robots."
130702,503,239,1019000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Flanders, I don't judge a robot by the color of their eyes. I look at their hands, which have turned into buzz saws."
130703,503,240,1030000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Sonofa-- Why did you do that?
130705,503,242,1037000,Robots,Evergreen Terrace,Eliminate impediment. Eliminate.
130706,503,243,1039000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Just say ""kill me,"" jerks!"
130507,503,244,1042000,Robots,Evergreen Terrace,Kill him. Kill him.
130707,503,245,1043000,Lisa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Dad, they can only go three miles an hour!"
130708,503,246,1046000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,I'm doomed! Can they climb stairs?
130709,503,247,1049000,Lisa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,With great difficulty!
130710,503,248,1050000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,I'm doomed!
130712,503,250,1061000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Living Room,Robots... trying to kill me... and now they'll kill you... 'cause I led them here...
130714,503,252,1068000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Now see here! You are so not the heartless automatons I was looking for! There's one thing man has that machines can never match: hounds!
130716,503,254,1083000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Fine! Slink away! And guess what: all those times I said ""you're a good boy,"" it was a lie!"
130717,503,255,1090000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,No! Stop! I'll give you the combination to the num-num safe!
130718,503,256,1095000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Flee, you fool!"
130719,503,257,1096000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,Aren't we getting num-nums?
130721,503,259,1106000,C. Montgomery Burns,VICTORIAN SOLARIUM,Ahh. The solarium. We'll be safely cornered in this glass room with one door.
130723,503,261,1119000,C. Montgomery Burns,VICTORIAN SOLARIUM,Stop brandishing me!
130724,503,262,1121000,Homer Simpson,VICTORIAN SOLARIUM,"Sorry. Before we die, can you tell me how old you really are?"
130725,503,263,1125000,C. Montgomery Burns,VICTORIAN SOLARIUM,"Well, it has four digits..."
130726,503,264,1125000,Lenny Leonard,VICTORIAN SOLARIUM,Unemployed Springfielders to the rescue!
130727,503,265,1130000,Carl Carlson,VICTORIAN SOLARIUM,And underemployed!
130728,503,266,1137000,Waylon Smithers,VICTORIAN SOLARIUM,To servos with love!
130729,503,267,1149000,Homer Simpson,VICTORIAN SOLARIUM,"Guys, thank you. The words ""prime directive"" get thrown around a lot these days, but I'm glad yours was saving me. The saddest part is none of this had to happen, if Mr. Burns had simply trusted the human worker. Or if someone, anyone had told me that robots were incapable of human feelings."
130730,503,268,1171000,Robot #1,VICTORIAN SOLARIUM,I told you precisely that fact one thousand five hundred sixty-two t--
130731,503,269,1181000,Homer Simpson,VICTORIAN SOLARIUM,And his arm can be my back-scratcher.
130733,503,271,1184000,C. Montgomery Burns,VICTORIAN SOLARIUM,"Well, I've learned the robotic worker is no match for the old-fashioned man of labor. You're all hired back... as temps!"
130735,503,273,1193000,Fishing Robot,Lake Springfield,"Homer, why have you reprogrammed me for this?"
130736,503,274,1196000,Homer Simpson,Lake Springfield,I'm giving you your wish: to be a real boy.
130737,503,275,1200000,Fishing Robot,Lake Springfield,I am real and I do not have wishes.
130738,503,276,1202000,Homer Simpson,Lake Springfield,Then take us out to sea.
130739,503,277,1204000,Fishing Robot,Lake Springfield,I am not a transformer. I cannot turn into an outboard motor.
130740,503,278,1208000,Homer Simpson,Lake Springfield,"Oh, I believe you, but Flanders' drill doesn't."
130742,503,280,1216000,Homer Simpson,Lake Springfield,"Oh, this is the life."
130743,503,281,1219000,Homer Simpson,Lake Springfield,Hey!
