111782,431,8,137000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe we have to start another year of school. I never learned anything at that suck shack.
111783,431,9,142000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who taught you that language?!
111784,431,10,142000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Kid at school.
111785,431,11,144000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,So you did learn something.
111786,431,12,146000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Homie, the insurance bill is due today. Can you make sure to mail it?"
111787,431,13,151000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Absolutely. Insurance is the greatest deal ever. If I get hurt, I get paid. And man, do I get hurt."
111788,431,14,209000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What a week.
111790,431,16,215000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Welcome to another school year. One important note: the flower-based names of the reading groups are now barnyard-based. Mr. Becker has protested the move, so his group will remain the Daffodils."
111791,431,17,227000,Mr. Becker,Springfield Elementary School,Yeah! Where my Dils at?!
111792,431,18,229000,Daffodils Reading Group,Springfield Elementary School,GO DI-ILS / GO DI-ILS / GO DI-ILS...
111793,431,19,232000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I never tire of that. Uh, one other announcement, at the end of the month we'll be participating in the Vice-President's Assessment Test."
111794,431,20,241000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,He stinks!
111795,431,21,242000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"We're assessing you, not him."
111796,431,22,244000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Withdrawn.
111798,431,23,245000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"The V.P.A.T. is part of the Federal Government's ""No Child Left Alone Act."" It'll be a rewarding day of pencil sharpening and eyes-on-your-own-paper-keeping..."
111799,431,24,253000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Cut the horse-bull, Seymour. Your scores on this test will determine how much money this suck shack gets for years to come, so we will spend every moment of the next two weeks drilling the questions and answers into your soft little skulls."

111810,431,35,305000,Coach Krupt,Springfield Elementary School,Wrong!
111811,431,36,306000,Coach Krupt,Springfield Elementary School,Nine-hundred and twelve divided by six!
111812,431,37,308000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You can't teach this way!
111813,431,38,310000,Coach Krupt,Springfield Elementary School,Yes I can! Studies show it works!
111814,431,39,313000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,Where were these studies conducted?

111816,431,41,316000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"So, when you take your practice test, take your number two pencil and..."
111817,431,42,321000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What kind of pencil do we take again?
111818,431,43,323000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Number two. Take a number two.
111820,431,45,327000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Looks like you took a big number two.
111822,431,47,331000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, quite so. As you can see, I'm holding a big number two in my hands, enjoying the weight and feel of it."
111826,431,51,348000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,"Woo-hoo! Test day at last! Now I can show off at a Federal level. Hey Bart, on the practice test yesterday, what did you pick as the best title for the paragraph about ""Manifest Destiny?"""
111734,431,52,358000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,Slurp my snot.
111797,431,53,361000,Bart Simpson,Homer's Car,"I wrote ""Slurp My Snot"" in the ovals on the answer sheet. True story."

111828,431,55,367000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Oh no! Now who will sell oranges on the off-ramp?
111829,431,56,374000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Great jokes make me hungry. I wonder what's in the pantry...
111831,431,58,381000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Wait a minute...
111832,431,59,392000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Wait a minute...
111835,431,62,402000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, we need to talk to you about your practice test."

111840,431,67,416000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Ninety-six.
111841,431,68,418000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What did I get wrong?
111842,431,69,418000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Several answers.
111843,431,70,420000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"""Several?!"" That's more than ""a few"" and almost ""a bunch!"""
111844,431,71,424000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, because of your superior intellect--"
111845,431,72,427000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No, but wait. I aced the Math part, right? Because..."
111846,431,73,429000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, yes, well, well, run along now."
111847,431,74,433000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, you and the other perfect-scoring ""Superstars"" are exempt from taking the actual test today."
111848,431,75,439000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,No test?
111849,431,76,440000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Now don't be too disappointed. We are throwing you a pizza party at a bowling alley.
111850,431,77,445000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, it's about time."

111860,431,87,472000,Seymour Skinner,PLAYGROUND,"Brilliant plan to remove all the underperformers for test day, sir."
111862,431,88,476000,Gary Chalmers,PLAYGROUND,"Yes, all of them. Why Seymour, it seems I left my sunglasses on the bus."
111863,431,89,482000,Seymour Skinner,PLAYGROUND,"Well, I'd best retrieve them."
111864,431,90,484000,Gary Chalmers,PLAYGROUND,"Yes, yes, you'd best."

111866,431,92,490000,Gary Chalmers,PLAYGROUND,"So long, ""superstars."""
111869,431,95,503000,Seymour Skinner,Bus,I can't believe it. Superintendent Chalmers betrayed me. After all the wrapping paper I bought from his daughter.
111870,431,96,511000,Nelson Muntz,Bus,Pizza Party! Pizza Party!
111871,431,97,513000,Ralph Wiggum,Bus,Heli-copter! Heli-copter!
111872,431,98,515000,Bart Simpson,Bus,Stop it! All of you!
111873,431,99,517000,DOLPH,Bus,"What's the matter, superstar? Feeling sorry for the normals?"
111874,431,100,521000,Bart Simpson,Bus,Don't you get it? There is no pizza party. This isn't a helicopter.
111875,431,101,525000,Nelson Muntz,Bus,No pizza party?
111876,431,102,527000,Otto Mann,Bus,Not a helicopter?! Huh?
111878,431,104,535000,Seymour Skinner,Bus,Let me explain this to you in terms even the simplest will understand. We're hiding you in Capital City for the day so your numb-skullery won't drag down the test scores of the children who are our future.
111879,431,105,546000,Bart Simpson,Bus,Told ya.
111880,431,106,546000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Bus,"Will there be other numbskulls there? Sort of a Numbskull Olympics, as it were?"
111881,431,107,551000,Jimbo Jones,Bus,Let's all act stupid!
111882,431,108,555000,Bart Simpson,Bus,Doy. Doy. Doy. Doy.
111883,431,109,555000,Nelson Muntz,Bus,Guys. Guys. Save it for the competition.
111885,431,111,562000,Security Guard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I.D., please."
111886,431,112,563000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Must be in the glove box.
111888,431,114,571000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,This was due two weeks ago! I'm not insured! For the first time in my life I'm financially responsible for my own actions!
111889,431,115,579000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Uninsured! Uninsured!
111890,431,116,580000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I'm not in good hands! I'm in no hands! Like a bad neighbor, no one is there!"
111892,431,118,589000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Dear. Stupid. Insurance. Company. I. Meant. To. Mail this. On time. What. Do You. Mean. Too bad? Screw. You! Heh. Heh.
111893,431,119,608000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"I won't be insured until three o'clock?! Okay, until then, I have to avoid any serious injuries or accidents on my property, or I'm ruined."
111895,431,121,618000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Oh no you don't!
111898,431,124,625000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Now, I know some of you may suffer from ""test anxiety"". Here's a helpful hint: imagine each question is a baby chick. If you answer wrong, the chick dies."
111900,431,126,638000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Shut up, they would've died anyway! Now, the test will begin in five... four... three... Oh my God, we should've begun four minutes ago! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!"
148719,431,127,649000,Lisa's Thoughts,Springfield Elementary School,"You can do it, Lisa. There's nothing in the room but you and the test."
148720,431,128,674000,Lisa's Thoughts,Springfield Elementary School,Focus!
111901,431,129,678000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"""Pride"" is to ""downfall"" as ""overconfidence"" is to..."
111903,431,131,687000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,They're all equally valid! But that can't be. In life everything only has one answer!
111904,431,132,694000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Piece of cake, huh? Oh, I'm writing on my shirt."
111906,431,134,705000,Bart Simpson,Outskirts Of Capital City,"Hey Seymour, I just realized something. You're stuck babysitting us losers which makes you the real loser!"
111908,431,136,713000,Seymour Skinner,Outskirts Of Capital City,"For your information, I am not a loser! I'm a successful principal who paints houses in the summertime."
111909,431,137,718000,Seymour Skinner,Outskirts Of Capital City,Your dad insisted I use an inferior primer!
111910,431,138,724000,Bullies,Outskirts Of Capital City,Loser! Loser!
111911,431,139,726000,Ralph Wiggum,Outskirts Of Capital City,"Excuse me, Mommy, I have to go potty."
111912,431,140,729000,Seymour Skinner,Outskirts Of Capital City,"Otto, can you pull over? Pull over!"
111913,431,141,733000,Otto Mann,Outskirts Of Capital City,Sorry. I was mesmerized by the little boy's dance.
111917,431,145,741000,Ralph Wiggum,GAS STATION RESTROOM DOOR,"YO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WANT, WHAT I REALLY REALLY WANT..."
111921,431,147,743000,Ralph Wiggum,Seedy Gas Station Bathroom,"SO TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT, WHAT YOU REALLY REALLY WANT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WANT, WHAT I REALLY REALLY WANT, SO TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT, WHAT YOU REALLY REALLY WANT..."
111922,431,148,749000,Seymour Skinner,Seedy Gas Station Bathroom,"Ralph, are you almost finished?"
111923,431,149,751000,Ralph Wiggum,Seedy Gas Station Bathroom,I finished before we came in!
111926,431,152,754000,Seymour Skinner,Seedy Gas Station,"All right, now we can get back on the bus and on..."
111927,431,153,759000,Otto Mann,Seedy Gas Station,All aboard!
111928,431,154,762000,Jimbo Jones,Seedy Gas Station,"Hey Skinner, wanna see our impression of you?"
111929,431,155,765000,Seymour Skinner,Seedy Gas Station,I guess I could use an affectionate homage.
111930,431,156,773000,Otto Mann,Seedy Gas Station,Doy. Doy. Doy. Doy.
111932,431,158,773000,Seymour Skinner,Capital City,"All right, stay calm, boys. Oh God! We're at the corner of Cesar Chavez Way and Martin Luther King Boulevard!"
111933,431,159,778000,Bart Simpson,Capital City,Ay carumba.
111935,431,161,783000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie! What are you doing home so early?
111936,431,162,785000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I won't bore you with the truth. All I can say is that until three p.m., we must avoid all accidents and injuries or we're all going to the poor house."
111937,431,163,793000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean back to the poor house?
111938,431,164,795000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine. Back. And we can't let anyone else get hurt on our property.
111939,431,165,799000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't want anyone to ever get hurt.
111940,431,166,802000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Me too, baby. But we gotta get real."
111941,431,167,803000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"We can discuss it later. Right now, while you're here, you can help host my book club."
111942,431,168,808000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Book club? That's the most stupid boring thing ever. Oh, thank you."
111943,431,169,816000,Helen Lovejoy,Simpson Home,"Now I would never say a bad word about Cletus and Brandine, but I hear he's been feeding slop to another woman's pig."
111945,431,171,831000,Agnes Skinner,Simpson Home,I've been cleaved!
111946,431,172,833000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh my God! Oh my God! We're totally liable!
111947,431,173,841000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah.
111948,431,174,843000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I mean, nooo!"
148721,431,176,851000,Lisa's Thoughts,Springfield Elementary School,Maybe I should just move on to question two.
148718,431,177,853000,Lisa's Thoughts,Springfield Elementary School,Question two: Using what you learned in question one...
111951,431,179,860000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, like Captain Kirk, I'm not supposed to interfere. But like T.J. Hooker, I say what is on my mind. If you don't know the answer, just guess."
111952,431,180,869000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,This test penalizes guessing.
111953,431,181,871000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"It does? All right, nobody guess! Just be right! Get down on your knees, pray to your God and ask him -- no, demand -- he tell you the answer! And if he won't, he is no God of yours!"
111956,431,184,886000,Bart Simpson,Capital City,"What's your plan now, Skinrash?"
111957,431,185,888000,Seymour Skinner,Capital City,"My name isn't Skinrash, it's Principal Skinner, and you will address me as such."
111958,431,186,892000,Bart Simpson,Capital City,"Sure thing, Such."
111959,431,187,894000,Seymour Skinner,Capital City,I'll deal with your insubordinate wordplay later. My first duty is to get you boys to safety and that's... where's Ralph?
111960,431,188,902000,Ralph Wiggum,Capital City,I'm playing with Elmo!
111963,431,191,915000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, I just have to keep these tipsy witches safe for ten more seconds."
111964,431,192,923000,Agnes Skinner,Simpson Home,Van Johnson was never half the man Van Heflin was.
111965,431,193,929000,Agnes Skinner,Simpson Home,Oops.
111966,431,194,929000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Kniiiife!
111967,431,195,960000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Got it!
111969,431,197,960000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,Apaches!
111970,431,198,963000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Mr. Burns! Why do terrible things always happen to wonderful people at three-oh-one p.m., which, for the record, is the correct time."
111971,431,199,977000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, plans for the weekend?"
111973,431,201,981000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, are you mad I forgot to send in the payment?"
111974,431,202,985000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, sweetie. At this point in a marriage, a wife should know what her husband can do and what he can't. Who was I to think you could mail an envelope?"
111975,431,203,993000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Baby, I hope you've got snuggle insurance, 'cause I'm about to file a claim."
111976,431,204,1012000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,"Bart, do you have your slingshot?"
111977,431,205,1014000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, sir."
111978,431,206,1015000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,I see it in your back pocket.
111979,431,207,1017000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Just don't stretch it out.
111980,431,208,1018000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,I was once a boy. And like all boys...
111861,431,209,1020000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,You like all boys? Haw haw!
111981,431,210,1023000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,Shut up! A child is in danger under my aegis!
111982,431,211,1026000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Haw haw?
111983,431,212,1050000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,"Run, Ralph! Run!"
111984,431,213,1051000,Ralph Wiggum,Simpson Home,Okay.
111985,431,214,1057000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,Time to do what I've never done as principal: something.
111986,431,215,1068000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,Skinner's spazzing out!
111987,431,216,1070000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,I am not spazzing out -- I'm using the principle of conservation of angular momentum to turn the container.
111989,431,218,1079000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,That is so cool! That's the kind of stuff they should teach in school!
111990,431,219,1083000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,We do teach it in school! You're too busy eating sugar snacks and horsing around!
111991,431,220,1087000,Boys,Simpson Home,He's right. / Learning can teach you things. / Education rules!
111993,431,222,1103000,Seymour Skinner,GARBAGE BARGE,"""...But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and civilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before."""

111996,431,225,1117000,Barge Captain,GARBAGE BARGE,Next stop -- Springfield Elementary!

111999,431,228,1135000,Milhouse Van Houten,CAFETERIA,All done -- and I've got two minutes to take care of these stray marks.
112000,431,229,1141000,Lisa Simpson,CAFETERIA,"Well, that's it."
112001,431,230,1141000,Milhouse Van Houten,CAFETERIA,Mm-hm.
112002,431,231,1143000,Lisa Simpson,CAFETERIA,The test is almost over and I haven't done a thing. I've blown my whole future.

112012,431,240,1173000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,"Yes, I know what that means -- I've learned so much today! This is my school and I'm throwing out the test!"
112014,431,242,1182000,Lisa Simpson,CAFETERIA,Hooray! I'm a brainy outcast again!
112015,431,243,1186000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,"And finally, effective immediately, I'm overturning this school's ban on dancing."
