140199,539,2,15000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,...the only part of the movie I didn't get is: now Radioactive Man gets his powers from his suit?
140200,539,3,20000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"The suit is slowly killing him, but if he doesn't wear it, he'll die."
140201,539,4,24000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh...
140202,539,5,26000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Wait, you guys saw the new Radioactive Man sequel?"
140203,539,6,28000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, it's not a sequel, it's a reboot."
140204,539,7,30000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Actually, this one undoes the stuff from the last one, so it's a de-boot."
140205,539,8,34000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Stop talking! I haven't seen it yet!
140206,539,9,36000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"""Radioactive Man Re-Rises"" came out three days ago. It is fair game."
140207,539,10,41000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, if you haven't seen it, then you gotta leave the water cooler."
140208,539,11,43000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,But what if I want some cooled water?
140209,539,12,45000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You should have thought of that when you were not seeing the movie.
140056,539,13,49000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Fine. I'll drink alone.
140210,539,15,58000,Plant Employee #1,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It was so awesome when Radioactive Man had to erase his own memory.
140211,539,16,63000,Plant Employee #2,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, so he wouldn't be tortured by his past, when he was born in the future."
140212,539,17,67000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"They're talking about the movie! Hurry up, you idiot! No, no, don't stop! I'm sorry I got mad. I'll do that thing you like."
140214,539,19,79000,Milhouse Van Houten,Krusty Burger,I got Radioactive Man's new villain -- the Collider.
140215,539,20,82000,The Collider,Krusty Burger,I turn out to be a good guy.
140216,539,21,86000,The Collider,Krusty Burger,"I die, but come back to life after the credits."
140219,539,24,93000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Sometimes we feel there's nowhere left to turn, much like Radioactive Man, when he had to kill his own antimatter twin"
140220,539,25,93000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,AMAZING GRACE / HOW LOUD I SING / TO DROWN THE SPOILERS OUT... shut up. Shut up. Shut up!
140221,539,26,93000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"...with a blast of time particles from the Chrono-cube, and in doing so, mortally wounding his girlfriend, who was pregnant with his own grandfather."

140236,539,41,148000,Homer Simpson,Theater,"Two adults, two kids, and one senior with the mind of a baby so he should be free."
140237,539,42,153000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Theater,"For the 3-D show, that'll be seventy-two dollars."
140239,539,43,156000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Theater,Homer looks upset at the high ticket prices.
140240,539,44,156000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Theater,"Or, for ten dollars more you can see it in IMAX Hobbit Frame Rate Virtual Reality Vision."
140241,539,45,170000,Homer Simpson,Theater,"All right, movie, you better be worth it."
140242,539,46,188000,Homer Simpson,Theater,The motorcycle dudes are chicks!

140254,539,58,239000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Chins up, Homer. You don't need a theater to watch the movie. You just have to illegally download it."
140255,539,59,246000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Illegally download it? Is that legal?
140256,539,60,248000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Who knows? But it sure is easy. I'll walk you through it. All you have to do is--
140257,539,61,253000,Serious Announcer,Simpson Home,"The FOX network forbids the broadcast of step-by-step instructions for illegally downloading copyrighted intellectual property. In the meantime, please enjoy this footage from Nascar's 2011 Martinsville Cup."

140259,539,63,273000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,And play!
140260,539,64,279000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bless you, boy. That was the greatest thing I've seen on a computer that I can talk about with you in the room. How did you know how to do that?"
140261,539,65,287000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm under thirty.
140263,539,67,288000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Guys, guys, I saw the Radioactive Man movie! Here's my ten favorite scenes from worst to best -- number ten: when what's his name did that stuff with those dudes. Number nine--"
140265,539,68,296000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, Homer, that movie's been talked out. We're discussing the new James Bond flick."
140266,539,69,300000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I like that James Bond is ugly now.
140267,539,70,302000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I like that he doesn't have any gadgets.
140268,539,71,304000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I like that he's not good at shooting, doesn't say funny quips, or do any James Bond stuff."
140269,539,72,308000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Shut up shut up shut up!
140270,539,73,310000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Homer, go to the theater and see the movie."
140271,539,74,311000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Theaters? All I need to see this movie is a laptop and a website based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform. Care to join me?
140273,539,76,325000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,That was so much better than the cinema. It mixes the wonder of movie-going with the rush of stealing.
140274,539,77,330000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"All we want is brand new, big budget entertainment in our homes for nothin'! Why doesn't Hollywood get that?"
140275,539,78,337000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Gentlemen, I am inspired to create a theater for the people -- an experience free of all the nuisances and gouging of modern day movie-going!"
140276,539,79,346000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, no more jerks talking on their cell phones!"
140277,539,80,349000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,No more jerks telling me not to talk on my cell phone!

140283,539,86,397000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, what'd you think?"
140284,539,87,399000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"We may be going to hell for seeing ""side bosom,"" but this backyard is a little slice of Heaven, all thanks to Homer Simpson!"
140286,539,89,407000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This is fun! And it was so nice of the movie company to let you show their film.
140287,539,90,412000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Let me? Uh, sweetheart, I downloaded it off the internet... illegally."
140288,539,91,418000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,An illegal download? But Hollywood says stealing from Hollywood is wrong.
140289,539,92,424000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why should a regular guy like me have to spend fifteen bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the Air Buds and Ray Liottas of the world?
140291,539,94,435000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"When I watched that pirated movie, I was stealing with my eyes. So I'm repaying the good people in Hollywood for the ticket I should have bought."
140292,539,95,445000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Now this money will end up in the hands of the talented people who make magic happen on the silver screen.
140293,539,96,464000,Sleazy Executive,Simpson Home,"Karen, get me the FBI! Karen!"
140295,539,98,479000,Deputy Director Gratman,F.B.I. Headquarters,You people joined this squad for one reason -- to fight movie pirates.

140297,539,100,486000,Deputy Director Gratman,F.B.I. Headquarters,I wanted to get serial killers.

140299,539,102,495000,Young Fbi Agent,F.B.I. Headquarters,"Sir, you have to see this."
140300,539,103,498000,Deputy Director Gratman,F.B.I. Headquarters,... took it off the web... watched for free... never pay for a movie again...!
140301,539,104,503000,Deputy Director Gratman,F.B.I. Headquarters,"Men, set your guns on ""kill."" We're going after Homer Simpson."
140303,539,106,508000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I now present, direct from the computer of an angry editor at a special effects house, ""Cosmic Wars Episode Seven""."

140309,539,112,553000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Ow, ow, ow! I'm-I'm not wearing an undershirt and my badge is poking into my skin!"
140310,539,113,559000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's going on here? Is there a fondler in the neighborhood?
140311,539,114,563000,Deputy Director Gratman,Simpson Home,I'm here to arrest and hopefully stage the prison suicide of the mastermind of this operation -- Homer Simpson!
140312,539,115,569000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, mastermind."
140314,539,116,571000,Deputy Director Gratman,Simpson Home,"We got our man, thanks to a tip from a heroic American snitch."
140315,539,117,576000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,One of you turned me in? Who was it?
140316,539,118,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You!

140318,539,120,591000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,They're gonna take Dad! We gotta do something!
140319,539,121,593000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm on it.
140320,539,122,600000,Fbi Trooper #1,Simpson Home,Copyrighted material!
140321,539,123,604000,Fbi Trooper #2,Simpson Home,Don't look at it!
140322,539,124,605000,Fbi Trooper #3,Simpson Home,Someone sell me a ticket!
140323,539,125,607000,Deputy Director Gratman,Simpson Home,Ear plugs in! Blinders on! We trained for this!
140325,539,127,627000,Deputy Director Gratman,Simpson Home,"From now on, the only place you'll be watching movies without having to buy a ticket is jail."
140326,539,128,633000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Baby, promise me you'll find out who turned me in!"
140328,539,130,641000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's probably someone I would never suspect! Never suspect!
140330,539,132,646000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Your moans of sympathy are all I have!
140332,539,134,651000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoever did this will be haunted by unbearable guilt forever!

140339,539,141,671000,Homer Simpson,Prison Bus,Movie piracy.
140341,539,143,673000,Criminal #1,Prison Bus,People in show business work hard to make those movies!
140342,539,144,676000,Criminal #2,Prison Bus,My media stocks under-performed because of people like you!
140343,539,145,681000,Criminal #3,Prison Bus,My brother lost his job as a grip on a movie set because of piracy. He had to sell his jet ski. A grip without a jet ski ain't no grip at all!
140345,539,147,694000,Criminal #2,Prison Bus,You're about to find out what we do to copyright infringers.
140348,539,150,713000,Homer Simpson,Highway,Woo hoo!
140350,539,152,741000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's almost like having Dad here. Only with less growling when I go near his food.
140351,539,153,745000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I just want to know who dropped the dime on Dad. Lousy rat.
140352,539,154,749000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe the person that turned your father in thought they were doing the right thing.
140353,539,155,754000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer just pirated a movie. It's not the worst thing Dad ever did. It's not even the worst kind of pirate Dad's ever been.
140354,539,156,761000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, tell your brother that stealing is wrong, no matter what."
140355,539,157,764000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know. It wasn't like Dad was stealing for himself. He created this wonderful experience for the whole town. I just can't imagine anyone turning him in.
140356,539,158,778000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad! Dad! You're back! You're back!
140357,539,159,781000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer! What are you doing out of prison? You have to go back and give yourself up.
140358,539,160,786000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I can't go back to jail! There's no shampoo, just soap!"
140359,539,161,791000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait, I know one place in Springfield that doesn't care about internet piracy laws."
140361,539,163,800000,Lisa Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,Thanks for taking us in. Our family always appreciates asylum.
140362,539,164,804000,Gottfrid,SWEDISH CONSULATE,This consulate is like being on Swedish soil. You're as safe here as you would be in the Skatteskrapan.
140364,539,166,812000,Marge Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,Your country doesn't think illegally downloaded movies is wrong.
140365,539,167,816000,Lisa Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,The people of Sweden believe all movies should be shared freely.
140366,539,168,819000,Marge Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,How is that not stealing?
140367,539,169,822000,Gottfrid,SWEDISH CONSULATE,Bah! Your Hollywood studios are the real thieves -- claiming all their hit movies have lost money. I spit on their bookkeeping!
140368,539,170,830000,Homer Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,"Yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to ""Taken"" where the ""Hangover"" guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is ""Fast and Furious."""
140369,539,171,838000,Bart Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,"Oh man, I would love to pirate that."
140370,539,172,841000,Gottfrid,SWEDISH CONSULATE,As would the proud people of Sweden.
140371,539,173,850000,Lisa Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,They've found us!
140372,539,174,852000,Deputy Director Gratman,SWEDISH CONSULATE,There's only one surefire way to get fugitives out of a foreign building: blasting death metal.

140374,539,178,869000,Gottfrid,SWEDISH CONSULATE,Swedes love death metal. It reminds us of death.
140375,539,179,874000,Deputy Director Gratman,SWEDISH CONSULATE,Damn those peace prize-giving fish-smokers!
140376,539,180,880000,Marge Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,I'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy.
140377,539,181,883000,Homer Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,Consulate.
140378,539,182,885000,Homer Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,"Consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capital."
140379,539,183,890000,Homer Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,Thank you so much for sticking with me through all this. You're the greatest wife in the world.
140380,539,184,897000,Marge Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,It was me! I was the one who told the FBI.
140381,539,185,903000,Homer Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,You? How could you? You're my own flesh and blood!
140382,539,186,907000,Marge Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,I was just trying to do the right thing! Who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me?
140383,539,187,914000,Homer Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,"Have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding -- to love and cherish, to aid and abet?"
140384,539,188,921000,Marge Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,I never wanted to say funny vows!
140385,539,189,923000,Homer Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,Well you did. And they got laughs. Solid laughs.
140386,539,190,927000,Marge Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,"I didn't mean for this to happen, but... you were stealing."
140387,539,191,931000,Homer Simpson,SWEDISH CONSULATE,All I ever had was you looking out for me. I've got nothin' now.

140393,539,197,970000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Court,"The people call Hollywood ultra-producer, Judd Apatow."
140394,539,198,974000,Judd Apatow,Court,"Homer Simpson is an enemy of art. Art created by writers, directors, and the guy who uses a computer to erase or enhance nipples."
140395,539,199,982000,Judd Apatow,Court,"And not just the people who dream for a living, but the people who depend on us. The spin class instructors, the personal rabbis, Seth Rogen."
140396,539,200,995000,SETH ROGEN,Court,"It's true, I need him."
140397,539,201,997000,Judd Apatow,Court,"I saw a bootleg DVD of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" for sale at a carwash... they left off my director's commentary! It didn't even have a blooper reel!"
