129912,501,1,70000,Lisa Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Dad? Dad?
129914,501,3,79000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yes! Awake! Let's do this!
129915,501,4,81000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I wanted to give you a heads-up. Mom's birthday is tomorrow. It's time to start your annual mad dash around town to get her a present that's not completely insulting."
129916,501,5,90000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know sweetie, there was a time when I would've killed for that information, but I'm pleased to announce I've already bought your mother a present."
129918,501,7,99000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And brace yourself: I put some thought into it.
129920,501,9,105000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's a state-of-the-art food mash-'em-upper.
129921,501,10,108000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Wha--? Mom is gonna love that!
129922,501,11,111000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Love""?! Your Mom's gonna feel so good it'll make mere ""love"" seem like chewing tinfoil. Because today I'm getting it autographed."
129923,501,12,122000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,By who? Lenny?
129924,501,13,123000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,By the box lady herself!
129926,501,15,128000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah.
129929,501,18,141000,Homer Simpson,Swapper Jack's,"Man, oh man, look at this place! Finally, a supermarket with a clear premise: island something."
129930,501,19,144000,Bart Simpson,Swapper Jack's,It's like going to Hawaii without the murderous locals!
129931,501,20,150000,Lisa Simpson,Swapper Jack's,They have jellies made of fruits I've never heard of!
129932,501,21,153000,Lisa Simpson,Swapper Jack's,These'll go great with betel nut butter!
129933,501,22,156000,Homer Simpson,Swapper Jack's,Wow. I don't believe the Simpsons will be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart anymore.
129934,501,23,160000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Swapper Jack's,Oh really?
129935,501,24,161000,Homer Simpson,Swapper Jack's,Apu! What are you doing out of your natural habitat?
129936,501,25,164000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Swapper Jack's,"I am finding out who my real customers are, and who is going to cheat on my store with some South-Sea sugar shack!"
129937,501,26,170000,Lisa Simpson,Swapper Jack's,"But at the Kwik-E-Mart, the only fresh fruit is the one banana by the register."
129938,501,27,174000,Sideshow Mel,Swapper Jack's,You keep your ice cream right beside the motor oil!
129939,501,28,178000,Nelson Muntz,Swapper Jack's,You sell cigarettes to kids!
129940,501,29,180000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Swapper Jack's,Now see here. I have always considered you cash-giving cows to be my friends. And friends do not betray friends!
129941,501,30,186000,Homer Simpson,Swapper Jack's,Friends are the only people you can betray! And you'd do it in a second for a supermarket that gives free coffee samples!
129942,501,31,193000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Swapper Jack's,"Defend yourself, sir!"
129943,501,32,231000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Swapper Jack's,"Convenience forever, freshness never!"
129944,501,33,241000,Homer Simpson,Swapper Jack's,Would you sign this for my wife Marge? She's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow.
129945,501,34,246000,Paula Paul,Swapper Jack's,"Uh-huh... You know, while I was signing this for your wife, I just cooked up..."
129947,501,36,252000,Paula Paul,Swapper Jack's,...a great idea!
129949,501,38,254000,Paula Paul,Swapper Jack's,How would you like it if I called your wife live from my show tomorrow to wish her a happy birthday?
129950,501,39,260000,Homer Simpson,Swapper Jack's,"You would do that? Oh my God, this might be a Marge's birthday where I get sex!"
129952,501,41,269000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Ooh! An apron with a sonnet!
129953,501,42,271000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Open mine! Quick, before it suffocates!"
129954,501,43,273000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,A bunny! Just like the one I had when I was a girl! How did you know?
129957,501,44,278000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I saw this picture at Grandma's house, then I hit the pet stores till I found one that looked just like it."
129958,501,45,282000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Bart, you got me the fluffy pet I've never stopped thinking about!"
129959,501,46,289000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, last but not least, your present, Homie."
129960,501,47,293000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait one sec, Marge. Before you open it, you're gonna get a phone call that will make this your most awesome birthday ever."
129961,501,48,302000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we're still focused on me instead of watching golf, so that's pretty good."
129962,501,49,307000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The only golf we'll watch is ladies' golf, and we're not watching that. Now in three... two... one..."
129963,501,50,317000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I repeat. One...
129964,501,51,321000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Onnnnnnneee...
129965,501,52,330000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,...Onnneee... onnneee...
129966,501,53,338000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Please don't say one again.
129967,501,54,340000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Onnneee.
129968,501,55,343000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, whatever it is, it's not happening."
129969,501,56,348000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! From her show!
129970,501,57,354000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, at least you remembered I like her."
129971,501,58,359000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A pity kiss?! That tears it! I'm gonna call that Paula Paul and give her a piece of my mind!
129972,501,59,366000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The phone's dead.
129973,501,60,368000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Normal, normal, normal, normal... uncharacteristic?! Hm, a chew-through. What could have..."
129974,501,61,379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Aw... I mean arrrgh!
129975,501,62,379000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, he's trying to eat ewectwicity."
129976,501,63,379000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You let this monster into our home! Where he chewed through our one and only phone cord!
129977,501,64,391000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Wait! Maybe Paula Paul left a message.
129978,501,65,394000,Paula Paul,Simpson Home,"Hi, Marge! Paula Paul here, calling live from ""What's On Paula's Windowsill?"", ready to wish you a happy birthday... ...but since you're not home yet, we'll go to commercial and call you right back. Hi, Paula Paul, calling back for Marge Simpson! Kind of a big moment for you, a little surprised you're not picking up! Marge, this is just plain disrespectful. I bumped a segment to do this and you're making me look like an ass! Screw you, Marge Simpson! Don't read my books and don't make my recipes! May my curse follow you beyond the grave!"
129955,501,66,434000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Check it out! It's on TV!
129979,501,67,436000,Paula Paul,Simpson Home,"They're booing you, Marge! An audience full of church groups and marines!"
129980,501,68,441000,Marine,Simpson Home,"Marge, go to Hell, Marge!"
129981,501,69,444000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I think that's enough birthday fun.
129982,501,70,450000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why you little... I'm gonna get... No, Homer. You can't strangle a boy on his mother's birthday. Juries hate that. So instead, boy, I want you to... get in that rabbit cage!"
129983,501,71,466000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No way, man! I'm a free-range kid!"
129984,501,72,468000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No backtalk! In the cage! Now!
129985,501,73,472000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Get in there!
129986,501,74,482000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Son, do you have a minute?"
129987,501,75,485000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've been thinking. I really shouldn't have put you in there and left you there while we were having pizza without you. So I'm gonna let you out with my apologies.
129988,501,76,495000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't wanna come out.
129989,501,77,496000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What?
129990,501,78,498000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I like it in the cage. These cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress.
129991,501,79,504000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boy, get out of that cage!"
129992,501,80,506000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"But it's my home now, sir."
129993,501,81,508000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll poke a broom in there! You know I'm capable of it!
129995,501,83,525000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine.
129996,501,84,528000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Stupid kid.
129997,501,85,533000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This isn't comfortable at all! I don't see how a rabbit could possibly--
130001,501,89,544000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,There. Finished.
130002,501,90,545000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,Awesome revenge -- cutting your Dad's face out of a piece of cardboard!
130003,501,91,550000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"No, you dweeb. It's a stencil. I'm gonna take Homer's ugly face and spread it all over town."
130004,501,92,555000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Treehouse,Can I come? Every vandalism spree needs an obnoxious laugher.
130005,501,93,561000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,You're in.
130011,501,99,588000,Drederick Tatum,First Church of Springfield,"Hey, you punks! What're you doing?"
130013,501,100,592000,Drederick Tatum,First Church of Springfield,"If you wake up my pigeons they're gonna do their business again. And these days there's no newspapers so I have to put down Amazon Kindles. I'm like... it's, it's bankrupting me."
130016,501,103,606000,Homer Simpson,Car,DRI-VING-TO-WORK!
130017,501,104,610000,Homer Simpson,Car,Wait a minute... that guy on the poster looks familiar.
130018,501,105,615000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Don't just stare back at me, come up with a theory! Geez, it's all over the place. Holy Moly."
130019,501,106,627000,Chief Wiggum,Car,"Quiet night. Nothin' but the sound of a spray can and kids laughing, heh."
130021,501,108,633000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Tag, we're it! Springfield has been hit hard by a mysterious graffiti artist and his iconic calling-card, which we have dubbed ""Mr. Fatso."""
130022,501,109,636000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Heard about this thing, boy?"
130023,501,110,644000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no, I'm too concerned with unemployment."
130024,501,111,646000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?"
130025,501,112,649000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, have you seen our stencil budget for this month?"
130026,501,113,653000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not now, Marge!"
130027,501,114,654000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Chief, any leads on this ""Vandal Van Gogh?"""
130028,501,115,658000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"I don't traffic in wordplay, Kent. But I do have a message for Mr. ""Prank Lloyd Wright."""
130029,501,116,663000,Lou,Simpson Home,"Uh, that's architecture, not painting, Chief."
130030,501,117,666000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"They're all artists, Lou! Why don't you open your eyes. Now, as for Mr. Prank Gehry, you may have thumbed your nose at the police...and made yourself into a combination of Robin Hood, Luke Skywalker and, well, every rapper ever...but unless you prove that this wasn't just a one-time spree, and take your controversial art form to the next level, I am not impressed."
130032,501,119,690000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boy, you like this necklace I just bought?"
130033,501,120,692000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Pretty dope, don't you think?"
130036,501,123,696000,Perky Checkout Lady,Swapper Jack's,"So, how do you like working at Swapper Jack's?"
130037,501,124,699000,Snake Jailbird,Swapper Jack's,"Hey, after biting off a man's nose in a prison race war, selling pre-cooked pad thai to soccer moms is pretty darn sweet. Here, I'm not Jailbird. I'm just ""Bird."""
130038,501,125,707000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Swapper Jack's,This is a stick-them-up!
130039,501,126,711000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Swapper Jack's,"Because I have a gun, you must stick them up now! Yes, it is loaded, with bullets that you put in my chest. Now empty the cash drawer! Come on!"
130040,501,127,718000,Snake Jailbird,Swapper Jack's,"Alright, chill, bro. Just chill."
130041,501,128,720000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Swapper Jack's,"I will chill you, right between your damn eyes! For once, the Indian has been outsourced!"
130042,501,129,725000,Snake Jailbird,Swapper Jack's,"Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh. Just give me the piece. You've got a family, dude, or were you lying when you begged for your life?"
130043,501,130,732000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Swapper Jack's,"Sweet Vishnu the Destroyer, what have I done?"
130044,501,131,736000,Snake Jailbird,Swapper Jack's,"It's okay. The jails, they don't have room for us now. Wiggum just makes you do book reports for Ralph. But you have to make 'em so it looks like he's done it. That's kinda the hard part."
130045,501,132,746000,Moe Szyslak,Swapper Jack's,Where's this 2006 Beaujolais that's puttin' me out of business?
130046,501,133,750000,Moe Szyslak,Swapper Jack's,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! There's a white wine? And wha- a Swiss cheese? And a peanut butter? And a potato chip? And toilet paper? Wha-what?!"
130048,501,135,760000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Yo, mysterious pranksters, it's time for dinner."
130049,501,136,764000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Dammit, she knows! Okay, how do we buy your silence?"
130050,501,137,767000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Just throw in a couple of ""fur is murders."""
130051,501,138,767000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,How is fur murder? They're just animals.
130052,501,139,773000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Da-ad!
130053,501,140,774000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Fine. Fur's murder. Everything's murder.
130055,501,142,801000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Bart, you've really grown as an artist."
130056,501,143,803000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Thanks, Milhouse. We make a great team."
130057,501,144,806000,Shepard Fairey,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,Hold it right there!
130058,501,145,807000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,The jerk in the glasses did everything!
130059,501,146,810000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,Need... inhaler!
130061,501,148,816000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Oh God, man! Here, drink this paint thinner."
130062,501,149,825000,Shepard Fairey,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,So you're the two punks who've been tagging the town. Congratulations.
130064,501,151,831000,Shepard Fairey,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,We're street artists.
130066,501,152,834000,Robbie Conal,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Take that, Ronald Reagan! Even in death you're not safe from me!"
130067,501,153,837000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Is that graffiti or are you opening up a ""Mommy and Me?"""
130068,501,154,842000,Kenny Scharf,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"That's it. You just got yourself a place on the wall, kid."
130069,501,155,846000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,Nooo! I've been satirized! Who are you guys?
130070,501,156,851000,Kenny Scharf,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Kenny Scharf, Robbie Conal."
130071,501,157,853000,Shepard Fairey,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,I'm Shepard Fairey.
130072,501,158,854000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,What was that name again?
130073,501,159,857000,Shepard Fairey,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,Shepard Fairey.
130074,501,160,858000,Nelson Muntz,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,Haw haw!
130076,501,162,861000,Shepard Fairey,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"I'm the guy who created the Obama ""Hope"" poster, and the ""Obey"" stickers."
130077,501,163,865000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Man, you're the talkiest bullies I ever met."
130078,501,164,867000,Shepard Fairey,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"We're not bullies, we're artists. And so are you. Urban vandalism is now the hottest art form there is."
130079,501,165,874000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Hey, I got an F in art. Mainly so it would say ""fart"" on my report card."
130080,501,166,879000,Shepard Fairey,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Bart, we would love to set up a gallery show for your street art."
130081,501,167,883000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Well, if it's in a Gallery, how is it street art?"
130082,501,168,885000,Shepard Fairey,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Bart, street art is not about questioning authority."
130083,501,169,888000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Well, I'll have to discuss it with my partner."
130084,501,170,891000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"Bart, say yes! At the opening, I could wear a sports jacket with a t-shirt and jeans!"
130085,501,171,897000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,"First, I'm not sure you have the shoulders for it, and second, maybe we've pushed this far enough."
130086,501,172,904000,Thought Bubble Homer,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,I put you in a rabbit cage! I poked your flab back in! Square by square!
130087,501,173,912000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT,Count me in.
130089,501,175,918000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Apu! It is a miracle!
130090,501,176,921000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,What now? Swapper Jack is reuniting Led Zeppelin in aisle six?
130091,501,177,924000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Swapper Jack's is closing!
130092,501,178,926000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,No! Do not give me false hope like the time they said it was only sextuplets.
130093,501,179,929000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,It is true! Every successful corporation harbors a terrible secret. Theirs is that what they sell as chicken is actually monkey.
130065,501,180,937000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,But the drumsticks...
130094,501,181,938000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Stunted monkey tails.
130095,501,182,940000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,And their chicken pot pie?
130096,501,183,941000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,Monkey pot pie.
130097,501,184,942000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,But how 'bout their rotisserie chi--
130098,501,185,944000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Monkey, monkey, monkey! They scoop them up off the streets of Brazil!"
130099,501,186,948000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"So, we have won. Finally I am lucky at something."
130100,501,187,951000,Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,You were lucky at love.
130101,501,188,953000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Yeah, sure, baby."
130103,501,190,957000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street - Day,"Hey Bart, check this out."
130104,501,191,959000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street - Day,"Look at me, I'm Mr. Fatso! It's funny 'cause it's so preposterous."

130122,501,212,1028000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bed,Pay for your genius!
130124,501,214,1032000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bed,"Oh, what's the use? When a man isn't a hero to his son, he's nothing."
130126,501,217,1049000,Carl Carlson,ART GALLERY - CONTINUOUS,I like what used to make a neighborhood look dangerous now makes it look sophisticated.
130127,501,218,1053000,Lenny Leonard,ART GALLERY - CONTINUOUS,I like how the painting makes more than I do.
130128,501,219,1055000,Lisa Simpson,ART GALLERY - CONTINUOUS,Looks like Dad's not coming.

130132,501,223,1066000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,"C'mon, Dad. You made me mad so I got back at you. How was I to know parents had feelings?"
130133,501,224,1072000,Homer Simpson,GALLERY,"Well, we do."
130134,501,225,1074000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,I wanna show you I understand how you feel. And they say a picture's worth a thousand words:
130135,501,226,1083000,Homer Simpson,GALLERY,You just ruined my car.
130136,501,227,1085000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,Correction. It's worth ten times as much.
130137,501,228,1088000,Homer Simpson,GALLERY,"Five hundred dollars? Woo-hoo! Thanks, boy."
130138,501,229,1091000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,"You're welcome. And from now on, Dad, if anyone laughs at you, they've gotta go through me."
130139,501,230,1097000,Homer Simpson,GALLERY,"Really, anyone? What about the Hulk riding a rhinoceros? Would you stop him from laughing?"
130140,501,231,1103000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,"Wait, is the Hulk laughing, or the rhinoceros?"
130141,501,232,1106000,Homer Simpson,GALLERY,"Both, but the rhinoceros doesn't know why. He's just trying to fit in."
130142,501,233,1110000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,"Dad, it's getting cold out here."
130143,501,234,1112000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,"Art lovers and Bart lovers! First of all, I'd like to thank the good folks at Springfield Arts Daily for setting this up."
130144,501,235,1120000,Pompous Arts Editor,GALLERY,Thank you for bringing us a fresh new voice.
130146,501,237,1122000,Pompous Arts Editor,GALLERY,Yes... yes. Yes.
130147,501,238,1125000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,"As a graffiti artist, there're so many people to thank... people who build walls... nighttime, for being dark..."
130148,501,239,1133000,Chief Wiggum,GALLERY,"Hold it right there, Spray-candy Warhol!"
130149,501,240,1141000,Chief Wiggum,GALLERY,"Bart Simpson, you're under arrest for tagging the town. This overdue art-quake that taught us all a new way of seeing was actually a police department sting!"
130150,501,241,1150000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,It was?
130151,501,242,1152000,Chief Wiggum,GALLERY,Yeah. Do you think people would be stupid enough to pay for something some amateur put on a wall for nothing?
130152,501,243,1157000,C. Montgomery Burns,GALLERY,"Oh, no indeed! Now if I can just get my three million dollars back..."
129956,501,244,1161000,Ron English,GALLERY,No refunds.
130153,501,245,1163000,Waylon Smithers,GALLERY,But he just said the show was a sham.
130154,501,246,1165000,Ron English,GALLERY,"Oh, it is. And I'm just a guy sitting at a table. The only thing that's real is the sign that says ""no refunds."""
130156,501,248,1171000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,"Wait, Chief. I must know... who tipped you off?"
130157,501,249,1175000,Chief Wiggum,GALLERY,"Probably shouldn't tell you this, but it was our undercover officer... Shepard Fairey."
130158,501,250,1182000,Lisa Simpson,GALLERY,You're an undercover cop?
130159,501,251,1184000,Shepard Fairey,GALLERY,"Hey, don't be so surprised. I spent twenty years putting up posters that said ""obey."""
130160,501,252,1186000,Grampa Simpson,GALLERY,"What gives, Daddy-O? I thought you were the dean of the underground scene."
130161,501,253,1194000,Shepard Fairey,GALLERY,I'm not in the business of helping out posers any more. Now I just sell stuff to them.
130162,501,254,1200000,Marge Simpson,GALLERY,"Wait, wait, wait. He's just a boy! Do you have to put him in jail?"
130163,501,255,1206000,Chief Wiggum,GALLERY,"Well, we've gotta teach him a lesson somehow."
130164,501,256,1210000,Homer Simpson,GALLERY,"Chief, I believe I have the answer in the back of my car."
130165,501,257,1220000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,There you go.. thanks for comin' out...
130166,501,258,1226000,Bart Simpson,GALLERY,I need to go to the bathroom.
130167,501,259,1228000,Chief Wiggum,GALLERY,Knock yourself out.
130168,501,260,1231000,Chief Wiggum,GALLERY,"All right, time's up!"
130169,501,261,1234000,Chief Wiggum,GALLERY,"Oh, no! Nooo! No, no, no, no."
