74622,293,58,186000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What? Wait a... That can't be right! Wait, was last night the night we set the clocks ahead eight hours?"
74623,293,59,195000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, it was the night you got loaded at Moe's and the car had to be towed home."
74624,293,60,197000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"If I was that drunk, I would remember it."
74625,293,61,200000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's true. I couldn't even wake you up for work this morning. I had to tell Mr. Burns you had violent diarrhea.
74626,293,62,207000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Couldn't you come up with a less embarrassing lie?
74628,293,63,211000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But you did have violent diarrhea. Nobody open the hallway closet until I say it's okay.
74629,293,64,219000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Do you remember how you got home last night, Dad?"
74630,293,65,221000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of course. It was, uh... some kind of a... light rail."

74635,293,70,237000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, time for my favorite show."
74636,293,71,241000,Network Announcer,Simpson Home,"""MTC: Monkey Trauma Center"" will not be seen tonight, so we may proudly present this much cheaper show..."
74638,293,73,248000,Female Announcer,Simpson Home,Taxicab Conversations...
74639,293,74,252000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I read about this show in Teen Modern Maturity. They film passengers with hidden cameras and catch them at their most uninhibited."
74640,293,75,259000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That explains that.
74641,293,76,266000,Female Cab Driver,Simpson Home,Looks like somebody got down tonight...
74642,293,77,269000,Disco Stu,Simpson Home,"Disco Stu always gets down, baby, 'cuz when the beat is hot, the... Hey, can you keep a secret?"

74644,293,79,278000,Disco Stu,Simpson Home,"I hate disco. It's all I've talked about for so long, that people think I'm a one-note guy."
74645,293,80,285000,Disco Stu,Simpson Home,"It's just getting harder, you know?"
74646,293,81,287000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I had no idea Disco Stu was so complex.
74647,293,82,292000,Cab Driver,Simpson Home,How ya doin'?
74648,293,83,293000,Drunk Homer,Simpson Home,"Talky thing, ain't ya..."
74649,293,84,294000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Another proud moment for the Simpsons.
74650,293,85,297000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't remember anybody telling me I was gonna be on TV.
74651,293,86,301000,Cab Driver,Simpson Home,So what do you do for a living?
74652,293,87,303000,Drunk Homer,Simpson Home,"Oh you know, I'm a guy at a place. How'd you get such a crappy job? You a convict or a junkie?"
74653,293,88,310000,Cab Driver,Simpson Home,Little o' both. You got a family?
74654,293,89,312000,Drunk Homer,Simpson Home,Oh yeah... wife and two or three kids. Can't imagine my life without 'em.
74655,293,90,317000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, you big fooler. Pretending not to remember so you could surprise us."
74656,293,91,322000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I'm pretty great..."
74658,293,92,326000,Drunk Homer,Simpson Home,"At the end of a hard day, there's no better feeling than comin' home to the people you love."
74659,293,93,333000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie..."
74660,293,94,335000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That is so sweet.
74661,293,95,337000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I had no idea, Dad. I just assumed with all the stranglings, you know..."
74662,293,96,342000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That my family isn't the center of my universe? Are you nuts?
74663,293,97,347000,Drunk Homer,Simpson Home,Then there's those other days. Where you just wish you never got married or had kids.
74664,293,98,354000,Drunk Homer,Simpson Home,"One minute, you're a carefree teenager with dreams of being a rock star, or a photographer for Playboy... Then bam, some babe gets her claws in ya...And boom, you got a buncha kids that always need love."
74665,293,99,373000,Drunk Homer,Simpson Home,"So whammo, you get stuck in some boring job where they don't let you play guitar or take pictures of naked women, and all you can do is watch yourself get bald and fat, and kiss your dreams good-bye..."
74666,293,100,391000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I can't believe they took ""Monkey Trauma Center"" off for this."
74667,293,101,399000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lousy family...
74668,293,102,403000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,So I'm just some babe who sank her claws into you?!
74669,293,103,408000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A hot babe...
74671,293,105,411000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Have you always resented us, Dad?"
74672,293,106,413000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I don't resent you, sweetheart. What I was trying to say, and maybe I didn't use the right words, was that marriage is like a coffin and each kid is another nail, but as coffins go..."
74673,293,107,425000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Please don't say any more!
74674,293,108,426000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry we ruined your life, Homer."
74675,293,109,434000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, what have I done?"
74677,293,111,443000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Get in.
74679,293,113,445000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Get in.
74680,293,114,447000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, what's this suitcase for? Are we going on a trip?"
74681,293,115,450000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You are.
74685,293,119,457000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,Where are you taking me?
74686,293,120,459000,Marge Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,A place where you'll never be bothered by your family again.
74687,293,123,473000,Marge Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,"Get out of the car, Homer."
74688,293,124,475000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,You can't just leave me out here! There's not another woman for miles!
74689,293,125,479000,Bart Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,"Sorry, Dad. Maybe now you'll appreciate us..."
74690,293,126,481000,Lisa Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,...while you're spending the week at...

74692,293,128,488000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,"""The Rolling Stones Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp!!"" But I thought you guys were mad at me. For once in my life, I'm confused."
74693,293,129,496000,Marge Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,"We had a family meeting and decided that even though what you said about us was incredibly thoughtless and hurtful, you had a point."
74694,293,130,505000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,Damn straight.
74695,293,131,506000,Marge Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,You work a job you don't like so I'm able to be home with the kids.
74696,293,132,511000,Lisa Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,"And you take me places you hate, like museums, plays, and the Olive Garden."
74697,293,133,515000,Bart Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,"And even though you knew I ratted you out to the IRS, you never busted me on it."
74698,293,134,519000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,You what?
74699,293,135,520000,Marge Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,"So to say thank you for all your sacrifices, we spent our family vacation fund on something that's just for you. Do you like it?"
74700,293,136,529000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,"You guys are the best. I love you, I love you, I love you..."
74701,293,137,532000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,"I'm okay. I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you..."
74703,293,139,541000,Homer Simpson,Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp,"Hey, what gives? Where are all the rock stars?"
74704,293,140,544000,Chief Wiggum,Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp,"I don't know, but it's starting to get dark."

74731,293,167,623000,Homer Simpson,Bunk House,I am so excited I couldn't fall asleep! I even took some pills I found on the floor and still nothing!
74732,293,168,628000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Bunk House,You took pills you found on the floor?
74733,293,169,629000,Homer Simpson,Bunk House,"Uh-huh. Now I'm afraid that if I stop talking, I'll die. Isn't Mick cool? I thought he'd be all like, ""I'm a rock star. Aren't I great?"" But he's just like you or me or Jesus over there."
74735,293,171,644000,Campers,CAMP,Guitar! Guitar! / Can I have a guitar?! / I want a guitar! Definitely a guitar!

74777,293,214,782000,Tom Petty,CAMP,Lyrics are the hardest part of songwriting. But when you come up with something meaningful and heartfelt...
74778,293,215,788000,Homer Simpson,CAMP,Bor-ing.
74779,293,216,789000,Tom Petty,CAMP,Will you stop saying that?
74780,293,217,791000,Homer Simpson,CAMP,But rock stars are supposed to be about drinking and getting drunk and boozing it up.
74782,293,218,795000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,CAMP,And girls that have legs and know how to use them.
74783,293,219,798000,Otto Mann,CAMP,"And, and why I can't drive 55."
