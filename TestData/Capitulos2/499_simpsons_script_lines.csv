129449,499,1,70000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,How'd you get so many more Valentines? I got one from Lisa and one from my optometrist.
129450,499,2,91000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That's a bill.
129451,499,3,92000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,No! It's got a love stamp!
129452,499,4,94000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe we should just watch TV.
129457,499,8,114000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Now son, you know Itchy and Scratchy give you night terrors."
129458,499,9,118000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Last night you had the night terrors.
129459,499,10,121000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I dreamt I got fired from that job I dreamt I got the night before."
129460,499,11,127000,Announcer,Simpson Home,"Welcome to ""MythCrackers,"" where we debunk rumors, legends, and all religions except the Jesus-based ones."
129461,499,12,137000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's a beautiful afternoon. No TV.
129462,499,13,140000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Luckily, she doesn't know that our viewing platforms are... multi."
129464,499,15,140000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,No TV on the computer!
129466,499,17,152000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,No TV on a smart phone!
129468,499,19,156000,Jamie,Gas Station,"Tonight, we take on the classic myth that a cat will always land on its feet."
129469,499,20,160000,Adam,Gas Station,"And we didn't want to hurt a real cat, so we took this Build-A-Bear carcass..."
129470,499,21,164000,Jamie,Gas Station,"...stuffed it with ballistic gel, shot it from a twenty foot barrel steam cannon..."
129471,499,22,176000,Adam,Gas Station,...and made a scatter plot of the remains. Boo-yah!
129472,499,23,179000,Jamie,Gas Station,What was it we trying to prove again?
129473,499,24,181000,Adam,Gas Station,"Don't know, don't care!"
129474,499,25,186000,Milhouse Van Houten,Gas Station,"Hey, Bart, why don't we become MythCrackers? I bet those guys get so many valentines."
129475,499,26,193000,Bart Simpson,Gas Station,"That might be a good idea, but then again, you thought it up. Eh, why not?"
129476,499,27,197000,Milhouse Van Houten,Gas Station,"Okay, first myth. Using a cell phone at a gas station is dangerous."
129477,499,28,207000,Milhouse Van Houten,Gas Station,"Well, at least I'm cool now!"
129480,499,31,223000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why does the guy have to do everything for the girl on Valentine's Day?
129481,499,32,226000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"We show girls love on Valentine's Day, and they let us blow stuff up on the Fourth of July. I just pray they never fall on the same day."
129482,499,33,236000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, read this."
129483,499,34,238000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""My darling husband. This Valentine's Day, I have a present for you..."""
129484,499,35,240000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Thanks for reading it to me.
129485,499,36,245000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My pleasure.
129486,499,37,246000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"...I want you to have a fun night doing guy stuff. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine."
129456,499,38,249000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Marge, this is brilliant."
129487,499,39,257000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I just think we should do things every day to show our love for each other.
129489,499,41,264000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's okay, Homie. Go. Have a good time. Take Bart with you!"
129490,499,42,269000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Which one do you want?
129492,499,44,273000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BATTING CAGE,"You have the most wonderful Mom in the world, which is why I have no idea where she is or what she's doing."
129493,499,45,281000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD BATTING CAGE,"That's right, sucker! It's Valentine's Day, and I've got a date with some fastballs!"
129494,499,46,288000,Guy Driving By,SPRINGFIELD BATTING CAGE,"Lucky bastard. I mean, my darling, I was looking at myself in the side view mirror."
129496,499,48,290000,Guy Driving By,SPRINGFIELD BATTING CAGE,I hope you hit one off the handle and your hands sting!
129499,499,51,302000,Marge Simpson,Luigi's,"Lisa, I love spending mother-daughter time with you. We have so much in common, like... um... Oh no! Someone's about to put the thousand island ladle into the vinaigrette!"
129500,499,52,373000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,"Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to be nosey."
129501,499,53,376000,Nick,Luigi's,"Don't apologize. It was dark, then a light came through the crack. The light was you."
129502,499,54,381000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,You have a way with words.
129503,499,55,383000,Nick,Luigi's,Words are just nails we use to build ideas. Care to continue this discussion at the dessert table?
129504,499,56,389000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,"Mom, I'm gonna look at the desserts!"
129505,499,57,391000,Marge Simpson,Luigi's,Don't panic. This can be separated out. Quick! Does anyone have a centrifuge?!
129506,499,58,398000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Luigi's,All I wanted was one romantic night.
129507,499,59,406000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Luigi's,"Aw, for glyvin--"
129508,499,60,406000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,"Yep, you're the crack head. What dessert are you gonna get?"
129509,499,61,412000,Nick,Luigi's,"I'll toss this fork into the air and wherever it lands, that's what I'll eat. Hiya!"
129510,499,62,418000,Nick,Luigi's,"As Hemingway said, ""the shortest answer is doing the thing."""
129511,499,63,418000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,"Um, I should probably get back to my Mom. By the way, my name is--"
129512,499,64,427000,Nick,Luigi's,"No! When I first hear your name, I want to be somewhere important: the peak of Kilimanjaro... the back of a vaporetto in Venice... the--"
129514,499,65,435000,Lisa Simpson,Luigi's,Lisa. Now this is the most important place in the world.
129515,499,66,438000,Luigi,Luigi's,Now that's a spicy meet-cute!
129516,499,67,442000,Marge Simpson,Luigi's,Lisa?
129517,499,68,444000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"Hey, Midge! You want a piece of my ziti?"
129518,499,69,449000,Moe Szyslak,Luigi's,"That cost a nickel, but we'll settle up later."
129520,499,71,457000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Today we tackle the most terrifying ""myth"" in the history of Springfield Elementary: that if you press E-8 on the candy machine, you get electrocuted and die."
129522,499,73,466000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,Did you invent a robot hand to touch the buttons?
129523,499,74,470000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Something like that.
129524,499,75,482000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Ladies and gentlemen, that myth is... cracked!"
129525,499,76,486000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Candy cigarettes? I didn't know they made these!
129526,499,77,490000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,They were discontinued because they were thought to encourage impressionable children to smoke.
129527,499,78,495000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,How dumb do they think we are?
129528,499,79,506000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I can quit any time I want!
129530,499,81,514000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,"This place is great! If I cover my peripheral vision, I feel like I'm in France!"
129531,499,82,541000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,Ew. How 'bout I'll just look at you.
129532,499,83,547000,Frida,Springfield,El Puerco! I must break up with you!
129533,499,84,551000,Frida,Springfield,"Oh, but the hand-holding is just too good!"
129534,499,85,558000,Waiter,Springfield,Your juice boxes.
129535,499,86,562000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,It's... nice.
129536,499,87,564000,Nick,Springfield,Perhaps we can try a little harder... for the lady.
129537,499,88,567000,Waiter,Springfield,Such is the life of the juice boxi√©r.
129539,499,90,571000,Otto Mann,The Needle Exchange,Oh.
129541,499,92,576000,Jerri,SEWING PARLOR,"Marge, since you're by yourself, would you like to borrow one of my twins?"
129542,499,93,580000,Sherri Mackleberry,SEWING PARLOR,But remember: the one you pick may not be the one you get.
129543,499,94,587000,Lisa Simpson,SEWING PARLOR,"Mom, I'm sorry I'm late! No excuse, I just forgot all about you. Huh? I'm not sure that patch really represents who I am right now."
129545,499,95,597000,Marge Simpson,SEWING PARLOR,"Well, if you'd been here for the design phase, you could've registered that objection. Now start quilting!"
129546,499,96,605000,Marge Simpson,SEWING PARLOR,Now there's three of you?
129547,499,97,606000,3rd Twin,SEWING PARLOR,Or maybe you're losing your mind.
129549,499,99,618000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"According to the wisdom of our elders...if you go all the way around on the swing, your body will turn inside-out."
129550,499,100,628000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Cool, now my beauty will be on the outside."
129551,499,101,641000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"He's still inside-in, folks! And just to prove it:"
129554,499,104,694000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""She had now come to the part that Peter Pan hated. 'I do like a mother's love,' said Tootles..."""
129555,499,105,697000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I have a crush!"
129556,499,106,701000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Is it on your father? Little girls always get crushes on their fathers.
129557,499,107,706000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Somehow I missed that phase.
129558,499,108,708000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Almost there, boy. Almost there. Almost there."
129559,499,109,710000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm getting' closer. It's just within reach.
129560,499,110,714000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The boy I like is Hemingway-esque!
129561,499,111,717000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay. Let's ""esque"" him to dinner."
129562,499,112,717000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, Nick here in our house. I hope it doesn't make him think less of me."
129563,499,113,726000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This house is not an embarrassment!
129564,499,114,731000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Usually when I say something like that, something extremely embarrassing happens. I'm gonna say goodnight before it does."
129565,499,115,743000,Nick,Simpson Home,Well. Lisa didn't tell me that she had a sister.
129567,499,117,748000,Nick,Simpson Home,Or a daughter.
129568,499,118,751000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my. I don't know if anyone's ever kissed my hand before."
129569,499,119,756000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, your arms are lanky. It's kind of a long trip down there."
129570,499,120,760000,Nick,Simpson Home,My mother said I should bring some wine.
129571,499,121,761000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hm, the French have gotten into the wine game. Good luck catchin' up with the big boys."
129572,499,122,768000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll get a couple glasses.
129573,499,123,772000,Nick,Simpson Home,"Mrs. Simpson, I'd like your permission to take your daughter to the Doritos Nutrition Fair at the school gym."
129544,499,124,777000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well. I usually take Lisa, but I can just go with Bart."
129361,499,125,781000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Wait. What? No!
129574,499,126,783000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're going with me! But Lisa, after this, I don't want you to spend any more time with this boy. If you do, it'll mean you're a separate person from me."
148668,499,127,792000,Marge's Thoughts,Simpson Home,That'll stop her from seeing him.
129576,499,129,801000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Mom can't appreciate the kind of boy Nick is, because although I love Dad, he's a completely different creature."
129577,499,130,808000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Yeah, there's a lot of fish in the sea, but she picked out a drunken walrus. But you and this Nick fella sound to me like the story of Pyramus and Thisbe."
129578,499,131,817000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Which inspired Romeo and Juliet, which inspired West Side Story, which inspired me to say ""eh."""
129579,499,132,817000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Pyramus and Thisbe were lovers from ancient times!
129580,499,133,827000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,They lived next door but their families despised each other.
129581,499,134,830000,Pyramus' Father,Springfield Retirement Castle,"I don't like to babble on, but I sure do like Babylon--"
129582,499,135,838000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,The lovers had to whisper their sweet nothings through a crack in the wall.
129583,499,136,842000,Thisbe,Springfield Retirement Castle,Wait a minute!
129584,499,137,843000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Nick and I met talking through a crack between two booths!
129585,499,138,848000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,And the power of that forbidden smooch made them love each other forever.
129586,499,139,861000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Man, that company thinks every time it adds a wisecracking parrot to a story, they own it."
129587,499,140,866000,Parrot,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Talk to the wing, Thisbe!"
129588,499,141,868000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Grampa, would you help take me on a foolish romantic mission?"
129589,499,142,873000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Let me check my schedule.
129590,499,143,874000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,That might work... I think I'm free... Tuesday's open...
129591,499,144,878000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"You got it, kiddo."
129593,499,146,882000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Legend has it a girl named Eleanor Mackie drowned on this very spot. Now they say if you call her name three times while looking in this mirror, you will die. Milhouse?"
129594,499,147,900000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Eleanor Mackie. Eleanor Mackie. Eleanor Mackie!
129596,499,149,903000,Lunchlady Dora,Springfield Elementary School,"Aw, gimme a break."
129598,499,150,908000,Lunchlady Dora,Springfield Elementary School,The one day the lunch-lady decides to wash her hands...
129599,499,151,912000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Okay. That was the last school myth and it's officially... cracked.
129600,499,152,916000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"So school is just... everything we see? That's sad, man."
129601,499,153,927000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You into cigars now?
129602,499,154,928000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,It's a Twix.
129603,499,155,930000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I can't be the guy who killed everybody's fun. That's Skinner's job.
129604,499,156,934000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't blame me. You killed the fun, fun-killer."
129606,499,158,941000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Milhouse, I've just figured out a way to make school cool again."
129607,499,159,944000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,American Girl doll day? You might be surprised at the number of boys who have American Girl dolls. It's not weird 'cause they're historic figures.
129608,499,160,959000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I have found one last myth to destroy -- the so-called legend of Groundskeeper Were-Willie.
129609,499,161,966000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Prepare to be disappointed!
129611,499,163,978000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Gentlemen, we just created a myth."
129612,499,164,981000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Now there's a myth about me I'd like you to correct: I'm not from Edinburgh! I'm also not from Glasgow! I'm from Kirkwall in Orkney! Me father was an Uppie! And me mother was a Doonie! It tore the family apart!
129614,499,166,1006000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,Mulberry Island. We'll kiss there at sunset.
129615,499,167,1006000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,Ow!
129616,499,168,1011000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Street,Pull over. You're wanted for grand theft retirement home -- the TV remote is in your pocket!
129618,499,170,1017000,Voice From Tv,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Hola! Yo soy Maury Povich! Uno de estos siete hombres es el verdadero padre de este ""crack baby."""
129619,499,171,1019000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,Everyone's speaking Spanish!
129620,499,172,1027000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"If we stop now, we'll never make it there by sunset."
129621,499,173,1032000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Run, young lovers! I'll take care of the cops!"
129622,499,174,1035000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,But Grampa...
129623,499,175,1035000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Go ahead! I ain't afraid of no prison!
129624,499,176,1042000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Sir, we're gonna bring you back to your retirement home."
129513,499,177,1044000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Noooo!
129597,499,178,1050000,Lou,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Chief, we heard gunfire!"
129625,499,179,1051000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Relax! It's just my back...and my hip...spinal column...
129627,499,181,1061000,Nick,COVE,"Thanks for the ride, Mr. Spuckler."
129628,499,182,1063000,Cletus Spuckler,COVE,"Yeah, I don't normally approve of out-breeding, but you two seem nice."
129629,499,183,1069000,Lisa Simpson,COVE,We could take this boat.
129630,499,184,1077000,Nick,COVE,I don't know... This water's a little choppy.
129631,499,185,1079000,Lisa Simpson,COVE,I thought you rowed up the Zambezi without a guide.
129632,499,186,1083000,Nick,COVE,Right. Right.
129634,499,188,1091000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"So, Dad, what kind of stupid idea did you put in Lisa's head?"
129635,499,189,1094000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Car,"She wants to steal a kiss, like Pyramus and Thisbe."
129636,499,190,1098000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Did you say ""ultimate Frisbee?"""
129637,499,191,1100000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Car,No.
129641,499,195,1121000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Women and shoes, am I right?"
129642,499,196,1130000,Nick,Simpson Car,Your hands are really cold.
129643,499,197,1134000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"You know, you were a lot more adventurous at the dessert table."
129644,499,198,1138000,Nick,Simpson Car,I sure was! I'm allergic to chocolate!
129645,499,199,1139000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,Shut up and kiss me.
129646,499,200,1144000,Hadley,Simpson Car,"Lisa, it's Hadley Richardson, Hemingway's first wife. Trust me, you're making a big mistake."
129647,499,201,1150000,Hadley,Simpson Car,"If you don't believe me, ask Pauline Pfeiffer."
129648,499,202,1153000,Pauline Pfeiffer,Simpson Car,I was his second wife. There were two more after me. Tortured writers make horrible husbands.
129649,499,203,1159000,Marlin,Simpson Car,"At least you chose to be with him. I was just swimmin' along, mindin' my own business. Next thing I know, I was hanging on his wall! He used to pee in the fireplace!"
129650,499,204,1171000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Wait, how long is this love for again?"
129651,499,205,1174000,Nick,Simpson Car,Eternity!
129652,499,206,1175000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Hm, that's a pretty long time."
129653,499,207,1177000,Nick,Simpson Car,Now my lips are getting cold.
