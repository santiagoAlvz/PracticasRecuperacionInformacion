140931,542,1,48000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"...And it's for all these reasons, and more, that the Kingdom of Moab is the least interesting in the Bible. Amen."
140932,542,2,133000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,Amen! We're done!
140933,542,3,136000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Allow me to introduce our guest speaker...
140935,542,5,136000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"...from our ill-advised mission in Indonesia, the Rev. Kartawijaya."
140936,542,6,145000,Rev. Kartawijaya,First Church of Springfield,"I know how you feel, young man!"
140938,542,8,148000,Rev. Kartawijaya,First Church of Springfield,"The children in my village are just like you. One boy, named Sumadi, never comes to church."
140939,542,9,154000,Rev. Kartawijaya,First Church of Springfield,"He is always tying the monkeys' tails together and yelling ""tiger is gone"" when in fact the tiger is there."
140940,542,10,161000,Rev. Kartawijaya,First Church of Springfield,"Unfortunately, Sumadi is sick now."
140941,542,11,165000,Carl Carlson,First Church of Springfield,What?! Sumadi has a problem?
140942,542,12,167000,Rev. Kartawijaya,First Church of Springfield,"Sumadi... and others equally doe-eyed... need urgent medical treatment. After all, we are all just children of Allah. I mean, God. Sorry, recent convert."
140943,542,13,178000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,Poor Sumadi. Born in such a terrible country.
140944,542,14,182000,Rev. Kartawijaya,First Church of Springfield,Now wait a minute...
140945,542,15,183000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"But, good news. To help him we will now have a second collection."
140947,542,17,189000,Lenny Leonard,First Church of Springfield,Wasn't our sympathetic nodding enough?
140948,542,18,191000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"Mom, can I have some money?"
140949,542,19,193000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"I'm sorry, honey. I'm all out. I spent all I had lighting that candle for Great Aunt Betty."
140951,542,21,199000,Shauna Chalmers,CANDLE RACK,I hope that wasn't somebody's Aunt Betty or something.
140952,542,22,203000,Bart Simpson,CANDLE RACK,Dad? Please? For Sumadi?
140953,542,23,206000,Homer Simpson,CANDLE RACK,"Sorry son, I only have twenties. And if God needs money, why doesn't he just write another Bible? The first one sold pretty well."
140954,542,24,212000,Ned Flanders,CANDLE RACK,Does anyone remember when it was considered rude to talk in church?
140955,542,25,216000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,CANDLE RACK,"Pipe down, Ned."
140956,542,26,220000,Bart Simpson,CANDLE RACK,Please!
140957,542,27,224000,Homer Simpson,CANDLE RACK,"All right, son... but you have to pay me back."
140958,542,28,230000,Bart Simpson,CANDLE RACK,Life is good.
140959,542,29,232000,Homer Simpson,CANDLE RACK,Do you have my money?
140960,542,30,232000,Bart Simpson,CANDLE RACK,What?
140961,542,31,233000,Homer Simpson,CANDLE RACK,Do you have my money?
140962,542,32,234000,Bart Simpson,CANDLE RACK,How could I?
140963,542,33,236000,Homer Simpson,CANDLE RACK,"Right, right, too soon. Do you have my money?"
140966,542,36,242000,Homer Simpson,Restaurant,"Seriously, do you have my money?"
140760,542,38,244000,Homer Simpson,LITTLE LEAGUE BALL FIELD,Where's my money?
140968,542,41,254000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Where's my money?
140970,542,43,256000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Where's... my... mon... ey?
140972,542,45,261000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"It's been a rough patch, man. Hope you got something to cheer me up."
140973,542,46,265000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Bedroom,"Well, there is one fun fact I've been saving for an emergency situation. Did you know there really was a Duncan Hines?"
140974,542,47,273000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Where's my money? Do you have my money? Where is it? You know, if you had the money, I'm right here. Do you have the money?"
140976,542,49,280000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, quit badgering the boy."
140977,542,50,283000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Pressure's how you make your beloved diamonds, Marge."
140978,542,51,287000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't have any diamonds.
140979,542,52,288000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Quit pressuring me!
140981,542,54,292000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Money, money. I need money!"
140982,542,55,295000,Devil Kid,Springfield Elementary School,Would you eat anything for money?
140983,542,56,297000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I guess. Who are you?
140984,542,57,299000,Devil Kid,Springfield Elementary School,"School play. ""Damn Yankees."""
140985,542,58,302000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Children of the playground! I will eat anything for money! Except money!
140986,542,59,309000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,I'll give you a quarter if you eat my gum.
140987,542,60,313000,Terri Mackleberry,Springfield Elementary School,I'll give you another if you eat mine!
140988,542,61,317000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Here's some orthodontic wax!
140989,542,62,319000,Kid With Lisp,Springfield Elementary School,And thome thinnamon!
140990,542,63,320000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,St. John's Wort!
140991,542,64,324000,Otto Mann,Springfield Elementary School,And here's something that'll make you forget about the other stuff.
140992,542,65,328000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Ay carumba. So, what else ya got?"
140993,542,66,333000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"All right, Simpson. Twenty big ones says you're not messed-up enough to eat... this!"
140994,542,67,342000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No Bart, no. Do it and you'll always be known as the kid who ate the dead frog."
140995,542,68,349000,Frog,Springfield Elementary School,Where's my money! Get my money! Money-money-money-money-money...
140996,542,69,365000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Easiest money I ever...
141000,542,71,368000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Son, by rights I should be playing banjo at your funeral. That frog was filled to the gills with formaldehyde, a highly toxic poison."
141001,542,72,371000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,"Here's your money, dad."
141002,542,73,378000,Homer Simpson,Hospital,What? Did you owe me some money?
141003,542,74,380000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"And Homer, here's your bill for four thousand dollars."
141005,542,76,384000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Where's my money? You got my money? Where's my money? Seriously, where's my money?"
141008,542,79,395000,Girl,School Bus,Ew! It's the kid who ate the dead frog.
141009,542,80,404000,Nelson Muntz,School Bus,Herbivore!
141010,542,81,406000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,That's someone who eats plants.
141011,542,82,407000,Nelson Muntz,School Bus,I named the frog Herb!
141012,542,83,410000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,Even you won't sit with me?
141013,542,84,412000,Milhouse Van Houten,School Bus,"Bart, if you sit here, I'll be the boy who sat next to the boy who ate the frog. And I'm already the boy who shared a comb with a boy who threw up on the boy who wet his pants at the winter carnival. P.S. I would've given you the money."
141016,542,87,442000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,What's the matter? Frog in your throat?
141017,542,88,444000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You're the ones that paid me to eat it.
141018,542,89,446000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Elementary School,"All we hear is ribbit, ribbit!"
141019,542,90,452000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,You said this was a simple bullying job!
141020,542,91,459000,Diggs,Springfield Elementary School,"Diggs and Freedom, at your service. Diggs is short for Digby."
141021,542,92,462000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Thanks. I'm the kid that ate the frog.
141022,542,93,465000,Diggs,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, so you're the reason I had to dissect a Muppet in biology today."
141023,542,94,472000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Thanks for the help, man."
141024,542,95,472000,Diggs,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, you're welcome. At least, from me. There's no way to say what the bird thinks, or even if he thinks, really."
141025,542,96,479000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Wait! Wait! Wait! Who the hell are you?
141026,542,97,481000,Diggs,Springfield Elementary School,I transferred here a few months ago.
141027,542,98,483000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,To this school? On purpose? Even after Springfield Montessori opened across the street?
141028,542,99,493000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,That place is really in your face.
140998,542,100,495000,Diggs,Springfield Elementary School,I like the lack of attention. Especially in here.
141030,542,102,507000,Bart Simpson,Falconry Clubhouse,This school has a falconry club? No way.
141031,542,103,510000,Diggs,Falconry Clubhouse,I resuscitated it.
141032,542,104,512000,Diggs,Falconry Clubhouse,"I'm president, secretary-treasurer, and faculty adviser. That took a lot of fancy paperwork but it was worth it to be left alone."
141033,542,105,520000,Bart Simpson,Falconry Clubhouse,Can I join?
141034,542,106,522000,Diggs,Falconry Clubhouse,"Hmm, I'll have to check with Freedom."
141035,542,107,525000,Diggs,Falconry Clubhouse,Habemus Papam! We have a poop! It's white! You're in!
141037,542,109,531000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Looks like the falconry club's back from the dead!
141038,542,110,535000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Can the Esperanto Society be far behind? I mean... Ĉu la Esperanto-Societo esti multe malantaŭ?
141039,542,111,542000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Two languages and somehow no one will talk to you.
141040,542,112,546000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Ĝi estas vera. Mi tre soleca.
141041,542,113,550000,Diggs,Springfield Elementary School,The first thing to learn about falcons is how beautiful they are in flight.
141042,542,114,558000,Diggs,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't fret, he'll be back."
141043,542,115,561000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,There's my Sky Gramma!
141045,542,117,563000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart's usually first in line for Taco night, but now he's ""muy tarde."" Is it all right to say ""tarde?"""
141046,542,118,571000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, you've said it twice, Marge. You're in pretty deep."
141047,542,119,575000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer!
141048,542,120,576000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ten minute rule.
141049,542,121,578000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Lisa!
141050,542,122,579000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What? A rule's a rule.
141052,542,124,582000,Diggs,Springfield Elementary School,There he is!
141053,542,125,582000,Diggs,Springfield Elementary School,He is just riding that thermal.
141054,542,126,587000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You were right about watching him fly.
141055,542,127,589000,Diggs,Springfield Elementary School,"I thought you'd get it. Seat-backs and tray tables, Bart. We're coming in for a landing!"
141056,542,128,596000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Wow. You don't know how impressive that is to a boy whose dad can't even get the dog to sit.
141058,542,130,601000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sit. Sit. Sit! Sit! SIT!!!
141059,542,131,608000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't know what that is, but it's not sitting!"
141060,542,132,612000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Where could Bart be?
141062,542,133,615000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I saw him heading across the field after school with a kid a little bit older and undoubtedly wiser.
141063,542,134,620000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I know what that means. There comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. Finally! I was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler."
141064,542,135,632000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart Simpson, at your service."
141065,542,136,635000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"More like ""at your six-pack,"" am I right? It's okay if you need to take a little nap."
141066,542,137,641000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why would I want a nap?
141067,542,138,642000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because you're so drunk you can barely keep it together!
141068,542,139,646000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I wasn't drinking. I was learning that nature isn't a complete waste of space.
141069,542,140,650000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That doesn't sound like you.
141070,542,141,651000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.
141071,542,142,656000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I met this kid. A little older, kind of strange. I don't think other people get him, but I just wanna hang out with him all the time."
141072,542,143,663000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's even better than I thought... you've found your Moe Szyslak! In just a few short years you'll be getting your version of baked on your version of pot listening to your version of Journey.
141073,542,144,678000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What's he doing?
141076,542,147,685000,Diggs,Woods,"Now when he lands, you'll feed him, so he has positive associations with you."
141077,542,148,691000,Diggs,Woods,Don't worry. He's only bitten off one of my fingers.
141079,542,150,695000,Diggs,Woods,Just goofing on you. This is the finger he bit off.
141080,542,151,702000,Diggs,Woods,"If he starts to carry you off, slip out of the glove. Now tell him to fly."
141081,542,152,706000,Bart Simpson,Woods,"Fly! Fly! C'mon, man! Do the wing thing!"
141082,542,153,712000,Bart Simpson,Woods,I did it! He did it! We did it!
141083,542,154,714000,Diggs,Woods,"Yes, Bart, that is how you conjugate the verb ""to do."" Well done."
141085,542,156,723000,Disco Stu,Woods,Hey! Bring back my bling!
141086,542,157,749000,Krusty the Clown,Woods,Give that back! All I've got is a hole in my face!
141087,542,158,752000,Krusty the Clown,Woods,Uncle Krusty's back!
141089,542,160,761000,Bart Simpson,TREETOP,Whoa! Did you teach him to do that?
141091,542,161,763000,Diggs,TREETOP,Nobody could communicate that -- except maybe Gerard Manley Hopkins:
141092,542,162,768000,Diggs,TREETOP,"""I caught this morning morning's minion, kingdom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding / Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding / High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing!"""
141093,542,163,768000,Bart Simpson,TREETOP,Wow.
141094,542,164,784000,Bart Simpson,TREETOP,I've already eaten.
141095,542,165,786000,Diggs,TREETOP,"Hey, you want to see something really cool?"
141096,542,166,789000,Bart Simpson,TREETOP,Is a falcon's training leash called a creance? Yes!
141097,542,167,803000,Bart Simpson,TREETOP,Say something so I'll know you're not hurt.
141098,542,168,806000,Diggs,TREETOP,I'm really hurt.
141099,542,169,806000,Bart Simpson,TREETOP,Phew!
141102,542,172,812000,Diggs,Hospital Room,"Bartholomew! Good to see you, old sport. Where's Freedom?"
141103,542,173,816000,Bart Simpson,Hospital Room,"Well... my Dad said don't bring home anymore dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds."
141105,542,175,827000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay. In your terms, points are like mice."
141107,542,177,831000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't interrupt! I just thought it would be nice if we shared an interest.
141109,542,179,839000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,You Korean girls know what a soldier likes.
141110,542,180,844000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine! But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
141111,542,181,847000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, the Eagles and the Falcons. Tell me you're not interested in that."
141112,542,182,853000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I could fly too if I didn't have a wife and three kids!
141114,542,184,857000,Bart Simpson,Hospital Room,"Hey, you've had a lot of visitors."
141115,542,185,859000,Diggs,Hospital Room,"No, I signed them myself. They're people I would've liked to come visit."
141116,542,186,866000,Bart Simpson,Hospital Room,Listen... what happened in that tree?
141117,542,187,869000,Diggs,Hospital Room,"Um... you want the truth? Of course you do. You're like Diogenes, but with slingshot in place of lamp."
141118,542,188,878000,Diggs,Hospital Room,I wanted to fly.
141119,542,189,881000,Diggs,Hospital Room,"I know it sounds a little crazy now, but I suddenly thought maybe we can all fly, but somehow we've forgotten that we can."
141120,542,190,887000,Bart Simpson,Hospital Room,"You don't still think that, do you?"
141061,542,191,889000,Diggs,Hospital Room,"Hey, I'm not flying anywhere with this broken wing."
141121,542,192,894000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital Room,"Bart, here's another doctor that would like a few words with this young man."
141122,542,193,898000,Bart Simpson,Hospital Room,This hospital has another doctor?
141124,542,195,905000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,So they're transferring him to another hospital.
141125,542,196,908000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I hope he gets out soon and takes his bird back. I don't care for how it circles the cat."
141126,542,197,916000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,He's just riding the thermals from Dad's butt.
141127,542,198,919000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,At least someone in this family is using them.
141128,542,199,922000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I never heard of this new hospital so I looked it up and printed it out.
141130,542,201,927000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Can I visit him tomorrow?
141131,542,202,928000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know Bart. This is one of those... Arkham Asylum-type hospitals.
141132,542,203,935000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Diggs isn't cuckoo!
141133,542,204,936000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. You know, Dweebler."
141134,542,205,943000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Milhouse abandoned me.
141135,542,206,946000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So, why can't I go there?"
141136,542,207,948000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, if this is what I think it is, it's not a place we should ever, ever take a little boy."
141137,542,208,954000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Then why is Diggs there?
141138,542,209,955000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because it's his home forever.
141140,542,211,961000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"You know, Bart, just because Diggs is a little different doesn't mean he's not a good person."
141141,542,212,967000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,What would you know about friends like Diggs?
141142,542,213,969000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I have about eight of them.
141143,542,214,971000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,So how do we fix him?
141144,542,215,973000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Oh, Bart... Diggs' problems don't have easy fixes."
141145,542,216,977000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,What kind of cheer-up talk is this?
141146,542,217,979000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Well... sometimes it helps to know people feel for you. Want a hug?
141147,542,218,988000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,You hug the bedpost. Then I hug the bedpost. That way we never hug each other.
141149,542,220,1004000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, Simpson. I heard bird boy got a new cage -- one with rubber bars."

141157,542,229,1029000,Diggs,FALCONRY CLUB,The rumors of my bonkertude have been greatly exaggerated. D.S.M. Five indicates paranoid schizophrenia. But that work is mired in controversy. Mired.
141158,542,230,1038000,Bart Simpson,FALCONRY CLUB,I knew you'd escape! Were you carried out by a flock of falcons?
141159,542,231,1041000,Diggs,FALCONRY CLUB,I got a one-day pass.
141160,542,232,1043000,Bart Simpson,FALCONRY CLUB,Were falcons involved in any way?

141163,542,235,1052000,Diggs,FALCONRY CLUB,I'm fine. My meds won't wear off till tonight. Then I'll have Freedom tear you to shreds.
141164,542,236,1062000,Bart Simpson,FALCONRY CLUB,"No offense, but when a crazy guy pretends to be crazy, it's not funny."
141165,542,237,1067000,Diggs,FALCONRY CLUB,You're discounting all talk radio.

141170,542,242,1091000,Bart Simpson,COMPETITION AREA,Why am I not surprised the only sport you do is one where a bird brings you food?
141171,542,243,1096000,Comic Book Guy,COMPETITION AREA,A falcon's greatest joy is to serve its master.
141172,542,244,1099000,Comic Book Guy's Bird,COMPETITION AREA,Fatso!

141183,542,255,1144000,Diggs,COMPETITION AREA,Wherever he wants. He's free now.
141184,542,256,1146000,Cletus Spuckler,COMPETITION AREA,"If you see the stork what brings us babies, kill it!"
141185,542,257,1151000,Diggs,COMPETITION AREA,"Now Bart, I'm afraid one-day passes don't last forever. And I'm probably not going to get another one for quite a while."

141187,542,259,1163000,Diggs,COMPETITION AREA,"It's all yours, Mr. President."
141188,542,260,1165000,Bart Simpson,COMPETITION AREA,"Well, I guess some delicate birds are safer in a cage."
141189,542,261,1170000,Diggs,COMPETITION AREA,"I had thought of it as a therapeutic milieu, but now ""cage"" is stuck in my head, so thanks. And thanks for being my friend."
141190,542,262,1186000,Milhouse Van Houten,COMPETITION AREA,"Bart, when I pushed you away, I was really pushing away the thought of losing you."
141191,542,263,1192000,Bart Simpson,COMPETITION AREA,How long did it take you to think that up?
141192,542,264,1194000,Milhouse Van Houten,COMPETITION AREA,Two hours with the therapist.
141193,542,265,1196000,Bart Simpson,COMPETITION AREA,I'll take that.
