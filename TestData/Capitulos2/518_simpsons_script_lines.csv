He's up the stairs but is now being buffeted by the breeze... And they've put some rocks in his pocket and... we're ready to go.
134553,518,4,180000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"To decide how much your electricity bills will rise, I've assembled a team of distinguished economists...and placed plausible rate hike percentages on their backs."

134555,518,6,200000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Notice how the Keynesians climb trees while the Austrian school economists hide under rocks.
134556,518,7,206000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That is fascinating.
134557,518,8,212000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"And there you have it, folks -- rates will rise a healthy seventeen percent. And now, to help you disperse..."
134558,518,9,218000,Kirk Van Houten,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Let me guess. You're gonna release the hounds again.
134559,518,10,221000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, don't be silly. Release the radioactive steam!"

134569,518,20,263000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"We can keep the shrimp de-veiner though, right?"
134570,518,21,265000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm afraid not.
134571,518,22,268000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And this goes too.
134572,518,23,271000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Good riddance. When I found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol, I really lost interest."
134548,518,25,277000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Children, we can no longer afford to use anything electric. However, we will still be able to watch today's film thanks to the magic of potato power. Ha!"

134580,518,32,326000,Dewey Largo,Springfield Elementary School,Sounds better than half the kids in the band.
134581,518,33,327000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"So does a leaf blower. Look, the district can't afford to keep every school open. So all the kids will take a standardized test, and whichever school scores the lowest will be closed forever."
134582,518,34,338000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"So you're saying if our kids don't pass this test, you're shutting down Springfield Elementary?"
134583,518,35,343000,Coach Krupt,Springfield Elementary School,"I don't teach to the test, I teach them to dodge balls. Things they can use in life!"

134605,518,59,454000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,I hate waiting. That's why I hate risotto.
134606,518,60,457000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Even mushroom risotto?
134607,518,61,458000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,What do you think?!

134611,518,65,466000,Jennifer,Springfield Elementary School,"You did worse than the worst school in the state, which now makes this school the worst school in the state."
134612,518,66,472000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Why did you say that to us in the meanest way you could?
134613,518,67,474000,Jennifer,Springfield Elementary School,To show you that there's no way out. Except...
134614,518,68,477000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Except what?
134615,518,69,479000,Jennifer,Springfield Elementary School,"No, I meant you should accept your terrible fate."
134616,518,70,488000,Jennifer,Springfield Elementary School,This place is worse than the elementary school in prison. This student filled in everything but the ovals!
134617,518,71,495000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,In art school he'd be a genius.
134618,518,72,496000,Jennifer,Springfield Elementary School,This isn't an art school.
134619,518,73,497000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"We tried to have ourselves accredited as one, but no one here could... draw the pirate."
134620,518,74,502000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Children, Groundskeeper Willie will direct you to your new school district. Any correlation to your talents, needs or friends is completely coincidental."
134621,518,75,510000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Sherri, you're going to West Ogdenville, Terri, North Haverbrook."

134624,518,78,524000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Stop your whingeing! It's not like you're losing a rake or a back-hoe. Nelson, you're off to Arkham Elementary School For The Criminally Insane."
134625,518,79,539000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Well I'm glad you're not upset. All my extra credit points are like frequent flyer miles on a bankrupt airline.
134626,518,80,546000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, don't blame me -- I didn't even take the test."
134627,518,81,549000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You didn't?! Is there no limit to your disrespect?
134628,518,82,552000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I had something better to do.
134630,518,84,567000,Bart Simpson,Field,Driving you crazy instead of pulling off your legs. I've really matured.
134631,518,85,572000,Lisa Simpson,Field,"Wait a minute... if you take the test now, your score could raise the average and save the school!"

134636,518,90,589000,Seymour Skinner,FACULTY LOUNGE,I have an aunt named Hope. Perhaps you'd like to kill her as well.
134638,518,92,594000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Bart will take his exam first thing tomorrow morning.
134639,518,93,597000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart, I'm begging you to try and study."
134640,518,94,600000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"When I think begging, I don't imagine someone standing up."
134641,518,95,603000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Sorry, I can't grant a favor to someone I don't respect anymore."
134642,518,96,607000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,You can spin in my chair!
134643,518,97,609000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Wheee!
134644,518,98,612000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Spin-ner! Slow down!
134647,518,101,622000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Streets,"Well, sir, the Lord wouldn't have placed His meter there if He didn't want me to park."
134648,518,102,630000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"This is the easiest money I've ever made, lugging around a ninety pound parking meter!"
134649,518,103,639000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,It's not that kind!
134650,518,104,646000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"All right, now to drag the meter to the next idiot."

134663,518,117,723000,Kid,Springfield Elementary School,"Do it, man, or you'll never see us again."
134664,518,118,728000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Principal Skinner, could you help me sharpen this pencil?"
134665,518,119,731000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I guess a little circular grinding might relax me."
134666,518,120,735000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I can't do this. I'm not ready.
134667,518,121,737000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,You really didn't study?
134668,518,122,738000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I slept on my books, so I might have gotten something through osmosis."
134669,518,123,742000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,So you know what osmosis is!
134670,518,124,744000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Uh... pajamas?
134671,518,125,746000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Let me make this crystal clear to you, Simpson, if you don't pass this test, it will destroy the school."
134673,518,127,763000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Our entire school riding on that coffee can head of yours. We've got to get you more time to study. But how?
134674,518,128,770000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Pull the fire alarm. I'd do it, but everyone's lookin' at me."
134675,518,129,778000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,What to do? What to do?
134676,518,130,781000,Angel Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't do it, Seymour. You've never broken school rules. Ever."
134677,518,131,785000,Mrs. Skinner Devil,Springfield Elementary School,You wimp!
134678,518,132,791000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Children, remain calm... find your disaster buddy... which is different from your lab partner, but may be the same as your lunchroom buddy."
134679,518,133,797000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, well, well."
134680,518,134,801000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Looks like Mr. Vanilla just grew some chocolate chips.
134681,518,135,804000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Save your analogies for the analogy portion of the exam.

134689,518,143,828000,Kent Brockman,CHANNEL SIX NEWS DESK,"Meter Meter, Quarter Cheater? A rogue parking meter has been terrorizing the streets. Experts estimate the cost to taxpayers at north of fifty dollars."
134690,518,144,836000,Chief Wiggum,CHANNEL SIX NEWS DESK,"That's right, Kent. The entire force is on the lookout for anyone with an excessive amount of change."
134691,518,145,843000,Chief Wiggum,CHANNEL SIX NEWS DESK,Our top criminologists have a theory as to what the suspect just might look like.
134692,518,146,848000,Chief Wiggum,CHANNEL SIX NEWS DESK,But of course that question mark could be an exclamation point or an Interrobang. And the man... or woman... could be Hispanic...
134693,518,147,851000,Chief Wiggum,CHANNEL SIX NEWS DESK,"Or, most frightening, contain no punctuation at all."
134696,518,150,869000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"So, how's the studying going?"
134697,518,151,871000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"When I start, I'll tell ya."
134698,518,152,874000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,This is the most selfish thing you've ever done!
134699,518,153,876000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"You're letting your friends go hang because you are lazy, and selfish, and-- Hey, are you falling asleep just to spite me?!"
134700,518,154,892000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Hey, why aren't you eating that?"
134701,518,155,893000,DOLPH,Bart's Bedroom,There's four of us and eight slices. We don't know how to divide it!
134702,518,156,898000,Disco Stu,Bart's Bedroom,Something Stu forgot the music he loves!
134703,518,157,902000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Mrs. Krabappel? Are you a... teacher of the night?
134704,518,158,906000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Bart's Bedroom,I wish I was a hooker. No one in this town has any money. But the worst thing is what's happened to the school.

134707,518,161,920000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,What have I done?
134708,518,162,924000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Spinach farm, huh? That's right, you talk in your sleep."
134709,518,163,928000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Lisa, I wanna pass that test, but I need your help."
134710,518,164,932000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"I have all sorts of problems: lack of attention, I'm afraid of ovals, I only know twenty-four letters... don't you fall asleep on me!"
134712,518,166,942000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Excuse me, you're that proctor that's shutting down my children's school."
134713,518,167,947000,Jennifer,Kwik-E-Mart,I don't shut anything down. People cut their own heads and I just tip 'em into the basket.
134714,518,168,952000,Marge Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"You've been in public education a long time, haven't you?"
134716,518,170,971000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Street,"Freeze, Jack Nickel-scum!"
134717,518,171,975000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Street,"You know what they do to parking meter thieves in prison? They probably treat 'em pretty well. But when you get out, you're not eligible for jury duty. Which again, sounds pretty good."
134718,518,172,986000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Eat silver, copper!"
134720,518,174,995000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Stay with me, man. Stay with me."

134723,518,177,1007000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,It's hopeless. I can't make up for ten years of goofing off in one day. I need two days!
134724,518,178,1013000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Look, the thing is, it's more important to know how to take a test than knowing what's on it. So, do the ones you know first. If you don't know one, guess B and move on. Now, what is the capital of Massachusetts?"
134725,518,179,1026000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Uh... B?
134726,518,180,1027000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Very good.
148680,518,182,1034000,Bart's Thoughts,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, this is it. Do or die."
134728,518,183,1038000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Will you stop that?!

134733,518,188,1066000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The pillows are safe at my workstation. As for the quarters... well, I'm ashamed to tell you what I did."
134734,518,189,1073000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How long have you been in there?
134735,518,190,1079000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we're gonna turn this change into change for the better!"

134738,518,193,1083000,Homer Simpson,Wishing Well,...and I wish that Mr. Teeny gets a banana ... that the Isotopes emerge from this season with a great blooper reel ... I wish that wishing wells worked so I wasn't just tossing my money away ... and that Marge loves me forever no matter what stupid things I do ...
134739,518,194,1103000,Marge Simpson,Wishing Well,And I hope Bart passes his test and saves the school.
134740,518,195,1106000,Homer Simpson,Wishing Well,"Way to get us back on topic, Marge."
