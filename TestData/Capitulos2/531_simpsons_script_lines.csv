138225,531,117,553000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You're so beautiful when I cut you off in the middle of a question.

138227,531,119,566000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Moving my body.
138229,531,121,575000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't you think it's weird that dad stopped eating pork and drinking beer?
138230,531,122,579000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Who cares what happened? Daddy's back!
138232,531,124,595000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield,Something happened to Dad on that trip. This is worse than when he went to New Orleans and came back with the southern accent.
138233,531,125,602000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,How y'all doin'?
138235,531,127,610000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,"Chief Wiggum, how come every time there's terrorist chatter in this town, you come to me?"
138236,531,128,610000,Chief Wiggum,Kwik-E-Mart,"Lay off, Apu. When I look at people, I don't see colors. I just see crackpot religions."
138237,531,129,617000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Chief, is there really a terrorist threat to Springfield?"
138238,531,130,622000,Chief Wiggum,Kwik-E-Mart,Yep. I got a very important phone call...

138241,531,133,629000,Chief Wiggum,Kwik-E-Mart,It's a little jiggly but it'll hold.
138242,531,134,632000,Chief Wiggum,Kwik-E-Mart,We got intel-- that's short for a word I don't know...
138243,531,135,636000,Lisa Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Intelligence?
138244,531,136,636000,Chief Wiggum,Kwik-E-Mart,"I don't believe so, no. Anyway, this ""intel"" says that someone in town has been turned, and they're working for terrorists."
138246,531,138,638000,Chief Wiggum,Kwik-E-Mart,Now I've gotta go check my other suspects...but I may be back.
138249,531,141,657000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Dad's kneeling on a prayer mat! He doesn't believe in kneeling!
138252,531,144,667000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Garage,Huh. It looks like he's praying...

138342,531,233,946000,Homer Simpson,PLANT OPERATIONS CENTER,How'd you get in here?
138343,531,234,948000,Lisa Simpson,PLANT OPERATIONS CENTER,Girl Scout cookies get you in anywhere.
138344,531,235,950000,Lisa Simpson,PLANT OPERATIONS CENTER,"Please, don't do this, Dad! I don't know what horrors you saw in Boise, but it's not worth blowing up everyone you love."
138345,531,236,956000,Homer Simpson,PLANT OPERATIONS CENTER,I'm not blowing up the plant. Just harmlessly stopping it from doing more damage to Mother Earth.
138346,531,237,963000,Lisa Simpson,PLANT OPERATIONS CENTER,Is that something your terrorist masters told you to tell me?
138347,531,238,966000,Homer Simpson,PLANT OPERATIONS CENTER,"Yes, my terrorist masters are always talking about you, Lisa."
138348,531,239,971000,Homer Simpson,PLANT OPERATIONS CENTER,"I missed my flight so I got in a van...with some eco-friendly activists. They wanted gas, grass or ass and brother, I had the ass."
138349,531,240,988000,Homer Simpson,PLANT OPERATIONS CENTER,They taught me something I found shocking: pigs aren't happy to be made into pork chops. This t-shirt lied to me!
138350,531,241,996000,Homer Simpson,PLANT OPERATIONS CENTER,And they also gave me an alcohol detox.
138351,531,242,1013000,Homer Simpson,PLANT OPERATIONS CENTER,I've been listening to this song for three days and it's only the end of the first verse!
138352,531,243,1020000,Lisa Simpson,PLANT OPERATIONS CENTER,But I saw you praying to Mecca!
138354,531,245,1022000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Lisa, I've never prayed to a city in my life, and if I did, it would be Hershey, Pennsylvania. I was kneeling on the Affirmation Rug they gave me."
138355,531,246,1032000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,See?
138356,531,247,1034000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees."
138357,531,248,1038000,Lisa Simpson,PLANT,"But wait, wait, wait! What is this?"
138359,531,249,1041000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Lisa, the most horrible truth of all is the plant where I work poisons our water and our air."
138360,531,250,1047000,Lisa Simpson,PLANT,I've told you that a million times!
138361,531,251,1049000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Aw, sweetie, you've told me a thousand things a million times. Even with a brain the size of a dinosaur's, I couldn't take that in."
138362,531,252,1057000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Anyhoo, this canister is full of spoiled milk and utility-grade chicken."
138363,531,253,1057000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,Both sold to me by Apu this morning.
138364,531,254,1065000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"When I release it into the A. C. system, it'll stink up the plant forever."
138365,531,255,1070000,Lisa Simpson,PLANT,No one can use it but no one gets hurt!
138366,531,256,1073000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,Just like when I smell up the toilet.
138367,531,257,1080000,Annie Crawford,PLANT,There he is! Use your fattest handcuffs!
138368,531,258,1083000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Hey, hey, it's not what you think, Lou. Lou! Lou! Lou! Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu!"
138369,531,259,1088000,Lisa Simpson,PLANT,I can complete my Dad's mission just like George W. Bush.
138370,531,260,1093000,Chief Wiggum,PLANT,I can't shoot a little girl...
138371,531,261,1096000,Chief Wiggum,PLANT,"Ow, dammit! There's some things they just don't teach you in the Police Academy movies."
138372,531,262,1114000,Lisa Simpson,PLANT,"We did it, Dad. We did it."
138373,531,263,1116000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,We sure did.
138374,531,264,1118000,Lisa Simpson,PLANT,You weren't shot!
138375,531,265,1120000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"No, I was just up late watching a movie. Something with... William Holden and--"
138378,531,268,1132000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Your plan failed! Thank god this plant has never had a functioning air conditioner.
138379,531,269,1137000,Fbi Supervisor,Burns's Office,"Wait a minute, Burns. You don't have a functioning A. C. system at a nuclear plant? That's against the law."
138380,531,270,1142000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"That's impossible! Smithers, didn't we move this plant to China?"
138381,531,271,1145000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Sir, that's two years from now and you're not supposed to tell anyone."
138382,531,272,1148000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Oopsie.
138384,531,274,1151000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"There isn't a prison made that can hold me! Prisons are still made of mud and wattles, right?"
138385,531,275,1156000,Fbi Supervisor,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, concrete."
138388,531,277,1156000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You know, Dad, just because your mission's complete, it doesn't mean you have to go back to pork eating, and beer-drinking..."
138389,531,278,1167000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,A beer from the sky! It's a sign!
138390,531,279,1174000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, this equipment will pay for itself in one night of binging."
138391,531,280,1181000,Annie Crawford,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I wish a mission could bring me closer to someone, but it can't. It's time for me to walk alone into the sunset."
138392,531,281,1191000,Annie Crawford,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That's better!
138395,531,284,1213000,C. Montgomery Burns,PLANT,"Amazingly, the hamster's older than I am."
