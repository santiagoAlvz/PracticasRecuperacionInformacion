82841,322,35,151000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, the kitchen lady's right -- no new bike while your old one still works."
82842,322,36,155000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I see. So if my old bike didn't work, I would automatically get a new one?"
82843,322,37,161000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's right. No questions asked.
82846,322,40,168000,Bart Simpson,FRONT OF SIMPSON HOUSE,"Boy, I'm really gonna miss you. We've really had some great... Ooh, a Mercedes!"

82866,322,60,273000,Homer Simpson,Bike Store,Here we go. Now it starts with the fees.
82867,322,61,277000,Homer Simpson,Bike Store,I'll assemble it myself.

82899,322,93,431000,Lisa Simpson,ANIMAL SHELTER,"All right, I'll look."
82900,322,94,433000,Lisa Simpson,ANIMAL SHELTER,"Too fluffy, too Siamese, too needy, too stuck-up, infected eye, clearly a skunk. Me-ow!"

82910,322,103,489000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Wait a minute. What is it my Dad always said to me?

82921,322,114,555000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Lisa. Honey, it's okay. You're a Buddhist, so you know your cats are now reincarnated as a higher form of life."
82922,322,115,584000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Like a dog. Or a snowman!
82923,322,116,585000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ashes to ashes... dust to dust... we've gotta go fight some robots.
82925,322,118,592000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"C'mon, Homer. How long does it take to go to the bathroom?"
82926,322,119,598000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,Huh?
82927,322,120,599000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,Dear Bart...

82941,322,135,668000,Homer Simpson,Arena,Doin' it for the boy...doin' it for the boy... pain is love... to bleed is to care...

82949,322,143,701000,Marge Simpson,ANIMAL SHELTER,"Coltrane? Lisa, I'm glad you're ready to love again. But a kitty needs a proper name, like Whiskers. Or Paws Scaggs."
82950,322,144,717000,Lisa Simpson,ANIMAL SHELTER,"Well, I think it's only fair I get to name him. You got to name me."
82951,322,145,722000,Marge Simpson,ANIMAL SHELTER,You should be glad I did. Your father wanted to call you Bartzeena!
82953,322,147,727000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Coltrane, would you like to hear some music written by your namesake?"
82954,322,148,734000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Coltrane?
82955,322,149,736000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Coltrane, you were with us only briefly, but we'll always have the ride home from the shelter. And uh... I guess that's it. Amen."
82956,322,150,746000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"And Lord, if you think I'm making lemon bars for your bake sale Sunday, you'd better stop killing our cats."
82957,322,151,753000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I'm not sure God responds to threats and intimidation."
82958,322,152,758000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's the only way to talk to bullies.
82959,322,153,760000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,...then Knockahomer did three victory laps and pretended to drink a beer!
82960,322,154,765000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Pretended.
82961,322,155,767000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, what are all those cuts?"
82962,322,156,768000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Various bug bites and wounds. Now stop interrupting your brother.
82963,322,157,772000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"In my day, mechanical men had funnel hats and showed respect. Then it all changed when they got the vote and started tinkering with our memories!"
82965,322,159,820000,ROBOT WARS ANNOUNCER #1,Robot Rumble Ring,"Well, if you ever want to see a mailbox shoot a boy, that's about as close as you're gonna get."
82966,322,160,826000,Bart Simpson,Robot Rumble Ring,"Dad, it was so great -- Knockahomer really took a pounding but then he won!"
82968,322,161,833000,Homer Simpson,Robot Rumble Ring,"Not so rough, Bart. Daddy can't handle so much love right now."
82969,322,162,838000,Bart Simpson,Robot Rumble Ring,This robot's the greatest thing you've ever done for me. I can't believe you've never seen him fight.
82970,322,163,842000,Homer Simpson,Robot Rumble Ring,"Well, I've been busy, son. They really need me over at the nuclear plank."
82971,322,164,847000,Bart Simpson,Robot Rumble Ring,"Well, the next match is Saturday. Can you come then?"
82972,322,165,850000,Homer Simpson,Robot Rumble Ring,"I don't think so, son. But on the other hand, I may be closer than you think."
82973,322,166,855000,Homer Simpson,Robot Rumble Ring,So much metal in my eye.
82975,322,168,858000,ROBOT WARS ANNOUNCER #1,Robot Rumble Ring,"Ladies and gentlemen... eh, who am I kidding, just gentlemen... join us next week for our title bout, when Knockahomer will try to unseat five time defending champion... Smashius Clay, a.k.a. Killhammad Aieee!"
82976,322,169,884000,Bart Simpson,Robot Rumble Ring,Our robot can kick that robot's ass! Right Dad? Dad?
82977,322,170,889000,Homer Simpson,Robot Rumble Ring,Oh no! My recurring nightmare is coming true!
82978,322,171,892000,Homer Simpson,Robot Rumble Ring,"There are many people I'd like to thank for this award. My wife, Anjelica Huston -- this is for you, Angie! We did it!"
82979,322,172,901000,Scary Robot,Robot Rumble Ring,Speeches cannot be longer than thirty seconds.
82981,322,174,904000,Scary Robot,Robot Rumble Ring,Now a tribute to those who have left us this past year.
82983,322,176,925000,Bart Simpson,Robot Rumble Ring,Sure he's tough. But he's never come up against a wooden mallet!
82985,322,178,932000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen son, there's something I have to tell you about our robot."
82986,322,179,937000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Simpson Home,There it is! That thing that makes us respect Bart!
82987,322,180,942000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You guys are just in time. My dad's about to tell me something important about our robot.
82988,322,181,947000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh...
82989,322,182,950000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I just installed a chip that makes it ten per cent more bloodthirsty!
82991,322,184,956000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And if anything happens to me, I want you bullies to take care of my boy."
82992,322,185,961000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, I'll raise him like the mean streets raised me."
82993,322,186,964000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I wish I had bullies like you growing up.
82995,322,188,970000,Attendant,ANIMAL SHELTER,Hey! Hey!
82996,322,189,971000,Attendant,ANIMAL SHELTER,These cats would rather take their chances in the back room than go home with you.
82998,322,191,980000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"My job was to keep Lisa's hope alive. But instead, she's really depressed."
82999,322,192,986000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You think you've got problems, look what I just pulled out of my arm!"
83001,322,194,991000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's what we in the business call ""a biggie."""
83002,322,195,991000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Business, what business?"
83003,322,196,995000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The business of being a Dad. Can you hand me that magnet?
83004,322,197,1002000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Can you do my back?
83005,322,198,1004000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I guess I'm not meant to own a cat. I'm much happier petting this leaf.
83008,322,201,1020000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait, you don't want me to have this cat!"
83010,322,203,1028000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, you don't want to get involved with a girl like me. My cats have a nasty habit of waking up dead. Now go, cough me out of your life like a bad fur ball."
83011,322,204,1045000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You're not hurt! You're a good-luck kitty!
83012,322,205,1050000,Gil Gunderson,Simpson Home,"All right, ol' Gil's gonna collect big from insurance! I'll be eating food tonight!"
83013,322,206,1061000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm keeping you! You're Snowball Five, but to save money on a new dish, we'll just call you Snowball Two and pretend this whole thing never happened."
83014,322,207,1071000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,"That's really a cheat, isn't it?"
83015,322,208,1072000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I guess you're right, Principal Tamzarian."
83016,322,209,1075000,Seymour Skinner,Simpson Home,"I'll just be moving along, Lisa. Snowball II."
83018,322,211,1089000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"Okay I've been studying Frink's robot, and I've discovered he has one small weak spot."
83019,322,212,1098000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,Uh-oh. His weak spot is now his strongest point.
83021,322,214,1101000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,That moan sounded almost human.
83022,322,215,1103000,Knockahomer,TV Studio,The Hell it did.
83024,322,217,1124000,ROBOT WARS ANNOUNCER #1,TV Studio,End of round one! Two hundred and thirty rounds to go!

83028,322,220,1142000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,Dad?!
83029,322,221,1143000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,"Bart, I'm sorry -- I could never build a robot this awesome. I'm a fraud."
83030,322,222,1148000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"So, you fought all those robots?"
83031,322,223,1150000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,Affirmative.
83032,322,224,1152000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,That is so cool!
83033,322,225,1154000,Homer Simpson,TV Studio,You really think so?
83034,322,226,1155000,Bart Simpson,TV Studio,"Yeah! Any Poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life, even though you're the sole provider for a family of five! I am the luckiest kid in the world."
