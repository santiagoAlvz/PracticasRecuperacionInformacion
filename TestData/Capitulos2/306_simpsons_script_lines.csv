78460,306,120,577000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, he does. All my life I've had one dream: to achieve my many goals. Mr. Burns has never given me a thumbs up or a ""way to be"" or a ""you go, girl."" No, he just steps all over everyone who works for him, taking pleasure in making us feel small."
78461,306,121,594000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Homie. Don't let it get you down. So Mr. Burns doesn't take you seriously? Big whoop! Who gives a doodle? Whoopie ding dong doo!"

78472,306,132,638000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Or give him some face time with sweet lady brick.
78473,306,133,643000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"No, I think this calls for something a little more cerebral."

78484,306,144,685000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Sir, for dumping that waste, you could go to jail. And a handsome man like you, I'd hate to see what would happen."
78485,306,145,691000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,I wouldn't go to jail. The legal owner of this plant would:
78486,306,146,692000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,Canary M. Burns.
78489,306,149,699000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"This entire plant is in his name -- so when they come to put C. M. Burns in jail, it's the canary that does the time."

78491,306,151,710000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Oh yes. Tycoons have been doing it for years. Why, Standard Oil was once owned by a half-eaten breakfast."

78498,306,157,737000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I have a plan to get to the top, but I have to do some pretty rotten things to get there. I'm not sure I could look at myself in the mirror, or any highly-polished metal."
78499,306,158,746000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if you don't know the right path to take, you have to be very quiet and listen for that little voice inside that tells you what to do."
78500,306,159,757000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Do it, Dad. You could get a less- crappy car."
78501,306,160,759000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, you can hear us?"
78502,306,161,761000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah. From my room I can hear everything.
78503,306,162,764000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Me too. The walls are paper-thin.

78531,306,191,856000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Finally, I would like to add to any nuclear inspectors in the crowd, that the titular head of the power plant is now Mr. Homer J. Simpson."
78532,306,192,863000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"That's right. And as my first act... Mr. Burns, you're fired!"
78534,306,194,870000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"That man's mad. Smithers, get this bedlamite an alienist!"
78535,306,195,875000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"No, it's entirely within my power. Furthermore, there never were any nuclear inspectors. Check and mate. Now, king me!"
78536,306,196,884000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"So, the caterpillar has emerged from its cocoon as a shark with a gun for a mouth. I only have one thing to say to that... bravo."
