76295,298,214,1007000,Bart Simpson,EFCOT Center,"Seymour? Glad you're here. You can help me play ""Halloween Hit and Run."""
76298,298,215,1009000,Seymour Skinner,EFCOT Center,"Ooh, this game is gonna get some disapproving clucks. But for now I need my tongue to talk to you. I don't want to lose Edna, so I need you to sabotage her chances of winning tonight."
76299,298,216,1026000,Bart Simpson,EFCOT Center,But I don't want to hurt Mrs. K.
76300,298,217,1028000,Seymour Skinner,EFCOT Center,"All right, Bart, I didn't want to resort to this, but... this drawing was found on the wall of Springfield Elementary late last week."
76301,298,218,1036000,Bart Simpson,EFCOT Center,"All right, I'm in. I'll humiliate the love of your life. Because I like you, I'll even do it pro boner."
76302,298,219,1043000,Seymour Skinner,EFCOT Center,That's pro bono.
76303,298,220,1044000,Bart Simpson,EFCOT Center,I know what I said.
76304,298,221,1046000,Seymour Skinner,EFCOT Center,This is the worst thing I've ever done. Even worse than what I did in 'Nam.
76306,298,223,1057000,Seymour Skinner,Vietnam,You're gonna get your parade. Down my esophagus.
76309,298,226,1065000,Lisa Simpson,Auditorium,"So many categories... Gym teacher of the year, Substitute teacher of the year, Most Wheelchair-Accessible School Award?"
76310,298,227,1073000,Homer Simpson,Auditorium,Who will take home The Rampy?
76311,298,228,1078000,Announcer,Auditorium,"And now, to present our final award for Teacher of the Year, Little Richard."
76312,298,229,1084000,Little Richard,Auditorium,"I love teachers. In fact, I'm a teacher. I taught Paul McCartney to go ""Whoo!"""
76313,298,230,1091000,Homer Simpson,Auditorium,Purple Rain!
76314,298,231,1091000,Little Richard,Auditorium,Shut up!
76315,298,232,1095000,Homer Simpson,Auditorium,Michael Jackson just told me to shut up!
76316,298,233,1099000,Little Richard,Auditorium,"We're down to our last three teachers, folks."
76317,298,234,1099000,Little Richard,Auditorium,And the winner will be decided by one final question -- asked by the students who nominated them.
76318,298,235,1111000,Skinner's Thoughts,Auditorium,I feel terrible. But this is the only way I can win Edna without upsetting Mother.
76319,298,236,1118000,Mrs. Skinner's Thoughts,Auditorium,He has the tiny hands of a chimp.
76320,298,237,1122000,Little Richard,Auditorium,"And now, Bart Simpson will ask a question to his teacher."
76321,298,238,1128000,Bart Simpson,Auditorium,W-u-w-h-a-a-t... W-w-wuh... h-h-huh...
76322,298,239,1132000,Little Richard,Auditorium,"Hurry up, son."
76323,298,240,1134000,Bart Simpson,Auditorium,"I'm sorry, I can't read. Mrs. Krabappel never taught me to read!"
76324,298,241,1141000,Little Richard,Auditorium,"Is this true, Edna?"
76325,298,242,1144000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,Oh God. I've created a Prankenstein!
76296,298,243,1147000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,Wait! That boy is lying! He's not illiterate.
76297,298,244,1150000,Marge Simpson,Auditorium,"And he's good around the potty, too."
76326,298,245,1153000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,"I'm sorry, everyone. I perpetrated this charade. The boy can read, and Edna Krabappel is the greatest teacher I have ever known. If she can teach me to love, then she can teach anything."
76327,298,246,1165000,Audience,Auditorium,Awwww...
76328,298,247,1167000,Agnes Skinner,Auditorium,Seymour! Your feelings are ugly and wrong!
76329,298,248,1171000,Little Richard,Auditorium,Are you gonna listen to her?
76330,298,249,1173000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,"Not on your life, Reverend. From now on, I'm my own man."
76331,298,250,1176000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Auditorium,I have waited to hear that for so long.
76332,298,251,1178000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,"Wait, it gets better."
76333,298,252,1179000,Seymour Skinner,Auditorium,"Edna Krabappel, will you marry me? Now I must warn you, two months' salary only bought me the ring box."
76334,298,253,1188000,Little Richard,Auditorium,"Oh here, honey. Take one of mine. Whoo!"
76335,298,254,1193000,Little Richard,Auditorium,"Ooh, I felt naked there for a minute."
76336,298,255,1201000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Auditorium,"Seymour, of course I'll marry you."
76337,298,256,1204000,Agnes Skinner,Auditorium,"Oh, great. Three in a bed."

76340,298,259,1212000,Judge #1,Auditorium,Julio Estudiante...an inner-city math teacher who taught teenage gang members that differential equations are more powerful than bullets.
76341,298,260,1222000,Homer Simpson,Auditorium,What a rip! You all should be ashamed!
76343,298,262,1227000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,EFCOT Center,"Well, I didn't win Teacher of the Year, but I didn't go home empty-handed."
76344,298,263,1231000,Seymour Skinner,EFCOT Center,Do you want to check out the bed of tomorrow... today?
76345,298,264,1235000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,EFCOT Center,"Oh, Seymour."
76346,298,265,1238000,Lisa Simpson,EFCOT Center,I love happy endings.
76347,298,266,1240000,Homer Simpson,EFCOT Center,"Well, here's ours. We're going to Disney World!"
76348,298,267,1248000,Cartoon Mouse Voice,EFCOT Center,Step away from the wall. Step away from the wall.
76349,298,268,1252000,Homer Simpson,EFCOT Center,"Oh, it's so beautiful."
