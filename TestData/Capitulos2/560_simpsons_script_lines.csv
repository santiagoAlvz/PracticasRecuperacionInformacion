145419,560,4,38000,KING TOOT,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,Moe.
145420,560,5,40000,Moe Szyslak,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,How many times I gotta tell you not to throw your trash in my dumpster?
145421,560,6,43000,KING TOOT,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,"Oh, come on, Szyslak. I gotta make space in the store for my new side business -- a tanning salon that secretly has cameras in the beds. Which feeds into my website, www dot tancams dot com. That is registered."
145422,560,7,57000,Moe Szyslak,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,"Hey, sounds great. Maybe then you could afford to rent your own dumpster."
145424,560,8,61000,KING TOOT,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,I like my current deal. Free. Of. Charge.
145425,560,9,68000,Moe Szyslak,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,I'll eat your hair!
145426,560,10,69000,KING TOOT,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,You call that a testicle kick?
145427,560,11,73000,Chief Wiggum,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,"All right you two, break it up."
145428,560,12,75000,KING TOOT,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,"Drive on, asphalt cowboy -- or I'll squeeze his brain out like an edamame."
145429,560,13,80000,Chief Wiggum,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,"Eh, uh, a what?"
145430,560,14,81000,KING TOOT,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,Those beans you eat before your sushi comes.
145431,560,15,84000,Chief Wiggum,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,Oh... salt peas. I call them salt peas.
145432,560,16,88000,KING TOOT,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,"Look, officer, after twenty years of being neighbors, tempers sometimes flare up. Moe's a good guy."
145433,560,17,94000,Moe Szyslak,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,"No, no, no, it's my fault. I'm a hot head. I ain't got no beef with you, Toot."
145434,560,18,100000,Moe Szyslak,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,You better stay out of my dumpster.
145435,560,19,101000,KING TOOT,ALLEY BEHIND MOE'S,I've also been stealing the catalogs out of your mailbox.
145439,560,23,114000,Moe Szyslak,King Toot's Music Store,It's my dumpster!
145442,560,26,126000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,...and that's the terrifying tale of how the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche.
145443,560,27,134000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Oh no! King Toot's is closed! Dad, you're gonna have to take me to the... big box music store."
145445,560,29,142000,Lisa Simpson,BIG BOX MALL,Look at all these monstrosities.
145446,560,30,145000,Homer Simpson,BIG BOX MALL,"Lisa, how many times have I told you to bow down to our corporate overlords?"
145449,560,33,153000,Lisa Simpson,GUITAR CENTRAL,(IMPRESSED NOISE
145450,560,34,155000,Homer Simpson,GUITAR CENTRAL,It's like some kind of guitar central.
145451,560,35,163000,GUITAR CENTRAL EMPLOYEE #1,GUITAR CENTRAL,Mid-life crisis at twelve o'clock.
145452,560,36,166000,GUITAR CENTRAL EMPLOYEE #1,GUITAR CENTRAL,Mm-hm.
145453,560,37,167000,STIG,GUITAR CENTRAL,"Okay, let me guess, dude, you're an axe-man -- you're looking to score a new blade."
145454,560,38,172000,Homer Simpson,GUITAR CENTRAL,Stig. You've got a name that's not a name.
145455,560,39,176000,STIG,GUITAR CENTRAL,"So what's your poison, bro? Les Paul? Straight up Gibson? No, no, no, classic Strat, am I right?"
145458,560,40,181000,Homer Simpson,GUITAR CENTRAL,"Oh, I don't have what it takes to play guitar. I mean, I'm no Joe Walsh in the brains department."
145459,560,41,186000,STIG,GUITAR CENTRAL,"Who is? Look, you don't have the weak, womanly fingers of a guitar princess."
145460,560,42,192000,STIG,GUITAR CENTRAL,"You, my friend, have the muscular stumps of a bass man."
145461,560,43,196000,STIG,GUITAR CENTRAL,Try this on.
145462,560,44,202000,Homer Simpson,GUITAR CENTRAL,What the rock?
145463,560,45,204000,STIG,GUITAR CENTRAL,Now that was a lick.
145464,560,46,206000,Homer Simpson,GUITAR CENTRAL,I did a lick?
145465,560,47,207000,STIG,GUITAR CENTRAL,Keep 'em comin'.
145466,560,48,211000,STIG,GUITAR CENTRAL,"Yes, now bob your head. Bob it. Bob it. Bob it."
145467,560,49,215000,STIG,GUITAR CENTRAL,"Dude, usually it takes years to learn such neck confidence. Now check this out:"
145468,560,50,225000,Homer Simpson,GUITAR CENTRAL,Oh my god... I'm amazing.
145469,560,51,228000,STIG,GUITAR CENTRAL,"Dude, you're already one of the greatest bass players of all time."
145470,560,52,233000,STIG,GUITAR CENTRAL,"Okay. Now oh, how are you set for stage lights?"
145471,560,53,236000,Homer Simpson,GUITAR CENTRAL,I'm not set at all.
145472,560,54,238000,STIG,GUITAR CENTRAL,"OOh, what about gels?"
145473,560,55,241000,Homer Simpson,GUITAR CENTRAL,"This is embarrassing to admit, Stig, but I hadn't even thought about gels."
145478,560,60,257000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Garage,WHAT IS THAT RACKET?
145479,560,61,259000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,MUSIC! BEAUTIFUL MUSIC!
145480,560,62,263000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Garage,WHAT?
145481,560,63,265000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Beautiful music, baby."
145482,560,64,266000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Garage,The bass guitar? This doesn't really seem like... you.
145483,560,65,270000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Sure it is. You know I've always loved laying things down. Grooves are just the latest.
145485,560,67,277000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"I feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players. Like what's his name from The Who. Or that guy from Led Zeppelin who wasn't Page, Plant or Bonham. Those are the only two I know for sure."
145486,560,68,290000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Garage,It's so cool to have another musician in the family!
145487,560,69,293000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Oh yeah, and you know what's the great thing is about music? It's so easy."
145488,560,70,298000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Uh, well to truly master an instrument you'll need years of--"
145489,560,71,301000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,So easy.
145493,560,79,334000,Marge Simpson,'ZERZ,I can't take it. All Homer does is play that stupid bass! Doink doink doink doink doink doink doink!
145494,560,80,342000,Luann Van Houten,'ZERZ,"You're not alone, Marge."
145495,560,81,344000,Bernice Hibbert,'ZERZ,"A man gets older, has a career, a few kids, and suddenly there's a hole in his life that can only be filled by... jamming. For my Julius, it was the drums."
145496,560,82,355000,Helen Lovejoy,'ZERZ,Timothy has that awful guitar.
145497,560,83,357000,Luann Van Houten,'ZERZ,Kirk just loves his keyboards.
145498,560,84,360000,Marge Simpson,'ZERZ,I never knew so many women suffered from extramarital jamming.
145499,560,85,364000,Marge Simpson,'ZERZ,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. What if -- all the dads jammed together... in a dad band?!"
145500,560,86,372000,HELEN,'ZERZ,"That way they would play their horrible music... in one garage at a time. Marge, you're a genius!"
145501,560,87,378000,Bernice Hibbert,'ZERZ,This menu was right -- good things do happen... at 'Zerz.
145503,560,89,389000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know guys. I'm not sure I'm feeling this. The bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument.
145504,560,90,396000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,What were our wives thinking? We probably don't even like the same tunes.
145505,560,91,401000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"On the count of three, everyone say their favorite kind of music. One, two, three..."
145506,560,92,406000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,Hard-driving rock!
145507,560,93,409000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"Dads, let's jam!"
145508,560,94,415000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,Garage bands rule!
145509,560,95,422000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I almost forgot the most important thing.
145512,560,98,444000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,"Great practice, guys. What do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day?"
145513,560,99,450000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,GARAGE,"Excuse me... My wife told me about your get-out-of-the-house band. And uh, perhaps you need a singer?"
145514,560,100,456000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,"Oh... yeah, Apu, I'm sure you're a great singer. But the balance of the band is really delicate right now, and we're not really looking for a ""world music"" vibe. No disrespect to world music. I love world music."
145515,560,101,483000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,GARAGE,WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES / I WISH THAT I COULD FANTASIZE / PULL A DREAM RIGHT OUT OF THE AIR / TAKE A CHANCE TURN IT INTO A PRAYER...
145516,560,102,499000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,"That sounds nothing like terrible, terrible world music."
145517,560,103,503000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,GARAGE,Why is your voice different when you sing?
145518,560,104,505000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,GARAGE,It is because of all the years I spent at the Kwik-E-Mart...
145520,560,106,510000,SUNGAZER SINGER,Kwik-E-Mart,'CAUSE GIRL YOU KNOW I WANNA BE THE GUY / WITH A HUNGER BURNING DEEP INSIDE / TONIGHT I WISH UPON A FALLING STAR / TO DISCOVER WHAT MY YEARNINGS ARE...
145521,560,107,510000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,... where classic rock anthems were piped-in on a never-ending loop. The endless repetition drove many clerks to madness.
145522,560,108,518000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,The only way to maintain my sanity was to sing along until it seemed like our voices were one.
145523,560,109,524000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,HOPIN' FOR A DREAM...
145524,560,110,528000,Kirk Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,HOPIN'...

145526,560,112,540000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"Guys, are you feeling this? Are you feeling this?"
145527,560,113,543000,Kirk Van Houten,Kwik-E-Mart,I'm feeling it.
145528,560,114,544000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Kwik-E-Mart,I'm definitely feeling it.
145529,560,115,545000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Kwik-E-Mart,"I felt something earlier, but I was afraid to bring it up."
145530,560,116,548000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,I think we all felt something.
145531,560,117,550000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,We are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families. We are now a cover band. And we shall be called... Covercraft. Because we play covers and this is our craft.
145532,560,118,564000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Kwik-E-Mart,And it sounds like Hovercraft.
145533,560,119,566000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,"That was not my intent. Okay, Covercraft: hands in."
145534,560,120,569000,Homer Simpson,Kwik-E-Mart,Cover...
145535,560,121,571000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Kwik-E-Mart,...craft!

145541,560,127,606000,Homer Simpson,PERFORMANCE AREA,"Apu, what's wrong?"
145542,560,128,607000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,PERFORMANCE AREA,"What if, what if I am no good? This is the Cabbage Festival, man... I-I don't know if I can face that crowd!"
145545,560,129,615000,Homer Simpson,PERFORMANCE AREA,"Buddy, buddy. Think of it this way: you're not singing in front of all those people, you're alone at the Kwik-E-Mart in the middle of the night. You just wear this on stage, and everything will be fine."
145546,560,130,627000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,PERFORMANCE AREA,My uniform!
145548,560,132,632000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,CABBAGE FESTIVAL,All alone at the Kwik-E-Mart.

145553,560,137,675000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Everyone loves you, Dad. You could become a famous rock star!"
145554,560,138,679000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Well son, I do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs I could write... down the names of and then cover. But then I remember: I'm just a regular guy, jamming with my buds."
145555,560,139,692000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Oh, sweetie. This band has brought out the best in you."
145556,560,140,696000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Yeah, you really get that it's all about the music."
145557,560,141,699000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Yep. It's all about the music... and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that. Pretty unforeseen...
145560,560,144,712000,Band Member,Mansion,"Gentlemen, I think we've found what we're looking for."
145562,560,146,719000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Guys, I really need your honesty here. At the Squidport Senior Jamboree... was I too in the pocket?"
145564,560,148,728000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Garage,"Freddy Freeman, Shredder Stevens, Nick Delacourt and Peter D'Abbruzio -- you're four of the five guys from Sungazer!"
145565,560,149,736000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Garage,"But where's your lead singer, Grant LeDavid?"
145566,560,150,739000,NICK DELACOURT,Simpson Garage,"Uh, he passed away."
145567,560,151,741000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,How?
145568,560,152,743000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,What kind of erotic asphyxiation?
145569,560,153,747000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Oh...
145572,560,154,748000,PETER D'ABBRUZIO,Simpson Garage,"Apu, you're the only man on the entire internet whose got the pure Sungazer sound. Will you be our new lead singer and join us on our stadium tour?"
145573,560,155,758000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"I think I can answer for Apu. He's flattered, but the small-time success of Covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted."
145574,560,156,766000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Garage,"Uh, actually... I..."
145575,560,157,768000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Apu has a rich life here in Springfield: a store full of great products, a lovely him-type wife, and eight super kids: Anoop, Sandeep, Nabendu, Gheet, Pria, Uma, Poonam, Sashi--"
145576,560,158,782000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Garage,"Shut your mouth, I want to do it! I want to do it! I want to be a singer for a real rock band!"
145577,560,159,787000,SHREDDER STEVENS,Simpson Garage,Sun...
145578,560,160,788000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Garage,...gazer!
145580,560,162,793000,Kirk Van Houten,Street,"I gotta say, I'm kind of jealous of Apu getting a break like that."
145581,560,163,797000,Homer Simpson,Street,Not me. I'm nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune.
145582,560,164,812000,Homer Simpson,Street,I want his fame and fortune so much! Why must the Lords of Rock be so cruel?!
145584,560,166,821000,Homer Simpson,Street,Sammy Hagar? You're not dead.
145586,560,168,825000,SAMMY HAGAR,MEXICAN RESORT,Dammit! I told you these jalapeno poppers had too much breading!
145587,560,169,829000,Waiter,MEXICAN RESORT,"Sorry, Señor Hagar."
145588,560,170,830000,SAMMY HAGAR,MEXICAN RESORT,"Nah, nah, nah, it's cool, man. I went to rock star Heaven. And there was this great back patio with a SWEET fire pit. If you had the right wrist band -- which I did."
145589,560,171,846000,Kent Brockman,MEXICAN RESORT,"News story in aisle three? Local clerk, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, is a dead ringer for a dead singer. He's living the rock star dream as front man for '80s chart-toppers Sungazer on their ""Last Final Hell Re-Freezes Over Ultimate Goodbye For Serious This Time Never Again Part Two of Question Mark Tour."""
145590,560,172,866000,Kent Brockman,MEXICAN RESORT,Apu and the band appeared on Saturday Night Live as the punchline in a game show sketch.
145591,560,173,870000,Bart Simpson,MEXICAN RESORT,What's a game show?
145592,560,174,871000,Homer Simpson,MEXICAN RESORT,It's something you make sketches about.
145593,560,175,873000,Kent Brockman,MEXICAN RESORT,It looks like Apu won't be playing the Cabbage Festival ever again.
145594,560,176,881000,Lisa Simpson,MEXICAN RESORT,"Dad, you shouldn't be jealous of Apu. Remember, it's all about the music."
145596,560,177,885000,Homer Simpson,MEXICAN RESORT,I'm not jealous. I'm envious. Jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have. Envy is wanting what someone else has. What I feel is envy.
145597,560,178,896000,Lisa Simpson,MEXICAN RESORT,"Wow, he's right."
145598,560,179,898000,Homer Simpson,MEXICAN RESORT,You know what? Apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band. We're gonna be like Genesis after Peter Gabriel left.
145599,560,180,905000,Bart Simpson,MEXICAN RESORT,You mean more popular but not as good?
145600,560,181,908000,Homer Simpson,MEXICAN RESORT,"Phil Collins-era Genesis is not as good, huh? ""No Reply at All,"" ""Land of Confusion,"" ""Throwing it All Away,"" ""Illegal Alien,"" ""I Can't Dance,"" and I'm sure I don't need to mention... ""Invisible Touch!"""
145602,560,183,932000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"You know, we really could use a new lead singer."
145603,560,184,936000,Kirk Van Houten,Simpson Home,"You know, I've been known to sing a little..."
145604,560,185,938000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What? So you can also get famous and bail on us? You're out of the band!
145605,560,186,942000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,You can't just kick him out--
145606,560,187,944000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, so you're sticking up for Yoko here? Looks like I've got another Yoko on my hands."
145607,560,188,950000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,How can there be two Yokos--
145608,560,189,954000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! All you Yokos are out of the band!
145609,560,190,966000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you okay?
145610,560,191,967000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Do I sound okay?
145611,560,192,968000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You sound great! Your licks are really... juicy.
145612,560,193,973000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,They're not juicy. My licks are dry. Dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue.
145613,560,194,977000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You didn't join a band to become famous like in ""Almost Famous."" You loved playing music with your friends. That was enough to make you happy."
145614,560,195,985000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well it's not enough anymore. When something great happens to one person, everyone else's life gets a little worse. Look it up, it's called physics."
145615,560,196,993000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Apu is a good man. He sent over front row tickets and backstage passes to his show at the Costington Center.
145616,560,197,1000000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star?"
145617,560,198,1005000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Your friend had a wonderful thing happen to him, and you are coming with us to share in his talent."
145618,560,199,1012000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll never have a per diem.

145651,560,237,1236000,SAMMY HAGAR,SPRINGFIELD POLICE DEPARTMENT JAIL,"So there I am, in Easter Island, and the heads ask me to play them a song. I say ""Why me, heads? You've heard the music of the universe itself."" And they say ""Sammy, your stuff rocks just a little harder."" That's when I wake up. I'm in the Springfield Elementary parking lot, doing a buck-fifty-five in my Ferrari 512 Boxer. I was cornering so hard, I blacked out from the cheese, man. They say I ran over the groundskeeper. Probably get life in prison. But I got a plan to escape. Using only this harmonica and some guitar picks with my face on 'em. Who's with me on this?"
