106162,409,11,170000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Six a.m. -- still early enough to sneak into bed and pretend I actually got home at three a.m.
106163,409,12,177000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Where's Marge?

106177,409,26,211000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What's going on, why are you attacking me? Look, if this is about me eating your heart pills, they shouldn't have made them in Good 'N' Plenty colors!"
106180,409,29,223000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, my family's gone, my dog hates me, and I can't remember what happened last night. Was I here?"
106183,409,30,227000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Was you ever. You came in sayin' you really needed to forget something, so I mixed you up the most powerful drink I got... the ""Forget-Me-Shot."""
106184,409,31,235000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"A ""Forget-Me-Shot?"" Never heard of it."
106185,409,32,239000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,That means it worked. No one ever remembers. That's why I made this video to explain the process.
106186,409,33,245000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"You start with a splash of Jaegermeister, then add sloe gin, Triple-Sec, Quadruple-Sec, gunk from a dog's eye, Absolut Pickle..."
106187,409,34,254000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Mmm, pickle..."
106188,409,35,256000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,The red stripe from Aquafresh...
106189,409,36,256000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,And the funniest ingredient... the venom of the Louisiana Loboto-moth.
106190,409,37,262000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"C'mon, sweetie."
106191,409,38,268000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"You stir it with a home pregnancy test till it turns ""positive""..."
106192,409,39,272000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,And presto: the Forget-Me-Shot.
106193,409,40,277000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Aw jeez, I don't look like that."
106195,409,42,284000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"The point is, this drink is the ultimate brain bleacher. One swig wipes out the last day of your life."
106196,409,43,290000,Krusty the Clown,Moe's Tavern,"Gimme one of those forget-me-drinks -- I made a mistake I gotta wipe out! I was trying to do a Don Rickles about Arabs, but it turned into a Mel Gibson about Mexicans."
106197,409,44,305000,Krusty the Clown,Moe's Tavern,What the hell am I doin' here? I gotta get back to the Latin Grammys.
106198,409,45,311000,Hispanic Crowd,Moe's Tavern,There he is! / Get him! / Hot sauce his eyes!

106202,409,49,324000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,There was a domestic disturbance at your address yesterday.
106203,409,50,329000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Chief Wiggum! I remember seeing you...
106205,409,52,336000,Memory Wiggum,Simpson Home,"What's going on here, Simpson? Am I gonna need the zip strips?"
106206,409,53,340000,Memory Marge,Simpson Home,Everything's fine! Cupcakes and sprinkles!
106207,409,54,344000,Memory Wiggum,Simpson Home,I see. And how did you get that?
106208,409,55,346000,Memory Wiggum,Simpson Home,"What gives, Simpson? Giving your wife an Irish kiss?"
106209,409,56,349000,Memory Homer,Simpson Home,"No, I swear!"
106210,409,57,350000,Memory Marge,Simpson Home,It was my fault! I... I walked into a door.
106181,409,58,354000,Memory Wiggum,Simpson Home,"""Walked into a door, huh?"" That is the lamest excuse I ever--"
106211,409,59,359000,Memory Wiggum,Simpson Home,"All right, door -- you're coming downtown."
106213,409,61,365000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Marge had a black eye?! I could never do something like that! Could I?
106214,409,62,371000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,Why don't you ask the person who filed the complaint? Not that I am authorized to release that infor--
106215,409,63,375000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Flanders!
106216,409,64,375000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,"Fine, it was Flanders. Now since you know everything, who was Jack the Ripper?"
106217,409,65,379000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,The queen's private surgeonnn!
106218,409,66,381000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,Wow.
106220,409,68,382000,Chief Wiggum,Flanders Home,"Flanders, why did you call the cops last night?"
106221,409,69,385000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"I had to -- I heard a hubbub, Bub."
106222,409,70,387000,Homer Simpson,Flanders Home,What did I do?
106223,409,71,389000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"I can't say for sure, but as a Christian, I assume the worst."
106225,409,73,394000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What happened in this room? If only these walls could talk... people would pay to come see my amazing talking walls. And I could use that money to-- Hey, a memory!"

106228,409,76,416000,Memory Marge,Simpson Home,"No, it can't be! I would never hurt Marge! I'm a good man!"
106229,409,77,421000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Yeah, yeah. Me too."
106230,409,78,425000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Ya know, doin' this is just confirming a stereotype for you Mexicans."
106231,409,79,429000,Julio,Simpson Home,I am from Costa Rica!
106232,409,80,430000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,And I should care because?
106235,409,83,437000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Thank goodness you come to visit me, son! I can't take one more minute of this high school glee club pretending they don't hate being here."
106236,409,84,445000,High School Glee Club,Springfield Retirement Castle,"OH WHAT A NIGHT / YOU KNOW I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER NAME / BUT I WAS NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME / WHAT A LADY, WHAT A NIGHT..."

106241,409,88,470000,Grampa Simpson,Dimwillie's,"You come to me for help rememberin'? That's like asking your horse to do your taxes, which I did back in nineteen ninety-eight."
106242,409,89,479000,Homer Simpson,Dimwillie's,I'm afraid I did something to make Marge and the kids leave me.
106243,409,90,483000,Grampa Simpson,Dimwillie's,"Wait, I know someone who can help ya -- a doctor who helps people dig up old memories."
106244,409,91,488000,Homer Simpson,Dimwillie's,"Really? Well, that's great, Dad. How can I ever repay you?"
106245,409,92,492000,Grampa Simpson,Dimwillie's,Punch that orderly who takes sips out of my juice.
106246,409,93,495000,Homer Simpson,Dimwillie's,Done.
106248,409,95,500000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"No wait, that's the guy that saved my life."
106251,409,98,505000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Medical Office,"Mr. Simpson, I have built a device that will enable you to explore your memories. The science was easy, but now I've got the hard part, coming up with a name."
106252,409,99,514000,Homer Simpson,Medical Office,How 'bout The Deja Viewmaster?
106253,409,100,516000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Medical Office,Uhh...
106254,409,101,517000,Homer Simpson,Medical Office,Remembrance of things fast?
106255,409,102,517000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Medical Office,Hmm...
106256,409,103,518000,Homer Simpson,Medical Office,The Rememberererer?
106257,409,104,520000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Medical Office,We don't have to come up with it now.
106259,409,106,522000,Old People,TREATMENT ROOM,/ My wedding! / A new puppy! / My first beard! /
106260,409,107,526000,Professor Jonathan Frink,TREATMENT ROOM,These wonderful wrinkle-bags are reliving their cherished memories of yesteryear.
106261,409,108,531000,Old Jewish Man,TREATMENT ROOM,"Ah, my first Christmas. Such great Chinese food."
106262,409,109,535000,Homer Simpson,TREATMENT ROOM,"This is great! I'm finally gonna find out how I ruined my family! Strap me in, nerd!"
106263,409,110,541000,Professor Jonathan Frink,TREATMENT ROOM,"To me, ""nerd"" stands for ""Not Even Remotely Dorky,"" so thank you. Thank you for the compliment."
106264,409,111,546000,Professor Jonathan Frink,TREATMENT ROOM,Now you'll feel a slight pinch... followed by an extremely painful pinch. Signaling that the spike will begin boring into your skull three seconds later.
106265,409,112,556000,Homer Simpson,TREATMENT ROOM,Bo-ring.
106266,409,113,557000,Professor Jonathan Frink,TREATMENT ROOM,"Yes, that's right, boring."

106270,409,118,571000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pond,"""This bubble allows you to view any past event from your life."" It's got that new bubble smell."
106271,409,119,580000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pond,"Aw, I landed in a pleasant memory -- look at happy me and playful them."
106272,409,120,586000,Memory Homer,Springfield Pond,And we're off!
106273,409,121,587000,Memory Homer,Springfield Pond,Now remember -- steer into the sculptures.
106275,409,123,603000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pond,"Oh, I miss those bygone days of earlier this week. But I'm needed in a darker place."
106277,409,125,630000,Memory Homer,Simpson Home,Those squeaks sound like couch springs. Groovin' to the beat of love!
106278,409,126,637000,Memory Marge,Simpson Home,Homer?! I wasn't expecting you.
106279,409,127,644000,Memory Homer,Simpson Home,"Hey, what's going on here?!"
106280,409,128,646000,Memory Marge,Simpson Home,"Oh Homer, I didn't want you to find out this way."
106281,409,129,650000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Another man... with my wife... in my house... on top of my TV Guide?
106282,409,130,657000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've gotta find out who that guy is, but I need help. Someone like Bart, only smart. Lisa!"
106284,409,132,671000,Memory Homer,Springfield Pond,Another me? You can watch the kids.
106285,409,133,673000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pond,"Lisa, I'm about to probe the most shattering moment of my life. You wanna join me?"
106286,409,134,679000,Memory Lisa,Springfield Pond,Might as well. You're getting this memory mixed up with a commercial you saw.
106287,409,135,682000,Announcer,Springfield Pond,"With new Synergy Wireless, nighttime minutes start at six-thirty, and you get four free d-cast downloads per month. Synergy -- it's your call."
106288,409,136,703000,Memory Bart,Springfield Pond,"Yo, Homer! Can you take me to when you were ten to see if I can kick your butt?"
106289,409,137,706000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Pond,Bring it on.
106291,409,139,711000,10-Year-Old Homer,PLAYGROUND,You're superior to me in every way!
106292,409,140,714000,Homer Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"Well, let's see how you do against twenty-year-old Homer."
106294,409,142,720000,20-Year-Old Homer,Homer's Apartment,What is it you want from me? Money? Weed?
106295,409,143,724000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,I'll teach you to beat up yester-me!
106296,409,144,734000,Memory Lisa,Homer's Apartment,"Dad, you just destroyed your first kiss."
106297,409,145,737000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Who was it with?
106298,409,146,738000,Memory Bart,Homer's Apartment,Uh... Apu.
106299,409,147,739000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Apartment,Right.
106300,409,149,748000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Memory,"Kids, your mom is with another man, and I need you to help me find out who he is. Hm... is this really something I should show you kids?"
106301,409,150,755000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Memory,"It's okay -- we're not really your kids. We're just representations of them, that you created in your mind."
106302,409,151,760000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Memory,Really? Then if I created all this... that means I can have pizza anytime I want!
106303,409,152,767000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Memory,"Hello, I'd like to order a pizza. Thirty-five minutes?!"
106305,409,154,774000,Memory Homer,Simpson Home,"Hey, what's going on here?!"
106306,409,155,777000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,See? That's where my memory stops. Who the heck is that guy?
106307,409,156,781000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What if you just moved the bottle?
106308,409,157,783000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right. Let me just get out of this bubble smoothly and elegantly.
106309,409,158,793000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How can I get my memory to work?
106310,409,159,797000,Memory Lisa,Simpson Home,"Declarative memory can be broken into two subsets: the episodic forms are stored in the neocortex, while the semantic ones are--"
106311,409,160,804000,Memory Lisa,Simpson Home,"Oh, can that tuna! We can get your brain to work the same way you always get the TV to work -- by hitting it!"
106314,409,163,818000,Memory Homer,Simpson Home,"Hey, what's going on here?!"
106315,409,164,820000,Memory Marge,Simpson Home,"Oh Homer, I didn't want you to find out this way."
106316,409,165,826000,Memory Marge,Simpson Home,Duffman!

106321,409,170,836000,Memory Duffman,Simpson Home,I'm just givin' it to your wife. She is gonna be sore tomorrow.
106322,409,171,841000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Noooo!
106324,409,173,843000,Homer Simpson,Clinic,Your stupid invention made me realize my life is worthless!
106325,409,174,847000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Clinic,"Well, if you can't stand the neural activity, stay out of the neural activator!"
106326,409,175,852000,Old Jewish Man,Clinic,So I did have butternut squash last night.
106328,409,177,858000,Old Jewish Man,Deserted Street,My wife left me. I've done horrible things. My family's gone.
106330,409,179,863000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,My life is ruined.
106331,409,180,866000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Goodbye, cruel world."

106337,409,186,887000,Selma Bouvier,Bridge,Jump and we'll carry you to Heaven.
106338,409,187,889000,Selma Bouvier,Bridge,"Hey, aren't trolls supposed to be under the bridge? Ha, ha, goodbye."
106339,409,188,895000,Selma Bouvier,Bridge,"C'mon, what are you waiting for?"
106340,409,189,897000,Patty Bouvier,Bridge,We want to see if the splash reaches the moon.
106341,409,190,900000,Selma Bouvier,Bridge,Good one.
106342,409,191,901000,Homer Simpson,Bridge,"Wait a minute -- if killing myself would make you two happy, then I'm not gonna do it."
106343,409,192,905000,Patty Bouvier,Bridge,"Don't worry about our happiness -- for once, think of yourself."
106345,409,194,913000,Homer Simpson,Bridge,My life's flashing before my eyes.
106347,409,196,977000,Homer Simpson,BELOW BRIDGE,A life well-lived. Until last night. I guess I'll have to watch that now.
106349,409,198,987000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, what's going on here?!"
106350,409,199,989000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Homer, I didn't want you to find out this way. We were planning a surprise party for you."

106352,409,201,1000000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This magic marker's running out of ink.
106353,409,202,1004000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm sorry your surprise party was spoiled.
106354,409,203,1006000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you kidding? The mother of my children with the reason for my children! This is gonna be the greatest party ever!
106355,409,204,1014000,Duffman,Simpson Home,"Oh yeah! Duff beer is sponsoring the party, featuring new Duff Champagne -- the beer of champagnes!"
106356,409,205,1022000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh my God! It's like Christmas in December! Let's celebrate now.
106357,409,206,1027000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Stop, Homer! Please!"
106358,409,207,1030000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,My eye!
106359,409,208,1033000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry honey, I'll get you an ice pack. Where's the ice pack?"
106360,409,209,1036000,Duffman,Simpson Home,I'm just giving it to your wife.
106361,409,210,1038000,Duffman,Simpson Home,She is gonna be sore tomorrow.
106364,409,212,1041000,Homer Simpson,AIR BELOW BRIDGE,"So Marge wasn't cheating on me, I never hit her, and my family is throwing me an awesome party. Thank God I figured it out before I did anything stupid."
106365,409,213,1056000,Homer Simpson,AIR BELOW BRIDGE,"Oh, right."
106367,409,215,1063000,Homer Simpson,AIR BELOW BRIDGE,Oh my God! I'm not dead!
106368,409,216,1067000,Marge Simpson,AIR BELOW BRIDGE,"Homie, this is your party!"
106369,409,217,1071000,Homer Simpson,AIR BELOW BRIDGE,This is great! I must be the first gullible husband to overhear snippets of surprise party planning and think it was my wife having an affair.
106371,409,219,1085000,Duffman,Duff Party Boat,"Oh yeah! Keep it up, people -- the night is young!"
106372,409,220,1091000,Duffman,Duff Party Boat,"Um, it's eleven -- do you want to pay for the extra hour, er?"

106377,409,225,1102000,Carl Carlson,Duff Party Boat,Your plan to make the surprise party a surprise again. Remember?
106379,409,227,1110000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Marge put so much work into that party. The least I could do is be surprised. If only I could forget what happened today.
106380,409,228,1118000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"I got just the drink to wipe your mind clean... the ""Forget-Me-Shot."" Fellas, if you got anything that you want to say to Homer that he'll never remember, say it now."
106381,409,229,1125000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Blue pants make you look fat.
106382,409,230,1127000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,I've never learned your kids' names.
106383,409,231,1128000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Your yard is unkempt.
106384,409,232,1130000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,It is obvious you're bald.
106385,409,233,1131000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Your thighs make noise.
106386,409,234,1132000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,I find your small hands attractive.
106387,409,235,1135000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I've spit in every drink I ever served you. Bottoms up!
106388,409,236,1138000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hmmm... The only problem is, I'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding Duffman. No doubt I'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. And that will make me want to jump off a--"
106389,409,237,1153000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"For the love of God, make sure the party boat has a moon-bounce."
106390,409,238,1156000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Okay.
106392,409,240,1158000,Lenny Leonard,PARTY BOAT,"Wow, I'm a genius. But there are still a few things I don't understand. Like why did Marge lie to Chief Wiggum about how she got that black eye?"
106393,409,241,1170000,Marge Simpson,PARTY BOAT,"Because I didn't want him finding out about the party. I mean, he's okay, but you know he'd bring Sarah, and I just don't care for that woman."
106394,409,242,1179000,Homer Simpson,PARTY BOAT,"And when you pushed me off the bridge, it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure I got here."
106395,409,243,1184000,Patty Bouvier,PARTY BOAT,"Yeah, that must be it."
106396,409,244,1186000,Selma Bouvier,PARTY BOAT,"You know, there's an after-party at the bottom of the ocean."
106397,409,245,1189000,Selma Bouvier,PARTY BOAT,This is good for two free drinks.
106398,409,246,1191000,Homer Simpson,PARTY BOAT,Hmmm... The only thing that still doesn't make sense is why the dog attacked me.
106399,409,247,1197000,Bart Simpson,PARTY BOAT,"Because you never feed him, walk him or let him out to pee."
106400,409,248,1200000,Homer Simpson,PARTY BOAT,Oh yeah.
106401,409,249,1202000,Homer Simpson,PARTY BOAT,Who's an angry dog? Who's an angry dog?
106402,409,250,1206000,Duffman,PARTY BOAT,Now who wants a beer? Ha-ha!
106403,409,251,1213000,Duffman,PARTY BOAT,To a man I'm happy to call my best friend Homer Simpsno! Simpson! Dyslexia -- Duffman's secret shame.
106404,409,252,1227000,Marge Simpson,PARTY BOAT,Aren't you going to drink?
106405,409,253,1229000,Homer Simpson,PARTY BOAT,"No, this is a moment I want to remember."
