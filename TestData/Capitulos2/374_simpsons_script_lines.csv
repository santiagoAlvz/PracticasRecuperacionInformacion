96979,374,12,68000,Captain Horatio McCallister,The Frying Dutchman,"Until then, perhaps an old sea yarn might pass the time."
96980,374,13,76000,Captain Horatio McCallister,The Frying Dutchman,Too bad I don't know any.
96981,374,14,78000,Lisa Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,"I know one, about the most important sea voyage in American history. The journey of the Mayflower."
96982,374,15,84000,Captain Horatio McCallister,The Frying Dutchman,"Ah yes, the ship that brought prostitutes to America."
96983,374,16,88000,Lisa Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,"Not prostitutes, Protestants."
96984,374,17,91000,Captain Horatio McCallister,The Frying Dutchman,Now who's being naive?
96985,374,18,93000,Lisa Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,The year was sixteen twenty...
96988,374,21,100000,Marge Simpson,DOCKS,"Hurry, my little Puritans -- we must flee England and its insufficiently Puritanical ways."
96989,374,22,107000,Marge Simpson,DOCKS,Do you have your shipboard entertainments?
96990,374,23,109000,Bart Simpson,DOCKS,I've got my toy wood lump!

96998,374,31,134000,Beefeater Carl,DECK OF THE SHIP,He's wanted for daring to question why we call this the Jacobean era when the king's name is James and not Jacob!
96999,374,32,142000,Lisa Simpson,DECK OF THE SHIP,"Mother, we must protect him. Look, he's praying."

97010,374,43,179000,Homer Simpson,Mayflower,What kind of a booze cruise is this? Where's the hooch?
97011,374,44,183000,FLANDISH,Mayflower,"We Puritans have no place for drunkenness... or colorful clothes, or dreaming, or poetry. So if you write a sonnet, keep it under your bonnet! Oh no, that was a poem!"
97012,374,45,196000,FLANDISH,Mayflower,"Forgive me, Lord! Then, pour a little salt in the wounds... and I'm good."
97013,374,46,201000,Marge Simpson,Mayflower,"I see you met our devout leader, Ned Flandish."
97014,374,47,204000,Homer Simpson,Mayflower,"Stupid Flandish. Uh, listen, since all the other fun stuff is out of bounds, how 'bout a little Bible-thumping in the crow's nest? What do you say, Miss..."

97022,374,55,224000,Moezekiel,Mayflower,"We're engaged! I didn't kill her husband just so... I mean, I didn't kill her husband."
97023,374,56,229000,Marge Simpson,Mayflower,We're not engaged.
97024,374,57,230000,Marge Simpson,Mayflower,It's really more of an amiable concordance.
97026,374,58,234000,FLANDISH,Mayflower,"Such language from a woman... Oh no, I just thought of you as a woman!"
97027,374,59,241000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Mayflower,"Lord we thank you for the many ways you show your love: the sun which bakes our lips to the point of bleeding, and your hilarious idea to surround us with water that would kill us if we drank it."
97028,374,60,256000,Moezekiel,Mayflower,"Now I gotta warn ya, even for this day and age, I'm considered a bad husband."
97029,374,61,261000,Homer Simpson,Mayflower,She's gonna marry him 'cause he wears boots instead of blackening his feet.
97031,374,63,270000,Bart Simpson,Mayflower,"Well, I'm sure the way to win her heart is to be fat and crying."
97032,374,64,274000,Homer Simpson,Mayflower,Why thee little...
97035,374,67,281000,Marge Simpson,Mayflower,Oh don't stop -- you're choking him just the way his father used to.
97036,374,68,285000,Marge Simpson,Mayflower,Good times.
97038,374,70,289000,Marge Simpson,Mayflower,Perhaps thou wouldst make a good father!
97039,374,71,293000,Homer Simpson,Mayflower,May I escort you to the railing?
97040,374,72,297000,Moezekiel,Mayflower,"Oh my God, look at that hand-on-hand action! If I don't do somethin', soon they'll be exchanging pleasantries."
97041,374,73,303000,Marge Simpson,Mayflower,"Yes, the weather is fair."
97042,374,74,305000,Moezekiel,Mayflower,"Man, that guy sends my humors from sanguine to bilious! That's how we talk. Weird, huh?"
97043,374,75,311000,Moezekiel,Mayflower,Time to think of a plan most sneaky.
97044,374,76,314000,Moezekiel,Mayflower,"Anyways, I just wanted to let you know, that I'm throwin' a little party tonight to celebrate that only half of us have died so far."
97046,374,78,325000,Homer Simpson,SHIP DECK,Beer? I thought you guys didn't drink on the Gayflower.
97047,374,79,329000,Moezekiel,SHIP DECK,Stop callin' it that!
97048,374,80,330000,Homer Simpson,SHIP DECK,What-ever.
97049,374,81,331000,Moezekiel,SHIP DECK,"I was savin' this booze to mess up the Indians, but uh, seein' what good pals we are, I wanted to give you a taste."
97050,374,82,338000,Moezekiel,SHIP DECK,"Say, I know a good drinking game: take a sip every time a wave hits the ship."
97051,374,83,345000,Moezekiel,SHIP DECK,"Oh, you're good at this."
97054,374,86,350000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Mayflower,"Oh Lord, thank you for this generous rain and abundant lightning."
97056,374,87,358000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Mayflower,Obviously kissing your ass is getting me nowhere.
97057,374,88,365000,FLANDISH,Mayflower,This storm's blown us off course! And where's our crew?
97058,374,89,368000,Moezekiel,Mayflower,"I'll show you where they are. You don't wanna miss this, Marge."
97059,374,90,374000,Mayflower Crew,Mayflower,Sin! Sin! Sin!
97060,374,91,376000,FLANDISH,Mayflower,Horseplay? Roughhousing? Horse-housing?
97061,374,92,381000,Moezekiel,Mayflower,And here's the knave what's responsible.
97062,374,93,385000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Mayflower,That's all I needed to hear.
97064,374,95,390000,Marge Simpson,Mayflower,"Homer, I can't believe I was thinking of letting you touch my elbow through a cloth!"
97065,374,96,395000,Homer Simpson,Mayflower,"But baby, a man has needs."
97066,374,97,401000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Mayflower,Our Captain's be-head-bumped!
97067,374,98,403000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Mayflower,I guess we'll never make it to the new world.
97068,374,99,406000,Bart Simpson,Mayflower,"When we landed, I was gonna denounce my sister as a witch."
97069,374,100,410000,Lisa Simpson,Mayflower,"I keep telling you, the ability to add two-digit numbers is not witchcraft!"
97070,374,101,415000,Bart Simpson,Mayflower,Thirty-one plus forty-three.
97071,374,102,416000,Lisa Simpson,Mayflower,Seventy-four.
97072,374,103,417000,Pilgrims,Mayflower,Witch! Witch! Witch!
97073,374,104,419000,Homer Simpson,Mayflower,"People, this is madness! We can burn the witch later! Right now, I've got to save this ship!"
97074,374,105,426000,Homer Simpson,Mayflower,"Hey, I've been driving drunk since I was twelve! But first...who's gonna help me pee?"
97075,374,106,432000,Pilgrim Smithers,Mayflower,They're looking at me 'cause I have the key to the stocks.
97076,374,107,441000,Homer Simpson,Mayflower,"Don't worry, Marge. I'll see to it you fundamentalist Christians live to take over all America by the twenty-first century!"
97077,374,108,452000,Marge Simpson,Mayflower,Look!
97078,374,109,454000,Marge Simpson,Mayflower,An albatross! It can lead us to safety.
97080,374,111,460000,Homer Simpson,Ocean,"Man, that bird did it all. Good guy."
97082,374,113,463000,FLANDISH,Mayflower,I just thought of a name for where we're going: New England!
97083,374,114,467000,Brother Willie,Mayflower,"Oh, that's real creative. Whaddaya call your foot? ""New Hand?"""
97084,374,115,472000,FLANDISH,Mayflower,At least I'm pitching!
97085,374,116,475000,Homer Simpson,Mayflower,Land ho!
97086,374,117,477000,Marge Simpson,Mayflower,What'd you call me?
97089,374,119,482000,FLANDISH,PLYMOUTH COLONY,"Great Chief Wig-gum, we could never have survived our first year in the New World without you. I almost regret what we Europeans are gonna do to ya."
97090,374,120,490000,Chief Wiggum,PLYMOUTH COLONY,Wha-what are you gonna do?
97091,374,121,492000,FLANDISH,PLYMOUTH COLONY,Give you the biggest slice of pumpkin pie!
97092,374,122,496000,FLANDISH,PLYMOUTH COLONY,"Also, we're gonna take your land and wipe you out. Who wants whipped topping?"
97094,374,124,507000,Captain Horatio McCallister,The Frying Dutchman,Here's your bill. And will there be anything else?
97095,374,125,510000,Lisa Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,We haven't gotten our food yet!
97096,374,126,512000,Captain Horatio McCallister,The Frying Dutchman,I'll look into it.
97097,374,127,514000,Marge Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,Who else has a story?
97098,374,128,517000,Homer Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,I do!
97099,374,129,519000,Marge Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,"Homer, you can tell the third story. Bart will tell the second, which is usually the weakest."
97100,374,130,521000,Bart Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,Hey!
97101,374,131,525000,Marge Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,I'm just trying to take the pressure off of you.
97102,374,132,528000,Bart Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,"Well, one time I read this boring comic book about a ship called ""The Bounty..."""
97103,374,133,534000,Marge Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,"Ooh, like the paper towels. Go on..."
97106,374,136,546000,Fletcher Christian,BOUNTY,Captain Bligh! There's a message from Admiral Nelson!
97107,374,137,548000,Bligh,BOUNTY,"Thank you, Mr. Christian."

97109,374,139,555000,Nelson Muntz,BOUNTY,Haw-haw!
97110,374,140,558000,Bligh,BOUNTY,"Well, when you eat as much dolphin as I do, there's bound to be a booger or two in the mix."
97113,374,143,565000,Bligh,BOUNTY,"Good morning, crew. Welcome to day seven eighteen of our voyage. Today's announcements:"
97114,374,144,569000,Bligh,BOUNTY,"First of all, in an effort to save water, you will no longer be given any water."
97115,374,145,575000,Bligh,BOUNTY,And because of a drawing of myself having romantic congress with a mer-man...
97117,374,147,584000,Bligh,BOUNTY,I am dumping all your mail from home into the sea.
97118,374,148,589000,Bligh,BOUNTY,"And I can assure you, there were cookies in there. Good cookies. The kind only a loving mother or Milhouse's father could make."
97119,374,149,597000,Milhouse Van Houten,BOUNTY,My father's alive?
97088,374,150,598000,Bligh,BOUNTY,"No, he died while baking. It's all in the letter."
97121,374,152,603000,Jimbo Jones,BOUNTY,I'm getting pretty tired of that seawad!
97122,374,153,606000,DOLPH,BOUNTY,This is nothing like the recruiting brochure!
97123,374,154,611000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,BOUNTY,Maybe that's what happens on the last day.
97124,374,155,615000,Bosun Willie,BOUNTY,"I warn ye, Captain, push this crew too far and there'll be mutiny."
97125,374,156,620000,Bligh,BOUNTY,Mutiny? On The Bounty? What have you been smoking?
97126,374,157,624000,Bosun Willie,BOUNTY,Opium.
97127,374,158,624000,Bligh,BOUNTY,Besides that.
97130,374,161,634000,King Homer,PALAPA,"Welcome to our tropical paradise. Enjoy our luaus, our lagoons and our ladies... and remember, what happens in Tahiti, stays in Tahiti."
97131,374,162,644000,Queen Marge,PALAPA,"Because we have no way of communicating with the outside world! Tell me, has Robert Fulton invented the steamboat yet?"
97132,374,163,651000,Jimbo Jones,PALAPA,Any day now!
97134,374,165,674000,Tahitian Man,PALAPA,"I'm telling you, I don't look like that! Make another!"
97135,374,166,678000,Sculptor,PALAPA,"Yes, Lord Ugly-Face."
97136,374,167,683000,Tahitian Juggler,PALAPA,"Don't just sit there, help me!"
97137,374,168,686000,King Homer,PALAPA,"Ba-bye. Bye, bye. Thanks for staying with us... we appreciate your putting cloth over our women's boobies... you'll receive an updated bill after you leave... Bye, bye."
97140,374,171,697000,Milhouse Van Houten,BOUNTY,I wish we were back in Tahiti.
97141,374,172,700000,Bligh,BOUNTY,"Why yes, it was truly an unforgettable vacation. I order you to forget it!"
97143,374,174,706000,Bligh,BOUNTY,"And while you're working, I want to hear a sea chantey.... in a round!"
97144,374,175,710000,Half Of Crew,BOUNTY,ROW ROW ROW YOUR BOAT / GENTLY DOWN THE STREAM...

97147,374,178,720000,Bligh,BOUNTY,You're off-key! Make that song your own! You don't sound like you've ever been on a boat in your life!
97148,374,179,731000,Bligh,BOUNTY,What the?
97149,374,180,732000,Fletcher Christian,BOUNTY,"Captain, this is a mutiny."
97150,374,181,734000,Bligh,BOUNTY,"Well, let's not be hasty. What if I introduce a suggestion box?"
97151,374,182,740000,DOLPH,BOUNTY,We have a suggestion box. You made it from the head of the last guy who had a suggestion.
97025,374,184,749000,Bosun Willie,BOUNTY,I warned ye there'd be mutiny.
97153,374,185,752000,Bligh,BOUNTY,"Just start rowing, Willie. And sing a round while you do."
97154,374,186,756000,Bosun Willie,BOUNTY,"ROW, ROW / ROW YOUR BOAT / GENTLY / ROW ROW / MERRILY, MERRILY / BOUND THE DOWN THE / GENTLY DOWN THE, MERRILY DOWN THE-- I cannot do it. I'm only one man!"
97155,374,187,769000,Bligh,BOUNTY,You'll sing or you'll mutiny. And you're too much of a spineless coward for that.
97156,374,188,777000,Bligh,BOUNTY,Swim faster or I'll have you made into soup. What're you gonna do? Go underwater? I'd like to see that.
97158,374,190,786000,Bligh,BOUNTY,You call this deep?
97159,374,191,790000,Fletcher Christian,BOUNTY,"This is your new captain saying ""Next stop, Tahiti""!"
97161,374,193,790000,Fletcher Christian,BOUNTY,"And we're gonna remove all evidence of the previous regime, starting with this stupid wheel."
97162,374,194,805000,Bart Simpson,BOUNTY,Uh-oh.
97163,374,195,810000,Fletcher Christian,BOUNTY,"Well, I know you had your doubts, men, but there they are: the most beautiful women in the world."

97170,374,202,834000,Lisa Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,I'm starting to think the Sea Captain isn't coming back.

97174,374,206,851000,Homer Simpson,The Frying Dutchman,"Well, I guess we have time for my tale of moist adventure. It takes place in a dark time for mankind when madness and ignorance ruled: ""the nineteen seventies."""
