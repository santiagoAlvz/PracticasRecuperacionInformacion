72152,284,34,164000,Homer Simpson,PHONE COMPANY,"Marge, it's called negotiating."
72154,284,36,173000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, fascinating."
72155,284,37,173000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I need to call Janey, but I can't get a dial tone."
72156,284,38,176000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"We're not paying our bill, so the phone company shut off our service."
72157,284,39,181000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why must you fight with every utility?

72161,284,43,196000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,Oh we tried. But a recording said you were a bunch of deadbeats.
72162,284,44,201000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it. They have awoken a sleeping giant.
72163,284,45,206000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, what are you going to do?"
72164,284,46,208000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Crazy scheme, crazy scheme, crazy scheme..."

72174,284,56,241000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Maybe the red one...
72176,284,58,249000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How did I get here?
72177,284,59,250000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,We found you smoldering in the bushes.
72178,284,60,252000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it. We're just going to have to pay for that call to Brazil.
72179,284,61,256000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What call to Brazil?
72180,284,62,258000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The one I didn't make and Marge didn't make and Bart didn't make and hence no one in the house made.
72181,284,63,263000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh.
72182,284,64,264000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You made that call? But you're the good one.
72183,284,65,268000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, the one we both like."
72184,284,66,270000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why did you do it?
72185,284,67,272000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Please don't be mad. I've been sponsoring an orphan boy in Brazil.
72186,284,68,276000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, aren't you sweet? Sharing your allowance with a poor Brazilian boy."
72187,284,69,282000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't you know the boys from Brazil are little Hitlers? I saw it in a movie. Whose name I can't remember.
72188,284,70,289000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ronaldo used to send me a letter every month, but then they stopped. That's why I called the orphanage, but they said he'd disappeared."
72189,284,71,295000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How come you talked for four hundred dollars?
72190,284,72,298000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, then they started pressuring me for more donations. And you can't hang up on a nun."
72191,284,73,304000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's right. They have powers.
72192,284,74,309000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"When I sent my first donation, the charity mailed me this video."
72193,284,75,315000,Ronaldo,Simpson Home,"Hi, Lisa. Thank you for your donation. Because of your generosity, I bought sturdy shoes that will last for a thousand sambas."
72194,284,76,328000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Awww.
72195,284,77,329000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He's so adorable. Can we have another baby?
72196,284,78,333000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No way. I still haven't lost the weight I put on from the last one.
72198,284,79,337000,Ronaldo,Simpson Home,"And with the money left over, the orphanage was able to buy a door."
72199,284,80,341000,Ronaldo,Simpson Home,Now the monkeys cannot bite me. Uh-oh.
72200,284,81,350000,Ronaldo,Simpson Home,I am like sugar to them.
72201,284,82,355000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that poor little boy. We've got to find him."
72202,284,83,358000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How many people live in Brazil?
72203,284,84,360000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,A hundred and fifty-six million.
72205,284,86,363000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we've got to find him! What? I'm really concerned. Fine, I want to meet monkeys."
72206,284,87,371000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't know, it's awfully expensive to fly to Brazil."
72207,284,88,375000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not if we buy our tickets on the internet. It's really cheap if we change planes in Phoenix, Honolulu, Sun City, and East St. Louis, spend a night in a haunted house and leave right now."
72208,284,89,384000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Then it's settled. The Simpsons are going to Brazil.
72209,284,90,388000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Then I'll have been on every continent.
72210,284,91,390000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Except Antarctica.
72211,284,92,391000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The Simpsons are going to Antarctica. Next year. This year, Brazil."
72214,284,95,403000,Lisa Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,"Okay, here's some travel tips: only drink bottled water... don't get into an unlicensed taxi... and remember, they have winter during our summer."
72215,284,96,412000,Homer Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So in August... it's cold?"
72216,284,97,416000,Lisa Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,That's right.
72217,284,98,417000,Homer Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,And in February... it's hot?
72218,284,99,419000,Lisa Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,Mm-hmm.
72219,284,100,420000,Homer Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,"So it's opposite land. Crooks chase cops, cats have puppies..."
72220,284,101,426000,Lisa Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,"No Dad, it's just the weather."
72221,284,102,428000,Homer Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,So hot snow falls up?
72222,284,103,430000,Lisa Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,Yes.
72223,284,104,431000,Homer Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,Woo hoo!
72224,284,105,436000,Bart Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,"Get ready, Brazil. I now speak fluent Spanish."
72225,284,106,440000,Marge Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,"Well done Bart, but in Brazil they speak Portuguese."
72226,284,107,444000,Bart Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,"Ay caramba, que mujer tonta! Veinte horas estudiar por nada!"
72227,284,108,448000,Homer Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,"Forget every word, boy. It's useless."
72228,284,109,450000,Marge Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,But Homer...
72197,284,110,451000,Homer Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,I said forget it!
71810,284,111,456000,Bart Simpson,Brazilian Airplane,All gone.
72229,284,113,459000,Pilot,Brazilian Airplane,"This is your Captain speaking. The local temperature in Rio de Janeiro is hot, hot, hot, with a hundred per cent chance of passion."
72231,284,115,466000,Co-pilot,Cockpit,"Bernardo, you make that joke every time."
72232,284,116,469000,Pilot,Cockpit,It was that joke that made you fall in love with me.
72234,284,118,475000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Hey Maggie, how ya doin' back there?"
72235,284,119,483000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Oh, so helpless."
72237,284,121,489000,Lisa Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,"Look, it's the giant statue of Christ on Corcovado."
72238,284,122,492000,Homer Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,Wow. It's like He's on the dashboard of the entire country.
72239,284,123,497000,Marge Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,It says here we can get anywhere we want by taking a conga line.
72240,284,124,502000,Homer Simpson,Rio de Janeiro,"Way ahead of you, Marge."

72247,284,131,540000,Lisa Simpson,Hotel Lobby,How to Loot Brazil?
72248,284,132,543000,Homer Simpson,Hotel Lobby,"I got it, I got, I got it."
72250,284,134,554000,Marge Simpson,Hotel Room,"Bart, what are you watching?"

72265,284,150,596000,Marge Simpson,RIO,What a charming neighborhood.
72266,284,151,598000,Lisa Simpson,RIO,"Mom, these are slums. The government just painted them bright colors so the tourists wouldn't be offended."
72267,284,152,604000,Marge Simpson,RIO,Works for me.
72268,284,153,605000,Bart Simpson,RIO,"Yeah, check out the rats."

72273,284,158,621000,Nun,RIO,"Ah yes, Ronaldo. He went out months ago and we haven't heard from him since. Every day we light a candle for him."

72275,284,160,631000,Nun,RIO,That's plan B.
72276,284,161,632000,Lisa Simpson,RIO,We're never gonna find him.
72277,284,162,636000,Homer Simpson,RIO,"Now Lisa, it's not as bleak as that. Can you fly me over town to look for him?"
72278,284,163,641000,Nun,RIO,We nuns cannot fly.
72279,284,164,642000,Homer Simpson,RIO,"Oh, too much junk in the trunk, eh?"
72280,284,165,645000,Nun,RIO,Yes.
72282,284,167,650000,Bart Simpson,Churrascarias,"Have some meat on a sword, Lisa. It'll cheer you up."

72285,284,170,661000,Marge Simpson,Churrascarias,Homer!
72286,284,171,663000,Lisa Simpson,Churrascarias,"Okay, on this map I marked all the places that Ronaldo liked to go. If we split up, we should be able to search them all."
72288,284,173,669000,Homer Simpson,Churrascarias,"We'll do our best, honey. Now let's get goin'."
72289,284,174,674000,Homer Simpson,Churrascarias,Check please.
72290,284,175,675000,Waiter,Churrascarias,"Ah, si?"

72306,284,191,745000,Teacher,Samba School,"Okay, this is a samba school, this is not a lost and found."
72308,284,193,750000,Teacher,Schoolhouse,This is where we invented the lambada and the macarena. We are now developing our most powerful dance: the Penetrada. It makes sex look like a church.
72309,284,194,762000,Marge Simpson,Schoolhouse,I don't think my daughter should hear this.
72310,284,195,765000,Teacher,Schoolhouse,You can't protect her forever! You stupid lady.
72312,284,197,772000,Homer Simpson,RIO,Gimme a drink with all your sweetest Brazilian fruits mixed together.

72316,284,201,792000,Bart Simpson,RIO,There's gotta be a million kids here. We'll never find Ronaldo.
72317,284,202,795000,Woman,RIO,Ronaldo?!
72318,284,203,795000,Bart Simpson,RIO,You know him?
72319,284,204,797000,Woman,RIO,"No, no. I was just distracting you while my children robbed you."
72321,284,206,805000,Marge Simpson,RIO,"Aw, look at all the stuffed coatimundi."
72322,284,207,808000,Lisa Simpson,RIO,I bet Maggie would like one.
72324,284,209,813000,Marge Simpson,RIO,I'll just get her this bracelet.
72325,284,210,817000,Marge Simpson,RIO,Everything here is something.
72327,284,212,819000,Homer Simpson,STREET IN RIO,"Hey, Bart. How many more places do we have to search?"
72328,284,213,823000,Bart Simpson,STREET IN RIO,"Just one, and it's across town."
72329,284,214,825000,Homer Simpson,STREET IN RIO,Taxi!
72330,284,215,828000,Taxi Driver,STREET IN RIO,"My American friend, I'm afraid that this is a kidnapping."
72331,284,216,832000,Homer Simpson,STREET IN RIO,So that means I don't have to pay the fare.
72332,284,217,834000,Taxi Driver,STREET IN RIO,I suppose.
72333,284,218,836000,Homer Simpson,STREET IN RIO,Woo hoo!
72334,284,219,844000,Taxi Driver,STREET IN RIO,I'm afraid you don't appreciate the seriousness of the situation.
72335,284,220,958000,Homer Simpson,STREET IN RIO,"Fine. Take me, but let the boy go."
72336,284,221,1043000,Taxi Driver,STREET IN RIO,I'm afraid he has already gone.
