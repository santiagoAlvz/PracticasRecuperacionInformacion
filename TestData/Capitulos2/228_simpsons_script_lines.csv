54927,228,1,91000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Principal Skinner, what would you say is the most important firefighting tool? Would you say it's prevention?"
54928,228,2,95000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Oh, absolutely, Lisa. That, and the sand bucket."
54929,228,3,99000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,What's that stuff?
54930,228,4,100000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Why this is retardant.

54933,228,7,104000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,That's called a hose lengthener.
54934,228,8,106000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,You need one.
54936,228,10,108000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,What's this?
54937,228,11,109000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Just read the label. It's a king-size flamer.
54939,228,13,113000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Bart, will you go bother someone else?"
54940,228,14,115000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"LOOK, A FIRE!..."
54941,228,15,115000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,... engine.
54942,228,16,117000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Stop that!
54943,228,17,117000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,HELP! HELP! FIRE!... ... helmets.
54944,228,18,121000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Can't you do something constructive?
54945,228,19,122000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Sure, I can do something destructive!"
54947,228,21,126000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Just say the word and I'll drive this hoe in his back. I can make it look like suicide.
54948,228,22,132000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Hm, and I want a bike, and a monkey, and a friend for the monkey..."
54949,228,23,137000,Hosey the Bear,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"You're not gonna start any fires, are you?"
54950,228,24,140000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"At my house we call 'em ""uh-oh's."""
54951,228,25,140000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Hi, fire doggie. Can you do any tricks?"
54952,228,26,146000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Tricks? Ha! That's rich. He's so inbred he can barely stand up.
54953,228,27,151000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Fire can be our servant, whether it's toasting s'mores, or raining down on Charlie. But it can turn not-so-nice, as you'll see in this skit by the Volunteer Fire Department Players."
54954,228,28,164000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Ho-ho! What a great pot party.
54955,228,29,166000,Maude Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Wasn't it, man?"
54956,228,30,168000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Now for a regular cigarette, to make the night complete. Oh! Man, that's good."
54957,228,31,175000,Maude Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Mad Dog, I been thinking... maybe we should get another smoke detector, in case that one trips out on us."
54958,228,32,181000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Ho-ho-ho! Why bother, baby? One smoke detector's enough for Mad Dog. Now let's hit the sack."
54959,228,33,194000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Check it out! Mad Dog's on fire!
54960,228,34,197000,Maude Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Stop, drop, and roll, man!"
54961,228,35,199000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Ha! Ha! Ha! That's for Clydes, baby. A little fire can't hurt you."
54962,228,36,204000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"But Mad Dog was wrong. The fire burned through the night, and cost him the use of his pants. Which just goes to show you..."
54964,228,38,205000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Oh!
54965,228,39,211000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Sorry to break character, but these stunt pants are getting pretty toasty!"
54966,228,40,215000,Maude Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Uh, roll, Neddie! Roll!"
54968,228,41,219000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,It's not working! It just spreads the flame!
54969,228,42,221000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Get the fire hose! Get the fire hose!
54970,228,43,226000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,What's it doing in the gymnasium?
54971,228,44,229000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Yeee-hawww!

54975,228,48,231000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Bart... Simpson!
54976,228,49,249000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,You've really done it this time.
54977,228,50,251000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Yeah, it all kinda came together."
54979,228,52,265000,Seymour Skinner,PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE,Thank you for coming.
54980,228,53,266000,Homer Simpson,PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE,Thank you for getting me out of work.
54981,228,54,268000,Seymour Skinner,PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE,I'll be blunt. Bart's latest escapade goes far beyond the realm of the hijink.
54983,228,56,272000,Groundskeeper Willie,Gym,There. Now the floor is as good as new.
54984,228,57,278000,Milhouse Van Houten,Gym,My sport goggles!
54985,228,58,280000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,"Your son is a ravenous demon, relentlessly gnawing at all that's good and true."
54986,228,59,285000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"Yeah, he's somethin' else, all right."
54987,228,60,287000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,"But worst of all, he drags down the grades of anyone who sits near him. Just look at this pattern."
54988,228,61,292000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"Hey, that looks like Bart."
54989,228,62,294000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,... And turning to the 3-D map...
54990,228,63,294000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,"We see an unmistakable ""cone of ignorance."""
54991,228,64,299000,Marge Simpson,Gym,Put it away. Put it away!
54992,228,65,301000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,"Very well, but there's no escaping the truth. Bart has a classic case of Attention Deficit Disorder."
54993,228,66,307000,Marge Simpson,Gym,You mean like John Leguizamo?
54994,228,67,308000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,"How should I know? The point is, A.D.D. makes children restless and easily distracted."
54995,228,68,313000,Homer Simpson,Gym,"Hi, Marge. It's me, Homer."
54997,228,70,316000,Homer Simpson,Gym,What? Time to go?
54998,228,71,317000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,"Please, Mr. Simpson. I'm afraid I'll have to expel your son."
55000,228,73,321000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,"... Unless you're willing to try a radical, untested, potentially dangerous..."
55001,228,74,325000,Homer Simpson,Gym,Candy bar?
55002,228,75,326000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,"No. It's a new drug called ""Focusyn."""
55003,228,76,328000,Marge Simpson,Gym,"A drug? I know Bart can be rambunctious, but he's not some hyperactive monster."
55004,228,77,334000,Bart Simpson,Gym,"Gimme an ""F!"""
55005,228,78,335000,Bart Simpson,Gym,"Gimme an ""art!"""
55006,228,79,337000,Seymour Skinner,Gym,Good Lord. He's gotten into the Pep Closet!
55007,228,80,338000,Homer Simpson,Gym,I'd say he's coming out of the Pep Closet.
55009,228,82,348000,Marge Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,I don't want to pump my little boy full of drugs.
55010,228,83,351000,Researcher #1,DRUG COMPANY,"Yeah, yeah, we get a lot of that."
55011,228,84,352000,Researcher #2,DRUG COMPANY,But then they see our results.
55012,228,85,355000,Researcher #1,DRUG COMPANY,"These are normal guinea pigs, running around like idiots."
55013,228,86,359000,Researcher #1,DRUG COMPANY,"Now, I'll give them some Focusyn."
55014,228,87,366000,Marge Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,That's amazing! ...And darling.

55016,228,89,374000,Homer Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,They become your slaves...
55017,228,90,376000,Researcher #2,DRUG COMPANY,"Yes, but it's not about slavery. It's about helping kids concentrate. This pill reduces class clownism 44 per cent."
55018,228,91,383000,Researcher #1,DRUG COMPANY,With 60 per cent less sass-mouth.
55019,228,92,385000,Researcher #2,DRUG COMPANY,The only thing more effective is regular exercise.

55041,228,113,435000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Son, let's forget all about that drug thing. Why don't you just come down and have some taffy?"
55042,228,114,442000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,"Nice try, Homer."
55043,228,115,443000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Just take one bite. If you're not one hundred per cent different...

55062,228,134,504000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not dope! It's something to help you concentrate.
55063,228,135,507000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,All I know is my testicles won't fit in my underwear.
55064,228,136,510000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! Get those oranges out of there.

55093,228,166,568000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"Well, it's not like I never saw a dog before."
148674,228,167,571000,Bart's Thoughts,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,That doesn't sound like me. Could it be the drug kicking in? I am feeling an urge to straighten up and fly right...
55094,228,168,578000,Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom,"C'mon, people. This poetry isn't gonna appreciate itself."

55144,228,219,740000,Bart Simpson,KITCHEN,And why did Humpty Dumpty have a great fall?
55145,228,220,743000,Navajo Boy,KITCHEN,Because... he took his eyes off the prize?
55146,228,221,746000,Bart Simpson,KITCHEN,"That's right. You stay on the ball, you stay on the wall."
55147,228,222,749000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"He's gone from Goofus to Gallant, and we owe it all to mind-bending pills."
55148,228,223,755000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,Bart's so well-behaved now... maybe you and I could have a night out!
55149,228,224,759000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,"Ooh, let's go to the waterpark. My ten-year ban ended yesterday."
55150,228,225,763000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,I was thinking of something a little more... adult.
55151,228,226,768000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,Oh... Marge!
55152,228,227,770000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,And then afterwards...
55153,228,228,770000,Homer Simpson,KITCHEN,Really? With butterscotch on it?
55154,228,229,776000,Marge Simpson,KITCHEN,I think you misheard me.
55157,228,232,780000,Choreographer,Theater,You've got more talent than any dancer I've ever seen. And you're throwing it all away.
55158,228,233,784000,Dancer,Theater,Screw you. Screw everybody!
55159,228,234,786000,Stage Manager,Theater,"All right, girls, tops off. It's showtime!"
55160,228,235,791000,Homer Simpson,Theater,"Marge, this is the greatest gift any wife has ever given her husband."
55161,228,236,795000,Marge Simpson,Theater,I thought you'd like it. And I'm enjoying the friendship between Showgirl and that seamstress.
55162,228,237,800000,Grampa Simpson,Theater,Pipe down!
55163,228,238,801000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Theater,"Yes, hush up."

55168,228,244,808000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,That was fun. We have to get out more often.
55169,228,245,811000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,I heard about a new bar where men dance with men. Doesn't that sound adorable?
55170,228,246,815000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Well, sure, if it's true."
55171,228,247,817000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Is that Lisa?
55173,228,249,823000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm so glad you're here. Bart's really acting funny.
55174,228,250,826000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ray J. funny... or O.J. funny?
55175,228,251,828000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You'll see...
55178,228,254,829000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Gotta get it done.
55179,228,255,831000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Bart? Honey?
55180,228,256,833000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Gotta finish.
55181,228,257,833000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Close the door!
55182,228,258,833000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,You're probably wondering about the coat hangers. They're to block the satellite that's been spying on me.
55183,228,259,843000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,O-kayyy.
55184,228,260,844000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,It can read your electronic organizer from space.
55185,228,261,847000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Even mine?
55186,228,262,850000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Hey, I had Lenny's name on that!"
55187,228,263,851000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,They have it now.
55188,228,264,853000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Who are ""they,"" exactly?"
55189,228,265,856000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Who else? Major League Baseball.
55190,228,266,858000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Maarge. I think Bart's gone crazy!
55191,228,267,861000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Oh, Bart, what's happened to you?"
55192,228,268,864000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Nothing yet. But the time draws near. Now, let's get those fillings out of you."
55193,228,269,866000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Aagghh!
55194,228,270,869000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Hey, you found my needlenose pliers."
55196,228,272,875000,Marge Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,"I understand the electrodes, but why does he have to be on a treadmill?"
55197,228,273,878000,Researcher #1,DRUG COMPANY,"Oh, that was his idea. He said he felt fat."
55198,228,274,880000,Marge Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,Oh.
55199,228,275,881000,Researcher #2,DRUG COMPANY,You said he was concerned about satellites.
55200,228,276,883000,Marge Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,And their beams.
55201,228,277,885000,Researcher #2,DRUG COMPANY,Any other strange behavior?
55203,228,278,886000,Homer Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,He quit blinking. He says that's when they get ya.
55204,228,279,888000,Researcher #2,DRUG COMPANY,I had a feeling this might happen.
55205,228,280,890000,Researcher #2,DRUG COMPANY,This carboxyl group sometimes causes problems.
55206,228,281,892000,Homer Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,After we trusted you...
55207,228,282,896000,Marge Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,I think we should take him off the drug.
55208,228,283,898000,Researcher #1,DRUG COMPANY,Whoa whoa whoa whoa WHOA. Ha. You can't just go OFF Focusyn.
55209,228,284,901000,Researcher #2,DRUG COMPANY,"But we can ease Bart onto one of its sister drugs, like chlorhexanol. And augment that with some phenylbutamine."
55210,228,285,907000,Researcher #1,DRUG COMPANY,Mm... and maybe some cyclobenzanone?
55211,228,286,909000,Researcher #2,DRUG COMPANY,That's a great idea!
55212,228,287,912000,Bart Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,No! You can't take my Focusyn! I need every brain cell blazing to outwit my invisible enemies!
55213,228,288,918000,Researcher #1,DRUG COMPANY,"I know you love Focusyn, son. But in time you'll get just as attached to these three amigos."
55214,228,289,924000,Bart Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,No!
55215,228,290,933000,Homer Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,Uh-oh. Somebody's gonna have a tummyache.
55216,228,291,937000,Marge Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,Stop him! He's wacked out of his gourd.
55217,228,292,940000,Researcher #1,DRUG COMPANY,Don't worry. We have a procedure for these situations.
55219,228,294,949000,Homer Simpson,DRUG COMPANY,"Hey, there was just air in mine."
55221,228,296,957000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"... And I'm really worried, Chief. There's no telling what he might do."
55223,228,298,961000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Okay, so you say your son is towheaded, button nose, mischievous smile, and may be armed with a slingshot. Got it. We'll find him, ma'am."
55224,228,299,971000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Looks like the kid who roughed up the Wilson widow.
55226,228,301,973000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my little guy's out there in the hot sun without his sombrero."
55227,228,302,977000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"We should have paid more attention to these side-effects. It's all here -- erratic behavior, paranoia, diarrhea..."
55228,228,303,983000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think he has diarrhea.
55229,228,304,985000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"But how do we know, Marge? How do we know?"
55233,228,307,994000,Soldier #1,ARMY BARRACKS,I can't believe it. Sarge said we're the worst bunch he's ever seen.
55234,228,308,997000,Soldier #2,ARMY BARRACKS,"See, I have to believe he's seen worse bunches than us."
55235,228,309,999000,Soldier #1,ARMY BARRACKS,But he said...
55236,228,310,1000000,Soldier #2,ARMY BARRACKS,"Yeah, I know what he said. He was just trying to motivate us."
55237,228,311,1002000,Soldier #1,ARMY BARRACKS,"Well, it ruined the whole hike."
55238,228,312,1009000,SOLIDIER #1,ARMY BARRACKS,Do you think Alex would mind if I asked Janet out?
55239,228,313,1011000,Soldier #2,ARMY BARRACKS,"They're married, idiot!"
55240,228,314,1013000,Soldier #1,ARMY BARRACKS,Why'd you have to yell? You ruined the whole shower.
55242,228,316,1017000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"So I gave up tap for jazz, and I've never regretted it. And here's why..."
55243,228,317,1021000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, you're supposed to be hunting for Bart!"
55244,228,318,1024000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I'm on top of it.
55245,228,319,1027000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,My sweet baby. He must feel so helpless and scared.
55247,228,321,1034000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,Don't stop / Thinkin' about tomorrow! / Don't stop / It'll soon be here...
55249,228,323,1042000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Smithers, we're at war!"
55250,228,324,1044000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"I'll begin profiteering, sir."
55251,228,325,1045000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,And hoarding! Leave it to the Democrats to let the Spaniards back in the pantry.
55253,228,327,1054000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,"Egad. A maniac, cutting a swath of destruction. This is a job for the Green Lantern, Thundra, or possiblyyy... Ghost Rider."

55277,228,352,1139000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Question.
55278,228,353,1141000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,How about getting out of the tank... huh maybe stopping your rampage? Huh? We could go to Krusty Burger...
55279,228,354,1148000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Okay. Sure.
55281,228,356,1149000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Right after I blow up one thing.
55283,228,358,1156000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Good lord, he's going to fire!"

55287,228,362,1175000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,The frame store! You monster!
55288,228,363,1180000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Not the sky! That's where clouds are born!
55291,228,366,1194000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Elementary School Yard,A satellite? What do we do? What do we do?
55292,228,367,1196000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"""Discotheques,"" ""Frat Houses,"" ""Malibu."" Nothing about satellite fires!"

55294,228,369,1204000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"That's the end of your Looney Tune, Drugs Bunny. You're under arrest for astro-vandalism."
55295,228,370,1210000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Elementary School Yard,And may God help you if that thing carried the Spice Channel.
55296,228,371,1215000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,Major League Baseball?
55297,228,372,1217000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,I told you they were monitoring my activities.

55303,228,378,1238000,Satellite,Springfield Elementary School Yard,Big Mac himself! Who'd-a thunk it?
55304,228,379,1241000,Mark McGwire,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"Young Bart here was right. We are spying on you, pretty much around the clock."
55305,228,380,1244000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Yard,"But why, Mr. McGwire?"
55306,228,381,1246000,Mark McGwire,Springfield Elementary School Yard,Do you want to know the terrifying truth? Or do you want to see me sock a few dingers?
55307,228,382,1250000,Onlookers,Springfield Elementary School Yard,Dingers! Dingers!
55308,228,383,1253000,Onlookers,Springfield Elementary School Yard,Oooooh!

55311,228,386,1263000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's good to have the old Bart back. Plus you exposed the disturbing unreadiness of today's Army.
55312,228,387,1268000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh honey, I'm so sorry we sent you on that psychotropic hayride."
55313,228,388,1272000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, at least I got to see some cool colors."
55314,228,389,1274000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And Mark McGwire gave you an autographed bat.
55315,228,390,1277000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Why is the zero made out of glass?
55316,228,391,1279000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who cares? That man can really slug.
55317,228,392,1283000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I'm not giving my baby any more dangerous drugs. From now on it's nothing but fresh air, lots of hugs, and good, old-fashioned Ritalin!"
55318,228,393,1292000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You said a mouthful!
55319,228,394,1294000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"When I can't stop fiddlin' / I just takes me Ritalin / I'm poppin' and sailin', man!"
