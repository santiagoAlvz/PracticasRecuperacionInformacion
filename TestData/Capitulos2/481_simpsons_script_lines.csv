124637,481,13,119000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, I can't do it. A balloon saved one of my arteries. It doesn't seem right to kill his cousin."

124674,481,48,326000,Bart Simpson,FOOTBALL STADIUM,Stop it!

124679,481,53,333000,Marge Simpson,FOOTBALL STADIUM,"Homie, maybe you should stop. We've talked about the gray zone..."
124680,481,54,337000,Homer Simpson,FOOTBALL STADIUM,"Marge, he's laughing, that means he's happy. Has the Joker taught you nothing?"

124683,481,57,353000,Sideshow Mel,FOOTBALL STADIUM,The child has wetted his trousers!

124686,481,60,368000,Homer Simpson,FOOTBALL STADIUM,"Oh, I don't know if I can... whoo!... ever make it up to you. I-- whoo!... but I sincerely whoo!"
124687,481,61,378000,Marge Simpson,FOOTBALL STADIUM,"Homer! Just because everyone else is doing the wave, doesn't mean you have to!"
124688,481,62,383000,Homer Simpson,FOOTBALL STADIUM,No one else is doing it. I'm trying to start it. Whoo!
124689,481,63,387000,Homer Simpson,FOOTBALL STADIUM,Whoo!
124692,481,66,394000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Master Bedroom,"...Taking pity on the boy, the operators of Springfield Stadium opened the stadium's retractable roof in an attempt to dry his pants."
124693,481,67,401000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Unfortunately, the stain was picked up by Russian spy satellites, and President Dmitry Medvedev has taken the pants-wetting as a sign of American weakness. A Russian flotilla has just entered New York harb--"
124694,481,68,411000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Bart's never gonna forgive me for humiliating him.
124695,481,69,414000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,And I wouldn't blame him. You destroyed our son's self-esteem.
124696,481,70,418000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Well, it was your idea to give him self-esteem in the first place!"
124698,481,72,422000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I told you you should've stopped the tickling.
124699,481,73,424000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Now I have to work overtime--
124700,481,74,424000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,What?
124701,481,75,426000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,--just to counteract the self-confidence--
124702,481,76,428000,Jimbo Jones,Bart's Bedroom,"Hey Bart, I hear the forecast is for showers... in your pants!"
124703,481,77,432000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Bart's Bedroom,"I'm on a European vacation, but you're-a peein' everywhere. Oui oui!"
124704,481,78,441000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Why did I agree to moderate this teleconference?
124706,481,80,445000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,You can't let this go without using it as a chance to improve your fathering.
124707,481,81,450000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Well of course, I would love to be a more sensitive father. You know that."
124708,481,82,456000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,That's great. Then you won't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class.
124709,481,83,460000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,I'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalogue and find one.
124711,481,85,465000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,There's one right here!
124712,481,86,467000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Please, Marge, no! The other negligent dads'll make fun of me! They're so cliquey!"
124713,481,87,474000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"You'll be fine, you always are."
124714,481,88,476000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,I miss my friends from drunk driving school. They were so cool.
124716,481,90,491000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,"Homer, welcome to Fresh Start: a fathering enrichment class. My name is Dr. Zander."
124717,481,91,497000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,"Last week we assigned everyone to keep a fathering journal. Gerald, would you like to share your entries?"
124718,481,92,501000,Gerald,COUNSELING CENTER,"Absolutely, Dr. Zander. Monday: left work early to see Derek's baseball game. When Derek saw me in the stands, his smile was worth a million dollars. Tuesday: Lost a million dollar account 'cause I left work early Monday."
124719,481,93,511000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,That's great journaling. Comments?
124721,481,94,519000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,"Uh, Homer, it says here you've been a father for ten years. What has that taught you?"
124722,481,95,523000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELING CENTER,"Well, for one thing, you're never really ready to be a father. But, oh, you know, the other day, Bart, the little dickens, said I had an elephant butt. So anyway, I'm strangling him, and I said to Bart..."
124723,481,96,536000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,Wait. Hold on a moment. You were strangling your son?
124724,481,97,539000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELING CENTER,"Yeah, strangling. I mean, it's not the only tool in my parenting toolbox, but it's the sharpest! Right? Anyway, I said ""Bart""..."
124725,481,98,549000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,You're actually serious! You physically lay your hands on your boy's neck?
124726,481,99,555000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELING CENTER,I guess it's just how I was raised.
148186,481,101,559000,Young Grampa,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,Look at these grades! They're a disgrace! No TV for a week!
148146,481,102,563000,Young Homer,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,Why you little!...
124728,481,104,569000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,"So... are those butter cookies for everybody, or..."
124729,481,105,575000,Dr. Zander,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,Um... why don't we stop there for today... and I'll see you next week.
124730,481,106,580000,Homer Simpson,HOMER'S BOYHOOD HOME,Who do you have next period?
124732,481,108,586000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELING CENTER,"Hey, Doc. Where is everybody?"
124733,481,109,589000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,I told them not to come.
124734,481,110,591000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELING CENTER,Why didn't you tell me not to come?
124735,481,111,593000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,"Homer, to emphasize the seriousness of this situation, I'm going to turn my chair around backwards."
124737,481,113,602000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,"I feel, in this situation, the only option is a risky and radical treatment."
124738,481,114,608000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,"Homer, meet Kareem Abdul-Jabbar."
124739,481,115,610000,Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,COUNSELING CENTER,"Dr. Zander and I play pick-up basketball on the weekend. And when he told me what you do to your son, I was so disturbed I only scored a hundred and seventy-two points."
124740,481,116,620000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,I had eighty-six assists!
124741,481,117,622000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,But today he's here to assist me with you.
124742,481,118,628000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELING CENTER,Wha-wha-what are you doing?
124743,481,119,631000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,"Homer, it's time you understood what it feels like to be young, small, and terrified."
124744,481,120,637000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELING CENTER,"No Doc, please! I'm just a little boy!"
124282,481,121,640000,Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,COUNSELING CENTER,Why you little!
124720,481,123,644000,Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,COUNSELING CENTER,"I don't want to hurt him, Doc."
124746,481,124,646000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,"You have a good heart, Kareem. Which is why you were the only Laker I could trust with this task."
124748,481,126,654000,Custodial Employee,COUNSELING CENTER,"Uh, not a good time to water the plants?"
124749,481,127,657000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,"No, it's fine."
124751,481,129,658000,Custodial Employee,COUNSELING CENTER,"Hey, Kareem, what do you think about today's selfish players?"
124752,481,130,666000,Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,COUNSELING CENTER,Fool-hearty... tattooed...
124753,481,131,690000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELING CENTER,"Dr. Zander, you made me see my life through Bart's neck, and I swear, I will never, ever strangle my boy again."
124754,481,132,699000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,I believe we've made excellent progress here today. And after another few years of twice-weekly sessions we can really...
124755,481,133,704000,Homer Simpson,COUNSELING CENTER,"Um, I uh, lied about having health insurance."
124756,481,134,708000,Dr. Zander,COUNSELING CENTER,And you're cured.
124758,481,136,715000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, boy."
124759,481,137,715000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer.
124760,481,138,717000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I want you to know I'm cured.
124761,481,139,719000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Good for you. No more drinkin'?
124762,481,140,721000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh son, I can't quit drinking any more than I could quit being a man."
124763,481,141,727000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now it feels like morning. What I am cured of is the blind rage that has soured our otherwise storybook relationship.
124764,481,142,735000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Go ahead -- just try to provoke me.
124765,481,143,737000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I just got up, man."
124766,481,144,740000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh come on, bust your daddy's chops."
124767,481,145,743000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine.
124768,481,146,748000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little...?!
124769,481,147,749000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll teach you to...
124770,481,148,750000,Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,Simpson Home,"I'm in your head, man."
124772,481,150,753000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you... I'm gonna... Maybe this time...
124774,481,152,760000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, my son's first stroke."
124775,481,153,764000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Say cheeese!
124776,481,154,766000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Can't hurt the boy. Can't hurt the boy.
124777,481,155,772000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What the?!
124778,481,156,774000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boy, get down from there!"
124779,481,157,775000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, first I'll send down my shoes."
124780,481,158,778000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right.
124781,481,159,778000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Why you little...
124782,481,160,783000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh c'mon, now you're a tree?"
124785,481,163,800000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Bart Simpson! What would your father say if he knew what you were doing?
124786,481,164,805000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"He'd say ""I'm a grown man who's scared of my own son."""
124787,481,165,805000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,I find that hard to believe.
124788,481,166,811000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Oh yeah? Look.
124789,481,167,815000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"How many more, sir?"
124790,481,168,816000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Fill the board then wash my car.
124791,481,169,819000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,These are my keys.
124792,481,170,821000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,What was that?
124793,481,171,822000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I-I said my keys-ter is ready for a whooping, sir."
124796,481,174,822000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"No, no. I'm just a kid. Leave me alone!"
124797,481,175,850000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"It's ""A-B-C-1-2-3""! It's the easiest song in the world!"
124798,481,176,858000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,You think you're better than the Great Simpsini?!
124799,481,177,861000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Well you're not!
124800,481,178,863000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"What're you gonna do, write a book about me?"
124801,481,179,865000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,You couldn't get in the door of Random House if your name was Bennett Cerf the Third!
124802,481,180,871000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"One, two, three, cry! One, two, three, cry!"
124803,481,181,871000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"How's that water, wet like your tears?"
124804,481,182,881000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Precious, is that you?"
124805,481,183,883000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Yes, Mama."
124806,481,184,884000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,You think you're so pretty? Where's my Lotto ticket?!
124807,481,185,887000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"I forgot, Mama."
124808,481,186,891000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,And don't you come back without it! You hear me?! Hurry up!
124809,481,187,906000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,I don't see many more movie roles for a girl like you! Not unless George Lucas needs another death star!
124810,481,188,913000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"No! Stop! No ""Star Wars"" parodies!"
124811,481,189,917000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Homer! Homer!
124812,481,190,918000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,What?!
124813,481,191,921000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,The school called and said Bart is out of control. I think we may need some therapy for him.
124814,481,192,926000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Oh, that's ridiculous. How could two people from the same family need therapy?"
124816,481,194,940000,Marge Simpson,COUNSELING CENTER,Dr. Zander? Kareem Abdul Jabbar? Anyone?
124819,481,197,952000,Marge Simpson,Homeless Camp,"Dr. Zander, what happened?"
124820,481,198,956000,Dr. Zander,Homeless Camp,"It's the damn economy. When it went south, the first thing people stopped spending money on was expensive therapists. So we all live here now, along with the other unemployed luxury professionals: wedding planners, personal shoppers...aromatherapists... high-end caterers..."
124821,481,199,972000,Man In Tux,Homeless Camp,Mushroom cap?
124822,481,200,973000,Marge Simpson,Homeless Camp,Those are pieces of broken glass.
