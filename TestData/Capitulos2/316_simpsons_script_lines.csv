81148,316,1,11000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Ooh boy, casino night! Finally, they'll teach our kids the dangers of doubling down on a six."
81149,316,2,37000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I really shouldn't be here -- I have a problem with games of chance. I played Candyland with Maggie and ended up throwing vodka in her face.
81150,316,3,45000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Aw Marge, I bet you've gotten that out of your system."
81151,316,4,48000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Bet... system... betting system! God is telling me to gamble!
81153,316,6,57000,Marge Simpson,CAFETERIA,Deal! Hit me! Hit me! Hit me! Busted!
81154,316,7,64000,Drederick Tatum,CAFETERIA,"Welcome to Springfield Elementary Casino Night. My fee for this evening goes to victims of my criminal recidivism. So relax, have fun and, please God, don't piss me off."
81156,316,8,74000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,Congratulations Mr. Student Body President -- your casino night is a huge success.
81157,316,9,79000,Martin Prince,CAFETERIA,"Thanks, Principal Skinner. I got the idea from an episode of ""Saved By The Bell."""
81158,316,10,83000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,That was always on too late for me.
81159,316,11,86000,Homer Simpson,CAFETERIA,I'll put everything on lucky seventeen.
81160,316,12,92000,Homer Simpson,CAFETERIA,Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!
81161,316,13,107000,Homer Simpson,CAFETERIA,Woo-hoo!

81163,316,15,110000,Homer Simpson,CAFETERIA,I win!
81164,316,16,113000,Homer Simpson,CAFETERIA,"This is it, baby. First thing tomorrow, we're getting a Playstation One!"
81166,316,18,119000,Homer Simpson,CAFETERIA,I'd like to cash in these chips. Give me most of it in cash and the rest in suitcases to carry the cash.
81167,316,19,126000,Martin Prince,CAFETERIA,"Sir, this casino is for charity. These chips are only redeemable in cafeteria scrip, or a day at the ballpark with Groundskeeper Willie."
81168,316,20,134000,Groundskeeper Willie,CAFETERIA,I'll be bringin' sparkplugs to chuck at people I don't like. Like you!
81169,316,21,139000,Homer Simpson,CAFETERIA,But I'm up two hundred thousand dollars! Give me my money!
81170,316,22,144000,Homer Simpson,CAFETERIA,You think I won't manhandle a little boy?!
81171,316,23,146000,Martin Prince,CAFETERIA,You don't understand -- it's not real money! None of these people have won any money!
81172,316,24,154000,Martin Prince,CAFETERIA,Didn't anyone read the flyer? It was sent home last Tuesday...
81173,316,25,162000,Lenny Leonard,CAFETERIA,Look at me! I'm a big man!
81174,316,26,166000,Lenny Leonard,CAFETERIA,But I break... just like a little girl.
81175,316,27,174000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,"Well, this was a disaster."
81176,316,28,176000,Martin Prince,CAFETERIA,"I should have known. The same thing happened on ""Saved by the Bell."""
81177,316,29,180000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,Care for a milk?
81178,316,30,181000,Martin Prince,CAFETERIA,No thank you.
81179,316,31,183000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,"Martin, in light of this fiasco, you're going to have to resign as president."
81180,316,32,187000,Martin Prince,CAFETERIA,I'll have that milk now.
81181,316,33,191000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,Easy there. That's whole milk.
81182,316,34,193000,Martin Prince,CAFETERIA,"I'm a private citizen now, I can drink what I like."
81183,316,35,197000,Martin Prince,CAFETERIA,You won't have Martin Prince to kick around any more.
81184,316,36,206000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,"Well, I guess we're gonna need a new student body president."
81186,316,37,209000,Thug #1,CAFETERIA,We're from Acme Amusement Rental. We're lookin' for Principal Skinner.
81187,316,38,213000,Seymour Skinner,CAFETERIA,"Uh... yes, we all are."
81189,316,40,221000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Hey... student body president...
81190,316,41,226000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I could join past presidents. Like Otto... or Krusty!
81192,316,43,232000,Lisa Simpson,Hallway,"Nelson, you're running for President?"
81193,316,44,234000,Nelson Muntz,Hallway,I'm not sayin' I have all the answers. But I do have all the answer keys. To every test.
81194,316,45,242000,Nelson Muntz,Hallway,Fractions? Dinosaurs? Foreign money? The first Thanksgiving?
81195,316,46,246000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Hallway,"Nelson, what are you doing?"
81196,316,47,248000,Nelson Muntz,Hallway,Real estate license exam?
81197,316,48,250000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Hallway,My ticket to freedom!

81203,316,54,264000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, what a delicious quiche! I drive a pink Miata."
81204,316,55,269000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't believe Nelson is more popular than me.
81205,316,56,272000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"La, la, la..."
81206,316,57,274000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, you could be popular, you've just got to be yourself... in a whole new way."
81207,316,58,280000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I'm gonna stick to my platform of incremental policy amelioration: fluoridated water fountains, vegan lunch options..."
81208,316,59,288000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,My name is Nelthon! I use a thalad fork. La-dee-dah! I wash my face!
81209,316,60,293000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Where did you get that tutu?

81227,316,77,409000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Skinner!! I'm worried. This girl is extremely popular and thinks for herself. She's like a female Eleanor Roosevelt.
81228,316,78,425000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,The students will do anything she says. She's captured their imagination like a bright piece of construction paper.
81229,316,79,431000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Hm, yeah. Well we've got to find a way to control her."
81230,316,80,435000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, maybe that escaped mental patient you hired has some sort of toxin in his shack..."

81249,316,98,526000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, you look so successful. Like you're the wife of a businessman."
81250,316,99,532000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I wish I'd married a businessman. Then I'd have nice things.
81251,316,100,537000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it's a little over the top, but there's no reason I can't look good and take back the playground from the gypsies."
81253,316,102,547000,Gypsy,PLAYGROUND,Is our Frisbee now.
81255,316,104,548000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, Lisa! Can I get a photo for the front page? It'll either be a picture of you or the drinking fountain that won't stop running."
81256,316,105,556000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Make it snappy, Milhouse. I've got an important meeting in the teachers' lounge."
81257,316,106,561000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,The teachers' lounge. Is it true they make fun of students in there?
81258,316,107,566000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, don't be silly."

81264,316,113,584000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh hello, Lisa. We were just uh, discussing Vasco De Gama."
81265,316,114,589000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I have some ideas for ways we can improve the classroom experience."
81266,316,115,594000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,We need to get teachers more involved! Have them meet with struggling kids in the morning before school.
81267,316,116,599000,Dewey Largo,Springfield Elementary School,Fine. I'll come in early to meet with students. And I'll have hypnotherapy when?
81269,316,117,604000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Or, we could hand out teachers' home phone numbers -- ­so kids can call them whenever they have questions."
81270,316,118,610000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,I've got a question: you're crazy.
81271,316,119,613000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Look, in the Swedish public schools, the students grade the teachers on their performance--"
81272,316,120,617000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Outstanding notions! Each more implementable than the last.
81273,316,121,619000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,It's a shame you can't stay to discuss them. Here's your schedule for the day.
81274,316,122,623000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"""Photo op helping Kindergartners take off snow boots..."" ""Move the brushfire hazard needle..."" Um, shouldn't I stay here and work on school policy?"
81275,316,123,632000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, you were elected to be seen and enjoyed. Don't hide your light in a smoky back room, making dusty old decisions."
81276,316,124,641000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I am proud of my light."
81277,316,125,643000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"But just in case you want to do any more thinking, I'm proud to present you with an official key to the study hall."
81279,316,127,650000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Use it anytime you like.
81280,316,128,652000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"You mean I can come to the school after hours, weekends, even during the summer?"
81281,316,129,657000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, it's like you're Harry Potter without the magic and wonder. Just sign these authorization forms and you can be on your way."
81282,316,130,668000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,That little girl should learn to read things before she signs them.
81283,316,131,671000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Excuse me? I was wondering if I should read what I just signed.
81284,316,132,675000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"No, it's just standard key release boilerplate."
81285,316,133,677000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Okay.
81286,316,134,678000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Boy, she'll believe anything."
81287,316,135,681000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Key release boilerplate? I find that very hard to believe.
81288,316,136,684000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Uh hmm. And yet there it is.
81289,316,137,686000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I'll just lock this door.
81290,316,138,688000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Boy, this key opens everything."
81293,316,141,693000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"And then, as school president, I don't have to take the hearing test."
81155,316,142,696000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm so proud of you Lisa.
81185,316,143,698000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What?
81242,316,144,699000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You're like Geraldine Ferraro, except you won, where she failed miserably."
81295,316,146,704000,Lisa Simpson,Dining Room,"Well, I think I can say with all humility, I am gonna be the best school president ever."
81296,316,147,711000,Bart Simpson,Dining Room,"Bravo, Lisa. Bra-vo."
81297,316,148,715000,Marge Simpson,Dining Room,"Oh, isn't that sweet? Even your brother's adding his kudos."
81298,316,149,719000,Bart Simpson,Dining Room,I was being sarcastic.
81299,316,150,721000,Marge Simpson,Dining Room,You were?
81300,316,151,722000,Bart Simpson,Dining Room,No. I was being sincere.
81301,316,152,724000,Homer Simpson,Dining Room,"Oh, I'm so confused."
81302,316,153,726000,Bart Simpson,Dining Room,"Lis, Skinner is using you. Like a pawn on his unholy chess set."
81303,316,154,730000,Homer Simpson,Dining Room,"On my chess set, the pawns are all Hamburglars."
81305,316,156,734000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I'M SO HAPPY WITH MY EVIL PLAN / SAY GOODBYE TO MUSIC, GYM AND ART / SOON WE WILL HAVE THE PERFECT SCHOOL / WHERE FUN AND EXCITEMENT NEVER START!"

81311,316,162,772000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Hmm, not a cloud in the sky -- a perfect day to unveil Operation SLAAAM: So Long Athletics Art And Music. Care for a T-shirt?"
81312,316,163,781000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"T-shirt? Why don't you just give me a sandwich board that says ""Male Prostitute""?"
81313,316,164,786000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh well... I... Forgive me, sir."
81317,316,168,791000,Lisa Simpson,Music Class,They've taken everything!

81328,316,178,825000,Bart Simpson,Hallway,As ordered by Principal Skinner and approved by student body president Lisa Simpson!
81330,316,180,825000,Milhouse Van Houten,Hallway,And to think I was gonna ask you to the dance.
81331,316,181,836000,Lisa Simpson,Hallway,I would have gone with you.
81332,316,182,838000,Milhouse Van Houten,Hallway,"Well, you still can."
81333,316,183,840000,Lisa Simpson,Hallway,"Well, I don't feel like it now."

81342,316,192,869000,Milhouse Van Houten,Hallway,I almost had a date. I've gotta tell Willie about this.
81344,316,194,879000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa is a sell-out! Lisa is a sell-out! Lisa, what's a sell-out?"
81345,316,195,885000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"With the band gone, how'll I know who to beat up?"
81346,316,196,889000,Üter,Springfield Elementary School,"They eliminated ""English for Fat Kids""!"
81347,316,197,892000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"Okay, you'll do."
81348,316,198,895000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Lis, you made this school even worse. And it wasn't exactly San Diego State to begin with."
81350,316,200,902000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,They made me pretty and popular just so they could exploit me and ruin my good name.
81351,316,201,907000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Lisa, you've got to stand up to these guys. And when you do, people will remember you. Just look at these postage stamps."
81352,316,202,915000,Homer Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,There's Bugs Bunny... Fat Elvis... Autumn in New England... Bats of the Southwest... all heroes. Wanna see Elvis kiss a bat? Hey baby come here lemme kiss you...

81355,316,205,929000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,You tricked me into betraying my fellow students!
81356,316,206,933000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,"Lisa, student government is meaningless. Look at your constitution. It's written on the back of a placemat."
81357,316,207,939000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"And not a good placemat. It's from some place called ""Doodles."""
81358,316,208,943000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"I see. Principal Skinner, may I make an announcement to the school?"
81359,316,209,947000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,I can't see the harm.
81360,316,210,950000,Lisa Simpson,Skinner's Office,"I hereby resign as your president. And for my last act, I call a general student strike, effective immediately!"
81361,316,211,957000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,Gimme that. Any student caught striking will be severely disciplined. Unless all of you do it. Then I'm stymied.
81363,316,213,963000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,Strike! Strike! Strike!
81364,316,214,965000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, please. Help me lure them back. I had to do what I did. Our budget is stretched tighter than mother's sauna pants."
81365,316,215,971000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Seymour!
81366,316,216,971000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Quit using me in analogies!
81367,316,217,974000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, mother."
81368,316,218,975000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Principal Skinner, I will not call off this strike until you bring back music and art."
81369,316,219,980000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,What about gym?
81370,316,220,980000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Meh.
81371,316,221,981000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, hey, Seymour S., Nurture our well-roundedness! / Sneeze, puke, burp, fart, / We want music, gym and art!"
81372,316,222,990000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Why didn't I cancel sign-making and creative chanting?
81373,316,223,994000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Principal Skinner, can't you just reinstate those programs?"
81374,316,224,997000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Would you be willing to pay an extra dollar twenty-three in taxes to fund them?
81375,316,225,1001000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,No way! I'm saving for a speedboat!
81376,316,226,1004000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,Strike! Strike!
81377,316,227,1005000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, what are you doing? This is the kind of troublemaking I expect from your brother."
81378,316,228,1010000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"You do? Cool, a blank check for mayhem."
81379,316,229,1017000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Mom, I was elected to make this a better school."
81380,316,230,1021000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, couldn't you just hang some colorful crepe paper in the gym?"
81381,316,231,1024000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,They've taken away our crepe paper.
81382,316,232,1027000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Those Fudruckers!
81383,316,233,1030000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh no, they heard me."
81384,316,234,1032000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Remember boys, these are little kids. Take out your tiny batons."
81386,316,235,1039000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Chief Wiggum, we're just like you policemen. Don't you ever feel like the mayor doesn't care about you?"
81387,316,236,1045000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"You mean the mayor who kept me waiting for two hours in that restaurant? I ate so much bread! Sit down, boys. We're joining this strike."
81388,316,237,1053000,Lou,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, Chief, are you sure the Mayor wasn't at a different Olive Garden than you?"
81389,316,238,1057000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I can't take that rattlesnake out of his mailbox now, now can I?"
81390,316,239,1061000,Eddie,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes, Chief, you could."
81391,316,240,1063000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Let me ask you this. Shut up.
81392,316,241,1065000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School,"The Springfield student strike has entered its fourth day with no end in sight. Today, professional buttinski Michael Moore arrived on the scene:"
81393,316,242,1072000,Michael Moore,Springfield Elementary School,Kids who don't get to take music and art are ten per cent more likely to become chronically unemployed and appear in one of my movies.
81394,316,243,1079000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School,Where did you get this statistic?
81395,316,244,1080000,Michael Moore,Springfield Elementary School,Your mother.
81396,316,245,1081000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School,"The student strikers have been joined by other unions, including the Springfield Goat Milkers... the Association of Newsroom Cue Card Holders..."
81397,316,246,1081000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School,Ow. And the United Federation of Theme Park Zombies.
81398,316,247,1092000,Zombie,Springfield Elementary School,Zombie eat brains but zombie cannot swallow this injustice.
81399,316,248,1100000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School,The heart of the strike is former student body president Lisa Simpson. Her brother had this to say:
81400,316,249,1103000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa is a nut. She has a rubber butt. Every time she turns around it goes ""putt putt."""
81401,316,250,1103000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School,Indeed. But that rubber butt doesn't have much time for turning around these days. It's pointed squarely in the face of the administration.
81402,316,251,1118000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Skinner! We have got to get these kids back in school.
81403,316,252,1123000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Willie, can't you turn your hose on them?"
81404,316,253,1125000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,They're wee children. I'd sooner turn it on maself!
81405,316,254,1129000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, that's a good idea, too."
81406,316,255,1131000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Now see here ya nose-wipin' hair-combers. Back in Edinburgh we had a coal miner's strike. All we wanted were hats with a wee light on top. Then one day the mine collapsed. No one made it out alive. Not even Willie.
81407,316,256,1150000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Skinner! I don't mean to interrupt your advice from the janitor. But I say, cut off the head and the body will die."
81408,316,257,1158000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,You want to get rid of Lisa?! But she's such a good student!
81409,316,258,1161000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Yes. In fact, I think she's a little too good for this school."
81410,316,259,1166000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"If we stand together, we are strong!"
81412,316,261,1170000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa Simpson, you have just been transferred to the Springfield magnet school for the gifted and troublesome. Please climb into the idling bus."
81413,316,262,1178000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,But... but I...
81415,316,264,1183000,Kids,Bus,POOR LI-SA / POOR LI-SA...
81416,316,265,1187000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,DON'T CRY FOR ME KIDS OF SPRINGFIELD / YOU CAN STILL REACH ME THROUGH E-MAIL / AT SMART GIRL SIX THREE / UNDERSCORE BACK SLASH / AT YAHOO DOT COM / AT YAHOO DOT COM...
81417,316,266,1215000,Boy Student,Bus,"Bonjour, Lisa. Regardez notre bibliothèque."
81418,316,267,1218000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,"Oh, this place is paradise."
81419,316,268,1222000,Otto Mann,Bus,"Well, I guess this story has a happy ending after all. Just like my last massage."
81420,316,269,1231000,Homer Simpson,Bus,I'm not driving forty-five minutes a day! You can't go to that school!
81421,316,270,1234000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,But this is my dream.
81422,316,271,1236000,Homer Simpson,Bus,"Why can't you have a normal dream, like being an Olympic figure skater?"
81423,316,272,1240000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,"Okay, let me take figure skating."
81424,316,273,1243000,Homer Simpson,Bus,Are you crazy? I'm not getting up at six-thirty every morning so you can prance around a frozen pond and think you're better than me!
81425,316,274,1249000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,"Well, what can I be?"
81426,316,275,1249000,Homer Simpson,Bus,I'unno. How 'bout a horse whisperer?
81427,316,276,1252000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,Okay.
81428,316,277,1253000,Homer Simpson,Bus,Over my dead body!
