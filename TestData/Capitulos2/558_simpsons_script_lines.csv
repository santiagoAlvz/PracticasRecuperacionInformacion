144861,558,6,38000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Students, each one of you has been assigned the mandatory honor of contributing to the Springfield Time Capsule...where your arcana will lie dormant until the thirty-first century...and..."
144862,558,7,49000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"By the time you finish talking, we're gonna be opening this damn capsule."
144863,558,8,55000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Right. Time capsule. Nelson. Give me something.
144864,558,9,57000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I brought a picture of my Dad!
144865,558,10,59000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,He's still at large... in my heart.
144866,558,11,63000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,I brought my lucky rabbit's foot. I can have good luck without it.
144867,558,12,68000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Ow!
144868,558,13,69000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Wish we could put this moment in the time capsule.
144869,558,14,72000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Consider it done.
144870,558,15,77000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"How about you, Bart? Let me guess, you forgot to bring something."
144871,558,16,81000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'm offended you think I forgot. Let's see...
144872,558,17,86000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Ta-da!
144873,558,18,88000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Listen boy, this is the only legacy you'll ever leave."
144874,558,19,91000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Better make this count.
144876,558,21,95000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,My sandwich!
144879,558,24,98000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Square,"And so a thousand years from now, this capsule will be opened by some future Mayor Quimby."
144880,558,25,111000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Town Square,That-that could be anyone's ooze!
144882,558,27,123000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Town Square,There.
144883,558,28,125000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Square,"And now, to help secure the jazz vote...Liser Simpson will play her saxophone."
144821,558,29,136000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Square,Even God hates jazz!
144884,558,31,139000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"A mysterious electrical storm is currently wreaking havoc with our studio. But I'm not one of those brainless dolts who mindlessly reads a teleprompterrrrr, error four-oh-one, backslash backslash, colon, reset C-drive, shutting down!"
144886,558,33,160000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What the hell was that?!
144887,558,34,160000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Probably just another piece of America's space junk falling out of orbit.
144888,558,35,164000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Remember when this country didn't suck? 'Cause I don't.
144890,558,37,177000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homer! Homer. I think there's someone downstairs.
144891,558,38,180000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Relax, Marge. It's probably just Homer comin' home late from Moe's."
144892,558,39,190000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The eyes in that picture are following me.
144893,558,40,193000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, that's a mirror."
144894,558,41,195000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Isn't all great art kind of a mirror?
144895,558,42,202000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"We'd better send the dog down. Come on. Here's your chance to protect us, boy. Come on."
144897,558,44,209000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Stupid dog!
144900,558,47,216000,Bender,Simpson Home,Ow!
144901,558,48,220000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"We'll have to set a trap, bait. I mean, Bart."
144902,558,49,231000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"All set. When he starts gnawing at you, I'll whack him with this broom."
144906,558,53,242000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Don't drink my loved ones!
144908,558,55,246000,Bender,Simpson Home,Bite my shiny metal ass!
144909,558,56,249000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,A robot with a catchphrase!
144910,558,57,251000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Homer, you gonna kiss him or kill him?"
144912,558,59,255000,Bender,Simpson Home,All right! Tether-boy!
144914,558,61,265000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, so what are you?"
144915,558,62,266000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Must be a secret government project.
144916,558,63,268000,Bender,Simpson Home,"Oh, what do I look like, a narc? My name is Bender and I come from..."
144917,558,64,274000,Bender,Simpson Home,...the future!
144918,558,65,276000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Prove it. What happens to Homer Simpson in the future?
144919,558,66,279000,Bender,Simpson Home,I don't know. You die?
144920,558,67,281000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh. My. God. He's telling the truth. I have to take you to our civic leaders.
144922,558,69,292000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, Hibachi head. How're you gonna pay for that?"
144923,558,70,295000,Bender,Moe's Tavern,"Uh... let me just transfer some, uh, electronic hyper-credits into your register here."
144924,558,71,301000,Bender,Moe's Tavern,"Ding-a-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding! Ooh, and, uh, another round for my friends! Ding-a-ding-ding-a-ding-ding!"
144926,558,73,309000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, this Blade Rummy is all right! He's a big spender, plus he fixed the jukebox. I think they had a thing going."
144927,558,74,316000,JUKEBOX RECORD,Moe's Tavern,OH BABY WHAT YOU DONE TO ME.
144928,558,75,320000,Bender,Moe's Tavern,I hate it when they get quiet.
144929,558,76,322000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Listen, I-I know you're a robot and incapable of emotion..."
144930,558,77,326000,Bender,Moe's Tavern,It's true! I'm empty inside.
144931,558,78,332000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Uh, look, I just wanna ask... can we be friends?"
144933,558,80,335000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,You're the only guy I know with less hair than me.
144934,558,81,338000,Bender,Moe's Tavern,"Sure! That's why I came to your time, for all you know."
144935,558,82,342000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,For all we know!
144938,558,85,354000,Bender,Barney's Bowlarama,D'oh!
144939,558,86,358000,Bender,Barney's Bowlarama,A strike! A totally legitimate strike!
144940,558,87,362000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"Yeah! Hey, uh, what's the robot version of bromance?"
144941,558,88,367000,Bender,Barney's Bowlarama,Romance.
144942,558,89,368000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,You future guys have a word for everything... pal.
144944,558,91,375000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, they look a little similar."
144945,558,92,377000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, like the guy who designed Bender just took a drawing of Dad and stuck an antenna on it."
144946,558,93,383000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,A little lazy if you ask me.
144947,558,94,387000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Regardless, I see no reason to believe that ""Bender"" is from the future. Robotic technology today is very advanced."
144948,558,95,395000,Bender,Simpson Home,"Oh really? Can your ""modern day"" robots do this?"
144949,558,96,404000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not my birthday. Although Maggie's is pretty soon.
144950,558,97,407000,Bender,Simpson Home,I can't do Maggie. The G's look like sixes.
144953,558,100,412000,Lisa Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,This is the robot who claims to be from the future.
144954,558,101,415000,Bender,Professor Frink's Lab,Can your present-day robots do this?
144956,558,103,424000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,"No, no they cannot. Not sure why they'd want to..."
144957,558,104,427000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,"Now why are you here? What is your mission, uh, so-to-speak."
144958,558,105,431000,Bender,Professor Frink's Lab,I don't remember.
144959,558,106,433000,Bender,Professor Frink's Lab,"Man, this guy doesn't ask permission. He just goes right in ya."
144960,558,107,437000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,"Aha! Bender's mission protocol is definitely intact. It just requires a delicate procedure known as ""unplug and replug."""
144961,558,108,441000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,Because that fixes everything.
144962,558,109,451000,Bender,Professor Frink's Lab,I remember why I'm here! To kill Homer Simpson!
144963,558,110,457000,Homer Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,My ears are burning.
144964,558,111,460000,Bender,Professor Frink's Lab,"Not yet, but they will be."
144965,558,112,464000,Homer Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,A boxing glove!
144966,558,113,470000,Homer Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,But we bowled together.
144967,558,114,474000,Bender,Professor Frink's Lab,I can't do it.
144968,558,115,476000,Lisa Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,"What stopped you, Bender? Asimov's three laws of robotics?"
144969,558,116,479000,Bender,Professor Frink's Lab,"You think robots care what some hack science fiction writer thinks? I killed Isaac Asimov on the way over here. Well, Isaac somebody."
144970,558,117,488000,Bender,Professor Frink's Lab,What the?! My ass is about to project something.
144971,558,118,490000,Homer Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,You don't have to announce it. Just do it quietly and blame the dog.
144972,558,119,496000,LEELA,Professor Frink's Lab,"Bender, we've just regained contact. Have you killed Homer Simpson?"
144973,558,120,500000,Bender,Professor Frink's Lab,Uh... yep. Killed him good.
144974,558,121,502000,LEELA,Professor Frink's Lab,"If Homer's dead, why are the creatures he begat still here and multiplying out of control?"
144975,558,122,511000,Homer Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,What the?
144976,558,123,512000,LEELA,Professor Frink's Lab,"You lied to me, Bender! Homer Simpson's still alive!"
144977,558,124,516000,FRY,Professor Frink's Lab,"Come on, Bender. Stabbity-stabbity!"
144978,558,125,519000,Lisa Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,"Wait, stop! Why must you kill my Dad? Especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you?"
144979,558,126,526000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Professor Frink's Lab,Homer Simpson must be eliminated immediately! The creatures destroying New New York have his D.N.A.!
144980,558,127,535000,HERMES,Professor Frink's Lab,The monsters are stealing our office supplies!
144981,558,128,538000,Bender,Professor Frink's Lab,That's inexcusable!
144982,558,129,542000,Bender,Professor Frink's Lab,Um...
144983,558,130,543000,DR. ZOIDBERG,Professor Frink's Lab,"Hello, robut! Looks like everyone gets a turn to say something! This concludes my turn."
144984,558,131,550000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Professor Frink's Lab,"We sent Bender back in time to kill Homer before the monsters could evolve from him. Apparently this was too heartless a task for a robot. Leela, can you handle it?"
144985,558,132,561000,LEELA,Professor Frink's Lab,"In a New, New York minute, minute!"
144986,558,133,566000,FRY/PROFESSOR/LEELA,Professor Frink's Lab,Ow!
144988,558,135,572000,Bender,Professor Frink's Lab,Ow! Right in my langwich centard!
144989,558,136,578000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,"Professor, you-you're a fellow man of science. Maybe if we teamed up, we could uh figure something out."
144990,558,137,584000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Professor Frink's Lab,"Okay, but remember, to me you're incredibly stupid."
144991,558,138,588000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Professor Frink's Lab,"Oh, and the annoying girl may be helpful. Meanwhile, Leela, take Homer and explore this time period. Find out why people would ever pay for ""freemium games."""
144992,558,139,595000,Homer Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,"I'll explain. Okay, it starts free, right?"
144994,558,141,603000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"Then you visit your friend's game, and he's got this awesome candy mansion..."
144995,558,142,607000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Street,Get a load of those freaks.
144996,558,143,611000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"...and you're like ""ninety-nine cents? You bet I'd like one..."""
144997,558,144,612000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,And that's why I owe Clash of Candies twenty thousand dollars. Here we are.
144999,558,146,624000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I'd like you to meet Leela and Fry."
145000,558,147,628000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, don't mention her eye. Don't mention her eye."
145001,558,148,631000,LEELA,Simpson Home,Don't mention her hair. Don't mention her hair.
145002,558,149,633000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I am so pleased to meet you.
145003,558,150,635000,LEELA,Simpson Home,Nice to be hair!
145005,558,152,638000,LEELA,Simpson Home,"Oh, Lord."
145008,558,155,643000,Lisa Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,"Professor Farnsworth, I'm dying to know how you got here. Was it a time machine?"
145010,558,156,646000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Professor Frink's Lab,"Little girl, time machines are physical impossibilities. We teleported through a singularity that I quantum entangled to Bender under the guise of fixing his collar."
145011,558,157,658000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,But how did Bender get here?
145012,558,158,660000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Professor Frink's Lab,With a time machine.
145013,558,159,660000,Lisa Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,But you just said that--
145014,558,160,662000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Professor Frink's Lab,Sample's ready!
145016,558,162,665000,Bender,Simpson Home,Kill all humans... kill all humans...
145017,558,163,671000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Start with Flanders... start with Flanders...
145018,558,164,674000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Simpson Home,"Good news, everyone!"
145019,558,165,677000,FRY,Simpson Home,That means it's bad.
145020,558,166,678000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Simpson Home,The human D.N.A. in the creatures was only half Homer's! The other half came from... someone else!
145021,558,167,685000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,"Oh, so we can kill that person instead. Maybe they're evil and deserve it. Or have one of those annoying voi-ces that gets on everybody's nerves! With the adding extra noises for no reason bloing... bloing."
145022,558,168,700000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Simpson Home,And the other person is...
145023,558,169,705000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who is that?!
145024,558,170,707000,MARGE *,Simpson Home,It's me!
145026,558,172,707000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Simpson Home,"Wait a minute, we don't have to kill you."
145027,558,173,711000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well that's better.
145028,558,174,713000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Simpson Home,We just have to kill all your children.
145030,558,176,715000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Simpson Home,"Or just one of them, if you can figure out which one sired the killer rabbits."
145032,558,178,724000,MORBO,Simpson Home,We interrupt this hologram to bring you an important bulletin. The horrific creatures destroying New New York have begun metamorphosing.
145034,558,180,742000,BART GOBLINS,Simpson Home,Eat my shorts! / Aye carumba!
145035,558,181,748000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What a surprise -- it's Bart.
145036,558,182,750000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, I'm doing the same jokes a thousand years later. Ay carumba!"
145037,558,183,755000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Simpson Home,But how did a mere boy destroy the future?
145038,558,184,758000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Well...
145039,558,185,770000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Let this be a lesson: never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule.
145009,558,186,774000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it! All we have to do is dig up the time capsule!
145040,558,187,778000,LEELA,Simpson Home,And bury Bart in the hole!
145041,558,188,779000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought people in the future would be more full of peace and love. Like in Epcot Center.
145042,558,189,785000,LEELA,Simpson Home,"In our time, Epcot Center is a work farm for the weak."
145043,558,190,788000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Simpson Home,"Oh, but it's not as crowded as the slave labor camps at Universal Studios."
145046,558,193,797000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,We're here.
145047,558,194,803000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,My bowling buddy.
145048,558,195,804000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Town Square,Hey!
145049,558,196,806000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Town Square,You can't dig that up for a thousand years! Plus I wrote my name there.
145050,558,197,810000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Town Square,See.
145051,558,198,813000,Amy,Springfield Town Square,Shmayday! Shmayday!
145052,558,199,815000,Amy,Springfield Town Square,They got Scruffy!
145053,558,200,817000,SCRUFFY,Springfield Town Square,"No, they just got my mustache. But a life without a mustache ain't worth living."
145054,558,201,824000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Springfield Town Square,No! That generator powers the portal!
145055,558,202,827000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,Springfield Town Square,"If they destroy it, we'll be..."
145057,558,204,831000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,PLANET EXPRESS,-- sucked back into the future.
145058,558,205,840000,Marge Simpson,PLANET EXPRESS,"Okay, head count. One, two, three, where's Maggie?!"
145060,558,207,847000,Bender,Springfield Town Square,"Well, little meat bag, looks like it's just you and me, stuck in a terrible past where I know the result of every horserace ever! To the track!"
145061,558,208,862000,SPOILED 2-YEAR-OLD,Springfield Town Square,I want that!
145062,558,209,862000,Father,Springfield Town Square,"Well, you can't have it!"
145065,558,212,872000,Homer Simpson,PLANET EXPRESS,Why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little...
145066,558,213,877000,Bart Simpson,PLANET EXPRESS,"Dad, it-it's me!"
145067,558,214,879000,Homer Simpson,PLANET EXPRESS,Prove it. When's your birthday?
145068,558,215,880000,Bart Simpson,PLANET EXPRESS,February twenty-third.
145069,558,216,882000,Homer Simpson,PLANET EXPRESS,Ha! February has no twenty-third!
145070,558,217,884000,Marge Simpson,PLANET EXPRESS,Yes it does!
145071,558,218,887000,Marge Simpson,PLANET EXPRESS,Can you please just get us out of this lousy future?
145072,558,219,890000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,PLANET EXPRESS,"Actually, of all probable futures, this is the worst."
145073,558,220,894000,Marge Simpson,PLANET EXPRESS,"It is, 'cause my baby's not in it!"
145075,558,221,897000,PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH,PLANET EXPRESS,"Motherly love. Why did we outlaw that? Madam, our mechanical friend Bender is your portal home. But we can't use him until the generator is repaired."
145076,558,222,907000,Marge Simpson,PLANET EXPRESS,Homer works at a nuclear plant! He can help us get home!
