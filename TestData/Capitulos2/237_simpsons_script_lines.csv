57883,237,40,255000,Homer Simpson,Springfield University,"Oh, this is gonna be so great."
57885,237,42,258000,Guard #1,Campus Security Headquarters,I think I know that guy. He ran over the dean five years ago. Punch up that picture.
57886,237,43,263000,Guard #1,Campus Security Headquarters,"All right, now age the picture five years."
57887,237,44,266000,Guard #2,Campus Security Headquarters,That's him!

57897,237,54,293000,Dean Bobby Peterson,DEAN PETERSON'S HOUSE,"Good evening, gentlemen."
57898,237,55,295000,Homer Simpson,DEAN PETERSON'S HOUSE,"Oh, that's it. You're through, dean!"
57899,237,56,301000,Homer Simpson,DEAN PETERSON'S HOUSE,Now who's the dean?
57901,237,58,306000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sorry, Dad, it just won't budge."
57902,237,59,309000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I tried greasing the bucket with bacon fat but your father kept eating it.
57903,237,60,314000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, couldn't you try a non-delicious fat? Oh, there's no such thing."
57905,237,62,319000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Hmmm... I'm afraid it's hopeless. Beneath that bucket, he's more glue than man."
57906,237,63,325000,Marge Simpson,Dr. Hibbert's Office,So he's stuck like this forever?
57907,237,64,327000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Oh, now don't fret. These days, the victims of comedy traumas -- or ""traumedies"" -- can still lead rich, full lives."

57915,237,72,360000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Homer, maybe I should drive."
57916,237,73,364000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,What? I can see fine.
57917,237,74,375000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,That had nothing to do with the bucket.
57919,237,76,379000,Marge Simpson,DITCH,Where are we?

57929,237,86,412000,Crowd,Brother Faith's Revival Tent,"Ahh, I don't know. I guess so."
57930,237,87,412000,Brother Faith,Brother Faith's Revival Tent,"The answer I'm looking for is ""yes""!"

57972,237,129,566000,Bart Simpson,REVIVAL TENT,Really? Hm. I would think He would want to limit my power.
57973,237,130,571000,Brother Faith,REVIVAL TENT,"Oh, yes Lord! When I was your age I was a hell raiser, too. My slingshot was my cross. But I saw the light and changed my wicked ways."
57974,237,131,580000,Bart Simpson,REVIVAL TENT,I figure I'll go for the life of sin followed by the presto-chango deathbed repentance.
57975,237,132,584000,Brother Faith,REVIVAL TENT,"Wow, that's a good angle. But that's not God's angle. Why not spend your life helping people instead? Then you're also covered in case of a sudden death."
57976,237,133,594000,Bart Simpson,REVIVAL TENT,Full coverage... hmm...
57978,237,135,597000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"... then I said ""I have the power"" and the bucket came off!"

57992,237,149,634000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"How can you believe all this mumbo-jumbo? The bucket came off Dad's head because the bright lights heated it, causing the metal to expand."
57993,237,150,642000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"""Heat makes metal expand?"" Now who's talkin' mumbo-jumbo?"
57995,237,152,650000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't come up with an idea for my homecoming float. Do it for me.

57997,237,154,657000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Look at Moe dance! ALOHA MOE...
57998,237,155,660000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's nice, but maybe your Homecoming float should have something to do with college."
57999,237,156,664000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, you're right."
58000,237,157,669000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I think Godzilla's bigger than Superman.
58001,237,158,671000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's not to scale.
58003,237,160,675000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul instructed them to send ten copies to the Thessalonians and the Ephesians. But the Ephesians broke the chain and were punished by..."

58008,237,165,698000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,But church can be fun.
58009,237,166,700000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,"No, really. It can be a crazy party, with clouds and lasers and miracles."
58010,237,167,705000,Homer Simpson,First Church of Springfield,And chili fries!
58011,237,168,706000,Bart Simpson,First Church of Springfield,A real preacher knows how to bring the Bible alive through music and dancing and Tae-Bo!

58023,237,180,747000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Ah, yeah, I, I couldn't help but notice you, you picked pretty much all of my flowers."
58024,237,181,752000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Can't make a float without flowers.
58025,237,182,753000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oh-ho, true enough. But, uh, did you have to salt the earth so nothing would ever grow again?"
58026,237,183,761000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah.
58029,237,186,768000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Tent,"Okay, Springfield! How many of you are in horrible pain?!"
58031,237,188,773000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Tent,Then put your souls together for Brother Bart!
