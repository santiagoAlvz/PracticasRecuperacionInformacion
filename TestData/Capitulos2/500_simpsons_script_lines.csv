129687,500,24,215000,Homer Simpson,STORM SHELTER,"All right, everybody in!"
129688,500,25,228000,Marge Simpson,STORM SHELTER,"All right, who's the wisenheimer that's been eating the powdered food?"
129689,500,26,232000,Bart Simpson,STORM SHELTER,Not me.
129690,500,27,232000,Homer Simpson,STORM SHELTER,Two can play at that game.
129691,500,28,242000,Homer Simpson,STORM SHELTER,I can do this... I can do this...
129692,500,29,255000,Homer Simpson,STORM SHELTER,"Boy, I told you an hour ago. Stop that!"
129693,500,30,258000,Bart Simpson,STORM SHELTER,But Bunkerball is keeping us sane!
129694,500,31,262000,Lisa Simpson,STORM SHELTER,"Do we really have to sit here the whole time? I mean, if we went out now, it might be cool to see the town empty."
129695,500,32,269000,Bart Simpson,STORM SHELTER,Yeah! I could sneak into the school and write whatever I want on the chalkboard!
129696,500,33,273000,Lisa Simpson,STORM SHELTER,I could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana!
129697,500,34,277000,Homer Simpson,STORM SHELTER,And I can drive drunk while I'm actually sober!
129699,500,36,284000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"It's fun, but not as fun."
129700,500,37,286000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Streets,That's odd.
129701,500,38,287000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Streets,Why are all those cars parked at City Hall?
129702,500,39,289000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Streets,Ay carumba!
129703,500,40,291000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Streets,"If I didn't know better, I'd say it was a town meeting."
129704,500,41,295000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Streets,"Not without us, it isn't! Pull over."
129707,500,44,303000,Mayor Joe Quimby,TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM,"Welcome to this secret meeting, made possible by the fake disaster drill. And a special thanks for the hard work of the Mystery And Secrecy Committee."
129708,500,45,311000,Cloaked Member,TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM,"We have names, you know!"
129709,500,46,313000,Mayor Joe Quimby,TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM,Quit complaining! You only meet once a month!
129710,500,47,316000,Comic Book Guy,TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM,"Yes, but the meetings last eight hours!"
129711,500,48,318000,Disco Stu,TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM,Shut up! Shut up! This is the most fun I have!
129712,500,49,323000,Mayor Joe Quimby,TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM,And now for the reason we are here.
129713,500,50,327000,Marge Simpson,TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM,What's going on? Why is there a picture of us? This isn't good.
129714,500,51,331000,Homer Simpson,TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM,"Oh honey, why must you always assume that a huge picture of us, at a secret meeting we weren't told about, is a bad thing?"
129715,500,52,337000,Mayor Joe Quimby,TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM,The results are in: this town has voted unanimously to get rid of Springfield's unending nightmare: the Simpsons.
129717,500,54,347000,Moe Szyslak,TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM,They're here! The monsters are here!
129718,500,55,349000,Marge Simpson,TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM,"Moe, it's me, Marge! I'm your friend!"
129719,500,56,353000,Moe Szyslak,TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM,The monster queen is comin' on to me!
129721,500,58,361000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Why would you want to banish us from Springfield?
129722,500,59,363000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Yeah. We're like family to you. I'm talking to you, headphone-bus driver guy."
129723,500,60,369000,Otto Mann,Springfield Town Hall,I'll have you know I'm also a hair donor! Salma Hayek wore me to the Oscars!
129724,500,61,375000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"This is not about who wore whose hair where. We are here to banish the Simpsons, although we are not pleased to be doing so."
129725,500,62,383000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Town Hall,I am!
129726,500,63,384000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield Town Hall,Me too.
129727,500,64,385000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Springfield Town Hall,I feel like a kid at Christmas!
129728,500,65,387000,Sideshow Bob,Springfield Town Hall,I believe you know my position.
129729,500,66,389000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,I know we're all happy-- I'm just trying to spare their feelings.
129730,500,67,393000,Cookie Kwan,Springfield Town Hall,Those freaks have no feelings! Even baby never cry!
129731,500,68,399000,Cookie Kwan,Springfield Town Hall,What baby does that?!
129732,500,69,401000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Why would an entire town go to all this fuss to get rid of one family? What have we done that's so terrible?
129733,500,70,408000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,I'm glad you asked.
129734,500,71,409000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"The simple fact is, the city is going broke cleaning up after Homer's drunken shenanigans..."
129735,500,72,417000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,We won! Woo hoo!
129736,500,73,419000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Homer! That is not banishment-hearing behavior!
129737,500,74,422000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Bart's pranks, which dwindle in humor as they rise in destruction..."
129738,500,75,428000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,And Liser's environmental initiatives...
129739,500,76,433000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,If I may speak.
129740,500,77,434000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Um-hm.
129741,500,78,436000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,We're not monsters. We're just people. People who love each other and love this town. The only place we've ever called home. Thank you.
129742,500,79,450000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Marge, you are a sweet woman and you make us see your family in a more forgiving light."
129743,500,80,455000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Thank you.
129744,500,81,456000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Which is why you're the worst Simpson of all!
129747,500,84,460000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Now, now, now just a second here! Now, I know we're not perfect. But, uh, I believe it was Sammy Hagar who said--"
129748,500,85,467000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Town Hall,Silence!
129749,500,86,470000,Sideshow Mel,Springfield Town Hall,"That was an ""inside me"" bone!"
129751,500,88,476000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Town Hall,Make way for Captain Coolerhead!
129752,500,89,478000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Town Hall,"Now, I like a good old-fashioned witch trial as much as the next person, but I do not think we should be so quick to judge our long-time neighbors..."
129753,500,90,485000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"Not so fast, Flanders. We knew you'd be the voice of mercy. And we're prepared to answer your concerns."
129754,500,91,495000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,Any other objections?
129756,500,93,496000,Ned Flanders,Parking Lot,I withdraw my... diddily...
129758,500,95,504000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,"I always thought ""tarred and feathered"" was just a figure of speech."
129759,500,96,508000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,Good luck patching potholes and stuffing pillows now!
129760,500,97,514000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Outskirts Of Town,"Simpsons, in accordance with article six, section two of the town charter..."
129761,500,98,518000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,"Wait! If you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought."
129762,500,99,526000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,I mean a thousand-year flood!
129763,500,100,530000,Homer Simpson,Outskirts Of Town,I mean a thousand years of perfect weather.
129764,500,101,533000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Outskirts Of Town,Just get out!
129766,500,103,536000,HANK WILLIAMS,Highway,I'M A ROLLING STONE / ALL ALONE AND LOST...
129768,500,105,543000,HANK WILLIAMS,Car,FOR A LIFE OF SIN / I HAVE PAID THE COST...
129769,500,106,551000,Marge Simpson,Car,That was the last Springfield radio station. Now we just get Shelbyville talk radio.
129770,500,107,557000,Shelbyville Announcer,Car,"If you see a Simpson, do not try to reason with it. Just kill it and turn in the pelt for a free soda."
129771,500,108,563000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Soda, eh?"
129772,500,109,568000,Lisa Simpson,Car,"Dad, where are we going? Do we have a plan?"
129773,500,110,572000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Oh, let's face it. I'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. And there's only one way out: I've gotta man up. Okay, manning up... manning up. Mannning-- Girling down! Girling down!"
129775,500,111,591000,Bart Simpson,Car,"Hey, Henrietta Hippo, I've got to drain the inchworm."
129776,500,112,594000,Homer Simpson,Car,Fine.
129777,500,113,604000,Homer Simpson,Car,Please. Put that down.
129778,500,114,605000,Bart Simpson,Car,I just got started!
129779,500,115,606000,Homer Simpson,Car,Not you! Him!
129780,500,116,608000,Mountain Man,Car,You best get back where you belong!
129781,500,117,610000,Marge Simpson,Car,"Please sir, we've been thrown out of a place we've always called home. We just wanna live out our lives in peace."
129782,500,118,617000,Mountain Man,Car,"Rejected by society, huh? Well, why didn't you say so? Welcome to the off-the-grid, unincorporated settlement we proudly call ""The Outlands!"""
129783,500,119,621000,Homer Simpson,Car,"We found a new home! When God shuts a door, he opens a window."
129784,500,120,636000,Mountain Man,Car,"Oh, I wouldn't be openin' no windows. Coyotes will take your baby."
129785,500,121,646000,Mountain Man,Car,THE OUT-LANDS!
129786,500,122,677000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Eh, I'm sick of watching Fox. Let's get some fresh air. I got the ATV's right out back."
129787,500,123,683000,Bart Simpson,Car,Should I get my helmet?
129788,500,124,684000,Homer Simpson,Car,Helmet? That's Springfield talk.
129790,500,126,687000,Bart Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,Is there gas in these?
129791,500,127,688000,Homer Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,Springfield talk!
129792,500,128,690000,Bart Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,Well how are we supposed to get fuel?
129793,500,129,691000,Homer Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,Private plane crashes.
129794,500,130,694000,Lisa Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,"Ahhh, smell that unpolluted air! Y'know, I'm glad we're in exile."
129795,500,131,699000,Homer Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,"Yep, I never realized how much I hated every single one of my friends and relatives."
129796,500,132,704000,Marge Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,I don't think this place is so great.
129797,500,133,709000,Marge Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,"I'm trying to make the best of things, but I'm worried Maggie is falling in with a bad crowd."
129799,500,135,717000,Marge Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,I miss our home and I want to go back.
129800,500,136,720000,Lisa Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,"It's not perfect here, but it is close to nature and if you have an axe to grind, Wikileaks is right over there."
129801,500,137,729000,Bart Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,"How're you doin', Mr. Assange?"
129802,500,138,730000,Julian Assange,THE OUTLANDS,"That's my personal information and you have no right to know about it. Hey, but we're neighbors... would you like to come over for a movie sometime?"
129803,500,139,740000,Marge Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,Is it Iraqi journalists being murdered?
129805,500,140,742000,Julian Assange,THE OUTLANDS,Don't be ridiculous. It's an Afghan wedding being bombed.
129806,500,141,746000,Homer Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,Well I've got a really big secret for you... I'm not wearing any underwear.
129807,500,142,752000,Julian Assange,THE OUTLANDS,"You know, you should really get out less."
129808,500,143,762000,Marge Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,"He's no Ned Flanders. And I miss the Springfield sign and how every street is a dead end. God help me, I even miss Helen Lovejoy criticizing my brownies."
129809,500,144,775000,Homer Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,"Hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes."
129810,500,145,779000,Bart Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,Yes it does.
129811,500,146,780000,Homer Simpson,THE OUTLANDS,"Pipe down, boy. I'm sneaking you back into Springfield."
129813,500,148,787000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Oh, ""Smithers""!"
129814,500,149,790000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,"Homie, these disguises won't fool anyone."
129815,500,150,793000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Pish tosh, Smithers, and fiddle-dee-dee! Nailed it!"
129816,500,151,797000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,Hold it right there!
129817,500,152,799000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Mr. Burns! You might catch a cold out this late. You want my jacket? Here, lemme warm my gun up for ya."
129818,500,153,807000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Excellent.
129819,500,154,809000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Yeah, it wouldn't be you if you didn't say ""excellent."""
129821,500,156,809000,Homer Simpson,Lard Lad Donuts,"You know what's great about you, Marge? After all these years you can still shinny up the donut, and then pull me up after you."
129822,500,157,825000,Marge Simpson,Lard Lad Donuts,Look! A shooting star!
129823,500,158,829000,Homer Simpson,Lard Lad Donuts,Do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets?
129824,500,159,832000,Marge Simpson,Lard Lad Donuts,On a night like tonight I have to believe there are.
129827,500,162,842000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Strike! Woo hoo!
129828,500,163,844000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Wanna make out over the foul line?
129829,500,164,847000,Homer Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,Ever since the day we met.
129831,500,166,854000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,The old homestead. Remember when we moved in and I talked like this?
129835,500,170,861000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,There's no sex like fugitive sex.
129836,500,171,874000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,Home sweet squat.
129837,500,172,877000,DOLPH,Simpson Home,"Yeah, this place is awesome, but it's not puppy safe, and my little guy's coming tomorrow."
129838,500,173,884000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Someone's downstairs!
129839,500,174,888000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,I think I heard a pair of underpants being picked up off the ground. Big ones!
129840,500,175,895000,DOLPH,Simpson Home,It's them! Bart's mom and the fat guy!
129841,500,176,898000,DOLPH,Simpson Home,Let's turn 'em in.
129842,500,177,899000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Not so fast. This case was already cracked...by the last person you'd expect -- the Chief of Police! You really thought you could fool me with that Burns and Smithers getup? I mean, I'm not the sharpest pencil in the pencil thing, but I'm at least as smart as a cat. Right, Lou?"
129843,500,178,915000,Lou,Simpson Home,"What breed, Chief?"
129844,500,179,917000,Lou,Simpson Home,"I mean, I saw an Abyssinian once who could change channels."
129845,500,180,920000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,That is pretty smart.
129846,500,181,922000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All right! You caught us. What are you gonna do about it? Throw us out of town again?
129847,500,182,926000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Home,Crucify them! And screw the boulder in tight!
129848,500,183,930000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Make 'em write monologue jokes!
129849,500,184,931000,Sideshow Mel,Simpson Home,Cancel their subscription to the opera!
129850,500,185,934000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We hate opera!
129851,500,186,935000,Sideshow Mel,Simpson Home,Then get them a subscription to the opera!
129852,500,187,938000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Nooo!
129853,500,188,939000,Gil Gunderson,Simpson Home,I say shoot 'em!
129854,500,189,940000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,Now hold on just a minute. Nobody said anything about shooting.
129855,500,190,943000,Gil Gunderson,Simpson Home,I did. Just now.
129856,500,191,943000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Home,"Ah, that's right, you did. Well, all right."
129857,500,192,950000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't even bother shooting us. We've found a new place that we love. A place that may not have indoor plumbing, but it's got something we treasure more..."
129858,500,193,962000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah. Non-jerks!
129860,500,195,964000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Simpson Home,Maybe he's right. We are jerks.
129861,500,196,967000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Simpson Home,"You want I should spray some of my ""Jerk Off"" on ya?"
129862,500,197,970000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Simpson Home,Eh -- it's okay.
129863,500,198,972000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Simpson Home,"In our new community, people accept others for who they are. I thought I wanted to come back to my house, but instead, I'm going to go back to my home."
129864,500,199,986000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Well, bah to them. Let's go, Smithers."
129804,500,200,990000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Getting a little clingy, aren't we?"
129865,500,201,993000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Home,"Oh, all right."
129866,500,202,996000,Waylon Smithers,Simpson Home,That's all it took? I just had to ask?
129868,500,204,1004000,Homer Simpson,OUTLANDS,"Well, I've tightened the bolt! I think we're good!"
129869,500,205,1008000,Bart Simpson,OUTLANDS,You sure this is a good idea?
129870,500,206,1010000,Homer Simpson,OUTLANDS,"This is the outlands, boy. Ideas aren't good or bad, they're just free! Power on!"
129871,500,207,1018000,Homer Simpson,OUTLANDS,"I was wrong, there are bad ideas! There are terrible ideas!"
129872,500,208,1024000,Homer Simpson,OUTLANDS,Now I'm over here!
129874,500,210,1028000,Bart Simpson,OUTLANDS,I'm on it.
129876,500,212,1037000,Bart Simpson,OUTLANDS,Lenny Lenford. You're a long way from your barstool.
129877,500,213,1041000,Lenny Leonard,OUTLANDS,"I'm-I'm-I'm here as a friend, looking for a better way of life!"
129878,500,214,1053000,Homer Simpson,OUTLANDS,"Hey Lenny, welcome aboard."
129879,500,215,1057000,Homer Simpson,OUTLANDS,"Now, I gotta warn you, if you find a little black thing on your pillow, it won't be a mint."
129880,500,216,1062000,Lenny Leonard,OUTLANDS,I don't mind. I want a fresh start... and so does Carl.
129881,500,217,1065000,Carl Carlson,OUTLANDS,Get her off! Get her off!
129882,500,218,1067000,Homer Simpson,OUTLANDS,"Let her slice off the tip of your ear, and she'll go right to sleep."
129883,500,219,1072000,Carl Carlson,OUTLANDS,No!
129884,500,220,1072000,Homer Simpson,OUTLANDS,That's not a choice you get to make.
129885,500,221,1075000,Carl Carlson,OUTLANDS,This is pretty tasty.
129886,500,222,1076000,Lenny Leonard,OUTLANDS,Yep. And I like how it's dissolving a hole in the cup.
129887,500,223,1080000,Moe Szyslak,OUTLANDS,Hey! Guys! What can I getcha?
129888,500,224,1083000,Homer Simpson,OUTLANDS,Forget it. We don't need some big city bartender chargin' us an arm and a leg for something we can do ourselves.
