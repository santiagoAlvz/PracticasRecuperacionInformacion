92702,358,6,66000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,It's seven a.m. What are they cock-a-doodily-doin'?
92703,358,7,70000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Flanders, I can't listen to your crap before my coffee."
92704,358,8,73000,Ned Flanders,Evergreen Terrace,"Okily-dokily, here's some French roast, now I'll go make toast."
92705,358,9,78000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Stupid best friend Flanders.
92706,358,10,81000,Bart Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,A stamp museum?
92707,358,11,84000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,Stamps? Those are for snail mail! Stamps rule! I mean suck!
92708,358,12,92000,Marge Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"Well, they just can't start building in our neighborhood without asking us. What ever happened to ""please"" and ""thank you""?"
92709,358,13,98000,Homer Simpson,Evergreen Terrace,"I think they killed each other. You know, one of those murder-suicide deals."
92711,358,15,103000,Marge Simpson,Construction Site,We have to stop all this construction. The noise is jiggling my grapes to the bottom of the Jell-o.
92712,358,16,110000,Homer Simpson,Construction Site,What man would want this now?!
92713,358,17,114000,Homer Simpson,Construction Site,Two four six eight! I hate stamps! They aren't great!
92714,358,18,121000,Homer Simpson,Construction Site,"Okay, how about this? Seven, four three one... oh wait, that's my pin number. Everyone forget that."

92716,358,20,142000,Bart Simpson,Construction Site,Again!
92717,358,21,145000,Bart Simpson,Construction Site,Again!
92718,358,22,145000,Bart Simpson,Construction Site,That's enough.
92719,358,23,160000,Truck Driver,Construction Site,"""Come home from Iraq,"" my wife says. ""Fallujah's too dangerous,"" my wife says."
92720,358,24,170000,Workers,Construction Site,Oh yeah! / Shake it baby!
92722,358,26,177000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"All right, Homer! You beat those stamp Nazis with good old-fashioned American complaining."
92723,358,27,184000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"Homer, if it weren't for you, we'd be at the mercy of weekend philatelists."
92724,358,28,192000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"Why didn't you just say ""stamp collectors""?"
92725,358,29,194000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,I'm tired of dumbing myself down for you.
92726,358,30,196000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"The Postal Service is sending a change of address card... to itself. The stamp museum will now be built on the site of the Springfield Cemetery. The cemetery will be moved right here, next to the Simpsons."
92727,358,31,207000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Instead of a stamp museum we'll be next door to a graveyard?!
92728,358,32,212000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look at the bright side, Marge. When I die, you can mourn me from the bathroom. That's multi-tasking."
92729,358,36,221000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"This is a little too spooky for me. I don't even like watching ""The Count"" on Sesame Street."
92730,358,37,227000,Vampire Puppet,Simpson Home,"One coconut, two coconuts, three coconuts..."
92731,358,38,232000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Go back to your own country!
92734,358,41,260000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,This stinks -- my room is the only one that faces that cemetery!
92735,358,42,263000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Then the zombies will eat you first, and you won't have to watch 'em eat us."
92736,358,43,267000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Thanks for making me feel better.
92737,358,44,268000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, thanks for making me feel better, knowing that your screams when the zombies chomp your brains will warn me so I can get away."
92738,358,45,273000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,There's no such thing as zombies!
92739,358,46,276000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, glad to hear you say that -- because the person who doesn't believe in zombies is always the first to get feasted upon."
92740,358,47,285000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Stop scaring me!
92741,358,48,290000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, don't you have homework to do?"
92742,358,49,292000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, and I could really use your help."
92743,358,50,301000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I believe in science and reality, not ghosts and monsters!"
92746,358,53,317000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Can I sleep with you guys tonight?
92747,358,54,319000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh sure you can, sweetie. Just don't make a habit of it."
92748,358,55,323000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, just let me clear some space."
92749,358,56,332000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,So that's why I've been smelling margaritas at three a.m.
92750,358,57,337000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I love waking up drunk in the morning."
92752,358,59,351000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, honey. I know last night was tough, but all our kids sleep by themselves. We don't even hear Maggie cry at night anymore!"
92753,358,60,359000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, wait a minute. There's no batteries in this thing."
92754,358,61,363000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I, uh, needed them for my remote control helicopter."
92755,358,62,366000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tonight I want you to really try to sleep in your own bed, because... Homer, stop that!"
92756,358,63,373000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,There's a little plastic man in your hair and I'm trying to rescue him.
92757,358,64,378000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No soldier left behind.
92759,358,65,380000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, can you help me out here?"
92760,358,66,384000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, honey, if you sleep in your own bed tomorrow, we'll do something special, just for you."
92761,358,67,391000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I heard they finished the stamp museum. That could be fun."
92764,358,70,397000,Homer Simpson,Car,I can't believe it took us forty minutes to get here. Why can't they build a stamp museum closer to our house?
92765,358,71,404000,Lisa Simpson,Car,"Dad, you fought tooth and nail to get it away from our house."
92766,358,72,407000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Lisa, when you've sustained as many blows to the head as I have, consistency is something, something that, something I love you, Bart."
92767,358,73,420000,Marge Simpson,Car,Isn't this Lenny's house?
92769,358,75,423000,Lenny Leonard,LENNY'S FRONT LAWN,"Hey, Simpsons! That'll be forty bucks!"
92770,358,76,425000,Homer Simpson,LENNY'S FRONT LAWN,I thought it was twenty.
92771,358,77,427000,Lenny Leonard,LENNY'S FRONT LAWN,"Yeah, that's per axle. Park over there in Carl Four. No early outs!"
92772,358,78,432000,Homer Simpson,LENNY'S FRONT LAWN,I can't believe you're making money off this!
92773,358,79,434000,Lenny Leonard,LENNY'S FRONT LAWN,"Oh, yeah. Living next to the Stamp Museum is making me a mint. I bought a diamond for my bellybutton!"
92774,358,80,441000,Lenny Leonard,LENNY'S FRONT LAWN,You guys need water?
92775,358,81,445000,Homer Simpson,LENNY'S FRONT LAWN,No one's gonna pay a buck to drink water from your hose --
92776,358,82,449000,Bart Simpson,LENNY'S FRONT LAWN,"Pay the man, Homer."
92778,358,84,455000,Lisa Simpson,STAMP MUSEUM,"Wow, look at all these worthy Americans..."
92779,358,85,461000,Frederick Ives Hologram,STAMP MUSEUM,My name is Frederick Ives. I invented the halftone printing process.

92782,358,88,478000,Alexander Graham Bell Hologram,STAMP MUSEUM,"And I'm Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone."
92783,358,89,481000,Elisha Gray Hologram,STAMP MUSEUM,"You stole it from me, Elisha Gray!"
92784,358,90,484000,Alexander Graham Bell Hologram,STAMP MUSEUM,"Read the patent number, bitch!"
92786,358,92,488000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,"""The Land of the Wild Beasts?"" That's the first book I read all the way through."
92787,358,93,492000,Bart Simpson,Museum,You read a book all the way through? Why?
92789,358,94,496000,Museum Head,Museum,Milton Burkhart's work has touched on every genre from books to films... to advertising!
92790,358,95,502000,Bart Simpson,Museum,"All right, commercials!"

92803,358,108,553000,Museum Head,JUNGLE,"Tell us, Mr. Burkhart, what led you to the magical world of children's books?"
92804,358,109,558000,Milton Burkhart,JUNGLE,I wanted to be a children's book illustrator ever since Playboy wouldn't publish my cartoons because they were too filthy.
92806,358,111,578000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Groundskeeper Willie?
92807,358,112,579000,Gravedigger Billy,Simpson Home,"No, I'm his cousin, Gravedigger Billy. I've been diggin' graves for thirty years and I've never buried anyone alive. If I did, they'd ring this bell."
92808,358,113,591000,Gravedigger Billy,Simpson Home,"Oh, that's just the wind!"
92809,358,114,595000,Gravedigger Billy,Simpson Home,"Oh, that's just a tree branch! With a nice watch on it!"

92813,358,118,613000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't care what Apu was in a past life. In this life, he's a blabbermouth!"
92814,358,119,618000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, and that Dr. Hibbert was so boring... ""Homer, we've got to get that lump checked out... Homer, we must discuss your test results... Homer, we've got to find you a donor..."" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
92815,358,120,630000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I thought those people were your friends.
92816,358,121,634000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Look who's sleeping in our bed again.
92817,358,122,638000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't know grownups said bad things about other grownups.
92819,358,123,641000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You see, sweetie, when a mommy and a daddy are married for years and have nothing new to talk about, they bad-mouth their closest friends."
92820,358,124,649000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But I thought it was wrong to talk about people behind their backs.
92821,358,125,652000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I spy with my little eye, a girl who's not sleeping in her room like she promised."
92822,358,126,657000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I know. I'm sorry.
92823,358,127,659000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, and I spy with my little eye something with four legs that can't run."
92824,358,128,664000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, we're not really playing."
92826,358,130,666000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Is it the chair?
92827,358,131,668000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Exactly. Now, what has two ears but can't hear?"

92829,358,133,671000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tragically, yes."
92830,358,134,673000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What if we show Lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened? Hm?
92831,358,135,679000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, Marge. But don't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up."
92832,358,136,685000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I hope he's accompanied by the ""How was your day"" monster, and the ""Foot rub"" monster and the let me just..."
92833,358,137,685000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, he's not showin' up."
92835,358,139,703000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Boy, Lisa's room really is scary."
92836,358,140,708000,Gravedigger Billy,Simpson Home,"Now Willie, the pot of gold I saw is right down there."
92837,358,141,713000,Groundskeeper Willie,Simpson Home,"All I see is an empty grave. Why don't you fill it, ya lazy bastard?"
92838,358,142,718000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Finally, back in the only safe bedroom in the house."
92839,358,143,721000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What about Bart's bedroom?
92840,358,144,723000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You know that racecar bed I made him?
92841,358,145,725000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah.
92842,358,146,725000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,The brakes are shot.
92843,358,147,727000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
92844,358,148,733000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, honey. Any chance you can stop reading soon?"
92845,358,149,738000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, I'll watch TV."
92847,358,151,741000,TV Announcer,Simpson Home,"Now, RerunLand takes you back to nineteen sixty-five with Bonanza."
92848,358,152,746000,Cowboy In Black,Simpson Home,"See here, Cartwright. Your boys have been eatin' my apples."
92849,358,153,750000,Ben Cartwright,Simpson Home,That doesn't sound like my boys. I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue!
92788,358,154,760000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, do you really want to watch this?"
92850,358,155,764000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I think there's a danger this time they might lose the Ponderosa!"
92851,358,156,768000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow.
92852,358,157,769000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Learn to drive, boy!"
92853,358,158,773000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We need professional help.
92856,358,161,782000,Child Therapist,Psychiatrist's Office,"As a young child, did Lisa receive a lot of nurturing?"
92857,358,162,785000,Marge Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Frankly, no. Lisa kind of took care of herself. Our oldest, Bart, was such a handful."
92858,358,163,792000,Child Therapist,Psychiatrist's Office,Did you bring those home movies of your daughter I asked for?
92859,358,164,795000,Homer Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,Uh... this is all I could find.
92860,358,165,802000,Homer Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,Why you very little...!
92862,358,167,806000,Marge Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Homer, stop that!"

92865,358,170,815000,Homer Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,Stationary camera.
92866,358,171,818000,Child Therapist,Psychiatrist's Office,"I see. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, to overcome her neglect, Lisa had to suppress her childhood fears. My ten-week program can help her learn to be a kid again."
92867,358,172,828000,Child Therapist,Psychiatrist's Office,Well worth the four thousand dollars.
92868,358,173,831000,Marge Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,Four thousand dollars?!
92869,358,174,832000,Homer Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Now Marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake..."
92870,358,175,832000,Homer Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,"Run, Marge! Start the car!"
92871,358,176,842000,Child Therapist,Psychiatrist's Office,"I'm not chasing you, Mr. Simpson."
92872,358,177,844000,Homer Simpson,Psychiatrist's Office,And you won't... unless you can leap through fire!
92874,358,179,852000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't keep sleeping in Mom and Dad's room.
92875,358,180,855000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, if Dad ever rolls over, you're dead."
92876,358,181,857000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Mom showed me how to make a retaining wall out of pillows. But I'm gonna conquer my fears... tonight.
92878,358,183,876000,Lisa Simpson,OTHER SIDE OF THE GATE,I've changed my mind! Can you please open the gate?
92879,358,184,879000,Security Guard,OTHER SIDE OF THE GATE,"Oh, I don't work here. I-I was just visiting another security guard that died. Bye now."
92883,358,186,895000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"If I can just spend the night here, I'll never be scared again. And boy, you're free to go home whenever you want."
92884,358,187,913000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"Hi, Dr. Nick."
92885,358,188,914000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Springfield Cemetery,"Hi, everybody! I mean, I'm not Dr. Nick, I'm Dr. Octopus. Ha!"
92886,358,189,922000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Springfield Cemetery,"I'm going to get you, Spidey. Then I will have upside-down kiss with Mary Jane."
92887,358,190,929000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,"Bye, Dr. Nick."
92888,358,191,931000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Springfield Cemetery,"Bye, Lisa. And remember: you have a checkup next Thursday."
92889,358,192,935000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Cemetery,We don't go to you anymore. We have a better doctor.
92890,358,193,938000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Springfield Cemetery,"Oh, congratulations!"
92892,358,195,947000,Chief Wiggum,Cemetery,"Boys, that grave robber could be anywhere. The most vital thing is that we stick together. We... where did everybody go?"
92893,358,196,953000,Chief Wiggum,Cemetery,"Okay, this is it, Clancy. No squad car, no backup, legs cramping in fear, sweat in my eyes and groin... I'd better get outta this damn cop uniform before someone takes a shot at me."
92894,358,197,966000,Chief Wiggum,Cemetery,"There we go. Hey, there's my Walkman."
92895,358,198,977000,Lou,Cemetery,"You know, I actually got into law school, but I just couldn't afford it."
92896,358,199,980000,Eddie,Cemetery,"Quiet, I hear something."
92897,358,200,982000,Lou,Cemetery,"Yeah, that's my life slippin' away."
92898,358,201,984000,Lisa Simpson,Cemetery,"Okay, gotta keep calm. If Scooby Doo has taught me anything, it's that the only thing to fear are crooked real estate developers."
92902,358,205,1020000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Where's Lisa, boy? This book's gonna solve all her problems."
92903,358,206,1024000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if you're lookin' for Lisa, she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back."
92904,358,207,1027000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,The cemetery? And you're just sitting here?
92905,358,208,1030000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I figured the best thing I could do is monitor the news for any reports.
92906,358,209,1034000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You're watching cartoons!
92907,358,210,1040000,Scratchy,Simpson Home,Just the show for me!
92908,358,211,1050000,Performer,Simpson Home,Tim Tom Tabby is a curious cat. / Went to see the queen in a velveteen hat.
92909,358,212,1058000,Scratchy,Simpson Home,This is so boring.
92910,358,213,1066000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Mom, can we have fried chicken for dinner?"
92818,358,215,1069000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,Lisa!
92881,358,216,1071000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,Lisa! Lisa!
92882,358,217,1073000,Marge Simpson,Cemetery,"Don't worry, we're not evil spirits."
92912,358,218,1076000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,"Although if we were evil spirits, we'd probably assume the shape of your parents."

92916,358,222,1099000,Skull,Cemetery,But I ain't gramma!

92918,358,224,1114000,Milhouse Slug,Cemetery,I made us a dream house out of slime!
92919,358,225,1118000,Milhouse Slug,Cemetery,"I don't know how I reproduce, but we'll have a great time figuring it out."
92921,358,227,1128000,Lisa Simpson,Cemetery,Where am I?
92923,358,229,1135000,Wild Beast #1,Cemetery,"Welcome to the Land of Wild Beasts, little girl."
92924,358,230,1145000,Lisa Simpson,Cemetery,Not scared... not scared...
92925,358,231,1148000,Wild Beast #2,Cemetery,"For God's sake, girl, you're eight years old. It's natural for you to feel scared sometimes."
92926,358,232,1153000,Lisa Simpson,Cemetery,But I'm too smart to get scared.
92927,358,233,1155000,Wild Beast #2,Cemetery,"Lisa, everybody gets scared. No matter how old or how smart they are. In fact, I'm scared of her."
92928,358,234,1162000,Wild Beast #3,Cemetery,"No, you're afraid of intimacy."
92929,358,235,1165000,Wild Beast #2,Cemetery,"That's because I know after we mate, you'll eat me."
92930,358,236,1168000,Wild Beast #3,Cemetery,Your brother didn't seem to mind!
92931,358,237,1170000,Lisa Simpson,Cemetery,"You know, you monsters seem scary, but when you get a little closer you're just funny."
92933,358,239,1183000,Lisa Simpson,Cemetery,But wait. How am I supposed to sleep with that spooky cemetery outside my window?
92934,358,240,1188000,Wild Beast #3,Cemetery,"You could just draw the blinds, you silly goose."
92935,358,241,1191000,Wild Beast #2,Cemetery,Or get a nightlight.
92936,358,242,1192000,Lisa Simpson,Cemetery,My Dad says they're too expensive.
92937,358,243,1196000,Wild Beast #1,Cemetery,"For God's sake, they're four bucks apiece."
92938,358,244,1198000,Milhouse Slug,Cemetery,I could slime your Dad. Just like I slimed us a Paris honeymoon.
92939,358,245,1205000,Lisa Simpson,Cemetery,I think I'll be okay by myself.
92940,358,246,1208000,Milhouse Slug,Cemetery,What is it about slime that chicks don't dig?
92941,358,247,1214000,Lisa Simpson,Cemetery,"Bye, guys. You really helped me a lot."

92946,358,252,1230000,Lisa Simpson,Graveyard,New pony?
92947,358,253,1231000,Homer Simpson,Graveyard,Uh... this is still part of your dream. Dreaming... dreaming... now you're awake.
92948,358,254,1239000,Marge Simpson,Graveyard,"Sweetie, we're gonna get you home and straighten out all these fears you have."
92949,358,255,1244000,Lisa Simpson,Graveyard,I think I'm gonna be fine. Let's get some breakfast.
92950,358,256,1252000,Lou,Graveyard,"Uh, Chief, it's light out. You can open your eyes and come down."
92951,358,257,1256000,Chief Wiggum,Graveyard,"I don't wanna, Lou."
