115225,445,1,19000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Children, it's time to announce my choice to represent our class at the National Reading Roundup."
148723,445,2,140000,Lisa's Thoughts,Springfield Elementary School,Here it comes.
115226,445,3,142000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,My choice is... Hubert Wong!
115227,445,4,146000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Hooray for Different-Face!
115228,445,5,148000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Congratulations, Hubert. Or should I congratulate your tutor: Amelia, at the Homework Factory! Your victory is tainted! Asterisk! Asterisk!"
115229,445,6,156000,Miss Hoover,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, don't take it personally. I barely spent any time on this decision."
115230,445,7,162000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Asterisk! Asterisk! Asterisk!
115231,445,8,168000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa Simpson?! In detention?! My horoscope told me I'd see something interesting today, but I thought that meant the horoscope itself!"
115232,445,9,175000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Stupid Miss Hoover.
115233,445,10,180000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I heard about your run-in with Hoover. Aren't teachers the worst?
115234,445,11,183000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I don't want to talk about it.
115235,445,12,184000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Listen, you're a smart kid. I bet you like ideas."
115236,445,13,188000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I do.
115237,445,14,189000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I just had a whopper! What if you got revenge on Krabappel for me, and I got revenge on Hoover for you? Crisscross!"
115238,445,15,198000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Interesting. With no obvious motive, no one would suspect us."
115239,445,16,202000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Exactly. Crisscross! Do we have a deal?
115240,445,17,204000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Thanks... but I'll pass.
115241,445,18,206000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"If I say ""crisscross"" one more time, will that change your mind?"
115242,445,19,206000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Listen, you're a persistent fellow, but I--"
115243,445,20,210000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Crisscross!
115244,445,21,210000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'm in.
115246,445,23,228000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,"Bart, have you established your alibi?"
115247,445,24,230000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Yep. I'm at the tennis match.
115248,445,25,232000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Street,And people will remember you were there?
115249,445,26,233000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,I'm pretty sure they will.
115251,445,28,244000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Edna's Apartment,Hello? Hello? I've been ding-dong-ditched!
115252,445,29,251000,Lisa Simpson,Edna's Apartment,Crisscross.
115254,445,31,255000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You should've seen the look on Krabappel's face!
115255,445,32,258000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"And you should've seen the look on Hoover's face. In fact, here it is."
115256,445,33,264000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You killed her?
115257,445,34,266000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Right. Like we agreed.
115258,445,35,267000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I never said ""kill!"""
115259,445,36,269000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, 'cause you're smart. You don't say ""kill,"" you say ""prank."" Like Mom and Dad say ""snuggle"" when what they really mean is ""let's lock the door and hug."""
115260,445,37,270000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I didn't kill Mrs. Krabappel!"
115262,445,38,279000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,So all you did was ring her doorbell and run?
115263,445,39,281000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, ding-dong-ditch!"
115264,445,40,283000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Ding-dong-ditch"" means you kill her, then you throw that ding-dong into a ditch. Geez, pick up a book."
115265,445,41,290000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,You're a monster!
115266,445,42,291000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"A deal's a deal, little sister. Tomorrow after school, go to her house and t.p. her."
115267,445,43,295000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it? Just t.p. her?
115268,445,44,297000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, torture and pulverize her. Then ding-dong-ditch the body and we're even."
115269,445,45,301000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I think I'm gonna be sick.
115270,445,46,314000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oh, Lisa! Come hold this blade so it doesn't slice through my neck."
115271,445,47,320000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Simpson Home,Come on! I trust you completely!
115272,445,48,329000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Slice her like a bagel!
115273,445,49,331000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Simpson Home,"Ah, got it! Thanks, Lisa. Last thing I want is to be sliced in two -- you know, like a bagel."
115275,445,51,346000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Bart?!
115276,445,52,347000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I've been waiting for you -- and trying to figure out how girls pee.
115277,445,53,353000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Sorry Bart, I couldn't do it! There's got to be another way."
115278,445,54,356000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"What if I gave you homework help? I won't give you the answers, but I'll give you the tools to find the answers yourself."
115279,445,55,362000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"No dice -- either take care of Krabappel, or Groundskeeper Willie will say he saw you kill Miss Hoover."
115280,445,56,367000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Why would Willie do that?
115281,445,57,369000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Let's just say... he owes me a favor.
115283,445,59,373000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Crisscross! Like the plaid on me kilt!
115284,445,60,377000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You're not wearin' a kilt.
115285,445,61,378000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Uh-oh.
115286,445,62,379000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"All right, Bart... I guess I have no choice. I have to kill... you!"
115288,445,64,423000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,/ Ice cream! /
115289,445,65,435000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Go ahead, do it. You're no different from me. We're made from the same dinna."
115292,445,66,439000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"It's pronounced ""D.N.A.,"" you idiot. And we are not the same -- I am not a murderer, and I never will be!"
115293,445,67,450000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Well done, Lisa!"
115294,445,68,452000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"It was an accident, I swear!"
115295,445,69,454000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Sure. An accident. Ha!
115296,445,70,457000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Ay carumba, you little snot."
115297,445,71,470000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm here at Krustyburger for the launch of the highly-anticipated ""Burger Squared."" Krusty, what can you tell us about this fantastic new sandwich?"
115298,445,72,478000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm glad you asked, Kent."
115299,445,73,479000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Elementary School,"We start with Grade A beef, feed that to other cows, then kill them and serve the unholy results on a seven-grain bun. Burger Squared!"
115300,445,74,489000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,The math checks out!
115301,445,75,491000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Cows eating cows?! That's an abomination!
115302,445,76,495000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Now Lisa, you're a vegetarian, but these cows have made a different choice."
115303,445,77,499000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School,And now this lucky reporter will be the first human to sample this delicious crime against nature.
115304,445,78,506000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Elementary School,Juicy... flavorful... with just a hint of
115305,445,79,513000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey! That's my check-cashing arm, you stupid..."
115308,445,82,531000,Moe Szyslak,Evergreen Terrace,A little tip: you might wanna wash me before you eat me.
115311,445,85,537000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,The munchers got Moe!
115312,445,86,539000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we're not going out to help him. We have no idea what hideous creatures might be out there!"
115313,445,87,543000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Please let me in!
115314,445,88,546000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How do I know you're not a muncher?
115315,445,89,547000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm your father and I need your help!
115316,445,90,550000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I can't make sense of that muncher talk!
115317,445,91,557000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Hungry. So hungry. There's nothing to eat. Except this.
115318,445,92,564000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,There's gotta be something yummy out there.
115320,445,94,575000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,A hamburger!
115290,445,98,586000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart ate a tainted burger!
115106,445,99,588000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll bash him with this book!
115322,445,100,591000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, no! That's the last book in the world!"
115323,445,101,595000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Really?
115324,445,102,596000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, and-- Oh, go ahead."
115325,445,103,600000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Wait! The burger didn't change me! I'm not a muncher!
115326,445,104,604000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my God. If Bart could eat the burger and survive, then maybe he can yield the key to an anti-muncher vaccine!"
115327,445,105,613000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Then we must keep this boy safe from harm!
115329,445,107,616000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Better call Dr. Hibbert.
115331,445,109,621000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Dr. Hibbert's Office,"Well, I suppose Bart could be immune -- a genetic ""chosen one,"" if you will."
115333,445,111,627000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"If so, secrets locked within his blood could be the key to saving humanity."
115334,445,112,632000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"You must get him immediately to the safe zone, just outside of town. And if you see my wife... tell her I love her."
115335,445,113,638000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You mean tell her I love her? Or I meaning you?
115337,445,115,644000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll just high-five her.
115338,445,116,650000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now remember, no loud noises. Oh man, that breeze feels good!"
115339,445,117,663000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,To the panic room!
115340,445,118,665000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We don't have a panic room!
115341,445,119,667000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,To the panic room store!
115342,445,120,675000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Simpson Home,Come with me if you want to live.
115343,445,121,679000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Another politician who can't keep his promises.

115345,445,123,684000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Simpson Home,This way!
115346,445,124,685000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, this day can't get any crazier."
115349,445,127,701000,Lisa Simpson,JEEP,"Apu, how did you survive?"
115350,445,128,703000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,JEEP,"Well, as a vegetarian, I did not consume any tainted burgers, and as a convenience store owner, I am armed to the teeth."
115351,445,129,714000,Muncher,JEEP,We need windows too!
115353,445,131,722000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,JEEP,Shoot her!
115355,445,133,726000,Marge Simpson,JEEP,I can't shoot her. She's Lisa's godmother.
115356,445,134,728000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,JEEP,You can apologize in Hell!
115291,445,135,730000,Marge Simpson,JEEP,I guess I could!
115358,445,137,748000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Outskirts Of Springfield,"I will get out and push. No matter what, Bart must make it to the safe zone."
115360,445,139,760000,Marge Simpson,JEEP,That was so noble of Apu to give his life for us.
115361,445,140,763000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,JEEP,Where are you going?! You were supposed to stop at the bottom and wait for me!
115363,445,142,781000,Marge Simpson,DESERT AREA,I don't see the safe zone anywhere.
115364,445,143,783000,Bart Simpson,DESERT AREA,Let's play a game: who gets to carry the chosen one?
115365,445,144,786000,Bart Simpson,DESERT AREA,Ow!
115366,445,145,787000,Lisa Simpson,DESERT AREA,"Oh, did the chosen one hurt his chosen little noggin?"

115368,445,147,797000,Homer Simpson,DESERT AREA,"Well, well, well."
115369,445,148,800000,Homer Simpson,DESERT AREA,Who's an unproductive worker now?
115370,445,149,803000,Homer Simpson,DESERT AREA,Got your nose.
115372,445,151,806000,Homer Simpson,DESERT AREA,Why you...
115374,445,153,815000,Marge Simpson,Woods,"Homie, where have you been?"
115376,445,155,820000,Lisa Simpson,Woods,"Dad, are you becoming a muncher?"
115377,445,156,822000,Homer Simpson,Woods,"I think the better brains is, are you brains a brains?"
115378,445,157,827000,Bart Simpson,Woods,"Where do you want it, the mouth or the eyes?"
115379,445,158,829000,Homer Simpson,Woods,"Ooo, mouth."
115380,445,159,829000,Bart Simpson,Woods,Eyes it is.
115381,445,160,831000,Marge Simpson,Woods,"No! When we get you to the safe zone, we can cure your father!"
115382,445,161,835000,Wild-eyed Man,Woods,"Safe zone? You really think there's a safe zone? Well, you're right. It's right over there."
115385,445,164,844000,Marge Simpson,SAFE ZONE,Let us in. We have the chosen one!
115386,445,165,849000,Head Soldier,SAFE ZONE,"Welcome, son. To survive, all we must do is eat your flesh."
115387,445,166,854000,Marge Simpson,SAFE ZONE,"Hold it right there, Bub. What kind of civilized people eat the body and blood of their savior?"
115388,445,167,862000,Marge Simpson,SAFE ZONE,There must be another way...
115389,445,168,869000,Lisa Simpson,SAFE ZONE,"Time has passed. Children play in the streets. At night, there is music and laughter."
115390,445,169,874000,Lisa Simpson,SAFE ZONE,And all we had to do was let Bart take a bath in our food.
115391,445,170,878000,Bart Simpson,SAFE ZONE,"Hey, Lis. Want some soup?"
115394,445,175,898000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,OH WHY CAN'T NO GIRL LOVE A GUY WITH THIS MUG...WHOSE MOTHER DECLARED / YOU'RE TOO UGLY TO HUG...

115431,445,211,1062000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"So Marge, uh... Homer's been gone a whole week, huh? In an unrelated matter, I just put on cologne and shaved my knuckles."
115432,445,212,1072000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I'm still hoping Homie will come back.
115433,445,213,1075000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Marge, I've got some bad news to give you."
115434,445,214,1078000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"It's a letter from Homer. On my stationery. In my handwriting. Using my idioms and speech patterns.
