83355,324,2,33000,Lisa Simpson,Library,I have to research a paper. Where did all the books go?
83356,324,3,36000,Elderly Librarian,Library,"Books? Books are for squares. We're now a multi-media learning center for children of all ages, but mostly bums."
83357,324,4,47000,Bart Simpson,Library,Ay carumba!
83358,324,5,57000,Lisa Simpson,Library,"""Everybody Poops, the Video?"" ""Yu-gi-oh Price Guides?"" There are hardly any books at all!"
83359,324,6,59000,Milhouse Van Houten,Library,No books? But Krabappel wants a paper on Henry the Eighth -- and I have to score at least a pumpkin sticker or better on it.
83360,324,7,67000,Marge Simpson,Library,"There, there, I can help you kids."
83362,324,9,72000,Marge Simpson,Library,I know a little something about history. Gather 'round.
83364,324,11,76000,Marge Simpson,HAMPTON COURT PALACE,"Henry the Eighth had everything he could want, except a son to follow in his footsteps..."
83365,324,12,84000,Henry VIII,HAMPTON COURT PALACE,"I'M HEN-E-RY THE EIGHTH I AM / HEN-E-RY THE EIGHTH I AM, I AM / I'VE BEEN EATING SINCE SIX A.M. / FOR DESSERT I'LL HAVE DINNER AGAIN / MY NAME'S SYNONYMOUS WITH GLUTTONY / I'LL ALWAYS EAT A TURKEY OR A HAM..."
83366,324,13,99000,MARGARINE OF ARAGON,HAMPTON COURT PALACE,Stop singing that song! We all know who you are.
83367,324,14,105000,Court Herald,HAMPTON COURT PALACE,"Her majesty, Margarine of Aragon!"
83368,324,15,109000,Henry VIII,HAMPTON COURT PALACE,What are you doing out of bed? I just planted my seed in your womanly dirt.
83369,324,16,112000,MARGARINE OF ARAGON,HAMPTON COURT PALACE,"Your Majesty, I know you want a son, but must we discuss my womb in front of the entire court?"
83370,324,17,120000,Royal Physician,HAMPTON COURT PALACE,As Royal physician it is my learned opinion that her womb is filled with sea serpents.
83372,324,19,129000,Henry VIII,ROYAL BEDCHAMBER,Must sire a dude. Must sire a dude.
83373,324,20,135000,Prince Bart,ROYAL BEDCHAMBER,"Father dearest, I am the son you crave! I'm smart, athletic and ever so masculine. Could a girl belch like this?"
83374,324,21,143000,Henry VIII,ROYAL BEDCHAMBER,My beautiful boy! Why can't I have you?
83375,324,22,146000,Prince Bart,ROYAL BEDCHAMBER,I'unno. Too much jerkin' your merkin?
83376,324,23,149000,Henry VIII,ROYAL BEDCHAMBER,Why you little...!
83377,324,24,151000,Henry VIII,ROYAL BEDCHAMBER,Get out of my dreams and into my wife!
83378,324,25,154000,MARGARINE OF ARAGON,ROYAL BEDCHAMBER,I could have married the King of France. He wasn't so preoccupied with procreation. Ting-a-ling-a-ling. Know what I mean?
83381,324,27,162000,Henry VIII,Throne Room,"Oh, look at me -- I eat and eat and eat, and I never get any thinner!"
83382,324,28,167000,Young Woman,Throne Room,"Well, there's more of you to worship, oh sire."
83383,324,29,169000,Henry VIII,Throne Room,Who would dare to flatter a King?
83384,324,30,172000,Young Woman,Throne Room,"Anne Boleyn -- loyal subject, big fan."
83385,324,31,176000,Young Woman,Throne Room,"""Modern Wench"" Magazine dubbed me ""Anne of the Child-Bearing Hips."""
83386,324,32,176000,Henry VIII,Throne Room,Yes. Wide hips indeed... my son could cartwheel out!
83387,324,33,184000,Margarine,Throne Room,Yoink!
83388,324,34,185000,Henry VIII,Throne Room,Where are you taking me?
83389,324,35,186000,Margarine,Throne Room,Marriage counseling!
83392,324,38,191000,Margarine,MARRIAGE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,We came here to talk about our problems.
83393,324,39,193000,Henry VIII,MARRIAGE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"Fine. I want to marry Anne Boleyn, but I can't chop my wife's head off because her father is the King of Spain."
83394,324,40,201000,Marriage Counselor,MARRIAGE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,"Your Majesty, your feelings are valid, but I'm afraid marriage takes a lot of hard work."
83395,324,41,206000,Marriage Counselor,MARRIAGE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,And who needs that? I say trade in that lemon and get biz-zay.
83396,324,42,209000,Henry VIII,MARRIAGE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE,Woo hoo!
83398,324,44,210000,Thomas More,PALACE OFFICE,"Divorce? Sire, there's no such thing in the Cath-diddly-atholic Church. But it's the only church we've got, so what are you gonna do?"
83399,324,45,217000,Henry VIII,PALACE OFFICE,I'll start my own church.
83400,324,46,218000,Thomas More,PALACE OFFICE,Wha?
83401,324,47,219000,Henry VIII,PALACE OFFICE,"Yes, my own church. Where divorce will be so easy, more than half of marriages will end in it."
83402,324,48,225000,Thomas More,PALACE OFFICE,"Your Majesty, I work for the Pope. And I think a celibate Italian weirdo knows a lot more about marriage than you."
83403,324,49,230000,Henry VIII,PALACE OFFICE,"I understand. And because you stuck to your principles, I'm going to canonize you."
83405,324,51,239000,Thomas More,PALACE WALLS,I can see my house!
83407,324,53,241000,Margarine,Throne Room,"Sweetie, sometimes a daddy and a mommy decide to live apart. It's not your fault, it's just that you came out the wrong sex and ruined everything."
83408,324,54,251000,Henry VIII,Throne Room,So grow a penis or get lost.
83409,324,55,259000,Lisa Simpson,Throne Room,I can't.
83410,324,56,260000,Henry VIII,Throne Room,Bye-bye!
83412,324,57,262000,Lisa Simpson,Throne Room,Why can't your heir be female? Or-or why can't we elect our leaders?
83413,324,58,265000,Henry VIII,Throne Room,I wonder if I could canonize a child...?
83414,324,59,267000,Lisa Simpson,Throne Room,Leaving!
83416,324,61,269000,Henry VIII,PALACE,"Hey, I invented divorce -- how did you get half of everything?"
83417,324,62,273000,Barrister,PALACE,"You should have invented the pre-nup. And now, half of your kingdom, please."
83418,324,63,278000,Margarine,PALACE,I get Ireland?!
83421,324,66,281000,Minister,Cathedral,"And by the power vested in me by you just now, I pronounce you King and trophy Queen. In the name of the Henry, the Hank and the Holy Harry. Amen. Henry."
83422,324,67,296000,Henry VIII,Cathedral,"Okay, now let's put a son in the oven!"
83423,324,68,303000,Anne Boleyn,Cathedral,"Oh, Henry!"
83425,324,70,306000,Anne Boleyn,Tower of London,"Henry, sorry I bore you a daughter."
83426,324,71,309000,Henry VIII,Tower of London,"Stop, Anne, I'll love her as much as I love you."
83427,324,72,316000,Executioner,Tower of London,"Your head lives for five seconds afterwards, so I left a magazine in the basket."
83428,324,73,323000,Anne Boleyn,Tower of London,"Ooh! My horoscope! ""Today will bring welcome new changes into your life."" Wrong!"
83429,324,74,328000,Itchy,Tower of London,"Sir Scratchy, I accuse you of conducting a Catholic mass!"
83430,324,75,332000,Scratchy,Tower of London,"Lord Itchy, I accuse you of not signing the Act Of Succession!"
83433,324,78,340000,Henry VIII,Throne Room,"Oh, if only I had a son to enjoy this with."
83434,324,79,345000,Henry VIII,Throne Room,"Hey, baby. How'd you like to be Queen for a Day?"
83435,324,80,351000,Executioner,Throne Room,It's funny 'cause you're king.
83437,324,82,353000,Archbishop Lovejoy,Chapel,"Do you, Jane Seymour, take this King to be your lawfully wedded husband until your first little spat?"
83438,324,83,360000,Jane Seymour,Chapel,"Oh, I do! I double do! Henry's the ginchiest!"
83440,324,85,366000,Jane Seymour,Tower of London,The Lord is my shep--
83441,324,86,368000,Next Wife #2,Tower of London,I told you I was a dude!
83442,324,87,371000,Next Wife #3,Tower of London,You-didn't-dump-me-I-dumped-you!
83445,324,90,374000,Henry VIII,Throne Room,Why on earth did I marry you?
83446,324,91,377000,Anne of Cleves,Throne Room,My track record! I've had ten sons. Now take a ride on the king-maker!
83448,324,93,386000,Anne of Cleves,Tower of London,Swing and a miss!
83449,324,94,387000,Anne of Cleves,Tower of London,"oh, come on! I'm ninety-five! You could use a butter knife, for God's sake!"
83450,324,95,392000,Anne of Cleves,Tower of London,"Don't just stand there, bury me!"
83452,324,97,395000,Advisor Moe,Throne Room,"Sire, I know what you usually do to the bearer of bad news, but um... well, we're running out of pikes to stick your wives' heads onto."
83453,324,98,403000,Henry VIII,Throne Room,I'll show you running out of pikes!
83456,324,101,407000,Henry VIII,Storeroom,"Hey, what do you know? You were right."
83457,324,102,410000,Advisor Moe,Storeroom,That means a lot.
83459,324,104,411000,Henry VIII,ROYAL BEDCHAMBER,My whole life I was looking for that one woman whose execution could bring me happiness. Now I realize I was just beheading myself for divorcing you.
83460,324,105,424000,Margarine,ROYAL BEDCHAMBER,...And locking me in a dungeon.
83461,324,106,428000,Henry VIII,ROYAL BEDCHAMBER,"Listen to us, we still finish each other's sentences. Margarine, won't you take back an old head-chopping fool?"
83462,324,107,438000,Margarine,ROYAL BEDCHAMBER,"Of course, your Majesty. Let me just fluff your pillow for you."
83464,324,109,446000,Margarine,ROYAL BEDCHAMBER,"See ya in Hell, fat man!"
83466,324,111,449000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Library,"Finally, Henry's daughter Elizabeth became Queen. England's power was never greater, and British actresses always had a role to play when they got to a certain age."
83467,324,112,460000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Library,"That was awesome, Mrs. S. Check plus plus, here I come!"
83468,324,113,467000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Library,"Wow, the library really is a great resource! And I just came in here to trip nerds for nothin'."
83470,324,115,480000,Lisa Simpson,Library,"Mom, I can't find anything on Sacagawea. Just a couple books on Ron Santo."
83471,324,116,485000,Marge Simpson,Library,"No problem! In elementary school, we girls learned about Sacagawea while the boys were learning math!"
83472,324,117,492000,Lisa Simpson,Library,Okay.
83473,324,118,494000,Bum,Library,All right! Toilet paper.
83474,324,119,498000,Marge Simpson,Library,"In 1804, President Jefferson..."
83476,324,121,498000,Marge Simpson,Mississippi River,...sent Lewis and Clark and some embedded journalists to find the Northwest Passage.
83478,324,123,505000,Marge Simpson,GREAT PLAINS,They paddled up the Mississippi from St. Louis...
83479,324,124,510000,Marge Simpson,GREAT PLAINS,"When winter came, Lewis and Clark tried to set up camp, but encountered much hardship."
83481,324,126,518000,Marge Simpson,Mandan Village,"Come spring, they sought help from the Native Americans."
83482,324,127,522000,Chief Homer,Mandan Village,"Long have we awaited the coming of the White Man, and Carl."
83483,324,128,526000,Lenny Leonard,Mandan Village,"Thanks, and welcome to the United States of America."
83484,324,129,528000,Carl Carlson,Mandan Village,"Have a flag. And while you're at it, cover your nakedness and worship our lord."
83485,324,130,532000,Chief Homer,Mandan Village,"Yeah, yeah, I'll get right on it. Now in order to aid your journey across the land, I offer you the guidance of my daughter, Sacagawea. In our language, her name means ""Little Know-It-All Who Won't Shut Her Maize Hole."""
83486,324,131,541000,Sacagawea,Mandan Village,"I will be happy to help the Americans. Of course I will be sad to leave my husband, the French fur trader, Charbonneau."
83487,324,132,554000,Charbonneau,Mandan Village,"I will come with you. Because by myself, the darkness, she scares me."
83488,324,133,560000,Chief Homer,Mandan Village,I don't know why I ever sold you to him.
83490,324,135,564000,Sacagawea,Riverbank Campsite,"Okay, those berries are poison, those leaves are poison oak and your belt is a snake, also poisonous."
83491,324,136,570000,Otto Mann,Riverbank Campsite,"I'll tell you what's poisonous, your attitude."
83492,324,137,572000,Otto Mann,Riverbank Campsite,You know you... I'm dying. But at least people will always remember the expedition of Lewis and Clark and Tweedleburger.
83493,324,138,585000,Sacagawea,Riverbank Campsite,"Also, if you're confronted by a mountain lion, try to make yourself look as big as possible. And when you get a chance, bury your friend."
83494,324,139,590000,Lenny Leonard,Riverbank Campsite,"Hey, we're still mourning. Let's get a drink."
83495,324,140,596000,Moe Szyslak,Riverbank Campsite,"All right, customers! And they said you couldn't open a bar in Kansas."
83496,324,141,605000,Moe Szyslak,Riverbank Campsite,"Well, nothing can crush the frontier spirit."
83497,324,142,610000,Moe Szyslak,Riverbank Campsite,That'll do it.
83498,324,143,613000,Lenny Leonard,Riverbank Campsite,"At last, the Pacific Ocean."
83499,324,144,615000,Sacagawea,Riverbank Campsite,That's a mud puddle.
83500,324,145,616000,Lenny Leonard,Riverbank Campsite,Some of us find solutions instead of just pointing out problems.
83380,324,146,619000,Sacagawea,Riverbank Campsite,How did you two ever get to be explorers?
83411,324,147,621000,Lenny Leonard,Riverbank Campsite,We got the job because we own a compass.
83501,324,148,623000,Carl Carlson,Riverbank Campsite,It turns out the needle was just painted on.
83503,324,150,627000,Thomas Jefferson,White House,"It's been two years, so our brave explorers should be right about here."
83504,324,151,633000,Thomas Jefferson,White House,You morons!
83507,324,154,644000,Sacagawea,MOUNTAIN VALLEY,Wait! That's my brother!
83508,324,155,646000,Sacagawea,MOUNTAIN VALLEY,"Don't kill them, they're my friends!"
83509,324,156,649000,Bart Simpson,MOUNTAIN VALLEY,Oh c'mon. Can't we at least have one pity scalp?
83510,324,157,652000,Charbonneau,MOUNTAIN VALLEY,"Ah, my brother-in-law. I haven't seen you since I killed all your buffalo. Water under the bridge, eh? Eh?"
83511,324,158,660000,Sacagawea,MOUNTAIN VALLEY,Don't forget the eyebrows.
83513,324,160,664000,Carl Carlson,RIVERSIDE,"Wow, the Columbia River! Now we just ride this baby down to the Pacific, and get us some sweet mermaid sex."
83514,324,161,672000,Sacagawea,RIVERSIDE,"For the last time, those are salmon."
83515,324,162,676000,Lenny Leonard,RIVERSIDE,"How do you like that, Sacagawea has an opinion."
83516,324,163,678000,Carl Carlson,RIVERSIDE,"Big surprise. You know, you could be a little more grateful to us for civilizing you."
83517,324,164,685000,Sacagawea,RIVERSIDE,"I am the only reason you guys made it this far alive. From now on, you're on your own!"
83518,324,165,693000,Lenny Leonard,RIVERSIDE,"Aw, she'll be back. She forgot her husband."
83520,324,167,696000,Sacagawea,Woods,"Ingrates... after all I did for them... oh warm, wooly rock, you're my only friend."
83522,324,169,707000,Carl Carlson,Woods,We're big! We're big!
83523,324,170,709000,Lenny Leonard,Woods,Which you mountain lions find terrifying.
83524,324,171,714000,Sacagawea,Woods,They remembered what I taught them!
83525,324,172,716000,Carl Carlson,Woods,"Of course we did. We'll never forget you, Pocahontas."
83526,324,173,720000,Sacagawea,Woods,Sacagawea!
83527,324,174,722000,Carl Carlson,Woods,Gesundheit.
83528,324,175,723000,Sacagawea,Woods,Look! The Pacific Ocean!
83529,324,176,726000,Lenny Leonard,Woods,We made it! We discovered the magnificent Pacific Northwest.
83530,324,177,733000,Lenny Leonard,Woods,"I say we give this lovely land a name worthy of its beauty: Eugene, Oregon."
83531,324,178,739000,Lenny Leonard,Woods,And we owe it all to you! You're gonna get the greatest honor this country can bestow.
83533,324,180,745000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Library,"And today, Lewis' promise has been fulfilled."
83534,324,181,750000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Library,"What is that, a quarter?"
83535,324,182,752000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Library,A Chuck E. Cheese token?
83536,324,183,753000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Library,"No, it's a Sacagawea dollar. You can trade it in at the bank for a real dollar! Eh?"
83538,324,185,759000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Public Library,"Bart, what famous historical figure do you want to write about?"
83539,324,186,766000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Public Library,I'unno. The boogeyman?
83540,324,187,767000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Public Library,"C'mon, Bart -- we can make this fun. History's like an amusement park, except instead of rides, you have dates to memorize."
83541,324,188,775000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Public Library,"Mom, everyone who ever lived is boring."
83542,324,189,777000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Public Library,Boring? Is there anything boring about a bad-ass rocker who lived fast and died young?
83543,324,190,784000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Public Library,"I know there's a catch, but tell me more."
83544,324,191,786000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Public Library,"As a young prodigy, this popular musician wowed audiences across eighteenth-century Europe..."
83546,324,193,792000,Father,EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY AUSTRIAN PALACE,"And now, the star of our show, my son... Mozart! He makes Bach turn back... Haydn go into hidin'... and... well, those are the only ones there have been so far."
83547,324,194,806000,Mozart,EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY AUSTRIAN PALACE,Hello Vienna! Are there any aficionados in the house?
83549,324,196,812000,Otto Mann,EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY AUSTRIAN PALACE,"Sonata in A, K331, Third Movement!"

83554,324,201,849000,Salieri,EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY PALACE,"Papa, let me be the headliner. I always show up on time and I close the piano lid ever so softly."
83555,324,202,855000,Father,EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY PALACE,"Oh little Salieri, why don't you go play with the other three untalented members of our family... Tito, Randy and Jermaine."
83556,324,203,867000,Mother,EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY PALACE,"Sally, no one practices as hard as you -- but it's your brother who keeps us in lead-based face powder."
83560,324,207,887000,Salieri,MOZART HOME,Ew! A plague rat!
83562,324,209,892000,Salieri,MOZART HOME,Don't you have music to write?
83563,324,210,893000,Mozart,MOZART HOME,I'm doing it right now.
83564,324,211,895000,Mozart,MOZART HOME,"I call this my ""Symphony In Gee, My Sister Sucks."""
83566,324,213,901000,Salieri,MOZART HOME,"Oh Lord, why did you give such transcendent talent to such an undeserving fool?"
83567,324,214,907000,God,MOZART HOME,Because you are ug-ly!
83569,324,216,913000,Rainier Wolfcastle,CONCERT HALL,"What is it about music that enchants us? The notes. Our next award is sponsored by Heinrich's Bratwurst ""Papa can we have a Heinrich's Bratwurst?"" For outstanding composer age ten and under, the winner is..."
