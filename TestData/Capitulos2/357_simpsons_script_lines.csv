92402,357,1,99000,Football Announcer,Simpson Home,"We got a real nail-biter here at Mile-High Stadium, the Broncos down by one, and thirty seconds left on the clock."
92403,357,2,107000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,C'mon Broncos... you can do it...
92404,357,3,110000,Football Announcer,Simpson Home,"And I'm joined in the broadcast booth by the stars of ABC's latest reality show: ""Billionaire Versus Bear."""
92405,357,4,116000,Football Announcer,Simpson Home,"Let's review the easy-to-follow rules of your show. Each of you thought you were in a race to plant the Taco Bell flag at the North Pole. What you didn't know is the race was a chase: spiced up by the presence of... ""The Betrayer."""
92407,357,6,131000,Football Announcer,Simpson Home,"Well, now the bear has a surprise for you. He's not really a bear... he's a tiger!"
92408,357,7,137000,Football Announcer,Simpson Home,"Oh looky there, Denver just won the ballgame..."
92409,357,8,141000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"The Broncos won?! Why didn't I bet on them, like Professor Pigskin told me to?"
92410,357,9,147000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Who's Professor Pigskin?
92411,357,10,149000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,He's a pig who can predict football winners... in advance!
92412,357,11,153000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,How is that possible?
92413,357,12,154000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because he's got something no gambler's ever had: a system.
92414,357,13,159000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row, and every time, the ""pick of the week"" has been right on the money."
92415,357,14,163000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I get it. Every week they send out two pamphlets, half picking one team and half picking the other. Eventually, there's a small group of people who only receive the correct predictions -- and think Professor Pigskin is always right! That's when they ask for your money."
92416,357,15,178000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I have money!
92417,357,16,180000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, it's a scam!"
92418,357,17,182000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"A scam? Not according to ""Eddie F. from Tucson,"" or ""Football Millionaire in Beloit, Michigan."""
92419,357,18,188000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, all I'm saying is, you really should think twice before..."
92420,357,19,191000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,...expiration date oh-six oh-eight.
92421,357,20,196000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Professor Pigskin told me to bet on the Raiders but they look awful.
92422,357,21,200000,Football Announcer,Simpson Home,"And with thirty-seven starting players out with the flu, the Oakland Raiders have turned to drunks conscripted from local bars."
92423,357,22,209000,Oakland Player,Simpson Home,"Spare some change, football dude?"
92424,357,23,212000,Oakland Player,Simpson Home,You have a good day.
92425,357,24,214000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, how much money did you bet?"
92426,357,25,217000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I didn't bet any of our money. I just borrowed some from him."
92427,357,26,221000,Fat Tony,Simpson Home,Don't worry. We can hammer out a payment plan.
92429,357,28,226000,Homer Simpson,Fat Tony's Office,"It's not my fault the Raiders lost, it's Professor Pigskin's!"
92430,357,29,232000,Fat Tony,Fat Tony's Office,"If he mentions that pig again, use two hammers."
92431,357,30,235000,Homer Simpson,Fat Tony's Office,But the pig!
92433,357,32,237000,Fat Tony,Fat Tony's Office,"Now, I do have a way we could settle this debt. We would like to use your home to shoot an adult film."
92434,357,33,243000,Johnny Tightlips,Fat Tony's Office,"Yeah. It's called ""Lemony Lick-It: A Series Of Horny Events""."
92435,357,34,243000,Homer Simpson,Fat Tony's Office,"Marge would kill me! Please, there's gotta be something else I can do. Like mow your lawn every week for two weeks. I can't do it next week."
92436,357,35,256000,Homer Simpson,Fat Tony's Office,"All right, you can shoot your gay adult film at my house."
92437,357,36,260000,Fat Tony,Fat Tony's Office,I didn't say anything about gay.
92439,357,38,265000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,They're shooting an adult film at my house tomorrow. How am I gonna get rid of Marge and the kids?
92440,357,39,271000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I got these free tickets to Santa's Village. I know a guy who turns the dead sleigh-horses into jerky and sells it to bars..."
92441,357,40,281000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Thanks, Moe!"
92443,357,42,283000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Why would we want to go to Santa's Village? It's August.
92444,357,43,287000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I want to see Santa. He can explain why he gave me a PlayStation box with nothing inside but a coloring book.
92445,357,44,292000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It got your hopes up, didn't it?"
92446,357,45,293000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, before I take the kids, I want you to swear you're not up to something."
92447,357,46,299000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I swear.
92448,357,47,299000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And I'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast.
92449,357,48,305000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Because you look even more beautiful now than the day I married you.
92452,357,51,316000,Elf,Santa's Village,"Welcome to Santa's Village, where it's Christmas every day. Closed on Christmas."
92453,357,52,321000,Lisa Simpson,Santa's Village,Those reindeer look really uncomfortable.
92454,357,53,324000,Elf,Santa's Village,That's because they don't thrive in this environment.
92455,357,54,328000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Village,"Whatcha readin', Santa?"
92456,357,55,329000,Santa Claus,Santa's Village,"Tom Clancy's ""Op Center."""
92457,357,56,331000,Bart Simpson,Santa's Village,You don't seem very jolly.
92458,357,57,333000,Santa Claus,Santa's Village,Santa got some bad medical news.

92465,357,64,356000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Guys, get out of here!"
92466,357,65,358000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,"Homer, how'd you ever get Marge to go along with this?"
92467,357,66,361000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, if you promise never to tell her, I'll let you be in the movie."
92468,357,67,364000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"We just came over to borrow a board game, but okay."
92469,357,68,367000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Home,I've always dreamed of workin' in an adult film! I'll run the sound board!
92470,357,69,370000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,And I'll perform in the sex scenes!

92478,357,77,397000,Lisa Simpson,Marge's Car,"Mom, I got a rash where the reindeer licked me."
92479,357,78,402000,Bart Simpson,Marge's Car,"When they put Santa in the ambulance, why did they pull the blanket all the way up over his head?"
92480,357,79,407000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,"Look, I know this wasn't the greatest outing, but your father meant well, so don't let him know that we didn't ."
92482,357,81,415000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you guys almost done?
92483,357,82,417000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Home,"Listen, uh, I've got a tattoo of Foghorn Leghorn on my right thigh. Are we gonna get into any trademark or copyright issues here? 'Cause we can put a Band-aid on it and say my character just got stabbed."

92486,357,85,435000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Is this a snuggle film?!
92487,357,86,439000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Um... you're in the wrong house, lady."
92488,357,87,441000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"How could you allow this, in the room where we... do puzzles?!"
92489,357,88,448000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, please, just listen to what I have to say."
92490,357,89,451000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,All right.
92491,357,90,452000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I owed the mafia money...
92493,357,92,455000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Where are you going?
92494,357,93,456000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Away from you.
92495,357,94,457000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,When will you be back?
92496,357,95,457000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know.
92497,357,96,459000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Who's gonna watch the kids?
92498,357,97,459000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You are.

92501,357,100,470000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, come back! You didn't say bye to the kids!"
92502,357,101,474000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bye Bart! I love you, Lisa! Sleep tight, Maggie! Today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge!"
92503,357,102,485000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, we'd better go eat that yogurt."
92504,357,103,492000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, I'm sure your mother will be back soon."
92505,357,104,493000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,She should be back now. It's dinner time.
92506,357,105,496000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, we've been down this road before. I do something stupid, your Mom leaves, we eat waffles."
92507,357,106,501000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,We're out of waffles.
92509,357,107,503000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,All we've got is ketchup.
92510,357,108,504000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You mean ""Homer's famous marinara sauce."""

92514,357,112,516000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Let it ring. Play hard to get. That's hard enough!
92515,357,113,519000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh-my-darling-I-love-you-please- forgive-me.
92516,357,114,521000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Hey, Homer."
92517,357,115,522000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Moe! What are you calling me for?
92518,357,116,523000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,You told me to call. You wanted to see if your phone was workin'.
92519,357,117,526000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, what if Marge tries to call while I'm talking to you?"
92520,357,118,529000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Well ain't you got call waitin'?
92521,357,119,530000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of course I have call waiting, you idiot! I just never learned how to use it!"
92522,357,120,535000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-oh. That might have broken the phone. I'd better call Moe.
92523,357,121,540000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Hey, Homer."
92524,357,122,541000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Moe! Will you get off the line!
92526,357,124,555000,Marge Simpson,HIGHWAY REST STOP,I guess I'd better tell them I'm coming home.
92528,357,126,563000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Marge. What a pleasant surprise."
92529,357,127,566000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm at a rest stop south of Springfield. I know, you're sorry now. Then you'll buy me some Kwik-E-Mart flowers, maybe a box of candy where half the pieces mysteriously have ""testing bites,"" and a week later you'll be back to your old thoughtless self."
92531,357,129,582000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"No, no. It's not gonna be like that, I swear."
92532,357,130,586000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Ew, lemon cream! You're goin' in the Marge pile. I mean I love you so much..."
92534,357,132,592000,Marge Simpson,PAY PHONE,I love you too...
92535,357,133,595000,Marge Simpson,PAY PHONE,"Hold on, I'll be off in a minute."
92537,357,135,598000,Marge Simpson,PAY PHONE,"Listen, buster. I had to buy a club soda I didn't want to get change for this phone!"
92538,357,136,598000,Marge Simpson,PAY PHONE,An oogli-boogli!
92540,357,138,608000,Man,PAY PHONE,Be still! Don't give it the phone!
92541,357,139,611000,Man,PAY PHONE,"Settle down, sugarplum. Look what daddy's got in his pocket. Yummy, yummy kelp."
92542,357,140,619000,Man,PAY PHONE,"Good girl. Yes, yes. This animal means you no harm. She's a sweet old Florida manatee. Also known as a sea cow or a dugong."
92543,357,141,630000,Homer Simpson,PAY PHONE,Hello? Marge? Where do we keep the socks that don't smell like feet?
92544,357,142,633000,Marge Simpson,PAY PHONE,I'll call you back!
92545,357,143,637000,Man,PAY PHONE,I'm Doctor Caleb Thorn. And I would do anything to protect a manatee... except harm another manatee.
92546,357,144,643000,Marge Simpson,PAY PHONE,"Well what if by harming a manatee you could save two manatees? But before you answer, consider this: the manatee you'd have to harm is pregnant."
92547,357,145,653000,Caleb Thorn,PAY PHONE,Those are the questions that keep me up at night.
92549,357,147,661000,Caleb Thorn,PAY PHONE,I see a manatee that needs a hug.
92551,357,149,669000,Homer Simpson,PAY PHONE,"Hello, Marge?"
92552,357,150,669000,Homer Simpson,PAY PHONE,"Does the pizza guy take a check? If so, where do we keep the checks? And lastly, how do you write a check?"
92554,357,152,678000,Marge Simpson,ROADSIDE CAFE,I think the worst part was when I realized that Homer lied to me.
92555,357,153,683000,Caleb Thorn,ROADSIDE CAFE,"From what you've told me, it sounds like what your husband did was nothing new."
92556,357,154,686000,Marge Simpson,ROADSIDE CAFE,Exactly!
92557,357,155,688000,Caleb Thorn,ROADSIDE CAFE,"I have a saying which goes ""you can't teach a manatee any tricks."""
92558,357,156,688000,Marge Simpson,ROADSIDE CAFE,Maybe you could just put a hat on him and say it's a trick.
92559,357,157,694000,Caleb Thorn,ROADSIDE CAFE,"My point is, Homer is the exact same man you married, and if there's a problem here, it's that you keep expecting him to change."
92560,357,158,701000,Marge Simpson,ROADSIDE CAFE,Huh.
148663,357,159,702000,Marge's Thoughts,ROADSIDE CAFE,He cares so much about those doggone dugongs. I wish I felt that kind of passion. Maybe I should join him on his mission...
92561,357,160,710000,Waitress,ROADSIDE CAFE,"Hey Lady Blue, while you're sittin' there staring at the ceiling, your boyfriend's in the parking lot with his hands in a walrus."
92562,357,161,720000,Waitress,ROADSIDE CAFE,"Yeah, that'll be good for business."
92564,357,163,724000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Gotta find your Mom. Gotta find your Mom.
92565,357,164,726000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Dad, I promise I'll be good."
92566,357,165,728000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,Can I get out of the dog carrier?
92568,357,166,729000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,It was hard enough gettin' you in there. I'm not lettin' you out.
92570,357,168,732000,Waitress,ROADSIDE CAFE,"Yeah, she came through here. I believe she was looking to rekindle her passion for life. Ain't that right, Victor?"
92571,357,169,739000,Victor,ROADSIDE CAFE,"Oh yes, señora left for the coast with a rugged, yet sensitive man of science."
92572,357,170,743000,Homer Simpson,ROADSIDE CAFE,Rugged? Is that the same as handsome?
92573,357,171,745000,Victor,ROADSIDE CAFE,"Oh, no, no. Handsome means he look at himself in the mirror all day. Rugged means you look at him."
92576,357,174,759000,Marge Simpson,SOUTHERN COAST,"Okay, water monsters. Be friendly. But not too friendly."
92577,357,175,767000,Marge Simpson,SOUTHERN COAST,What do I do?
92578,357,176,768000,Caleb Thorn,SOUTHERN COAST,Talk to it. Let it know you're not a threat!
92579,357,177,771000,Marge Simpson,SOUTHERN COAST,"Okay. Uh... you know, up close you're kinda cute."
92580,357,178,778000,Marge Simpson,SOUTHERN COAST,"Aw, you're a good thing. I know it. Let me clean out your ears."
92582,357,180,787000,Marge Simpson,SOUTHERN COAST,I've bonded with him!
92583,357,181,791000,Marge Simpson,SOUTHERN COAST,Where is he taking me?
92584,357,182,796000,Caleb Thorn,SOUTHERN COAST,"To his underwater palace! Just kidding, it's a lagoon full of bugs!"
92588,357,186,809000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Dad, I don't think we're gonna find Mom today. And I'm sick of eating at restaurant chains I've never even heard of, like Skobo's and Dim Willie's."
92589,357,187,818000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,Ew.
92590,357,188,818000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Okay, kids, we'll stop for the day. I have cousins near here. We'll stay with them."
92591,357,189,823000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,Country cousins? Are they rubes? 'Cause I don't cotton to rubes.
92592,357,190,826000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Oh, the rubiest. Ooh look! A new restaurant chain!"
92593,357,191,830000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,Can we say it's my birthday and get free stuff?
92594,357,192,833000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,We'll say it's all our birthdays!
92597,357,195,841000,Uncle John,Farmhouse,"Cousin Homer! How are you? And this must be Bart and Lisa. Well aren't you nice-looking kids. Hey, do you folks want to see a quilt that's been in our family for five generations?"
92599,357,196,852000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,"I warned you he was an idiot. Well, all I need is some moonshine and someone playin' the har-mon-a-key, and I'm as happy as a pig in plop!"
92600,357,197,862000,Uncle John,Farmhouse,We're having lasagna and Caesar salad.
92601,357,198,865000,Homer Simpson,Farmhouse,Don't laugh! They're doing the best they can.
92603,357,200,870000,Uncle John,Farm,"So, Homer, how are you?"
92604,357,201,872000,Homer Simpson,Farm,"Oh, just great. Things couldn't be better."
92605,357,202,875000,Aunt Kathy,Farm,And how is our lovely Marge?
92606,357,203,878000,Homer Simpson,Farm,"She, uh, was killed by a falling air conditioner."
92607,357,204,883000,Aunt Kathy,Farm,"Oh, why that's terrible!"
92608,357,205,885000,Homer Simpson,Farm,"It wasn't all bad. As part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned."
92609,357,206,892000,Homer Simpson,Farm,"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to use the outhouse again."
92610,357,207,895000,Aunt Kathy,Farm,We don't have an outhouse!
92611,357,208,898000,Uncle John,Farm,My recording studio!
92612,357,209,902000,Bart Simpson,Farm,"So, how are we related again?"
92613,357,210,904000,Randy,Farm,Our dogs are brothers.
92614,357,211,906000,Bart Simpson,Farm,Oh yeah...
92615,357,212,909000,Lisa Simpson,Farm,I see Mom!
92616,357,213,912000,Marge Simpson,Farm,I've got my groove back!
92617,357,214,914000,Lisa Simpson,Farm,We've gotta tell Dad! Where is he?
92619,357,216,921000,Homer Simpson,Chicken Coop,You lost that first game to hustle me!
92622,357,219,929000,Marge Simpson,Beach,I can't believe how many manatees we saved today.
92623,357,220,932000,Caleb Thorn,Beach,"And the ones we can't save, we put to good use."
92625,357,222,943000,Caleb Thorn,Beach,"What am I supposed to do, bury them at Arlington?"
92626,357,223,946000,Homer Simpson,Beach,Marge?
92627,357,224,948000,Marge Simpson,Beach,Homer?
92628,357,225,949000,Homer Simpson,Beach,These are for you.
92629,357,226,950000,Marge Simpson,Beach,Ooo.
92630,357,227,951000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"Listen, I thought about what I did. And it was really, really wrong. I'm sorry."
92631,357,228,957000,Marge Simpson,Beach,"Homie, I accept your apology."
92632,357,229,961000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"I love you, Marge."
92633,357,230,963000,Marge Simpson,Beach,But I'm not coming back yet.
92634,357,231,964000,Homer Simpson,Beach,Wha...?!
92635,357,232,965000,Marge Simpson,Beach,I've found a place where I'm needed.
92636,357,233,967000,Homer Simpson,Beach,You're needed at home!
92567,357,234,969000,Marge Simpson,Beach,And treated like I deserve.
92637,357,235,972000,Homer Simpson,Beach,You're needed at home!
92638,357,236,973000,Marge Simpson,Beach,"I'm sorry, Homie. I just can't find it in my heart to come back right now."
92639,357,237,978000,Homer Simpson,Beach,"Well, that's very reasonable."
92640,357,238,980000,Homer Simpson,Beach,You stole my wife! I'll kill you!
92641,357,239,982000,Caleb Thorn,Beach,"Homer, I have no interest in stealing your wife, but Marge is getting something from her work with me."
92642,357,240,988000,Caleb Thorn,Beach,"Something a strong, passionate woman like her needs: a purpose."
92643,357,241,992000,Homer Simpson,Beach,Wow. I can see why she loves you.
92644,357,242,996000,Caleb Thorn,Beach,She doesn't love me. She's just trying to find herself.
92645,357,243,998000,Homer Simpson,Beach,You know everything.
92646,357,244,1000000,Caleb Thorn,Beach,I don't know everything. I'm just a man.
92647,357,245,1002000,Homer Simpson,Beach,And what a man!
92649,357,247,1008000,Homer Simpson,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,"Okay, the key to this thing is the manatees. Is Marge saving them or killing them?"
92650,357,248,1012000,Lisa Simpson,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,Saving!
92651,357,249,1013000,Homer Simpson,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,"Okay. To save the manatees, I guess I could donate my time and money and help them build a... eh, screw that."
92652,357,250,1020000,Bart Simpson,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,Dad! Those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees!
92653,357,251,1026000,Jet Skier #1,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,"Check out those gentle, exotic sea creatures."
92654,357,252,1028000,Jet Skier #2,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,Let's whomp 'em!
92656,357,254,1036000,Jet Skier #2,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,"Aw man, I just wish we could see their tears."
92657,357,255,1041000,Homer Simpson,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
92658,357,256,1043000,Jet Skier #1,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,They are roughly our size.
92659,357,257,1045000,Jet Skier #2,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,"In fact, they're bigger than us."
92660,357,258,1046000,Homer Simpson,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,"Look, if it were up to me, I'd be harassing them with you. If anything, I'd be the guy who took it too far. But I love my wife and I want to win her back!"
92661,357,259,1054000,Jet Skier #2,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,You're a brave man. And we respect two things: bravery and tattoos that look like barbed wire. Let's go.
92662,357,260,1066000,Homer Simpson,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,Rubes.
92663,357,261,1068000,Jet Skier #1,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,What did you call us?
92664,357,262,1070000,Homer Simpson,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,Catch me if you can!
92665,357,263,1083000,Homer Simpson,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,Manatees -- defend!
92666,357,264,1102000,Uncle John,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,Attention jet skiers. I have a court order here requiring you to vacate these waters!
92667,357,265,1108000,Jet Skier #2,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,"No court order's gonna tell me what to do! Oh man, it's notarized!"
92668,357,266,1113000,Jet Skier #1,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,Let's boogie!
92669,357,267,1117000,Uncle John,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,"Homer, are you okay? How many fingers am I holding up?"
92670,357,268,1120000,Homer Simpson,SOUTHERN COASTAL TOWN,Poor dumb country mouse. Can't even count.
92673,357,271,1127000,Marge Simpson,Dock,"Oh, my sweet, sweet Homie! You sacrificed yourself for the manatees."
92674,357,272,1133000,Homer Simpson,Dock,"Rubes... so many rubes... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes! Please, no rubes..."
92676,357,274,1149000,Marge Simpson,Dock,"I'm gonna take you home and fix you up, 'cause you're the real endangered species... a devoted husband."
92677,357,275,1160000,Homer Simpson,Dock,"Marge, I'm always amazed you chose me."
92678,357,276,1164000,Marge Simpson,Dock,And I always will.
92679,357,277,1166000,Homer Simpson,Dock,Woo hoo!
92680,357,278,1171000,Caleb Thorn,Dock,I'm starting to think I should find a woman.
92682,357,280,1176000,Caleb Thorn,Dock,"Miranda was nice, but I'm not driving to Corpus Christi every time she needs a light bulb changed!"
92684,357,282,1180000,Caleb Thorn,Dock,Amen.
92685,357,283,1181000,Homer Simpson,Dock,"Hey, since we've got the kids with us, why don't we all take a few days of much-needed R and R?"
92686,357,284,1187000,Marge Simpson,Dock,Don't you have to be back at work?
92687,357,285,1189000,Homer Simpson,Dock,Yes... but I've got a friend who owes me a solid.
92690,357,288,1196000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Smithers, who is this barrel-chested go-getter?"
92691,357,289,1201000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I believe it's a manatee posing as Homer Simpson, sir."
92693,357,291,1205000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Aw, that's cute. I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
92694,357,292,1209000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Actually, sir, I believe he's about to die of dehydration."
92695,357,293,1212000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Good Heavens! Grab a sponge, man!"
