96229,371,17,122000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's Bedroom,What?! Next you'll be telling me he didn't meet Woody Woodpecker!
96230,371,18,126000,Lenny Leonard,Lenny's Bedroom,I dated the woman in that suit for three months. Then she left me for the guy who cleans the vomit off the roller coasters.
96231,371,19,132000,Moe Szyslak,Lenny's Bedroom,"Hey Lenny, I see you cut the celery at an angle, here! Makes my straight-cut celery look like crap."

96233,371,21,144000,Lenny Leonard,Lenny's Bedroom,"I know you're all wondering why you're here. The fact is, I'm dying."

96242,371,30,167000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's Bedroom,"Lenny, this TV is amazing. If you're not careful, I might just spend the rest of my life on your couch."
96243,371,31,175000,Lenny Leonard,Lenny's Bedroom,"You don't mean that literally, of course."
96244,371,32,177000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's Bedroom,"You're right, Lenny. I..."

96249,371,37,217000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's Apartment,"Ooo, ""Two and a Half Men!"" You can see the soulless emptiness in Charlie Sheen's eyes."
96250,371,38,225000,Lisa Simpson,Lenny's Apartment,"Dad? Please come home, we miss you. Is that a high-def TV?!"
96251,371,39,230000,Bart Simpson,Lenny's Apartment,Mom didn't say anything about high-def!
96252,371,40,235000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's Apartment,"Later, if I have enough energy, we can walk up to the TV and I'll show you how thin it is."
96253,371,41,240000,Lisa Simpson,Lenny's Apartment,"Wow, there's a rainbow outside."
96254,371,42,243000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's Apartment,"Oh yeah, well right there's a commercial with a dancing cold sore."

96262,371,50,281000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's Apartment,"Oh yeah, good times."
96264,371,52,285000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Stupid non-plasma TV. Picture so blurry. Might as well rub dirt in my eyes.
96265,371,53,291000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I've been thinking. We have been using this TV for a long time. So I entered a contest where the first prize is a plasma screen TV."

96275,371,63,342000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All expenses paid?
96276,371,64,344000,SMOOTH-VOICED MAN,Simpson Home,"Uh, look, I gotta go."
96279,371,67,355000,Tour Guide,FOX LOT,"Here's where we make ""The Best Damn Sports Show, Period."" And there's where we make ""The Worst Damn Comedy Show, Period."""
96280,371,68,358000,Studio Audience,FOX LOT,Booo!
96281,371,69,358000,Tour Guide,FOX LOT,"Ooh, why look, there's Dan Castellaneta from the Tracey Ullman show."
96282,371,70,369000,Homer Simpson,FOX LOT,"Hey, funny man, say something funny!"
96283,371,71,372000,Dan Castellaneta,FOX LOT,"Please don't lean out of the tram, sir, you might get hurt."
96284,371,72,375000,Homer Simpson,FOX LOT,Don't lean out of the tra--
96287,371,75,380000,Tour Guide,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"Here's where we develop our many reality shows. There's ""Dwarf or Midget: America decides,"" and ""Million Dollar Fart-off""..."
96226,371,76,389000,Lisa Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"""Mother-Flippers?"" What's this show about?"
96288,371,77,391000,Producer,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"Uh, this is a reality program, dear, where we take wives from two very different families and they trade places for a month."
96289,371,78,398000,Lisa Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,I already saw that exact same show on another network.
96290,371,79,401000,Producer,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"Here, sweetie. Have a Fox sweatshirt."
96291,371,80,405000,Lisa Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,This is an ABC sweatshirt.
96292,371,81,407000,Producer,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"Yes, and it zips all the way up."
96295,371,84,418000,Contestant #3,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,'CAUSE I'M SAVIN' ALL MY LOVE FOR YOU...

96299,371,88,423000,Producer,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"Oh, about enough to buy a new plasma TV."
96300,371,89,427000,Homer Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,That's just the product I've been coveting! Pick us! Pick us!
96301,371,90,429000,Female Producer,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,Not so fast. Are you sure you want your most intimate moments broadcast across the country?
96302,371,91,435000,Homer Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,Are you kidding? Take a look at my DVD.
96303,371,92,438000,Homer Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,They'll never let me near Lake Havasu again.
96304,371,93,441000,Marge Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"What are you doing, Homer?"
96305,371,94,443000,Homer Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,I'm signing us up for a reality show where we trade you to another family.
96306,371,95,447000,Marge Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"Well, that might be interesting... or it could damage many, many lives."
96307,371,96,452000,Homer Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"Oh Marge, you're the greatest mom ever. I want the whole world to see that."
96308,371,97,457000,Marge Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"That's very sweet, but I..."
96309,371,98,459000,Producer,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"Look, I've done a lot of these. Everyone has fun, no one gets hurt, and you make a lot of money you could really use."
96310,371,99,464000,Female Producer,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"And if you say yes now, it'll make a great act break."
96311,371,100,469000,Marge Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,I'll do it!
96312,371,101,470000,Producer,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"Perfect. But could you say it again with more emphasis on the ""I'll""?"
96313,371,102,474000,Marge Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,I'll do it.
96314,371,103,475000,Producer,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"No, no, go back to the first way."
96315,371,104,477000,Marge Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"I'll do it! Wait, I wasn't happy with that."
96316,371,105,480000,Producer,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,You know what? Just do it the way it feels comfortable to you.
96317,371,106,482000,Marge Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.
96318,371,107,492000,Marge Simpson,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,How was that?
96319,371,108,493000,Producer,FOX NETWORK BUILDING,"Uh, we'll get it later."
96321,371,110,498000,Producer,Simpson Home,These are the Heathbars.
96322,371,111,499000,Producer,Simpson Home,"Verity, who will be your new mom, is the youngest-ever full professor at Yale."
96323,371,112,503000,Verity,Simpson Home,I got my tenure at twenty-eight.
96324,371,113,506000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh really? Bart, when did you get your tenure?"
96325,371,114,510000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I got my tenure right here.
96326,371,115,512000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, well I have full tenure."
96327,371,116,518000,Producer,Simpson Home,We'd better pixelate those.
96328,371,117,519000,Panicky Cameraman,Simpson Home,There aren't enough pixels in the world!
96329,371,118,521000,Producer,Simpson Home,"Yeah, uh, just cover it with Ryan Seacrest's head. This is Charles."
96330,371,119,526000,Charles Heathbar,Simpson Home,You can call me Charlie. But do not call me late when there are scones about. Little British humor.
96331,371,120,535000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'll bet the twist is he's gay.
96332,371,121,537000,Producer,Simpson Home,Your two families will exchange wives for a month. Then a viewer vote will decide who they think is the least reprehensible.
96333,371,122,544000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I don't understand, Dad. Our family has so many flaws. Why must we share them with the world?"
96334,371,123,550000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Because we'll be on TV, and earn enough money to buy a TV. TV."
96335,371,124,557000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But Dad...
96336,371,125,558000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, TV-sa?"
96337,371,126,559000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Forget it.
96338,371,127,562000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Listen up, Stonehenge. I made a drawing of the places on Marge you can't touch. Especially the hair."
96339,371,128,569000,Charles Heathbar,Simpson Home,"Oh, you needn't worry. I'm a bit of an elbow man, myself, actually. A bit different, a bit weird. Not sexual."
96340,371,129,576000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You take forever to say nothing.
96341,371,130,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ya know, you don't seem like the money-hungry semi-stripper who's usually on Fox. Why'd you do it?"
96342,371,131,586000,Verity,Simpson Home,"Well, I thought there was no further way I could humiliate my husband. And then this opportunity came along."
96343,371,132,592000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I see. Well, I should be getting to the living room..."
96344,371,133,597000,Verity,Simpson Home,"You know, I despise my husband."
96345,371,134,599000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, he didn't get the prize pig at the fair, either."
96346,371,135,602000,Verity,Simpson Home,Charles hasn't satisfied me in years.
96347,371,136,605000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, that's how I feel about Notre Dame football."
96348,371,137,607000,Verity,Simpson Home,"Cruel, dusty years!"
96349,371,138,610000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know why I ever married that woman.
96352,371,141,617000,Marge Simpson,Home,"So, Charles, what do you do for a living?"
96353,371,142,620000,Charles Heathbar,Home,"Well, I'm an office manager, and no, I didn't even get a promotion today, again. So go on, go ahead. Disembowel me with your pointy, pointy words."
96354,371,143,629000,Marge Simpson,Home,Really? You manage a whole office?
96355,371,144,634000,Charles Heathbar,Home,"Yes. Yes, yes I do, actually."
96356,371,145,638000,Marge Simpson,Home,"Well, that's very impressive. Does that include the people and the furniture?"
96357,371,146,643000,Charles Heathbar,Home,"Yeah, and I decide where the Christmas party's held. Actually, it's decided by committee. But, you know, I choose the committee. Hello."
96358,371,147,653000,Charles Heathbar,Home,"I don't, I don't choose the committee as such. Um, but ya know, I choose where they meet. This year I am thinking of conference room ""C""."
96359,371,148,659000,Marge Simpson,Home,"That leaves ""A"" and ""B"" available for overflow. Well done!"
96361,371,150,675000,Verity,Simpson Home,"Bart, I told you: no television till you do the dishes. And I do not call that doing the dishes."
96362,371,151,685000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, my Mom says why bother punishing me, I never learn."
96363,371,152,695000,Verity,Simpson Home,"Disgusting. Young man, I'm going to turn that cartoon into homework."
96364,371,153,701000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Help me, cameraman! I let you smoke a cigarette in my bedroom."
96365,371,154,704000,Fox Cameraman,Simpson Home,That was a joint. And I have a name: it's Doug.
96367,371,156,706000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Then Itchy used an ice cream scoop to scoop out Scratchy's heart and make it a sundae. The End.
96368,371,157,711000,Verity,Simpson Living Room,"Now Homer, would you care to give your report on ""C.S.I. Miami?"""
96369,371,158,717000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Uh, okay."
96370,371,159,721000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"There's this guy that got killed -- I think it was in Miami? So C.S.I. Miami investiga-ted-ed it. Then a family said how much they loved the Olive Garden. Then I fell asleep. When I woke up, Letterman was talking to Alias."
96373,371,162,731000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,That's wonderful!
96374,371,163,742000,Ben,LIVING ROOM,"Indeed. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a Mandarin Chinese lesson. Xie xie. Zai jian."
96375,371,164,750000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,He's a very impressive boy.
96376,371,165,752000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. A tree that's been alone for far too long.
96377,371,166,757000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,I don't get it. Are you saying you're the tree?
96378,371,167,760000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,"Maybe... are my roots showing? Wordplay, brilliant. Would you like to hear a joke?"
96379,371,168,766000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"As long as it's not a knock-knock joke. I always ruin them by saying ""come in."""
96380,371,169,768000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,"No, no. This joke is actually quite funny. You see, this man, he finds a magic lamp, and a genie comes out."
96381,371,170,778000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,That's funny.
96382,371,171,779000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,That's just the setup.
96383,371,172,780000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Well, you've set me up, for laughs down the road."
96384,371,173,783000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,"So the genie says, ""I'll give you three wishes, but whatever you get -- your wife gets double."" Okay, remember that."
96385,371,174,790000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Oh, how nice for her!"
96386,371,175,792000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,"Now here's the humor. The man says, ""I want a new car."" The genie says, ""Your wife gets two."" Okay, you remember the double? The man says, ""I want a new house."" So the genie says, ""Your wife gets two."""
96387,371,176,807000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,"So the man says, ""Beat me half to death."""
96388,371,177,809000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,"It's funny, don't you get it? Cuz she gets double so if he gets beaten half to death, the wife would be beaten to death."
96389,371,178,821000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,That sounds horrible.
96390,371,179,821000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,"I agree, terrible. Offensive towards women. Little amusing, don't you think?"
96391,371,180,827000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,No!
96392,371,181,828000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,"Me either. Spousal abuse. It's uh, it's a real problem. It's not funny. It's tragic, if anything so..."
96393,371,182,832000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Well, I liked the genie part. That was fun."
96394,371,183,835000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,You think so?
96395,371,184,835000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Yes, I could really picture him. With curly shoes. And smoke all over the place. You're a born storyteller."
96396,371,185,843000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,"Well, yeah, suppose I am. Yeah... yeah, not a murderer."
96397,371,186,847000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,No.
96398,371,187,849000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,Would you like to hear another joke?
96399,371,188,851000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,I sure would! Let me just get us some iced tea.
96400,371,189,856000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,One more kind word from her and I am completely smitten.
96401,371,190,860000,Marge Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Ooh, your toaster takes bagels. How ritzy!"
96402,371,191,864000,Charles Heathbar,LIVING ROOM,And there we have it.
96404,371,193,872000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What's that delicious smell?
96405,371,194,874000,Verity,Simpson Home,I'm burning all your underwear.
96408,371,197,881000,Marge Simpson,SUBURBAN CONNECTICUT HOME,What's with the kimono? Are we having LaChoy?
96409,371,198,884000,Charles Heathbar,SUBURBAN CONNECTICUT HOME,"No, Marge. I was just sitting around, drinking vermouth and contemplating how just when you're drowning in a pit of despair, life can throw you a beautiful blue life preserver."
96410,371,199,895000,Marge Simpson,SUBURBAN CONNECTICUT HOME,I thought life preservers only came in orange. Because wouldn't it be hard to see blue in the ocean?
96411,371,200,902000,Charles Heathbar,SUBURBAN CONNECTICUT HOME,"Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa. No logic. Not tonight."
96412,371,201,905000,Marge Simpson,SUBURBAN CONNECTICUT HOME,Where's Ben?
96413,371,202,906000,Charles Heathbar,SUBURBAN CONNECTICUT HOME,The housekeeper took him out for a walk.
96415,371,204,910000,Ben,Dank Irish Pub,How long do we have to stay here?
96416,371,205,913000,Irish Housekeeper,Dank Irish Pub,Till I'm sick of drinkin' these. And I'm never sick of drinkin' these.
96417,371,206,925000,Irish Housekeeper,Dank Irish Pub,"That's right, it just gets worse."
96419,371,208,928000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"So, you see, we have the whole house to ourselves. Oh, who left this here?"
96420,371,209,935000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"Did I tell you I'm a bit of a songwriter? Words and music, hold the applause. I wrote this song for a woman. You."
96421,371,210,942000,Marge Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,What an odd thing for a man who's not interested in me to do.
96422,371,211,946000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,Yes. Not interested. Let me just breathe your scent for a moment before I play.
96423,371,212,961000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,LADY WHEN YOU CAME TO ME / I WAS FEELING BLUE
96424,371,213,967000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,BLUE JUST LIKE YOUR HAIR YOU SEE / BLUE JUST LIKE THE MOON
96425,371,214,973000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"BUT ONLY WHEN THE MOON IS BLUE / AND NOT WHEN IT IS CREAM / AND NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE WITH ME / I AM IN A DREAM. Oh yeah, Marge. Your dreams can come true."
96427,371,215,989000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,LADY WHEN YOU GO AWAY / I FEEL LIKE I COULD DIE / NOT LIKE DYE LIKE YOUR HAIR IS DYED / BUT DIE LIKE LADY DI / NOT LIKE DI LIKE HER NAME IS DI / BUT DIE LIKE WHEN SHE DIED
96428,371,216,1010000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"BUT LADY, JUST LIKE LADY DI / BE MY PRINCESS TONIGHT.... / BUT DON'T DIE... DON'T DIE..."
96429,371,217,1020000,Marge Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,That song was very nice. How'd you think up so many rhyming words?
96430,371,218,1024000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"Marge, I love you. And I can tell from your basic level of courtesy that you love me too."
96431,371,219,1029000,Marge Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"What? No! Listen, Charles, I don't want to hurt your feelings..."
96432,371,220,1034000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"Because you love me, right? Admit it. We were born to fall into each others' arms on reality TV."
96433,371,221,1039000,Marge Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"I'm sorry, but I love Homer."
96434,371,222,1043000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,Of course you do.
96435,371,223,1045000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"He's a real man -- not like me, a miserable toad under the thumb of the biggest bitch this side of the Westminster Kennel Club."
96436,371,224,1051000,Marge Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"Charles, please -- your son might see this."
96437,371,225,1054000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,He's not my son! His real father is either the pool man or my wife's lover. They're the main two candidates I've narrowed it down to. Pretty sure.
96438,371,226,1064000,Marge Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"There, there. God, I miss Homer."
96439,371,227,1067000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,I miss him too. What is it about him that is so damned irresistible?
96440,371,228,1071000,Marge Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,Well...
96441,371,229,1072000,Marge Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"He's loved me ever since the first moment he saw me and he's never stopped. And whatever it takes to make me happy, he'll do it even if it kills him."
96442,371,230,1082000,Cameraman,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"Sorry, I ran out of tape just before that beautiful speech of hers. But I got a great shot of him saying his son's a bastard."
96443,371,231,1090000,Marge Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,Lisa! What are you doing in the Nutmeg State?
96444,371,232,1093000,Lisa Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,Fox flew me out here to bring you back. They flew me on Frito Lay's Air Force Yum!
96445,371,233,1099000,Lisa Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"And I'm required to say ""Come to the cool ranch and rope in flavor. Yee ha."""
96446,371,234,1099000,Marge Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"Let's go home, sweetie. I'm sure there's a hamper full of Homer waiting for me."
96426,371,235,1108000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"And I'm coming with you -- to tell my sea hag of a wife, ""You're fired!"""
96449,371,236,1108000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,"I was doing uh, Donald Trump. Billionaire. If you knew who he was, you'd be dying."
96450,371,237,1122000,Lisa Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,I know who Donald Trump is.
96451,371,238,1123000,Marge Simpson,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,Me too.
96452,371,239,1124000,Charles Heathbar,CHARLES AND VERITY'S HOUSE,I don't think you do. Spot on.
96454,371,241,1131000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,She's nowhere to be seen. Time to let Homer be Homer.
96455,371,242,1141000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I missed you so much! Put your pants back on."
96456,371,243,1148000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Marge, thank God you're back! She made me spend time with the kids. And not just TV time. Talking time!"
96457,371,244,1156000,Charles Heathbar,Simpson Home,"Where is she? Where is the soul-sucking she-beast I call ""Sweetums?"""
96458,371,245,1161000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Maggie? She's in her crib.
96459,371,246,1163000,Charles Heathbar,Simpson Home,No. My soon to be ex-wife.
96460,371,247,1165000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I, uh, I don't think you wanna see her just now."
96461,371,248,1169000,Charles Heathbar,Simpson Home,Oh yes I do. She's got the shock of her life coming to her.
96462,371,249,1174000,Verity,Simpson Home,Charles?
96463,371,250,1174000,Verity,Simpson Home,I'm leaving you.
96464,371,251,1175000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,"Ya snooze, ya lose."
96465,371,252,1177000,Charles Heathbar,Simpson Home,You're leaving me for him?!
96466,371,253,1180000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"So it would appear. However, Cousin It, there, was born a woman."
96467,371,254,1183000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Home,What brought us together is how much we hate you.
96468,371,255,1186000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, well, I'm gonna vote ""No"" on Thirty-eight so you can't adopt."
96469,371,256,1192000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Kidding! Kidding! I don't vote! The polling place is up a hill and I never make it!
96470,371,257,1201000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,YOU MAKE ME LAUGH / YOU MAKE ME CRY / WITHOUT YOU I'D JUST / WANT TO DIE / FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE / YOU'LL BE A FIXTURE / NOW LET ME ENJOY / YOUR PICTURE IN PICTURE...
96471,371,258,1217000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"And Marge, you're pretty great too."
96472,371,259,1219000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, whatever."
96473,371,260,1229000,Charles Heathbar,Simpson Home,"Oh yeah, can you feel it? Just stay with the credits, just riffing now. Words... and chords. Not the poetry in the real thing but not bad for an ad-lib... not good, but... And, it's not long enough, so I'll just do a little bit more. And it's nearly done, that's the final credit, that's the end."
