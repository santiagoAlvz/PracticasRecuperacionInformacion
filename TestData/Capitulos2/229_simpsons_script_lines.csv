55473,229,157,731000,Farm Critic,Springfield Shopper,"Good Lord, man, you're a critic! You don't have to like everything.

55484,229,168,770000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Dinner Theater,"Hm. This pea soup is as weak as the acting, and nowhere near as hammy."

55508,229,192,890000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,People will think what I tell them to think when you tell me what to tell them to think!
55509,229,193,894000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Not anymore. I don't wanna be partners with a man who feels like that.
55510,229,194,899000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nobody talks to me that way! I'm Homer Simpson! The most powerful food critic in town, who will never get his comeuppance! You hear me? No comeuppance! We'll be right back."

55518,229,202,931000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"""Chewy!"" That's inspired."
55520,229,204,938000,Lifeways Editor,Springfield Shopper,"Homer, what gives with this review? You say the salad tastes like ""bark"", the potatoes were very . This reads like it was written by a dog."
55521,229,205,948000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Shopper,Are you crazy? A dog can't type. Unfortunately.
55522,229,206,952000,Lifeways Editor,Springfield Shopper,"Listen, you gotta shape up. Next week is the ""Taste of Springfield"" festival, and you'll be reviewing every restaurant in town. Remember, people have certain expectations about the Lifeways section."
55523,229,207,964000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Shopper,Really? Like what?
55524,229,208,966000,Lifeways Editor,Springfield Shopper,"Oh, I don't know... astrology, Broom Hilda, vacation horror stories, articles about chronic-fatigue syndrome. You know, chick crap."
55526,229,210,978000,Luigi,The Frying Dutchman,"Homer, he's outta control-a. He gave me a bad review -- so my friend put a horse head in his bed. He ate-a the head and gave it a bad review! True story."
55527,229,211,988000,Captain Horatio McCallister,The Frying Dutchman,"Arr, well, I've had it with Homer. His bad reviews are sinking our businesses."
55528,229,212,993000,Akira,The Frying Dutchman,Then why did you put yours in the window?
55529,229,213,997000,Captain Horatio McCallister,The Frying Dutchman,"It covered the ""D"" from the health inspector."
55530,229,214,1000000,DINNER THEATRE OWNER,The Frying Dutchman,"Well, I say we ban Homer from our restaurants!"
55531,229,215,1003000,Akira,The Frying Dutchman,"No, that would be impolite. I say we kill him!"
55532,229,216,1007000,Deli Owner,The Frying Dutchman,"Now, hold on a minute. Are we restauranteurs or are we murderers?"
55533,229,217,1010000,Captain Horatio McCallister,The Frying Dutchman,Does that answer your question?
55534,229,218,1015000,Akira,The Frying Dutchman,"We'll kill him at the ""Taste o' Springfield"" festival. We'll give Homer all he can eat, 'til he can eat no more. Then he'll get his just dessert."
55535,229,219,1027000,French Chef,The Frying Dutchman,This will be Homer Simpson's last lagniappe.
55536,229,220,1031000,Dinner Theater Owner,The Frying Dutchman,"C'mon, you're gonna kill him with a pastry? I've seen this man eat a bowl of change!"
55537,229,221,1036000,French Chef,The Frying Dutchman,This éclair has over one million calories.
55538,229,222,1039000,French Chef,The Frying Dutchman,Twenty-five pounds of butter per square inch.
55539,229,223,1044000,French Chef,The Frying Dutchman,"Covered with chocolate so dark, light cannot escape its surface..."
55541,229,225,1049000,French Chef,The Frying Dutchman,"No, no, no. This is just a picture. But Hom-aire Simp-son will find the real thing both delicious and deadly."
55542,229,226,1058000,Akira,The Frying Dutchman,"Ah, yes. Death by chocolate."
55543,229,227,1063000,French Chef,The Frying Dutchman,And poison. I'll stick in some poison.
55545,229,229,1072000,Marge Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,"Homie, my women's intuition's acting up. Something bad's going to happen if you go in there."
55546,229,230,1078000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,"Oh, Marge, something bad usually happens to me when I go in anywhere."
55547,229,231,1083000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,A bat! Now that's a new one.
55548,229,232,1089000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,"So what are you up to, young lady?"
55549,229,233,1090000,Lisa Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,I'm reviewing the festival for our school paper.
55550,229,234,1093000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,"Oh. Well, I'm glad to see my ex-partner is doing so well without me."
55551,229,235,1121000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,Pedestrian.
55552,229,236,1124000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,Uninspired.
55553,229,237,1127000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,I didn't say stop!
55555,229,239,1129000,Captain Horatio McCallister,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,Lard ho!
55556,229,240,1131000,Captain Horatio McCallister,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,"Arrr, 'tis a good sign. Homer's unfastened the top button on his pants."
55557,229,241,1136000,Akira,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,"No, he's been walking around like that since Thanksgiving."
55558,229,242,1139000,Captain Horatio McCallister,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,I'm surprised he just doesn't give it up and go for sweatpants.
55559,229,243,1143000,Akira,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,He says the crotch wears out too fast.
55560,229,244,1146000,Captain Horatio McCallister,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,Yarr! That's gonna replace the whale in my nightmares.
55561,229,245,1150000,Akira,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,"Well, don't worry. The giant éclair will knock Homer off the food page... and into the obituaries."
55562,229,246,1163000,Bart Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD FESTIVAL,"Wait a minute, they're gonna kill Dad!"
55564,229,248,1179000,French Chef,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Oh, that's-a spicy meatball."
55565,229,249,1181000,Bart Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"... So if we don't find Dad, this crazy French guy is gonna kill him!"
55566,229,250,1184000,Marge Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,Only your father could take a part-time job at a small-town paper and wind up the target of international assassins.
55567,229,251,1192000,Lisa Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,We can find him faster by splitting up. You take fried foods. You take salty snacks. I'll take desserts. Break!
55568,229,252,1200000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Oh, So full... Bellybutton moving from innie to outie..."
55569,229,253,1215000,Ned Flanders,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Ooh, that looks scrum-diddly-doodly-duddly --"
55570,229,254,1218000,French Chef,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,Get lost!
55571,229,255,1219000,Ned Flanders,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"A rude Frenchman? Well, I never!"
55572,229,256,1223000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Ooh, sweet."
55573,229,257,1229000,Lisa Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Dad, no!"

55575,229,259,1238000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Eh, I've had a good run."
55576,229,260,1240000,Lisa Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,Don't! Uh... um... It's low-fat!
55577,229,261,1246000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,Noooo!
55578,229,262,1251000,Chief Wiggum,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,That was close. Thank God it landed in that smoking crater.
55580,229,264,1259000,Chief Wiggum,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Take him into custardy, boys. Attempted Murder One."
55581,229,265,1263000,Chief Wiggum,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Now boys, what would you say to some Belgian waffles?"
55582,229,266,1266000,Lou,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Actually, I was in the mood for some frittatas."
55583,229,267,1268000,Chief Wiggum,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,Lou and his frittatas.
55584,229,268,1275000,Chief Wiggum,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Oh, he likes eggs."
55585,229,269,1276000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Oh, Lisa... you saved me! And after all the bad things I said about you."
55586,229,270,1281000,Lisa Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,What bad things? Why?
55587,229,271,1283000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Oh, Lisa, the important thing is, I didn't get my comeuppance, and I never will."
55588,229,272,1293000,Lisa Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"Uh, Dad?"
55589,229,273,1295000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,"I know, honey. The important thing is -- run!"
55590,229,274,1304000,Homer Simpson,TASTE OF SPRINGFIELD,Finally getting my comeuppance.
