78637,307,2,40000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,He didn't say anything about Skinner-in-a-shredder.com.
78638,307,3,44000,Animated Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Let's make this the best year ever.
78639,307,4,48000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Now today we have a special guest: a documentary filmmaker whose works include ""Lost Luggage, Shattered Lives,"" and ""Upskirt Dreams."" Please welcome Declan Desmond."
78640,307,5,61000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,"Thank you. Now, when you think of documentaries you probably think of the Maysles brothers and Barbara Koppel."
78641,307,6,68000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, they're not good enough to wipe my lens. Here's a look at my work. A film I made about Krustyburger... ""Do You Want Lies With That?"""
78615,307,8,72000,Declan Desmond,Krusty Burger,Does it bother you that Krusty uses mad-cow beef to save money?
78644,307,9,84000,Homer Simpson,Krusty Burger,"No, because they pass the savings onto me, the consumer."
78646,307,11,89000,Declan Desmond,Krusty's Office,Aren't you ashamed to lend your likeness to sub-standard food?
78647,307,12,93000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Office,"Look, I give people a meat-like burger and some kind of cola, and they still get change back from their fifty."
78648,307,13,100000,Declan Desmond,Krusty's Office,"Well, your customers may be shocked...by my footage of you...stapling together abandoned, half-eaten burgers."
78649,307,14,108000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty's Office,Good as new.
78650,307,15,111000,Kids,Krusty's Office,Ewww!
78652,307,17,111000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,"Powerful work. And now he's going to make a documentary about Springfield Elementary, which I assume will be glowing and positive, unlike all of his other work."
78653,307,18,120000,Declan Desmond,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,"Right. Now everyone, while I'm filming, please be yourselves. I want to see troubled children brooding, bullies doling out ""what-for."""
78654,307,19,124000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,"What about us cool kids? Should we just ""chill out""?"
78655,307,20,132000,Declan Desmond,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,You're doing great.
78656,307,21,134000,Declan Desmond,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM,Stay with the dink.
78658,307,23,136000,Declan Desmond,PLAYGROUND,"America is supposed to be a democracy, but in the schoolyard, cool rules. And Springfield's Machiavelli of the monkey bars is one Bartholomew Simpson."
78659,307,24,147000,Declan Desmond,PLAYGROUND,"On today's royal agenda, digging up dirt clods to throw at his school chums."
78660,307,25,152000,Bart Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"I chuck 'em at nerds, girls I like, whatever."
78661,307,26,155000,Bart Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Ow!
78662,307,27,157000,Nelson Muntz,PLAYGROUND,"Munch mud, Simpson!"
78663,307,28,161000,Bart Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"I'm telling! Oh, man."
78664,307,29,166000,Declan Desmond,PLAYGROUND,"And in a flash, Bart's glory has gone the way of England's masculinity."
78666,307,31,171000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"It's a dangerous life being a hall monitor. When you leave home in the morning, you may be kissing your dolls goodbye for the last time."
78667,307,32,181000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,"My sash says ""Ultraman!"""
78668,307,33,185000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I think we've seen enough.
78669,307,34,196000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Why look, it's typical student Lisa Simpson."
78670,307,35,204000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,Indeed.
78672,307,36,206000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Hitting it off already! I haven't seen such a natural pair since half-sandwich and soup of the day.
78673,307,37,212000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"I'll just leave you two alone. Remember, as far as he knows, we still teach math."
78674,307,38,222000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Why, whatever do you mean?"
78675,307,39,227000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Huh? Wha? Go Aberdeen!
78676,307,40,232000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, you can't blame Principal Skinner for wanting to feature his best student."
78677,307,41,237000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,And that's you?
78678,307,42,238000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, I am young, gifted and yellow. My interests include music, science, justice, animals, shapes, feelings..."
78679,307,43,255000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, that's not gonna happen!"
78680,307,44,257000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, I'm afraid you're a dilettante. Pick a path and follow it, or you'll just grow up, slog your way through Mount Holyoke and squeeze out babies."
78681,307,45,264000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,Stop it!
78682,307,46,269000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Since Nelson nailed you with that dirt, no one thinks you're cool anymore. Even that kid that wears diapers is more popular. And he ain't popular."
78683,307,47,278000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"So? I'll bounce back. I always bounce back -- like after the time I accidentally called the teacher ""Mom""."
78684,307,48,281000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Even I beat you up that day. After you passed out.
78685,307,49,291000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,What's that hood ornament doing around your neck?
78686,307,50,294000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"I snapped it off some jerk's car. I could go to prison for life, but, whatever."
78688,307,52,300000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,The only way to be cooler than him is to do exactly what he does. I've gotta steal me a hood ornament! But how?
78690,307,54,314000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Nelson steals a hood ornament and now he's king of the school. All that's left for me is to become the biggest drunk this town's ever seen.
78691,307,55,322000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Talking won't get you there.
78692,307,56,327000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, what's bumming you out? They cancel a test or something?"
78693,307,57,331000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, my life lacks direction!"
78694,307,58,334000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's a concern. A serious concern.
78695,307,59,336000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, I never chose a path. And because I kept my options open, I can finally do what I want."
78643,307,60,343000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,And what's that?
78671,307,61,344000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm gonna die alone.
78696,307,63,347000,Lisa Simpson,Street,I gotta pick a career! Gotta pick a career!
78698,307,65,350000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Museum of Natural History,I can find a good career at this museum. Or at lease see if they fixed that mislabeled raccoon I complained about.
78700,307,67,356000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,"Hmm, maybe I could be an expert on dinosaurs."
78701,307,68,360000,Sad Voice,Museum,"Don't do it, little girl."
78702,307,69,362000,Technician,Museum,I spent thirty years brushing the teeth of dead monsters.
78703,307,70,371000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,Maybe geology...
78704,307,71,374000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,"Formed by unimaginable heat and pressure deep inside the earth, minerals explode in a vast panoply of... Eh."
78705,307,72,374000,Announcer,Museum,"Since the dawn of time, travelers looking for guidance have turned to the heavens."
78706,307,73,391000,Announcer,Museum,"Polaris, the star of the north... Mighty Orion's Belt..."
78707,307,74,396000,Announcer,Museum,"The majestic Milky Way, home of a familiar blue planet we call... Rigel Seven. Not too far from Earth."
78708,307,75,404000,Announcer,Museum,We have only scratched the surface of the universe. Who will discover the wonders that lie beyond our galaxy? Will it be you... or you...or you?
78709,307,76,416000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,"That's it! Lisa Simpson, astronomer!"
78710,307,77,422000,Announcer,Museum,Now who will press my reset button? Will it be you... or you... or you?
78712,307,79,439000,Lisa Simpson,Hobby Store,"Oh Dad, look at this one!"
78713,307,80,442000,Homer Simpson,Hobby Store,"Sweetie, Daddy doesn't have enough money for that...unless they take a check."
78714,307,81,450000,Hobby Shop Guy,Hobby Store,We certainly do.
78715,307,82,455000,Homer Simpson,Hobby Store,Boi-oi-oi-oinggg!
78716,307,83,457000,Hobby Shop Guy,Hobby Store,Why did you say that? Is your check gonna bounce?
78717,307,84,459000,Homer Simpson,Hobby Store,"No, of course not!"
78718,307,85,461000,Homer Simpson,Hobby Store,Duh-uh.
78719,307,86,462000,Hobby Shop Guy,Hobby Store,Why did you say that? Are you implying that I'm dumb?
78720,307,87,465000,Homer Simpson,Hobby Store,I have to go.
78722,307,89,470000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,Oh my God! Space monsters are invading us!
78723,307,90,473000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Dad, that's a moth."
78724,307,91,475000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Oh. Well, where do I twist this thing to make funny patterns?"
78725,307,92,479000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Dad, that's a kaleidoscope."
78726,307,93,481000,Homer Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"You may be a smart kid, Lisa, but you don't know much about not hurting people's feelings."
78727,307,94,505000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,What happened?
78728,307,95,508000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Thanks a lot, surviving Beach Boys."
78729,307,96,512000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Okay, Jupiter should be somewhere around here..."
78730,307,97,516000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,Hey.
78731,307,98,527000,Mayor Joe Quimby,LIVING ROOM,"For three seconds there, you were legally the mayor."
78732,307,99,530000,Miss Springfield,LIVING ROOM,"Yeah. And you was a girl, Joe."
78734,307,101,552000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Mt. Springfield,"What you are seeing is light pollution. Light pollution. For astronomers like me, this is a bigger problem, even, than oh I don't know say, getting a date which is difficult for the geeky people."
78735,307,102,566000,Lisa Simpson,Mt. Springfield,We've got to do something. I know --maybe we can get people to sign a petition.
78736,307,103,571000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Mt. Springfield,"I'd like to help, I would. but if I leave this observatory, another astronomer will move right in. They're like hermit crabs. They really are. Oh, there's one now."
78737,307,104,580000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Mt. Springfield,I see you!
78738,307,105,583000,Astronomer,Mt. Springfield,You said he was out of microscopes!
78740,307,107,588000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, check out this hood ornament I stole."
78741,307,108,590000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,"With this glinting gewgaw, the beta male attempts to reclaim leadership of his herd. Ooh, that's good narration."
78742,307,109,599000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,That's not a hood ornament. It's a pacifier you spray-painted silver.
78744,307,111,610000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Haw haw. Wait, that's not right."
78745,307,112,614000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Haw haw!

78747,307,114,622000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'm collecting signatures to bring back the night sky.
78748,307,115,626000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,"Wow, the night sky. How'd you come up with that, tilt your head up?"
78749,307,116,630000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Does it make you feel superior to tear down people's dreams?
78750,307,117,634000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,Yes. Does it make you feel smart to question people's motives?
78751,307,118,637000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Yes.
78752,307,119,637000,Declan Desmond,Springfield Elementary School,Well all right then.

78758,307,124,653000,Mayor Joe Quimby,STEPS OF CITY HALL,"People of Springfield, I've heard your pleas. Whether you're an idealistic stargazer like Lisa, or a faded Southern belle who needs the forgiving cloak of night to seduce naïve young delivery boys with more pizza than common sense, I say Springfield will be the dimmest city in America."
78759,307,125,679000,Lisa Simpson,STEPS OF CITY HALL,"Look up at the stars, Springfield! For eons, people have gazed at the skies and seen into their souls."
78760,307,126,710000,Lisa Simpson,STEPS OF CITY HALL,"Oh, stop."
78762,307,128,712000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Look out, Matthew Modine and Charlene Tilton! There are new stars in town -- sky stars, now visible thanks to Springfield's latest cave-in to the astronomer lobby."
78763,307,129,723000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"The best part is, next week we'll get to see the Deadly Meteor Shower."
78764,307,130,728000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,Deadly meteor shower?
78765,307,131,729000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Named after its discoverer, Professor Artemis Deadly, who was ironically killed in the shower of 1853."
78767,307,133,736000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"The last time those meteors came, we thought the sky was on fire! Naturally, we blamed it on the Irish -- we hanged more than a few!"
78768,307,134,748000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Uh-oh -- sounds like some bad eggs are cooking up trouble.
78769,307,135,752000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Mmm... bad eggs.
78771,307,137,762000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Street,This is great! It's darker than a French chick's armpit!

78773,307,139,784000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,I've got to get that hood ornament. No matter who owns it.

78775,307,141,794000,Louie,Springfield Street,You're gonna be drinkin' worms through a straw.
78777,307,143,800000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Street,"Springfield's pro-darkness policy has resulted in a spree of vandalism unmatched since the Detroit Tigers last made the playoffs over two centuries ago. The government has issued an orange alert, which, once again, means nothing."
78779,307,145,815000,Bart Simpson,Luigi's Trattoria,Time to get that hood's ornament.
78780,307,146,832000,Milhouse Van Houten,Luigi's Trattoria,Try-a the cheese-a pizza. It's greasy like-a you.
78781,307,147,838000,Milhouse Van Houten,Luigi's Trattoria,You're gonna depreciate a Mafia Don's car?
78782,307,148,841000,Bart Simpson,Luigi's Trattoria,"Hey, we're all gonna be murdered some day."
78784,307,150,844000,Crowd,STEPS OF CITY HALL,TWO-FOUR-SIX-EIGHT / IT'S TIME TO RE-ILLUMINATE!

78789,307,155,862000,Luigi,Luigi's Trattoria,"Thank you Fat Tony. Thank you. But at the risk of enraging you by making you look a-stupid, we have no valet parking."

78792,307,158,885000,Milhouse Van Houten,Street,"You know Bart, I really like spending time with you."
78793,307,159,888000,Bart Simpson,Street,Just hold the light.
78794,307,160,891000,Legs,Street,I can't see nuttin'.

78796,307,162,895000,Fat Tony,Street,No -- you might hit a made man.
78798,307,164,897000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Springfield Town Hall,"They want light? By God, they'll get light."

78814,307,180,949000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, what happened? It's bright in the middle of the night."

78818,307,182,956000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,It's this new anti-crime dealie. The mayor turned the streetlights way up. My daughter Lisa feels really strongly about it.
78819,307,183,963000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Pro or con?
78820,307,184,965000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I'unno. What am I, Superdad?"
