147331,567,5,48000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, despite all that, today's gonna be fun, Dad! Will there be lots of other girls there?"
147334,567,8,65000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"...after we show you the wealth of jobs in the steno pool, a hearty luncheon of bison with lake beaver will be served..."
147336,567,10,72000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,...and upon leaving you will each receive a piece of orangewood to bite down on during childbirth. Excellent.
147337,567,11,80000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"It's getting harder and harder to maintain my sunny disposition, Smithers."
147338,567,12,84000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You're always my ray of...
147339,567,13,85000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Shut up.
147340,567,14,93000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Is it called the cooling tower because there's--
147341,567,15,95000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Not my department.
147343,567,17,102000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,"Curse that Elon Musk! Thanks to that Earth-smooching buttinski, I'm on the verge of bankruptcy. All I have left are the clothes on my back and the clones in my freezer."
147253,567,19,111000,Workman,WALK-IN FREEZER,Forty-three is missing again!
147346,567,20,114000,C. Montgomery Burns,WALK-IN FREEZER,I had to replace my beloved hounds with teacup poodles. It's pathetic. Watch. Release the hounds!
147347,567,21,125000,Waylon Smithers,WALK-IN FREEZER,"No! Help! Oh, stop!"
147350,567,24,145000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,But I have a new scheme that will undo the terrible damage done by my other schemes. I have an appointment with a Nigerian King to negotiate a uranium deal that will put me right back on top.
147351,567,25,155000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"Nothing can stop you, sir."
147352,567,26,157000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,But... not that you're not at the top of your game... what if you don't get the deal?
147353,567,27,163000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,I'll just have to sell everything and move to the South Pacific with you. What a grim fate that would be.
147354,567,28,169000,Waiter,Burns's Office,"And with your omelet, would you like the fried potatoes or the mixed berries?"
147355,567,29,173000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Office,I'll have the berries.
147356,567,30,178000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"A terrible fate indeed, sir."
147358,567,32,189000,Lisa Simpson,NUCLEAR PLANT CAFETERIA,"Dad, do you have anything I can eat?"
147360,567,34,195000,Homer Simpson,NUCLEAR PLANT CAFETERIA,"Oh, uh, I will turn this corn chip into a wonderful meal, using my greatest skill -- lunchroom trading. Shut your eyes."

147362,567,36,216000,Lenny Leonard,NUCLEAR PLANT CAFETERIA,"But what about the presentation? The eyes taste first, then lips, then palate, then the body's harshest critic, the colon."
147363,567,37,235000,Homer Simpson,NUCLEAR PLANT CAFETERIA,"Okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks!"
147364,567,38,239000,Lisa Simpson,NUCLEAR PLANT CAFETERIA,"Wow, Dad! Thank you!"

147374,567,48,289000,Waylon Smithers,Burns's Office,"What?! Sir, that's Homer Simpson. You forgot that he's the most incompetent...Homer Simpson would be perfect."
147375,567,50,305000,C. Montgomery Burns,FIVE SEASONS HOTEL,"Simpson, all you have to do is babysit the Princess -- keeping her in this hotel room during the negotiations."
147376,567,51,310000,Homer Simpson,FIVE SEASONS HOTEL,"Babysitting, eh? What do I know about kids?"
147377,567,52,314000,Homer Simpson,FIVE SEASONS HOTEL,"Princess, why did you put on that coat? You're obviously cold. May I escort you to the radiator?"
147378,567,53,331000,KEMI,FIVE SEASONS HOTEL,No. I want to go out. I am twenty-five years old.
147379,567,54,336000,Homer Simpson,FIVE SEASONS HOTEL,"Uh, just a second. Hey, Marge. Yeah, I'm workin' late. Yep, special project."
147380,567,55,340000,Marge Simpson,FIVE SEASONS HOTEL,"Lenny said you were babysitting. And if you are babysitting, why can't you do some at home? I could use a night out."
147381,567,56,348000,Homer Simpson,FIVE SEASONS HOTEL,"Sorry, Marge. But I am the royal babysitter. If I start watching commoners, the tongues of the court will be awag!"
147382,567,57,355000,Marge Simpson,FIVE SEASONS HOTEL,"Really? Awag? Really? Well, if you think tha--"
147383,567,58,359000,KEMI,FIVE SEASONS HOTEL,"I want to go out, and see the America whose greatest cities I've only seen destroyed in movies."
147384,567,59,366000,Homer Simpson,FIVE SEASONS HOTEL,"I see. You want excitement. Princess, have you ever heard of Studio Fifty-Four, C-B-G-Bs, the Roxbury?"
147385,567,60,372000,KEMI,FIVE SEASONS HOTEL,Yes! I've dreamed of...

147394,567,69,406000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Really? Tell me something: I've heard that Queen Elizabeth in person is actually not that funny.
147395,567,70,412000,KEMI,Moe's Tavern,I am from Africa.
147396,567,71,413000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Wow, Africa. I had a good friend who really wanted to go there. So, uh, you speak English there?"
147397,567,72,419000,KEMI,Moe's Tavern,I speak five languages.
147398,567,73,421000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Nobody does.

147403,567,78,440000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, that's it, Majesty. Notice I didn't say ""your."""
147404,567,79,442000,KEMI,Moe's Tavern,They don't make them like you in Nigeria.
147405,567,80,447000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Nigeria?

147408,567,83,455000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Can I try it?
147409,567,84,456000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Eh, you gotta be mad at something."
147410,567,85,458000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it."
147411,567,86,478000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,And you gave it to him?
147412,567,87,479000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, I did. I was sure the guy was on the level because of his bad spelling and grammar."
147413,567,88,490000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Now, guess how much of the twenty million I saw?"
147414,567,89,493000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Eight million?

147417,567,92,497000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"If Kemi there is a Nigerian princess, her brother just might be the Nigerian prince that took my money!"
147418,567,93,511000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,She's gone!
147419,567,94,513000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"And she trashed my bar! Oh no, wait. She actually cleaned up a little. Good for her."
147420,567,95,522000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Chief! Thank God! I was drinking at Moe's, and I lost an African princess!"
147421,567,96,528000,Chief Wiggum,Moe's Tavern,"Lost African princess, eh? Well, lucky for you, she just happens to be in the back of my cruiser."

147430,567,105,562000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,This is terrible. Can't think of anything to mumble to myself. That's how upset I am here.
147431,567,106,571000,KEMI,Moe's Tavern,Also... maybe... I wanted to talk more to you.
147432,567,107,575000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Really?
147434,567,108,576000,Moe's Thoughts,Moe's Tavern,"Okay there, Moe. You gotta get to the brother, because he knows what my pin number is and I forgot."

147441,567,115,602000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Guys, thanks for bailing me out. But I still have a huge problem."
147442,567,116,606000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Police Station,"Well, till we find her, maybe we could get somebody to pretend to be her."
147443,567,117,611000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Police Station,"You know, get a nice wig and a dress..."
147444,567,118,613000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Police Station,"Oh no. I am not dressing up like an African Princess. I am not, I am not, I am not."
147445,567,119,620000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Police Station,Thank you for listening to my objections.
147446,567,120,623000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Police Station,"Well, you were really vehement."
147447,567,121,626000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Police Station,"Uh, hello, Simpson. Just checking up. May I speak with the princess?"
147448,567,122,629000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Um, yeah, sure. Hello, this is the princess. I'm with Homer Simpson and I do declare he's wonderful. Oh, that's right, I'm from South Africa. Fiddle dee dee."
147449,567,123,641000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Police Station,Sounds like everything's going just the way I want it.
147451,567,125,644000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Yeah, so all my money's tied up in this jernt. Can't even afford elocution lessons to teach me how to pronounce ""joint."" I guess I could do it online, but what's the pernt?"
147453,567,127,655000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,What's so funny?
147454,567,128,657000,KEMI,Moe's Tavern,I thought my English was perfect. But you make me feel even better about it.
147455,567,129,662000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Usually people that tease me get thrown out on their ass. But, uh, your sayin' it made me feel good. Jeez, I sound like one of those guys in theM rom coms that play at the theater next to the theater I'm in."
147456,567,130,675000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"So, uh, what's a Princesses like you do all day, eh? A lot of spinning wheels and witches treatin' you like crap?"
147457,567,131,682000,KEMI,Moe's Tavern,"I read. Are you familiar with the books by my countryman Chinua Achebe, ""Things Fall Apart"" and ""No Longer At Ease?"""
147458,567,132,689000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,You guys got real optimistic literature there.
147459,567,133,692000,KEMI,Moe's Tavern,Fair comment.

147461,567,135,698000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Don't eat those eggs! We don't know what kinda bird they turn into! But there's a string cheese or something in the fridge in the back. Help yourself.
147462,567,136,706000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Alright, after she eats, I'd better close up. C'mon, pal."
147463,567,137,717000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,That's really stuck there good.
147464,567,138,724000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I can't be mad at her no more.
147465,567,139,737000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Goodnight, moon."
147466,567,140,739000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Goodnight, broom. Good night jukebox that won't play a tune."

147469,567,143,764000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,So my offer... for one ton of your uranium... is a goat.
147470,567,144,768000,King,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Will you stop offering me that? I come from a modern nation of ninety million people!
147471,567,145,773000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Two goats.
147472,567,146,773000,King,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You are starting to insult me.
147473,567,147,775000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"All right, let's cut to the chase. My board has given me permission to go up to... twelve goats."
147476,567,150,786000,Waylon Smithers,Island,"How 'bout here, sir?"
147477,567,151,789000,C. Montgomery Burns,Island,I'm so sorry I pretended not to be gay for all those years. Better an old queen than never a queen at all.
147478,567,152,800000,C. Montgomery Burns,Island,Pay attention! My last offer: twenty million goats.
147479,567,153,804000,King,Island,"Okay, fine. But, no dogs disguised as goats."
147480,567,154,807000,C. Montgomery Burns,Island,Oh great! Here comes the haggling!
147482,567,156,809000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, well, look who's up. Princess, I'm gonna do something for you I've never done for anyone in this bar: call you a cab."
147483,567,157,818000,KEMI,Moe's Tavern,No. I want to spend time with you. I want to see this town.
147484,567,158,822000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Do you mind ridin' on a cute little scooter with your arms around my waist?
147485,567,159,825000,KEMI,Moe's Tavern,I don't.
147486,567,160,827000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,To the scooter store!
147488,567,162,847000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Streets,And after you eat the soup you can eat the bowl or you can put coins in it. Whatever you like.
147489,567,163,857000,KEMI,Springfield Streets,I have a confession to make. This is my first montage.
147490,567,164,860000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Streets,Just relax and enjoy the music.
147491,567,165,865000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,Moe Szyslak!
147492,567,166,867000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,This is the part of the fairytale where the princess goes back to the hotel and watches TV!
147493,567,167,873000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Streets,Come with me.
147495,567,169,879000,Moe Szyslak,Street,Just move the pedals!
147496,567,170,891000,PEDICAB DRIVER,Street,"Whoa, sounds like the tower has cleared us for takeoff..."
147497,567,171,896000,Moe Szyslak,Street,We're tryin' to escape that guy!
147498,567,172,899000,PEDICAB DRIVER,Street,"Well, dude, as long as he can run, he can beat us."
147501,567,175,904000,PEDICAB DRIVER,Springfield,"So anyways, the place that I really feel the pedaling? It's my legs."
147502,567,176,909000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield,"Okay, all right, we're safe."
147503,567,177,911000,KEMI,Springfield,"Actually, I wanted to go back with him. I don't want to get my father mad."
147504,567,178,915000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield,Go back? But I didn't show you the place where Dave Grohl got mugged.
147505,567,179,919000,KEMI,Springfield,I have to leave. But I still had a wonderful day.
147506,567,180,923000,Moe's Thoughts,Springfield,Thank God I shaved my forehead this morning.
147507,567,181,926000,KEMI,Springfield,"A paparazzo! Please don't send that! If my father sees it, it will ruin my life!"
147508,567,182,932000,Paparazzo,Springfield,Well thanks for making it so easy.
147510,567,184,945000,King,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,And you have the twenty million goats.
147511,567,185,947000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Two now. Nineteen million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety eight on delivery."
147512,567,186,954000,King,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Very good.
147513,567,187,954000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Um, shouldn't we see how the Princess is doing before you sign, Your Majesty?"
147514,567,188,959000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"What are you talking about, Smithers?"
147515,567,189,963000,King,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I can't even trust you to watch an impetuous adult who does what she wants. The deal is off!
147516,567,190,970000,SMITHERS' THOUGHTS,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Wow. After spending my life serving others, I'm finally gonna get what I want."
147517,567,191,974000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Sir, there may be a bright side..."
147518,567,192,976000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,There's never a bright side!
147519,567,193,978000,SMITHERS' THOUGHTS,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,He's almost mine!
147520,567,195,986000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Yes, you've torn that up all right."
147521,567,196,988000,KEMI,Burns Manor,"Father! I want to explain. I was a young woman who wanted to see the world, and this kind man has shown it to me."
147522,567,197,996000,King,Burns Manor,And stolen your heart.
147523,567,198,998000,Moe Szyslak,Burns Manor,"Eh, well, that's what I do. Sorry, but there ain't no off switch for this."
147524,567,199,1005000,KEMI,Burns Manor,He has not stolen my heart.
147525,567,200,1008000,Moe Szyslak,Burns Manor,Wha?!
147526,567,201,1010000,King,Burns Manor,Why has he made the ancient tribal sound of confusion?
147527,567,202,1013000,KEMI,Burns Manor,"I think he is a sweet, sweet man. But when I kissed him on the forehead, it was not romantic. More like when Snow White kissed Dopey."
147528,567,203,1021000,Moe Szyslak,Burns Manor,"No, no, not this comparison again!"
147529,567,204,1024000,KEMI,Burns Manor,"I'm sorry, Moe. I don't love you, but I really like you."
147530,567,205,1030000,King,Burns Manor,"Well, daughter. Even though you have done nothing seriously wrong, first I will tear this contract one more time."
147531,567,206,1030000,King,Burns Manor,"And as for you, your punishment will be..."
147532,567,207,1040000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"Uh, may I speak to you, Majesty, father to father?"
147533,567,208,1044000,King,Burns Manor,A woman has allowed you to sire her children?
147534,567,209,1047000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,There was beer involved. I have two daughters. And I've learned you have to let them go their own way. Even the one-year-old.
147535,567,210,1056000,Marge Simpson,Burns Manor,Majesty.
147536,567,211,1058000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"And the older one, I can't tell her what to do. And she's only twelve."
147537,567,212,1061000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,Eight.
147538,567,213,1063000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,See what I mean? Always an argument.
147539,567,214,1068000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,But the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them...
147540,567,215,1073000,King,Burns Manor,I am not convinced.
147541,567,216,1075000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,"...uh, because you want them to grow..."
147542,567,217,1078000,King,Burns Manor,Still not convinced.
147543,567,218,1080000,Homer Simpson,Burns Manor,...and because you can't strangle a girl.
147544,567,219,1083000,King,Burns Manor,That makes sense.
147546,567,221,1085000,King,Burns Manor,"Come here, daughter."
147547,567,222,1087000,KEMI,Burns Manor,"Oh, father."
147548,567,223,1088000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,"Little girl, let me give you some advice. Never dream big because it will blow up in your face."
147549,567,224,1093000,Lisa Simpson,Burns Manor,You're talking to the girl who wants a career in jazz.
147550,567,225,1097000,Waylon Smithers,Burns Manor,Poor thing.
147552,567,227,1099000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,So the good King's cheap uranium will allow me to sell you expensive nuclear power. Everyone wins.
147553,567,228,1105000,Reporter,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yes, yes. Princess! Can you tell us about the man you kissed?"
147554,567,229,1109000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I'll field that. Yesterday, a local man may or may not have given a tour to a certain princess, who, uh, one assumes, turned all his thoughts of revenge to love and then love to respect."
147555,567,230,1123000,KEMI,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"And yesterday, a certain Princess may or may not have seen much of your world with a certain man, and she certainly might be eternally grateful."
147556,567,231,1132000,Reporter,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, this is vague stuff. Vague stuff!"
147558,567,233,1138000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I did not think this through.
147559,567,234,1142000,KEMI,Moe's Tavern,"Moe, before I left, I just wanted to give you these examples of our most beloved, albeit depressing, literature."
147560,567,235,1150000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, some nice bedtime readin'."
147561,567,236,1152000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Fun premise.
147562,567,237,1154000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,I'm laughing already.
147563,567,238,1156000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Really not cheerin' me up here, but uh, let me offer you the only literature in this bar. Sure works for me though."
147564,567,239,1163000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,This coaster.
147565,567,240,1165000,KEMI,Moe's Tavern,I will treasure it.
147566,567,241,1172000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I guess you'll pine forever for a man who doesn't care, while I just grow old here in this bar."
147567,567,242,1179000,Waylon Smithers,Moe's Tavern,Here's to suffering in silence.
147569,567,244,1189000,Waylon Smithers,Moe's Tavern,Can't wait to see those numbers hanging from my rafters.
147571,567,246,1195000,AGED MOE,Moe's Tavern,"I can't believe it's been three years since Smithers left. Man, have I been aging badly. But I guess I can finally wash this forehead."
147572,567,247,1205000,AGED MOE,Moe's Tavern,Divine.
147574,567,249,1214000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Oh God, what do you want?"
147575,567,250,1216000,RICHARD BRANSON,Burns Manor,"Well, neighbor, now that your streak of rum luck is at its end, I have a favor to ask."
147576,567,251,1221000,RICHARD BRANSON,Burns Manor,It involves charity.
147577,567,252,1224000,RICHARD BRANSON,Burns Manor,"I've set up the Virgin Earth Challenge, a twenty-five million dollar prize to eliminate greenhouse gasses, that I was hoping you would add to..."
147579,567,253,1233000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,Where are the hounds when I need them?
147580,567,254,1235000,RICHARD BRANSON,Burns Manor,They're on a free Virgin Galactic flight around the world.
147581,567,255,1235000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns Manor,"Can you go five blasted minutes without saying the word ""virgin?"""
147582,567,256,1235000,RICHARD BRANSON,Burns Manor,That's another Virgin Challenge. That I will not be Virgin taking. Virgin.
