60900,247,2,93000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"This globe will never spin again. Now, class, I want you to be creative with your video projects. I don't want to see thirty ""Blair Witch"" knock-offs."

60906,247,8,118000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,What will we find? Boogers... or Nazi gold?
60907,247,9,121000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,"Bart, quit it!"
60908,247,10,122000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,No way.
60909,247,11,124000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,Bart sleeps with Raggedy Andy.
60910,247,12,125000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,Cut! Cut! Cut!
60911,247,13,128000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Otto, a red traffic light means what?"
60912,247,14,132000,Otto Mann,School Bus,No time for brain teasers. Today's the day I ask my girlfriend to take a ride on the matrimony pony.
60913,247,15,138000,Milhouse Van Houten,School Bus,Otto's got a girlfriend! Otto's got a girlfriend!
60914,247,16,141000,Otto Mann,School Bus,"That's right, I do."
60915,247,17,142000,Milhouse Van Houten,School Bus,Uh... I know you do. Baby.
60916,247,18,146000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Otto, since when have you had a girlfriend?"
60917,247,19,149000,Otto Mann,School Bus,We met in the summer of love...Woodstock '99.
60918,247,20,158000,Otto Mann,School Bus,Quick! I need some water!
60919,247,21,161000,Clerk,School Bus,Eight dollars.
60920,247,22,162000,Otto Mann,School Bus,Huh. Not in this lifetime!
60922,247,24,182000,Otto Mann,Der Krazy Kraut,"Okay, this is it."
60923,247,25,188000,Becky,Der Krazy Kraut,Otto?
60924,247,26,190000,Bret Michaels,Der Krazy Kraut,"EVERY ROSE HAS ITS THORN / JUST LIKE EVERY COWBOY SINGS A SAD, SAD SONG..."
60925,247,27,201000,Otto Mann,Der Krazy Kraut,"Becky, you're my rose. Will you let me be your thorn?"
60926,247,28,206000,Becky,Der Krazy Kraut,"Oh, Otto. Of course my answer is..."
60927,247,29,210000,Otto Mann,Der Krazy Kraut,"Ooh, wait, wait, wait, wait. This solo is kick-ass."
60928,247,30,216000,Becky,Der Krazy Kraut,"Honey, could you turn it down?"
60929,247,31,218000,Otto Mann,Der Krazy Kraut,"Okay, but this better be worth it."

60931,247,33,222000,Otto Mann,Der Krazy Kraut,Cool.
60934,247,36,231000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, look, we're invited to Otto's wedding!"
60935,247,37,235000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, and such delicate tissue paper. Zig-Zag!?"
60936,247,38,240000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
60937,247,39,242000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No knife games on the kitchen table!
60938,247,40,245000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I didn't hit your precious table.
60939,247,41,247000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooh, we're ""cordially"" invited... this Saturday... to join Otto and Becky at... 742 Evergreen Terrace? That's our address!"
60940,247,42,257000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I told Otto he could have the wedding here. Hope that's okay.
60941,247,43,261000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"You should have asked first, Bart. Weddings are hard work and cost thousands of dollars."
60942,247,44,266000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, it'll be easy. You've still got most of the stuff from Apu's wedding back there."
60943,247,45,274000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"All right, Otto can get married here. But Homer, you have to get rid of that elephant."
60945,247,47,284000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Let's see. Candles, flowers, place cards, rice..."
60947,247,48,288000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, Mom, you're not supposed to throw rice anymore. Birds eat it, their stomachs swell and they explode."
60948,247,49,294000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Why am I just learning this now?
60950,247,51,299000,The Admiral,Backyard,"Son, your mother and I don't approve of this marriage, as we have not approved of any part of your life to date."
60951,247,52,306000,Otto Mann,Backyard,"Well, the important thing is you came."
60952,247,53,308000,The Admiral,Backyard,We're leaving.
60953,247,54,309000,Otto Mann,Backyard,Drive safe!
60954,247,55,311000,Selma Bouvier,Backyard,"Always a bridesmaid, only occasionally a bride."
60955,247,56,316000,Patty Bouvier,Backyard,"Lisa, it's time you learned the truth about men."
60956,247,57,319000,Lisa Simpson,Backyard,They're pigs?
60957,247,58,320000,Patty Bouvier,Backyard,The bitterness is strong in this one.
60958,247,59,325000,Bart Simpson,Backyard,"So, any words for the bride and groom?"
60959,247,60,327000,Seymour Skinner,Backyard,"Not now, Bart. I'm trying to urinate."
60960,247,61,330000,Bart Simpson,Backyard,You don't seem to be trying very hard.
60961,247,62,336000,Lisa Simpson,Backyard,"Dad, the bride and groom are supposed to cut the wedding cake!"
60962,247,63,340000,Homer Simpson,Backyard,"Oh, that's just superstition."
60963,247,64,343000,Lisa Simpson,Backyard,Thank you.
60965,247,66,365000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Oh, Becky, you look beautiful. I thought you might want to see this bridal magazine. It's got nine hundred tips for the perfect marriage. All ""don'ts."""
60966,247,67,374000,Becky,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Oh, we'll be fine. Otto's got a clean police record, and he doesn't do any needle drugs..."
60967,247,68,380000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Well, the real key, according to sexperts, is mutual interests."
60968,247,69,384000,Becky,Simpson Master Bedroom,No prob. We like all the same things. Except...
60969,247,70,388000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,Mm-hmm?
60970,247,71,390000,Becky,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Don't tell Otto, but I'm not into heavy metal and he loves it. He refers to our lovemaking as the headbanger's ball."
60971,247,72,397000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Oh, you can fix little defects like that with gentle nagging. Make it part of the background noise of your relationship. That's how I polished Homer into the perfect... Homer! No, that's ice!"
60974,247,75,415000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Backyard,"Uh, now... as for the matter of my honorarium..."
60975,247,76,417000,Otto Mann,Simpson Backyard,Wha?
60976,247,77,418000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Backyard,"You know, my emolument..."
60946,247,78,420000,Otto Mann,Simpson Backyard,Huh?
60977,247,79,421000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Simpson Backyard,Pay me. Three hundred dollars.
60978,247,80,422000,Otto Mann,Simpson Backyard,Three hundred? I could've gotten Rick Dees for that.
60979,247,81,424000,Lead Singer,Simpson Backyard,OOOOH. YOW! WHOOO!... YEAH!...
60980,247,82,441000,Becky,Simpson Backyard,You got Poison to play at our wedding?
60981,247,83,443000,Lead Singer,Simpson Backyard,"We're Cyanide, a loving tribute to Poison!"
60982,247,84,445000,Drummer,Simpson Backyard,We need a ride home!
60983,247,85,447000,Becky,Simpson Backyard,You expect me to walk down the aisle to a monster ballad?!
60984,247,86,451000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,Let me talk to Otto.
60985,247,87,453000,Becky,Simpson Backyard,"Oh, that's okay. I guess this is sort of our song."
60986,247,88,458000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Backyard,"Well, it doesn't have to be. Otto's just going to have to decide what's more important, his heavy metal or you."
60988,247,90,472000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,"Becky, what have I done here? I'm so sorry."
60989,247,91,476000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Front Yard,"In about fifteen minutes I'd take off that wedding dress, or you're gonna look crazy."
60991,247,93,489000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Moe, can I give you some shrimp for the road?"
60992,247,94,491000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Nah, I'll just take the ring pillow and these uhhh... seven presents I brung. Eh, you know what? Cram some shrimp in, too. Head to tail. That way you can fit more."
60993,247,95,505000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,How 'bout some sauce?
60994,247,96,507000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,Thanks.
60995,247,97,509000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Becky, I know you must feel awful. But at least this didn't happen after you were married."
60996,247,98,513000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yes, better now than when you're too old and fat to get another man."
60997,247,99,519000,Becky,Simpson Home,I feel so alone. What am I going to do?
60998,247,100,522000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, why don't you stay with us?"
60999,247,101,524000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house?"
61000,247,102,528000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Remember that talk we had about you not wrecking people's weddings?
61002,247,104,533000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It's settled. The stranger stays with us!
61003,247,105,538000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,CH-CH-CH-CHANGES / TIME TO CHANGE THE OIL / YEAH / CHANGES / DON'T WANNA BE AN OILY MAN /
61004,247,106,547000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"A man innocently changes his oil, when... a two-ton car comes crashing down!"
61005,247,107,555000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Crashing down!
61006,247,108,559000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Who'd have thought you could hold up a car with a wicker basket?
61007,247,109,565000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now, Lisa's going through this phase where she doesn't eat any meat. So I usually sneak a little meat juice into her vegetables."
61008,247,110,571000,Becky,Simpson Home,"Wow, you're a real-life Martha Stewart. I mean, without the evil."
61009,247,111,576000,Becky,Simpson Home,May I? Mmm. Yummers.
61010,247,112,580000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Nobody's ever called my gravy yummers before!
61011,247,113,583000,Becky,Simpson Home,Mm. You know what'd be really nuts? A little rosemary.
61012,247,114,587000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, ooo, I've always wanted to use rosemary in something."
61013,247,115,592000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, this gravy tastes better than God's sweat."
61014,247,116,597000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Thanks to our own spice girl: Becky.
61015,247,117,601000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, Mom, you really brought out the mung in these beans."
61016,247,118,605000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Actually, that was Becky, too."
61017,247,119,607000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What are these things in the mashed potatoes?
61018,247,120,609000,Becky,Simpson Home,That's the skins. I left them on.
61019,247,121,611000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, nobody's perfect. Let me just pick those out."
61020,247,122,614000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No! Oh, Becky, your potatoes are the best I've ever had."
61021,247,123,618000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, God."
61023,247,125,626000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Stop kicking my baby!
61024,247,126,627000,Becky,Simpson Home,"Ah, it's cool. We're just putting some Jackie Chan moves into Bart's video project."
61025,247,127,631000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, Mom. I need something great. Milhouse has footage of himself falling down the stairs."
61026,247,128,636000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, no kicking. It's too dangerous."
61027,247,129,639000,Becky,Simpson Home,"Marge, chill out! I have great control. See?"
61028,247,130,644000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's very impressive, but I still don't... stop that!"
61032,247,134,654000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Hello. HEL-LOOO.
61033,247,135,658000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"We're jamming, Mom. She's painting my music, and I'm playing to her painting."
61034,247,136,664000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Isn't it wonderful to have a hip female influence in the house?
61035,247,137,667000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Yes. Well, I guess I'll go roll socks. It's not ""hip,"" but it has to be done."
61038,247,138,673000,Becky,Lisa's Bedroom,"Actually, you could just tie them at the ends. That way, the elastic doesn't wear out."
61039,247,139,677000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Yes, I hate when things get worn out... hmm... socks... welcomes..."
61041,247,141,687000,Marge Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"...she's so helpful and everyone loves her and, well, this may sound crazy, but I think my family likes Becky more than me."
61042,247,142,697000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,I wouldn't worry about that.
61043,247,143,699000,Marge Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Really?
61044,247,144,700000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Yeah. You're going to be dead in a week anyway.
61045,247,145,702000,Marge Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Dead in a week? What are you talking about?
61046,247,146,705000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Look honey, never let an attractive woman into your house. All they ever do is usurp your family and then kill you."
61047,247,147,711000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Like that documentary, ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle."""
61048,247,148,714000,Marge Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,That was a movie.
61049,247,149,715000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Look, all we know is she's going to shoot you or stab you or boil you..."
61050,247,150,720000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Or club you with an antique wooden doll.
61051,247,151,722000,Selma Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was a good one."
61052,247,152,725000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"Oh, but first she's going seduce your husband."
61053,247,153,727000,Marge Simpson,Patty and Selma's Apartment,Becky's going to seduce Homer?
61054,247,154,731000,Patty Bouvier,Patty and Selma's Apartment,"It's an act of violence, not love."
61056,247,156,747000,Becky,Marge's Bedroom,"Oh, I'm sorry, did I wake you? I wanted to return your hairdryer."
61057,247,157,754000,Becky,Marge's Bedroom,"Oh, and here's your brush."
61059,247,159,757000,Becky,Simpson Home,"You just enjoy your grocery shopping, Marge. And if you pick up some semolina, I can make couscous for Lisa."
61060,247,160,763000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's my favorite!
61061,247,161,765000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,It is?
61062,247,162,766000,Becky,Simpson Home,"Oh, yeah. You can learn a lot from your kids if you just listen to them."
61064,247,164,774000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Be right back.
61065,247,165,777000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Take your time!
61067,247,167,783000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,"Why do I always think of the perfect thing to say when it's too late: ""Shut up, Becky!"" Ooh, that would've been sweet."
61068,247,168,794000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,"Oh, no. The ""Brakes Cut"" light."
61037,247,170,801000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,It's red!
60621,247,171,808000,Workmen,Springfield,Tough glass.
61069,247,172,811000,Tourist,Springfield,I still say ours is bigger.
61070,247,173,816000,Tourist,Springfield,"Our speed bumps are stronger, too."
61072,247,175,819000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"I don't know, Simpson. How do I know you didn't cut your own brakes?"
61073,247,176,822000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Why would I do that?
61074,247,177,824000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,I don't know. Get some attention from a handsome police officer.
61075,247,178,828000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,That's crazy.
61076,247,179,830000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,"Look, I know I don't have any proof, but this woman is trying to kill me!"
61077,247,180,835000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,Fine. Let me tell you what I tell everybody who comes in here: the law is powerless to help you.
61078,247,181,841000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Police Station,Do I have to be dead before you'll help me?
61079,247,182,843000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Well, not dead, dying. No, no, no, no. Don't walk away. Wait. How 'bout this: just show me the knife. In your back. Not too deep, but, uh, it should be able to stand by itself."
61081,247,184,855000,Lisa Simpson,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"C'mon, Becky. Tell us your big news."
61082,247,185,857000,Becky,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Well, I wanted to wait for your mother, but okay. I found an apartment, and I'm movin' out."
61083,247,186,861000,Lisa Simpson,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Awww. / Oh, no."
61084,247,187,863000,Homer Simpson,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Becky, I think I speak for all of us when I say ""When's the ice cream gonna get here?"""
61085,247,188,870000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"And God said, gather ye two of every flavor, anoint them with 62 sauces, whipped cream and nuts, and ye shall call it, ""The Ark."""
61087,247,190,888000,Becky,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,Homer!
61088,247,191,889000,Bart Simpson,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Relax, he's gorging."
61089,247,192,892000,Bart Simpson,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Okay, maybe not."
61090,247,193,894000,Becky,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,We've gotta save him!
61092,247,195,902000,Marge Simpson,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,Usurper! Usurper! Usurper!
61093,247,196,906000,Marge Simpson,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Don't mess with me, I've got jimmies!"
61094,247,197,910000,Employee,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,Aagh! I can only see a horrible rainbow!
61096,247,199,916000,Marge Simpson,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Shut up, Becky! There. I finally said it."
61098,247,200,928000,Chief Wiggum,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Drop the cone, Sugar."
61099,247,201,932000,Lou,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,Whoopsie.
61100,247,202,933000,Chief Wiggum,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,"Take her away, boys."
61101,247,203,937000,Marge Simpson,Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor,I thought you said the law was powerless.
