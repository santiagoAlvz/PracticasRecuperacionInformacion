109596,422,17,169000,Barney Gumble,SPRINGFIELD FREEWAY,"I'll clean you up good, giant beer can!"
109598,422,19,179000,Nelson Muntz,SPRINGFIELD FREEWAY,Where's Simpson?
109599,422,20,181000,Milhouse Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD FREEWAY,"Well I couldn't get a hold of him. No cell phone. But if I know Bart, he's busy doing something awesome."
109164,422,22,189000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't know why I agreed to this.
109601,422,23,191000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Because you love the taste of my imaginary tea.
109602,422,24,195000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're right!
109603,422,25,198000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Simpson Home,"Hey Spaz, while you were here spazzing yourself, you totally missed out."
109604,422,26,202000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Missed out? I didn't miss out. What'd I miss out on?
109605,422,27,212000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I wish I had a cell phone.
109606,422,28,214000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Here's an imaginary cell phone.
109607,422,29,216000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"What, do you think I'm crazy?"
109608,422,30,221000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, even Milhouse has a cell phone! Your son is lamer than Milhouse! What does that say about you?!"
109609,422,31,227000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sweetie, we can't afford to get you a cell phone. As it is, I'm buying frozen peas on installments."
109612,422,34,243000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm never gonna get a cell phone.
109613,422,35,245000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"And I'm never gonna go to Machu Picchu. In this family, you get used to disappointments."
109615,422,37,252000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,How am I ever gonna get a cell phone?
109617,422,39,268000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Is this your ball?
109618,422,40,269000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield Glen Country Club,Why yes it is.
109619,422,41,272000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield Glen Country Club,Here you go.
109620,422,42,273000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Don't tell me where I go. A dollar? What for?
109621,422,43,277000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield Glen Country Club,It's the least I can do -- these balls cost five dollars new.
109622,422,44,281000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"So I can get a dollar for every ball I find?! Then if a cell phone costs one hundred dollars, how many balls do I need?"
109623,422,45,287000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield Glen Country Club,This is why my kids go to private school.
109624,422,46,311000,The Rich Texan,Springfield Glen Country Club,Yee-haw!
109625,422,47,312000,The Rich Texan,Springfield Glen Country Club,"I'll fix you, ya varmint!"
109626,422,48,320000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Wow, I'm just twenty balls away from a cell phone!"
109627,422,49,322000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Glen Country Club,So it's you! You're the one who's been poachin' on me territory.
109628,422,50,327000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Groundskeeper Willie?
109629,422,51,328000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Weekends and summers, I'm Greenskeeper Willie. Your ball-scavengin' days are over! And those orphan golf balls belong to me!"
109631,422,52,336000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Glen Country Club,Dimpled gold! I'm rich! Now I won't have to pleasure a country-club wife to get me steak dinner.
109632,422,53,347000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,I'm never gonna get a cell phone!
109633,422,54,353000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Oh great, we've got to wait for Denis Leary! Hey Leary, if you want to have a tea party, go back to Boston!"
109635,422,56,363000,Rainier Wolfcastle,Springfield Glen Country Club,Boston.
109636,422,57,365000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Glen Country Club,"Come on, Ice Age -- take the shot!"
109637,422,58,368000,Denis Leary,Springfield Glen Country Club,"""Ice Age"" was the name of the film -- I played Diego, the vicious saber-toothed tiger, who, guess what, has a heart. Now shut up. Or I'll have you all kicked out of show business."
109639,422,60,379000,Denis Leary,Springfield Glen Country Club,Dammit!
109640,422,61,383000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,Huh? A cell phone!
109641,422,62,386000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Glen Country Club,It's mine! Cool! And you can even watch commercials on it.
109643,422,64,399000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"Hey Milhouse, guess where I'm calling from?"
109645,422,66,401000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Well, I know you don't have a cell phone, so you must be in your kitchen or one of your bedrooms. Unless you have a wall jack in your basement -- that would be huge."
109646,422,67,411000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,Look outside your window.
109647,422,68,412000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,I'm not supposed to look out the window when I'm alone.
109648,422,69,415000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,Just do it!
109649,422,70,418000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Cell phone!
109650,422,71,420000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Let's assign each other ringtones!
109651,422,72,425000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,That felt good.
109652,422,73,427000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,"Hello?... you want Denis Leary? Wrong number, dumbass."
109653,422,74,432000,Brian Grazer,Van Houten Home,"Come on Denis, it's me, producer Brian Grazer. I just paid five million dollars for the screen rights to the book ""Everybody Poops."""
109654,422,75,438000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,I'm a big fan.
109655,422,76,440000,Brian Grazer,Van Houten Home,Only one face came to mind for the constipated gorilla -- yours.
109656,422,77,444000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,Sure -- on one condition. I wanna do my own poops.
109657,422,78,448000,Brian Grazer,Van Houten Home,I wouldn't have it any other way.
109658,422,79,449000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,Of course I'll do it for minimum. Great. I'll see you next Monday in Tunisia.
109630,422,80,454000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,This phone belongs to Denis Leary!
109660,422,81,457000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Dennis Leary? Boston comedian turned movie star turned basic cable notable?
109661,422,82,462000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,That's right! Let's call his business manager and tell him to spend all his money on Yankees hats and Derek Jeter jerseys.
109662,422,83,468000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"I don't know, Bart. What if Denis Leary gets mad?"
109663,422,84,472000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,"Naw, he's cool. He's gonna think this is hilarious."
109665,422,86,480000,Denis Leary,Tunisian Desert,No longer must we live in shame! Let the decree go forth -- everybody poops!
109666,422,87,487000,Director,Tunisian Desert,"And... cut! Great, great, man -- you really nailed it!"
109667,422,88,492000,Denis Leary,Tunisian Desert,I don't even remember agreeing to be in this movie.
109668,422,89,494000,Director,Tunisian Desert,"Well, you did. Bring in the poop!"
109670,422,91,501000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Milhouse, I hold in this hand Denis Leary's cell phone. And in this hand, the phone numbers of bars around the world. Let's start with Hawaii."
109672,422,93,510000,Hawaiian Bartender,HAWAIIAN BAR,Aloha!
109674,422,95,512000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Aloha to you! I'm looking for Maya. Last name Normousbutt.
109676,422,97,516000,Hawaiian Bartender,HAWAIIAN BAR,"Hang on, I'll check. Has anyone here seen Maya Normousbutt?"
109681,422,102,529000,Australian Bartender,Australian Bar,"I got a ""Drew P. Wiener"" here. Anyone expecting a Drew P. Wiener? I hold in my hand a Drew P. Wiener."
109682,422,103,536000,Australian Barfly,Australian Bar,"Better put it down then, mate."
109686,422,107,546000,Swedish Bartender,Inga-Bar Beerman's,Ja? I shall inquire. Is there a Mr. Myfriendsaregay? First name Olaf? Attention everyone! Olaf Myfriendsaregay!
109688,422,109,562000,Swedish Bartender,Inga-Bar Beerman's,Wait a minute. If I ever get a hold of you...
109689,422,110,565000,Swedish Bartender,Inga-Bar Beerman's,I will thank you for showing me the futility of human endeavor.
109691,422,112,572000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,The sun never sets on the Bartish Empire.
109659,422,113,576000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Yo. Who's this?
109692,422,114,577000,Denis Leary,Bart's Bedroom,"Denis Leary, you little puke! I'm gonna rip out your heart with two fingers! They taught me how to do it for my show!"
109693,422,115,582000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Which one, the one that got canceled or the one that's gonna get canceled?"
109694,422,116,585000,Denis Leary,Bart's Bedroom,You are so dead!
109696,422,118,588000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,That laughter sounds like the result of misbehavior. Bart! How did you get a cell phone?
109697,422,119,594000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Same way you got me: by accident, on a golf course."
109698,422,120,596000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Whose phone is this?
109699,422,121,598000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,You'll never get it out of me.
109700,422,122,600000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Okay. Milhouse?
109701,422,123,601000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart's Bedroom,"It's Denis Leary's! I'm sorry, Bart -- I'm desperate for any signs of adult approval."
109702,422,124,607000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,You did the right thing.
109704,422,126,612000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Bart Simpson's stolen cell phone -- can I help you?
109705,422,127,616000,Denis Leary,Bart's Bedroom,"Damn straight you can! I'm Denis Leary, and your kid is out of control!"
109706,422,128,619000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"I'm sorry, Mr. Leary. Sometimes it's hard to be a parent."
109707,422,129,624000,Denis Leary,Bart's Bedroom,"No it's not, it's easy! I'll tell you what's hard -- having to watch my stunt double run into a burning building! Worrying that people might realize it's not me, it's him. Try doing that!"
109708,422,130,632000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"I don't think I could. Mr. Leary, I'm so sorry. I'll send you your phone back right away."
109709,422,131,638000,Denis Leary,Bart's Bedroom,"Keep the phone. In fact, can I give you some advice?"
109710,422,132,640000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Of course, you're Denis Leary!"
109711,422,133,642000,Denis Leary,Bart's Bedroom,"Give your kid back the phone... but first, activate its built-in G.P.S. system. That way you can log on to your carrier's website, and track your son's movements, the way I track every actor who gets a movie that I was up for."
109712,422,134,653000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Shouldn't you just be happy for their success?
109713,422,135,655000,Denis Leary,Bart's Bedroom,"I should be a lot of things, lady."
109714,422,136,659000,Denis Leary,Bart's Bedroom,My Tarts!
109716,422,138,672000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, here goes. Bart, I have something for you!"
109717,422,139,680000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Wait a minute. I thought you said I couldn't have this.
109719,422,140,683000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, sweetie... I know I said you couldn't have a cell phone, but, in these days of stranger dangers and sinister ministers, I think it's important that we're in touch."
109720,422,141,693000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lady, you are the best Mom ever!"
109721,422,142,701000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Did he take the bait?
109722,422,143,703000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Like a big-mouthed bass.
109724,422,145,708000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, Bart went to the comic book store."
109725,422,146,712000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bullies!
109726,422,147,715000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, he went into a construction site!"
109727,422,148,717000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's a hard hat zone!
109729,422,150,721000,Milhouse Van Houten,Construction Site,You sure this is safe?
109730,422,151,723000,Bart Simpson,Construction Site,"Sure, I got my seatbelt on."
109731,422,152,725000,Marge Simpson,Construction Site,Bartholomew J. Simpson!
109732,422,153,728000,Marge Simpson,Construction Site,What are you doing at this construction site?!
109733,422,154,731000,Bart Simpson,Construction Site,"Uh, trying to do something constructive?"
109734,422,155,735000,Bart Simpson,Construction Site,I'll just take Milhouse home.
109737,422,158,777000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart just keeps spinning around and around and around. What's his angle?
109738,422,159,788000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you two doing in the laundry room?
109739,422,160,791000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We're doing laundry.
109740,422,161,794000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, do laundry."
109741,422,162,797000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,No problem.
109742,422,163,810000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Tracking software? You're spying on Bart!
109743,422,164,816000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Honey, keeping track of someone because you love them is not wrong."
109745,422,166,820000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,It shows you care.
109746,422,167,823000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"That's right, my beautiful, beautiful Midge -- Soon you'll be mine."
109748,422,169,828000,Moe Szyslak,FBI OFFICE,Soon you'll be mine.
109749,422,170,830000,Fbi Agent,FBI OFFICE,"Keep talking, creep-o."
109750,422,171,832000,Fbi Agent #2,FBI OFFICE,Every word buys you another year in the slammer.
109752,422,173,841000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Bart! There's something I need to tell you! Mom and Dad have been--
109753,422,174,845000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Shhh! I'm listening to financing terms for double-glazed windows.
109718,422,175,849000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Awesome, another call."
109754,422,176,850000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,You got Bart!
109755,422,177,851000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"It's me, you idiot."
109756,422,178,853000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Mom and Dad are spying on you. There's a tracking chip in your cell phone!
109757,422,179,857000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,They're spying on me?! That's horrible!
109758,422,180,860000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I know! It's a complete violation of your rights. Not to mention--
109759,422,181,864000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Hold that thought. I'm getting a text.
109760,422,182,865000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Viagra at five dollars a pill? Whatever it is, it's goin' in Skinner's coffee."
109762,422,184,871000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,What is in this coffee?!
109763,422,185,887000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Track this, Mom and Dad."
109765,422,187,892000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Look at Bart go! He must be running away!
109766,422,188,896000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Eh, he won't get far. Not on the crappy breakfast I made for him."
109767,422,189,900000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh my God, he's out of frame! Zoom out! Zoom out!"
109768,422,190,907000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He's circling the Shelbyville Bird Sanctuary.
109769,422,191,910000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Our little boy has lost his mind. Let's get him.
109770,422,192,921000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Looks like I've got the house to myself for a while.
109772,422,194,924000,Bart Simpson,House,"I can do anything I want! First I'm gonna take a bath, then I'm gonna eat some vegetables, and then I'm gonna get to bed nice and early with no TV."
109774,422,196,943000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,So your family's been gone for three days?
109775,422,197,946000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah. And I think they may be gone a while longer. Ooh, it looks like the grilled Twizzlers are ready."
109776,422,198,952000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mmm, oh yeah, this baby is done."
109777,422,199,961000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Home,Awesome. But I better get goin'. It's gettin' dark. My Mom's gonna wake up soon. She gets upset if someone's not there to tell her where she is. Typical mom.
109778,422,200,973000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You sure you don't wanna stay and have a sleepover? I made sleepover shirts.
109779,422,201,978000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Listen Bart, if I don't get home soon, there won't be time for my mom to give me a hug, my dad to read me a story, and both of them to sing me a song till I gently fall asleep."
109780,422,202,989000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Anyway, you have fun by yourself. Huh, there's no moon tonight. Real boogeyman weather."
109783,422,205,1005000,Marge Simpson,Freeway,Bart's been moving nonstop all afternoon. Maybe there's too much sugar in his Sugar-Frosted Candy O's.
109784,422,206,1011000,Lisa Simpson,Freeway,Something about this just doesn't seem right.
109785,422,207,1014000,Marge Simpson,Freeway,Pull over -- Bart's in this field!
109786,422,208,1018000,Homer Simpson,Freeway,"Bart! Where are you, boy?! Don't worry, I won't strangle you."
109788,422,210,1035000,Lisa Simpson,Freeway,"I think we're following you. What's your species, little guy?"
109789,422,211,1041000,Lisa Simpson,Freeway,"Ooh, you're a scarlet tanager. You've been flying south, because you're migrating to... Machu Picchu, Peru!"
109790,422,212,1047000,Lisa Simpson,Freeway,"Well, I could tell Mom and Dad the chip is in the bird and hope they take me to Machu Picchu another time, or..."
109791,422,213,1055000,Lisa Simpson,Freeway,Mom! Dad! Bart's on the move!
109793,422,215,1061000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh man... when you're alone, night is scary."
109794,422,216,1065000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Day is awesome!
109795,422,217,1068000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Night is scary.
109796,422,218,1069000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Day is awesome!
109797,422,219,1074000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Night is scary...
109800,422,222,1080000,Marge Simpson,Machu Picchu,Are we ever going to find him?
109801,422,223,1082000,Homer Simpson,Machu Picchu,"Absolutely -- that unpleasantness in Ecuador is behind us, my coca leaf addiction is under control , and Bart is finally trapped in that paradise above the clouds."
109802,422,224,1098000,Marge Simpson,Machu Picchu,"Bart! Where are you, Bart?"
109803,422,225,1101000,Homer Simpson,Machu Picchu,"Is that him? No, it's just a bush. Clearly the work of Wirakocha, the trickster god."
109804,422,226,1111000,Lisa Simpson,Machu Picchu,You guys look exhausted. Maybe you oughta rest for a while.
109805,422,227,1114000,Marge Simpson,Machu Picchu,No. All I care about is finding my boy. And then I'm never letting him out of my sight again...
109806,422,228,1130000,Warrior Statue,Machu Picchu,"Greetings, sky-haired sun mother."
109807,422,229,1132000,Warrior Statue,Machu Picchu,"Um, I don't need any new friends, I'm just looking for my little boy. I need to protect him from himself."
