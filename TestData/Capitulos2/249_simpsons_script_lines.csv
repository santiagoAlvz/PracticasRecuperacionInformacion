61423,249,2,65000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't like you ogling her.
61424,249,3,67000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Why don't you read ""Cathy""? She's hilarious."
61425,249,4,70000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Eh, too much baggage. Oo, my horoscope. Taurus: ""Today you will die."""
61426,249,5,73000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What?!
61427,249,6,78000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"""... and you may get a compliment from an attractive co-worker!"" Lenny?"
61428,249,7,82000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"It really says ""die""? That sounds unusually specific for a horoscope."
61429,249,8,86000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maybe I'd better check mine. ""Today, your husband will die."" Homer, I'm scared."
61430,249,9,94000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ooo, scary newspaper. Don't hurt me, horoscope. I'm afraid of..."
61431,249,10,97000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ow! Oooh! Paper cut, paper cut!"

61438,249,18,129000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That is one handsome rattlesnake you got bitin' your arm there.
61439,249,19,132000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Yeah, it's quite fetching, but, uh, aren't you worried about the deadliness?"
61440,249,20,135000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Nah, he'll get tired of biting in an hour or so. Snakes: nature's quitters."
61442,249,22,142000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That horoscope was baloney. Nothing happened except for the pick ax in my head, the rattlesnake bite and the testicle thing. What's for dessert?"
61443,249,23,149000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No dessert until you eat your broccoli.
61444,249,24,151000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Fine.
61445,249,25,160000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,Hmm. Another broccoli-related death.
61446,249,26,163000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,But I thought broccoli was--
61447,249,27,165000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Simpson Home,"--Oh yes, one of the deadliest plants on Earth. Why, it tries to warn you itself with its terrible taste."
61448,249,28,171000,Paramedic,Simpson Home,Sure is easy when they're stiff like this. And very sad.
61449,249,29,183000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"St. Peter! Woo hoo! Got to heaven before you, Flanders!"
61450,249,30,191000,St. Peter,Simpson Home,"I wouldn't celebrate so soon, Mr. Simpson. I don't see a single good deed next to your name."
61451,249,31,197000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, the thing about that is..."
61453,249,33,204000,St. Peter,Simpson Home,"Homer, settle down. I'll give you a chance to get into Heaven. You have twenty-four hours to go back and do one good deed."
61454,249,34,212000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, I didn't get the number of hours or good deeds."
61456,249,36,219000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Poor Homie. I still can't believe a piece of broccoli killed you.
61457,249,37,223000,Ghost Homer,Simpson Home,What the hell was I thinking?
61459,249,39,234000,Ghost Homer,HEAVEN,I tried the broccoli again.
61460,249,40,235000,St. Peter,HEAVEN,You have twenty-three hours left.
61462,249,42,244000,Ghost Homer,Simpson Home,Maaarge Siiimpson.
61463,249,43,246000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer, it's you!! I thought I'd never see you again."
61464,249,44,250000,Ghost Homer,Simpson Home,You were wrong... dead wrong.
61465,249,45,253000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Do you have to talk like that?
61466,249,46,255000,Ghost Homer,Simpson Home,"No, not really. Marge, you gotta help me. I have to do one good deed to get into heaven."
61468,249,47,260000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I've got a whole list of chores: clean the garage, paint the house, grout the tu--"
61469,249,48,262000,Ghost Homer,Simpson Home,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm just trying to get in. I'm not running for Jesus."

61475,249,54,283000,Agnes Skinner,Street,What's happening to me? People can see up my bustle!
61476,249,55,287000,Ghost Homer,Street,"Hey, stop squirming!"

61525,249,103,443000,Marge Simpson,SIMPSON PUMPKIN HOUSE,"What?! Oh, why are the oafs always the first to go?"

61530,249,108,457000,Homer Simpson,SIMPSON PUMPKIN HOUSE,"Oh, I'm no dunce. I was born an oaf, and I'll die an oaf."
61531,249,109,463000,Marge Simpson,SIMPSON PUMPKIN HOUSE,"But Husband, without your weekly pittance, how shall we feed our children?"
61532,249,110,467000,Homer Simpson,SIMPSON PUMPKIN HOUSE,Don't worry. No child will ever starve in my home.
61534,249,112,471000,Homer Simpson,EDGE OF FOREST,"So long, kids. Enjoy your new home! Say hi to your other brother and sister."

61551,249,129,548000,Lisa Simpson,COTTAGE,I wonder where Goldilocks was.
61552,249,130,552000,Goldilocks,COTTAGE,"Oh, that bed was just right."
61553,249,131,558000,Goldilocks,COTTAGE,"Oh, no!"
61555,249,133,568000,Homer Simpson,SIMPSON PUMPKIN HOUSE,"Boy, dumping your kids in the forest sure gets your hands dusty."
61556,249,134,573000,Marge Simpson,SIMPSON PUMPKIN HOUSE,What?! You threw our precious babies into the woods?! We could have sold them!
61557,249,135,579000,Marge Simpson,SIMPSON PUMPKIN HOUSE,Go back and get them!

61665,249,244,1107000,Snorky,Springfield Town Hall,"I'm sorry, let me start over. Eons ago, dolphins lived on the land."
61667,249,246,1113000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,What'd he say?
61668,249,247,1114000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Town Hall,He said dolphins used to live on the land.
61669,249,248,1116000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,Whaaaa?!
61670,249,249,1117000,Snorky,Springfield Town Hall,"Then your ancestors drove us into the sea, where we've suffered for millions of years."
61671,249,250,1123000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,But you seemed so happy in the ocean. All that playful leaping.
61672,249,251,1127000,Snorky,Springfield Town Hall,"We were trying to get out! It's cold, it's wet. Every morning I wake up phlegmy."
61673,249,252,1131000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Plus all that sewage we keep dumping.
61674,249,253,1133000,Snorky,Springfield Town Hall,That was you?!
61675,249,254,1134000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"It was her, all right. Take the one who wronged you."
61676,249,255,1137000,Snorky,Springfield Town Hall,"I, King Snorky, hereby banish all humans to the sea!"
61678,249,257,1143000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Town Hall,Yeah!
61679,249,258,1146000,Townspeople,Springfield Town Hall,Pushy Dolphins. / I don't like 'em.
61680,249,259,1149000,Moe Szyslak,Springfield Town Hall,"I, I, I tuned out. Where we goin'?"
61681,249,260,1151000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,"Wait, stop! We can outsmart those dolphins! Don't forget, we invented computers, leg warmers, bendy straws, peel n' eat shrimp, the glory hole, and the pudding cup. I'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping tuna-munchers push me around!"
61682,249,261,1166000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Hall,Uh-oh.
61684,249,263,1179000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Geez, so many dolphins..."
61685,249,264,1196000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Oh, no. You poor thing. Here..."
61507,249,265,1199000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Ow! Son of a...
61686,249,266,1202000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Hey, leave my daughter alone! C'mon, humans! We've wiped out entire species before. We can do it again!"
61688,249,268,1217000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Springfield Town Square,"Oh, help!"
61689,249,269,1222000,Comic Book Guy,Springfield Town Square,If I could just... This is really not... You're hurting my...
61690,249,270,1234000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,C'mon lads! Let's drive them back to the ocean!
61692,249,272,1249000,Homer Simpson,Ocean,"Hey, you gotta hand it to those dolphins. They just wanted it more."
61693,249,273,1253000,Lisa Simpson,Ocean,"I kinda wish I hadn't freed their leader and, you know... doomed mankind."
61694,249,274,1258000,Marge Simpson,Ocean,"Oh honey, I wouldn't say doomed. It's gonna be an adjustment, no question..."
61697,249,277,1272000,Kang,Space,"Can you believe it, Kodos? They left us out of the Halloween show."
61698,249,278,1277000,Kodos,Space,Are you sure the space-phone is working?
61699,249,279,1281000,Kodos,Space,Hang up! They could be trying to call right now.
61700,249,280,1284000,Kang,Space,I knew we should have sent them a muffin basket.
61701,249,281,1289000,Kodos,Space,"Kang and Kodos Productions. Uh huh, yes... Just a second. Do we want to do a commercial for something called Old Navy?"
61702,249,282,1300000,Kang,Space,Work is work.
