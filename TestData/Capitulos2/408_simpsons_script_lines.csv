106063,408,201,926000,Marge Simpson,First Church of Springfield,...anus! ...anus! ...anus!
106065,408,203,929000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Sidewalk,Stupid Sideshow Bob. Even when he's dead he wrecks my life. I hope he's in hell eating a barf burger.
106066,408,204,935000,Cecil Terwilliger,Springfield Sidewalk,"I once felt that way, too."
106067,408,205,937000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Sidewalk,"Hey, aren't you Bob's brother?"
106068,408,206,939000,Cecil Terwilliger,Springfield Sidewalk,"Biologically, yes, but we never got along. He was always zigging when I zagged. That summer when he wanted to tour the castles of Italy, I wanted to tour the castles of France. So we went to Spain, a compromise that satisfied no one."
106069,408,207,950000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Sidewalk,"That's stupid. You talk like you're smart, but you're stupid."
106070,408,208,953000,Cecil Terwilliger,Springfield Sidewalk,"Anyway, I choose to remember Bob as the big brother who taught me to play ""Botticelli."""
106071,408,209,958000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Sidewalk,Sounds boring.
106072,408,210,959000,Cecil Terwilliger,Springfield Sidewalk,"Oh, you'd love it! It's a guessing game in which one player adopts the guise of a noteworthy-- you're right, it is boring. But the only way you'll find happiness is by making your peace with Bob."
106073,408,211,970000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Sidewalk,"Well, I guess I could say goodbye."
106074,408,212,973000,Cecil Terwilliger,Springfield Sidewalk,"You'd better make it snappy. They're cremating him in thirty minutes. I'll be scattering his ashes over the castles of France! Take that, ashes!"
106076,408,214,986000,Milhouse Van Houten,Street,Hey Bart! You're on the front page of the paper.
106077,408,215,989000,Bart Simpson,Street,I'm going to set things right. Wanna come with me?
106079,408,216,992000,Milhouse Van Houten,Street,"I would, but tonight my dad's taking me to the batting cage. He's gonna teach me to umpire! Check it out -- an official Major League ball/strike counter!"
106080,408,217,1001000,Milhouse Van Houten,Street,"Ball one, ball two, strike one... Bart? Bart?"
106082,408,219,1014000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Hi, Lisa. Hate to mix B with P, but your family owes me for two weeks."
106083,408,220,1019000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Milhouse, have you seen Bart?"
106084,408,221,1021000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Bart Simpson? I think he went to pay his respects to Sideshow Bob. Mind if I sit down for a second?
106085,408,222,1027000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,My feet are killing me.
106086,408,223,1029000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Feet? Killing?! We gotta save Bart!
106087,408,224,1033000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now?
106088,408,225,1033000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,But I'm getting a home perm!
106089,408,226,1033000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Now!
106091,408,228,1042000,Bart Simpson,Funeral Home,"Bob, it's me, Bart. I came here to tell you I never meant for you to die. I just wanted you to go to jail and get beat up a lot. Now everyone wishes I was dead..."
106092,408,229,1052000,Sideshow Bob,Funeral Home,Then let's give the people what they want!
106093,408,230,1057000,Bart Simpson,Funeral Home,Ahhhhh! Sideshow Bob!
106097,408,234,1077000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,Bob planned this from the beginning --
106098,408,235,1077000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Uh-huh.
106099,408,236,1079000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,He wanted to be captured at the restaurant!
106100,408,237,1079000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Yes.
106101,408,238,1081000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,He would never get a Shakespeare quote wrong --
106102,408,239,1081000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,No.
106103,408,240,1083000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,His mother was a Shakespearean actress!
106104,408,241,1083000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Oh yeah!
106105,408,242,1085000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,His father is a doctor...
106106,408,243,1085000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"A doctor, huh?"
106107,408,244,1087000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,...so when Bob collapsed in the courtroom...
106108,408,245,1087000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,I remember.
106109,408,246,1089000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,...his father could take that opportunity to inject Bob with a powerful drug that simulated death.
106110,408,247,1095000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Uh-huh.
106111,408,248,1095000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"It was a diabolical scheme, and every member of his family played a part!"
106112,408,249,1100000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Are you done? 'Cause I've been circling the funeral home for ten minutes.
105821,408,250,1100000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,Yes.
106078,408,253,1107000,Bart Simpson,CASKET,"Cool, I found a trapdoor that leads to an underground city. Here I go!"
106054,408,254,1117000,Bart Simpson,CASKET,"Oh my God, it's beautiful! Are you buying this?"
106113,408,255,1120000,Sideshow Bob,CASKET,"When they find your ashes, they'll think it's me. And I'll be far away with my loving family."
106114,408,256,1127000,Sideshow Bob,CASKET,It's the perfect crime.
106115,408,257,1129000,Cecil Terwilliger,CASKET,And it was my flawless performance as the grieving brother that sealed the deal.
106116,408,258,1133000,Sideshow Bob,CASKET,"Yes, and ""Hamlet"" is all about Laertes."
106117,408,259,1136000,Cecil Terwilliger,CASKET,Would you please stop comparing me to Laertes!
106118,408,260,1139000,Sideshow Bob,CASKET,If the doublet fits...
106120,408,262,1147000,Lisa Simpson,CASKET,Stop that cremation!
106121,408,263,1147000,Homer Simpson,CASKET,"Hey, what smells so good?"
106122,408,264,1151000,Sideshow Bob,CASKET,Zeus's pimples!
106123,408,265,1157000,Bart Simpson,CASKET,Hot! Hot! Hot!
106124,408,266,1159000,Sideshow Bob,CASKET,"You're too late, Simpsons!"
106125,408,267,1161000,Homer Simpson,CASKET,Eat hobo remains!
106127,408,269,1165000,Bart Simpson,CASKET,Get me outta here. What are you doing? I can't breathe!
106128,408,270,1169000,Homer Simpson,CASKET,"Marge, he's got to get over his fear of coffins."
106129,408,271,1174000,Chief Wiggum,CASKET,"Freeze, Sideshow Snobs! You're all under arrest. You have the right to remain silent, but I hope you don't -- it's a long way to jail, and I like to chitchat."
106130,408,272,1187000,Sideshow Bob,CASKET,"Wait, I must know -- how did you loosen the tiles of my mosaic of murder?"
106131,408,273,1192000,Lisa Simpson,CASKET,I grew suspicious when I saw the casket had extra room built in for your feet.
106132,408,274,1197000,Lisa Simpson,CASKET,Why would your family pay all that extra money for the comfort of a dead man?
106133,408,275,1202000,Sideshow Bob,CASKET,Damn these glorious gunboats!
106134,408,276,1205000,Bart Simpson,CASKET,"Nice try, Bob -- but you didn't count on one thing."
106135,408,277,1209000,Sideshow Bob,CASKET,What's that?
106136,408,278,1209000,Bart Simpson,CASKET,You stink like my butt! Take him away!
106137,408,279,1215000,Sideshow Bob,CASKET,Oh why must I feed him straight lines?!
106139,408,281,1224000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, this time I think Sideshow Bob is finally locked up for good."
106140,408,282,1229000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah. The only thing that's gonna be hacked to pieces now is this celebratory cake!
106141,408,283,1235000,Sideshow Bob,Simpson Home,So... who wants a nice big slice!
106143,408,285,1239000,Sideshow Bob,Prison Cell,Slash! Hack! Die!
106144,408,286,1249000,Sideshow Bob's Father,Prison Cell,There he goes again.
106146,408,287,1251000,Cecil Terwilliger,Prison Cell,"You have eighty-seven years to get used to it, father."
106147,408,288,1253000,Sideshow Bob's Father,Prison Cell,East bids two hearts.
106148,408,289,1256000,Gino,Prison Cell,Three diamonds.
106149,408,290,1258000,Snake Jailbird,Prison Cell,Three clubs.
106150,408,291,1262000,Cecil Terwilliger,Prison Cell,The joke's not funny and the bid's not sufficient.
