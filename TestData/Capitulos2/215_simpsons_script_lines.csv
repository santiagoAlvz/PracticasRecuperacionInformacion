51149,215,214,857000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Please, my friends... Ow! All right, I'll get you into to the game!"
51150,215,215,862000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Excuse me, Uh, Mr. Scalper, sir. Have I told you that I love you?"
51151,215,216,867000,Ticket Scalper,STADIUM,Forget it. You'll just hurt me like all the others.
51152,215,217,871000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Okay, Moe. I believe you had me by the throat. Reverend Lovejoy was working the body..."
51153,215,218,875000,Bart Simpson,STADIUM,"Wait, Dad, look!"
51154,215,219,880000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Gentlemen, I have an idea."
51155,215,220,885000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,Run!
51156,215,221,885000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,Woo hoo!
51157,215,222,889000,Guard,STADIUM,Get back here!
51158,215,223,890000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,We can still make the kickoff!
51159,215,224,892000,Lenny Leonard,STADIUM,Here comes the kick!
51163,215,228,900000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,STADIUM,"As a doctor, I'd say he's had enough. But as a football fan..."
51165,215,230,941000,Commercial Announcer,STADIUM,The Catholic Church. We've made a few changes.
51167,215,232,946000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,These Super Bowl commercials are weird.
51168,215,233,949000,Pat Summerall,Simpson Home,Just about ready for the second quarter here in Miami...
51169,215,234,951000,John Madden,Simpson Home,"I tell you, Pat, that wild first quarter blew out my Telestrator, and now the fans are screaming for more."
51171,215,236,958000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,Let us outta here!
51172,215,237,960000,Chief Wiggum,STADIUM,"Relax, Simpson, relax. A little-known fact about jail cells is they always have one phony bar, for like, emergencies."
51173,215,238,967000,Chief Wiggum,STADIUM,"Real... real... real... real... real. So, by the process of elimination, this one is the fake."
51174,215,239,977000,Chief Wiggum,STADIUM,"Oh! Ah, ah, that's painful."
51175,215,240,980000,Lenny Leonard,STADIUM,"Aw, nuts. That sounds like a touchdown."
51177,215,242,984000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,STADIUM,"No, no, no, I know my roars and that was most definitely a safety."
51179,215,244,990000,Bart Simpson,STADIUM,"Oh, man."
51180,215,245,991000,Wally,STADIUM,"Gosh, fellas. To see y'all stuck in here, when even guys in China can watch all the action from their town squares or what have you, well, I just feel pretty doggone bad. If they were electing a president of Dumbville, I'd have to nominate me."
51181,215,246,1005000,Bart Simpson,STADIUM,You got my vote.
51182,215,247,1007000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Oh, we're never gonna get out of... Psst, cleaning lady. Would you let us out of here?"
51183,215,248,1012000,Woman,STADIUM,Me? I'm Dolly Parton.
51184,215,249,1015000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,I didn't ask for your life story. Just give me the key.
51185,215,250,1017000,Dolly Parton,STADIUM,"Young man, where I come from, the South, folks say please. And besides, I gotta go sing a medley with Rob Lowe and Stomp."
51186,215,251,1025000,Wally,STADIUM,"Dolly, wait!"
51187,215,252,1026000,Dolly Parton,STADIUM,Wally?
51188,215,253,1027000,Krusty the Clown,STADIUM,You know Dolly Parton?
51189,215,254,1029000,Wally,STADIUM,"Yeah, I book a lot of package tours to Dollywood, and EuroDollywood. That's in Alabama."
51190,215,255,1034000,Dolly Parton,STADIUM,"Wally Kogen, what are you doing in Super Bowl jail?"
51191,215,256,1038000,Krusty the Clown,STADIUM,Ask her if she'll go out with me.
51192,215,257,1040000,Wally,STADIUM,We had a little ticket snafu. Do you think you can bust ol' Wally and his pals outta the pokey?
51193,215,258,1045000,Dolly Parton,STADIUM,"Well, I do have some of my extra-strength makeup remover. Shield your eyes."
51194,215,259,1056000,Lenny Leonard,STADIUM,"Thanks, Miss Parton."
51195,215,260,1058000,Barney Gumble,STADIUM,"Oh, way to go, Dolly."
51196,215,261,1060000,Bart Simpson,STADIUM,Thank you.
51197,215,262,1060000,Krusty the Clown,STADIUM,Will you go out with me?
51198,215,263,1061000,Dolly Parton,STADIUM,"Oo, look at the time. I better scoot to that halftime show. See y'all."
51199,215,264,1067000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Man, that's gonna be some show."
51200,215,265,1070000,Wally,STADIUM,Who's ready for some football?!
51201,215,266,1073000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,Football!
51202,215,267,1084000,Moe Szyslak,STADIUM,"Hey Homer, we been runnin' around cheerin' for an hour. Where the hell's the game?"
51203,215,268,1089000,Seymour Skinner,STADIUM,Yeah.
51204,215,269,1089000,Bart Simpson,STADIUM,"Where is it, man?"
51205,215,270,1089000,Dr. Nick Riviera,STADIUM,Yeah. Where?
51206,215,271,1089000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,You guys are following me? I was following Flanders.
51207,215,272,1094000,Bart Simpson,STADIUM,"Hey, look what I found!"
51210,215,275,1105000,Bart Simpson,SKY BOX,"Hey, somebody just scored."
51212,215,277,1105000,Homer Simpson,SKY BOX,In a minute.
51116,215,278,1112000,Moe Szyslak,SKY BOX,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Be right there."
51213,215,280,1112000,Homer Simpson,SKY BOX,"Hey, it's the beer copter!"
51214,215,281,1120000,Man,SKY BOX,What the bloody hell?
51215,215,282,1121000,Homer Simpson,SKY BOX,"Hit the road, Gramps. This is a private sky box."
51216,215,283,1125000,Man,SKY BOX,"I'm Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire tyrant, and this is my sky box."
51217,215,284,1129000,Chief Wiggum,SKY BOX,"If you're Rupert Murdoch, prove it."
51218,215,285,1136000,Guys,SKY BOX,/ Uh-oh.
51219,215,286,1140000,Wally,SKY BOX,"Well, I'm convinced. Tell you what, Mister Murdoch, let's just split the difference. The boys and I will just crouch here quietly and take it easy on the snacks --"
51220,215,287,1148000,Rupert Murdoch,SKY BOX,Silence!
51221,215,288,1150000,Rupert Murdoch,SKY BOX,Seize them!
51222,215,289,1156000,Chief Wiggum,SKY BOX,Nyaaahaaahaaa!
51223,215,290,1156000,Enchanted Policemen,SKY BOX,Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!
51225,215,292,1160000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,The game! We're so close!
51226,215,293,1162000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Follow me, boys. We're finally going to the Sup... Ow!"
51227,215,294,1167000,Football Players,STADIUM,We did it! / We're number one! / We're rich!
51228,215,295,1170000,Reporter #1,STADIUM,How does it feel?
51229,215,296,1171000,Reporter #3,STADIUM,Did you ever stop believing?
51230,215,297,1172000,Reporter #4,STADIUM,Does this suit make me look fat?
51231,215,298,1175000,Guard,STADIUM,Players and VIP's only.
51234,215,301,1181000,Ned Flanders,Locker Room,I can't believe it. We're actually in the winning locker room!
51235,215,302,1184000,Player #2,Locker Room,Woo! I'm going to Disneyland!
51236,215,303,1187000,Wally,Locker Room,Really? 'Cause I'm a travel agent and I've heard nothing but bad things.
51238,215,305,1198000,Barney Gumble,Locker Room,Let... Go... Booze!
51239,215,306,1198000,Homer Simpson,Locker Room,Y'ello...
51240,215,307,1199000,Bill Clinton,Locker Room,"Uh, hello, this is President Clinton."
51241,215,308,1201000,Homer Simpson,Locker Room,"Hey, howyadoin'?"
51242,215,309,1202000,Bill Clinton,Locker Room,"You know, your determination and grit under extreme pressure are an inspiration. The whole country is proud of you."
51243,215,310,1209000,Homer Simpson,Locker Room,"Well, it's about time."
51244,215,311,1211000,Bill Clinton,Locker Room,"And on behalf of America, I'd like to..."
51245,215,312,1213000,Homer Simpson,Locker Room,"Ow! Oh! All right, Lovejoy! You're gonna get it."
51246,215,313,1217000,Bill Clinton,Locker Room,Hello? Hello? I command you to answer me. Hello?
51247,215,314,1222000,Bill Clinton,Locker Room,"Al, do you have to do that right now?"
51249,215,316,1227000,Lenny Leonard,STADIUM,"What're you gonna do with your Super Bowl ring, Carl?"
51250,215,317,1230000,Carl Carlson,STADIUM,"Ah, probably give it to my wife. It's our anniversary today."
51251,215,318,1233000,Guys,STADIUM,Awwwww.
51252,215,319,1234000,Bart Simpson,STADIUM,"Dad, that doesn't belong to you."
51253,215,320,1236000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,But this might be my last chance to win one.
51254,215,321,1238000,Wally,STADIUM,"Well, we sure put together a heck of a trip, Homer. Ever thought about being a travel agent?"
51255,215,322,1243000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,"Wally, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't."
51256,215,323,1245000,Wally,STADIUM,"'Cause you can really ""go places"" in the travel business. Huh? Feel free to use that one."
51257,215,324,1251000,Homer Simpson,STADIUM,What one?
51258,215,325,1255000,Pat Summerall,STADIUM,"Well, John, what did you think of tonight's episode?"
51259,215,326,1258000,John Madden,STADIUM,"I loved it. The last minute addition of Wally Kogen to the lineup was a bit of a gamble, but it really paid off."
51260,215,327,1264000,Pat Summerall,STADIUM,Marge and Lisa painting eggs? Did that work for you?
51261,215,328,1267000,John Madden,STADIUM,"Oh-ho, big time. They came off the bench with a huge effort that allowed Homer and Bart to make some significant gains."
51262,215,329,1274000,Pat Summerall,STADIUM,Did it strike you as odd that in a Super Bowl show with Dolly Parton we didn't see any football or singing?
51263,215,330,1280000,John Madden,STADIUM,"I hadn't thought about it Pat, but in retrospect, it was kind of a rip-off. What a way to treat the loyal fans who've put up with so much nonsense from this franchise."
51264,215,331,1290000,Pat Summerall,STADIUM,Any final thoughts?
51265,215,332,1291000,John Madden,STADIUM,"Nah, I'm too mad. Let's get the heck outta here."
51266,215,333,1295000,Vincent Price,STADIUM,"All aboard, boys. I've been waiting for you."
51267,215,334,1298000,John Madden,STADIUM,"Now, I'll tell you that doesn't make a lick of sense."
51268,215,335,1301000,Pat Summerall,STADIUM,I know. Just get on the bus.
51269,215,336,1304000,Vincent Price,STADIUM,"Where's that infernal clutch? Wait, wait. I'll get it."
51270,215,337,1309000,JODY PRICE,STADIUM,"Give it some gas, Grampa."
51271,215,338,1311000,Vincent Price,STADIUM,"Oh, quiet Jody. You're not helping."
