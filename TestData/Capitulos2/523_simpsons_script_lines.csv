135938,523,80,437000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,Homer... you'll need to wear this eye patch for a couple weeks... and you may never see a film in 3-D again.

135940,523,82,449000,Marge Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Ned Flanders, I can't believe you struck my husband."
135941,523,83,453000,Ned Flanders,Springfield General Hospital,"Marge, I've been racked with guilt and pain... my moustache fell out! This is a clip-on!"

135947,523,89,472000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Here, I'll get you started. Hail Superman, wearing tights, Clark Kent be thy name... one nation, under Zod..."

135949,523,91,482000,Marge Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Ned, Homie's a little cranky right now. More than his eye, I think you hurt his feelings."

135962,523,104,520000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Flanders Home,You need to get some sleep.
135963,523,105,523000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Dare I take another sleep aid?
135964,523,106,527000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Better not take a full dose.
135965,523,107,532000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,See you in eight hours!
135966,523,108,548000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,Was this always waitin' for me or was it recently thrown together? That's what I wanna know.

135975,523,117,614000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,Ms. Cantwell?
135976,523,118,614000,Ms. Cantwell,Lisa's Classroom,Yes?
135847,523,119,615000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,Why are you so mean to me?

135980,523,124,624000,Ms. Cantwell,Lisa's Classroom,Now you've got a demerit.
135981,523,125,625000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,This class doesn't give demerits.

135984,523,128,630000,Ms. Cantwell,Lisa's Classroom,"You're bluffing, I've driven by your home."
135986,523,130,634000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Classroom,Principal Skinner...
135987,523,131,635000,Seymour Skinner,Lisa's Classroom,"Not now, I'm dealing with Mr. Testacleese."

135998,523,142,689000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I wish you wouldn't wear sweaters that the senior ladies knit.
135999,523,143,692000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Well putting my arms in sleeves is about all I got to offer a woman.
136000,523,144,697000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"What's the matter, sweetie? Is a book character having difficulties?"
136001,523,145,702000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I have a bully at school.
136002,523,146,704000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Did you tell the teacher?
136003,523,147,706000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,My bully is my teacher.
136004,523,148,708000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,A teacher can't be a bully.
136005,523,149,710000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, they sure can! When I was a boy, teachers would rap my knuckles with a yardstick. Now you've got the metric system."
136006,523,150,720000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,We don't have the metric system.
136007,523,151,721000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,What? This isn't Sweden? And I'm not King Olaf? I've got some explaining to do down at the bank.
136009,523,153,732000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,Skin-ner! Why am I here?
136010,523,154,735000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,Did this fat boy injure his eye in shop class? That place is a killing field.
136011,523,155,739000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,We're here because our daughter is being bullied by your teacher.
136012,523,156,743000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"Mrs. Simpson, this school does not hire bullies..."
136013,523,157,745000,Seymour Skinner,Skinner's Office,That's right. We...
136014,523,158,747000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"Quiet, nerd."
136015,523,159,748000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Well, she's just a substitute. Maybe you could transfer Ms. Cantwell to another school."
136016,523,160,753000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,Nix! She's already got two weeks tenure so she's impossible to dislodge.
136017,523,161,757000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,"I hate unions. There's this guy at my plant, caused three meltdowns and he still keeps his job."
136018,523,162,764000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Homer, that's you."
136019,523,163,765000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Oh yeah. I say ""union"" you say ""power""! Union..."

136022,523,166,769000,Marge Simpson,Skinner's Office,Power.
136023,523,167,771000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,"Marge, you're really dogging it on the ""power."" But don't worry, because of the union, you're safe. So, just what are you gonna do for our daughter?"
136024,523,168,779000,Gary Chalmers,Skinner's Office,"We should talk about what we're going to promise to do, not what we'll actually do."
136025,523,169,783000,Homer Simpson,Skinner's Office,We really appreciate that.
136028,523,172,789000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Look at those eyes! There's an employee with a healthy case of the go-get-'ems!
136030,523,174,795000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hear that lion's roar of determination.

136032,523,176,802000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Flanders?! How'd you get in here? This place is a highly-sensitive area.
136033,523,177,806000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Who here wants to touch radiation?
136034,523,178,809000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"""Life shall go for life, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth..."""
136035,523,179,809000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey, I don't go to where you work and read the bible to you!"
136036,523,180,816000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I would embrace such a glad visit!
136037,523,181,818000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Just what do you want?!
136038,523,182,819000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I want you to punch me in the eye. If you do, then we're even, according to Exodus, Leviticus and Matthew."
136039,523,183,825000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"So, you went and hired a law firm, eh? That's pretty aggressive."
136040,523,184,828000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Jeepers creepers, pop my peeper!"
136041,523,185,831000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"C'mon, man. What's the catch?"
136042,523,186,832000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Homer, just call me a little bubble 'cause I'm on the level. Punch me."
136043,523,187,837000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hmm...
136044,523,188,844000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"C'mon, Homer. I'm insisting on a fisting."
136045,523,189,847000,Waylon Smithers,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What's this about a fisting?
136046,523,190,849000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"I'm not punching you, Flanders."
136047,523,191,850000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What? Why?!
136048,523,192,852000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Because if I hit you back, we'll be even. But if I don't hit you, that makes me the better man. And I'm liking the way that feels."
136049,523,193,861000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,No! You can't! If I'm not as good as you... then I'm horrible!
136050,523,194,865000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"It's not for me to judge, Ned because... I am the better man!"
136051,523,195,868000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Now, there's no need to..."
136052,523,196,868000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Better man, comin' through... way-better-better, way-better-better zing!"
136053,523,197,875000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Enough!
136054,523,198,876000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"You may be the sweater man, but Homer is the better man."
136055,523,199,878000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Now you're rhyming?!
136056,523,200,880000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I didn't know you were left-handed.
136058,523,202,890000,Ms. Cantwell,Springfield Elementary School,Hello Lisa. I was shocked to hear from Principal Skinner that you and I aren't getting along.
136059,523,203,895000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"You should never tell on a bully, Lisa. Everyone knows that."
136061,523,205,901000,Dewey Largo,DETENTION HALL,Lisa Simpson?! In detention?
136062,523,206,904000,Ms. Cantwell,DETENTION HALL,Every rap sheet has a first line.

136089,523,234,986000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,My teacher's still bullying me.

136096,523,241,1014000,Baseball Announcer,Simpson Home,"You know, the great Mel Ott used to raise ducks in Louisiana during the off season. And when a duck got sick he would take it to bed with him until it got well. Mm-hm."

136117,523,262,1094000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Lisa's Classroom,Right. I can't be around him 'cause he's so delicious. Ha!
136118,523,263,1099000,Ms. Cantwell,Lisa's Classroom,"Well, I can't see what harm one boy could do."

136141,523,285,1185000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,She hates me because I'm pretty!
136142,523,286,1189000,Ms. Cantwell,Springfield Elementary School,"Not so pretty now, are ya?"
