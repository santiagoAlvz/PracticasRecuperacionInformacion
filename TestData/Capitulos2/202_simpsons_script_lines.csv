46980,202,1,90000,Milhouse Van Houten,Sidewalk,"Hey Bart, what's your favorite thing about teachers' conference day?"
46981,202,2,95000,Bart Simpson,Sidewalk,Hm. I guess that we don't have to go to school.
46982,202,3,97000,Milhouse Van Houten,Sidewalk,"Wow, mine too!"
46983,202,4,99000,Bart Simpson,Sidewalk,"The world is completely different on a weekday morning. Banks are open, old people are walking the streets with impunity..."
46984,202,5,105000,Bart Simpson,Sidewalk,And look! Barney's not even drunk yet!
46985,202,6,108000,Barney Gumble,Sidewalk,'Mornin' boys. Can't stop to chat. Time is money.
46986,202,7,113000,Homer Simpson,Sidewalk,"'Mornin', Barney."
46987,202,8,114000,Milhouse Van Houten,Sidewalk,"You know what makes it even sweeter? While we're out havin' fun and walkin' around like crazy, those teachers are cooped up in the school like morons."
46988,202,9,124000,Seymour Skinner,Sidewalk,Here we go again...
46990,202,11,133000,Bart Simpson,Sidewalk,Ah. No day would be completely wasted without a visit to the old joke shop.
46992,202,13,144000,Bart Simpson,Sidewalk,"Rookie mistake, Milhouse."
46995,202,16,152000,Milhouse Van Houten,Yuk-ingham Palace,"Check it out, Bart! X-ray specs!"
46996,202,17,157000,Milhouse Van Houten,Yuk-ingham Palace,Hey. These don't work.
46997,202,18,159000,Clerk,Yuk-ingham Palace,Uhh... Lead shirt.
46998,202,19,162000,Milhouse Van Houten,Yuk-ingham Palace,I'll take three pairs! Here's my prescription.
46999,202,20,165000,Bart Simpson,Yuk-ingham Palace,Hmm...
47000,202,21,170000,Clerk,Yuk-ingham Palace,Hey. You wanna not play with that? Just got it charged.
47001,202,22,174000,Bart Simpson,Yuk-ingham Palace,Maybe you can help me. I don't think my face is as hilarious as it could be. What can you show me in a nose or forehead accessory?
47003,202,24,182000,Milhouse Van Houten,Sidewalk,WWWhoa! Looking sharp.
47004,202,25,185000,Bart Simpson,Sidewalk,"Well. Thanks, guv'nor."
47006,202,27,188000,Milhouse Van Houten,Sidewalk,"If you put dog doo on the suction cups, they'll stick better."
47007,202,28,192000,Bart Simpson,Sidewalk,"Milhouse, I'm not gonna take dog doo that's been on the dirty ground and put it on my face. I have a better idea."
47009,202,30,204000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey Dad, wake up."
47010,202,31,206000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Huh? Whuh? Hyuwhuh? I'm awake! I'm awake! I'm a productive member of the team! You can't fire me, I quit! Please, I have a family! Well, let's see what we got in the ol' drawer."
47011,202,32,224000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Eh. Eh.
47012,202,33,224000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Aha. There's some glue.
47014,202,35,235000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hope this stuff holds.
47016,202,37,238000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,This exhibit is a once-in-a-lifetime event. It's the first time these Egyptian artifacts have been allowed out of England.
47017,202,38,245000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just let me put some film in the camera, and then we'll hop in the car. You can get a picture of your Mommy with a mummy."
47018,202,39,252000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoops! There goes Carlsbad Caverns. Oh, well."
47019,202,40,256000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I can't wait! In just twenty minutes, we'll be in a three hour line to see the Orb of Isis."
47020,202,41,262000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ta-da!
47021,202,42,262000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Notice anything new?
47022,202,43,265000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart! What have I told you about throwing money away at that joke shop?
47023,202,44,269000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,To try and cut back a little?
47024,202,45,270000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Take those silly things off.
47025,202,46,276000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It won't come off.
47031,202,52,284000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow!
47033,202,54,285000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow!
47035,202,56,287000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow!
47036,202,57,288000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, did you glue those on?"
47037,202,58,290000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, don't be ridiculous."
47038,202,59,294000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""In case of accidental ingestion, consult a mortician."" Oh my goodness!"
47039,202,60,300000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I didn't eat any of it. I'm not stupid."
47040,202,61,303000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,We've got to get you to a doctor right away.
47041,202,62,306000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
47042,202,63,309000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Wait! You promised to take me to the museum!
47043,202,64,311000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know, honey. But this is a very unusual situation... at least it would be for most families."
47044,202,65,318000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What if I took a bus?
47045,202,66,319000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"A bus? Alone? Absolutely not. It's just too dangerous for an eight-year- old. In a few years, when you're old enough to drive, then you can take A bus."
47046,202,67,330000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But it's the last day of the Isis exhibit!
47047,202,68,333000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you should have thought of that before I glued all this stuff to my face."
47050,202,71,347000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Hello?
47051,202,72,348000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Dad?
47052,202,73,349000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Who is this?
47053,202,74,350000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,It's Lisa. I just called to tell you how much I love you and can I take the bus to the museum?
47054,202,75,354000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Museum? I don't like the sound of that. What did your mother say?
47055,202,76,359000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Ahm... I wasn't a hundred per cent clear on that. She said something, but she was kind of in a rush to get Bart to the emergency room."
47056,202,77,367000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hmm. So you want to take the bus, huh? I don't know. That's a pretty big decision..."
47057,202,78,373000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well... if it would put your mind at ease, I could take a limousine. Although that would cost two hundred dollars..."
47058,202,79,381000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Two hundred dollars?! Isn't there any other way?
47059,202,80,383000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hmm. I guess I could take the bus, if you think that's a better idea."
47060,202,81,387000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Frankly, I do. I know you had your heart set on a limo, but sometimes daddies have to say no, honey. I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the bus."
47061,202,82,397000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, all right."
47062,202,83,399000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Atta girl. I love you, sweet --"
47063,202,84,401000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Yes!
47065,202,86,404000,Lisa Simpson,Bus Stop,"Ah, the old Number 22. Clean, reliable public transportation. The chariot of the people. The ride of choice for the poor and very poor alike. Sure, some folks prefer--"
47066,202,87,416000,Moe Szyslak,Bus Stop,"Uh, you gettin' on this next bus, kid?"
47067,202,88,416000,Lisa Simpson,Bus Stop,Yes.
47068,202,89,419000,Moe Szyslak,Bus Stop,Taxi!
47069,202,90,421000,Moe Szyslak,Bus Stop,V.D. clinic.
47070,202,91,424000,Lisa Simpson,Bus Stop,"Look! It's the bus! The bus! Come on, you're gonna miss the bus!"
47071,202,92,431000,Lisa Simpson,Bus Stop,That's one small step f-- Whoa!
47073,202,94,437000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,"Hi, Larry."
47074,202,95,441000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,"I'm sorry, it's just that on the school bus--"
47075,202,96,448000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,May I sit there?
47076,202,97,449000,Agnes Skinner,Bus,"Of course not, honey. That seat's for my coin purse."
47077,202,98,455000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,May I have that seat?
47078,202,99,457000,Comic Book Guy,Bus,Yes... if you can answer me these questions three. Question the first--
47079,202,100,463000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,Never mind.
47080,202,101,466000,Bus Driver,Bus,Sycamore Avenue.
47081,202,102,468000,Bus Driver,Bus,Little Newark. Little Newark.
47082,202,103,472000,Bus Driver,Bus,Crackton. Crackton is the stop.
47083,202,104,476000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,Crackton? That doesn't sound right.
47084,202,105,480000,Bus Driver,Bus,Industrial Access Road. / Airport Refuelin' Way. / Rural Route Nine. / Army Proving Ground.
47085,202,106,493000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,"Um... excuse me, sir. When does this bus get to the museum?"
47086,202,107,497000,Bus Driver,Bus,It doesn't.
47087,202,108,498000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,Oh! But isn't this the 22?
47088,202,109,501000,Bus Driver,Bus,"Yeah -- Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Tuesday-Thursday, it's the 22A."
47089,202,110,505000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,22A?! Then where the heck am I?
47090,202,111,507000,Bus Driver,Bus,Don't make me tap the sign.
47091,202,112,509000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,But I'm lost and I need to know where --
47092,202,113,513000,Bus Driver,Bus,Last stop. End of the line.
47093,202,114,521000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,I should've got off in Crackton.
47095,202,116,528000,Lisa Simpson,Deserted Area,"Okay, the museum's got to be north of here. Now which way is north...?"
47096,202,117,533000,Lisa Simpson,Deserted Area,"Aha! It's springtime, so the geese must be flying back north."
47097,202,118,540000,Lisa Simpson,Deserted Area,Hey!
47101,202,122,553000,Marge Simpson,Waiting Room,"See, Bart? There's another boy who played with glue."
47102,202,123,556000,Faucet-head Kid's Mother,Waiting Room,"Actually, it was a plumbing explosion."
47104,202,125,560000,Marge Simpson,Waiting Room,That's the kind of faucet I want for your bathroom.
47106,202,127,563000,Lisa Simpson,Deserted Area,How could I confuse bus 22 with bus 22A?
47107,202,128,568000,Lisa Simpson,Deserted Area,Area 51? I found Area 51!
47108,202,129,572000,Soldier,Deserted Area,"No, ma'am. This is Area 51-A."
47109,202,130,576000,Lisa Simpson,Deserted Area,"Well, um, I'm kind of lost. Can you tell me where I am?"
47110,202,131,579000,Soldier,Deserted Area,I'm sorry. The location of this location is classified.
47112,202,133,591000,Lisa Simpson,Street,Stupid bus that can't even go to the stupid place it's supposed to stupid go.
47113,202,134,597000,Lisa Simpson,Street,Yahhh!

47115,202,136,600000,Cletus Spuckler,Street,"Ooh, Girly Sue's gonna have a elegant weddin' feast."
47116,202,137,605000,Lisa Simpson,Street,"Uh-huh. Um, listen, I'm kind of lost. Do you think you could give me a lift downtown?"
47117,202,138,612000,Brandine Del Roy,Street,"Cletus, what are you beatin' your gums about?"
47118,202,139,614000,Cletus Spuckler,Street,"Eh, never you mind, Brandine. You just go back to birthin' that baby. Yeah, I'll fetch ya a ride, little Missy. Hop on in."
47119,202,140,625000,Cletus Spuckler,Street,Mind the skunk. Them things can go off even after they's dayd.
47122,202,143,637000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Hmmm. Young man, there's nothing funny about novelties. I mean, they're humorous and all, but, uh, this is certainly no laughing matter."
47123,202,144,651000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,"Can you help him, Doctor?"
47124,202,145,652000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Oh my, yes. Why if I had seventy-five dollars for every novelty I've removed... oh, by the way, I'll need a check for seventy-five dollars."
47125,202,146,662000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Yes, I think a... a series of painful injections directly into Bart's spine should get the job done."
47127,202,148,680000,Marge Simpson,Hospital,What happened? You didn't do anything.
47128,202,149,682000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Oh, didn't I? Nothing dissolves glue better than human sweat. I knew Bart would panic and start perspiring at the sight of this button applicator."
47129,202,150,695000,Bart Simpson,Hospital,Couldn't you have just turned up the heat a little?
47130,202,151,697000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Hospital,"Oh, heavens no. It had to be terror sweat."
47132,202,153,709000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"So, uh, ain't you guys gonna ask me about my hat?"
47134,202,155,713000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hey Carl, what's with the hat?"
47136,202,156,716000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, what, this thing? I got it down at the museum. It's what the ancient Egyptians call a ""souvenir."""
47137,202,157,722000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"My daughter's at that Egyptian dealy right now. She wanted to take a limo, but I made her take the bus."
47138,202,158,730000,Lenny Leonard,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You sent your little girl downtown on a bus?
47139,202,159,733000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Alone?
47140,202,160,735000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"MMMaybe... but you don't know Lisa. I mean she's so smart, they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things, but she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and caught on fire."
47141,202,161,749000,Carl Carlson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"That never, uhh, happened, did it, Homer?"
47142,202,162,751000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh, yesss... but now I have to leave on a totally unrelated matter."
47143,202,163,760000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Lisa!
47145,202,165,762000,Lisa Simpson,RUSSIAN NEIGHBORHOOD,I didn't know Springfield had a Russian district.

47165,202,185,840000,Homer Simpson,Springsonian Museum,Has anyone seen my little girl?
47166,202,186,846000,Homer Simpson,Springsonian Museum,"For God's sakes, my little girl is--"
47167,202,187,848000,Homer Simpson,Springsonian Museum,Hello.
47135,202,188,848000,Marge Simpson,Springsonian Museum,"Homer, what's going on? Shouldn't you be at work?"
47168,202,189,851000,Homer Simpson,Springsonian Museum,I am at work. This is what I do.
47169,202,190,854000,Marge Simpson,Springsonian Museum,But--
47170,202,191,854000,Homer Simpson,Springsonian Museum,"Keep it moving, Marge. This isn't a parking lot."

47214,202,235,1022000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Nah, I'll just walk it off."
47216,202,237,1027000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,"I should have known I wasn't old enough to take the bus alone, but I really wanted to see that exhibit. I'll never take another stupid risk like that again!"
47217,202,238,1038000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,Don't ever say that.
47218,202,239,1040000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,What?
47219,202,240,1041000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"If I hadn'ta taken a stupid risk with that cherry picker, I never would have found you."
47220,202,241,1045000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,I guess...
47221,202,242,1047000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Stupid risks are what make life worth living. Now your mother, she's the steady type, and that's fine in small doses. But me, I'm a risk taker. And that's why I have so many adventures."
47222,202,243,1060000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,Dad! You're headed for the river again!
47223,202,244,1065000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Feel your heart pumping a mile a minute? That's what my heart's doing all the time. Bet your left arm's tingling too, huh?"
47224,202,245,1072000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,"Dad, are you all right?"
47225,202,246,1074000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"I'm enjoying my life too much to care. And you should be too. So what would you like to do right now, more than anything in the world?!"
47226,202,247,1081000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Car,See the Isis exhibit. But the museum's closed.
47227,202,248,1085000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Car,"Closed, eh? So getting in would be a pretty big risk. What do you say, honey? Feeling stupid? I know I am."
47229,202,250,1099000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, we're home! Sorry about the museum! You'd better go up and apologize."
47230,202,251,1107000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But my apologies always sound so forced.
47231,202,252,1110000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Do it!
47232,202,253,1116000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Lis. I'm sorry I ruined your Egyptian thing. We're still buds, right?"
47234,202,255,1123000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Okay, be that way. Be a big, stupid jerk."
47236,202,257,1126000,Bart Simpson,UPSTAIRS HALLWAY,"Oh, you're not the jerk, I am. Forgive me? Oh, like you're Miss Perfect! Mom! Lisa's making me feel bad!"
47237,202,258,1138000,Marge Simpson,UPSTAIRS HALLWAY,"Stop it, Lisa!"
47238,202,259,1141000,Bart Simpson,UPSTAIRS HALLWAY,That shut her up.
47240,202,261,1152000,Homer Simpson,Springsonian Museum,Just a little higher...
47241,202,262,1163000,Lisa Simpson,Springsonian Museum,"Dad, I'm kind of scared."
47242,202,263,1165000,Homer Simpson,Springsonian Museum,Good. You're gonna need that adrenaline to make the final jump.
47243,202,264,1170000,Lisa Simpson,Springsonian Museum,Okay... Here goes.
47244,202,265,1175000,Homer Simpson,Springsonian Museum,Could you open the window? The cops have Daddy's prints on file.
47246,202,267,1186000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,Wowww. It's magnificent.
47247,202,268,1191000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,Now I know how Sir Dudley Winthrop felt when he first fell through the ceiling and discovered the Temple of Isis.
47248,202,269,1197000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,Have you ever seen such exquisite Ushabtis?
47249,202,270,1201000,Homer Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,Uh... not this exquisite.
47250,202,271,1206000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,Ohmigosh! It's the mysterious Orb of Isis.
47251,202,272,1210000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,"Archaeologists have been studying it for decades, and still have no clue what it means."
47252,202,273,1215000,Homer Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,"Well, Daddy will figure it out."
47253,202,274,1219000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,"Oh! We can't touch it, Dad. It's behind a velvet rope! A velvet rope."
47254,202,275,1225000,Homer Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,"Lisa, you can't go this far and then not go further."
47256,202,277,1237000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,Dad!
47257,202,278,1243000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,You broke it!
47258,202,279,1253000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,"It's a music box! Dad, we uncovered the secret!"
47259,202,280,1258000,Homer Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,"Oh, so now it's we, eh."
47260,202,281,1261000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,"It's so beautiful. And just think, we're the first people to hear its song in more than four thousand years."
47261,202,282,1270000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,"Thanks for making me take such a stupid risk, Dad."
47262,202,283,1274000,Homer Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,"Anytime, honey. Just remember, never be afraid to live life on the edge. Now let's get home before your mother kills us."
47263,202,284,1284000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,"It's kind of humbling, isn't it? The music we just heard might never be heard again."
47264,202,285,1290000,Homer Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,"Yeah... but it'll always live on, because we'll never forget it."
47265,202,286,1299000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,"Dad, that's the Old Spice song."
47266,202,287,1301000,Homer Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,It is? Well... that's a good song too. Do do do do-do do do...
47267,202,288,1305000,Lisa Simpson,EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM,Do do do do-do / Do do do do-do / Do do do do do do do do.
