83857,325,225,889000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,I want to get a second house. Closer to work.
83858,325,226,892000,Indigent Man,Springfield Street,He's taking all our business! We're gonna have to do something.
83859,325,227,895000,Indigent Woman,Springfield Street,"We never do anything, that's why we're bums."
83860,325,228,898000,Indigent Man,Springfield Street,"Hey, you're a woman."
83861,325,229,901000,Indigent Woman,Springfield Street,And you're a three-headed devil dog. Devil dog!
83862,325,230,904000,Indigent Man,Springfield Street,Wanna make out?
83863,325,231,905000,Indigent Woman,Springfield Street,No one wants to be alone.
83866,325,234,907000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"""The Mound Builders worshiped turtles, as well as badgers, snakes, and other animals."""
83867,325,235,907000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Thank God we've come to our senses and worship a carpenter who lived two thousand years ago.
83868,325,236,918000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Hi, Janey... Branford Marsalis' car broke down outside your house? And he's just jamming 'til Wynton shows up? Oh..."
83869,325,237,930000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Um... some other time, maybe. Today I'm just hanging out at home."
83870,325,238,941000,Nelson Muntz,Simpson Living Room,"Hey, Bart, I ""borrowed"" my uncle's pellet gun. Wanna go shoot Apu?"
83871,325,239,946000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, that does sound fun."
83872,325,240,948000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,But not today. I think I'm just gonna hang out at home.
83886,325,241,954000,Lisa's Thoughts,Simpson Living Room,Oh my God! My brother's my best friend.
83885,325,242,958000,Bart's Thoughts,Simpson Living Room,Oh my God! My sister's my best friend.
83884,325,243,962000,Marge's Thoughts,Simpson Living Room,Diamonds! I still can't believe he gave me diamonds!
148618,325,244,967000,Homer's Thoughts,Simpson Living Room,Mirror mirror on the wall: who's the baldest of them all?
83874,325,246,975000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,One time I swung all the way around.
83875,325,247,978000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,You did not.
83876,325,248,979000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,I know a guy who did.
83877,325,249,981000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Who?
83878,325,250,982000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,You don't know him. He lives in Russia.
83879,325,251,983000,JANEY,Springfield Elementary School Playground,I can't believe they're hanging out.
83880,325,252,985000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Ha! Maybe she'll be a good influence on him.
83881,325,253,988000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Or maybe he'll corrupt her.
83882,325,254,989000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School Playground,It won't last. Brothers and sisters are natural enemies. Like Englishmen and Scots. Or Welshmen and Scots. Or Japanese and Scots. Or Scots and other Scots. Damn Scots! They ruined Scotland!
83883,325,255,1005000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Playground,You Scots sure are a contentious people.
83887,325,256,1008000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Ye just made an enemy for life!
83889,325,258,1010000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Listen, Mr. Hobo. You may not have laundry to wash, but I do. Now what do you want to show me?"
83890,325,259,1017000,Indigent Man,Springfield Street,"There's your husband, a.k.a. Mooch-a-lini, Drooly McGee, Corporal Flashback, etcetera, etcetera."
83891,325,260,1024000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,Homer!
83893,325,262,1026000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,You're panhandling! I should have known from that panhandling sign! Plus that ticket you got for panhandling.
83894,325,263,1035000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,"But Marge, it was all for you. To buy you all the nice things you deserve. The flowers, the earrings, the Bob Seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice..."
83895,325,264,1045000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Homer, I don't need fancy things. And even if I did, this is the wrong way to get them."
83896,325,265,1054000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"And to remind you of what you've done, I'm going to keep these earrings and wear them at social occasions."
83897,325,266,1061000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,I don't understand.
83898,325,267,1063000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"Well, then maybe you need to buy me a brooch."
83900,325,269,1066000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,Bart! I cracked the code of the pictograph. It says there's a curse on the mound. Of course I don't believe in...
83901,325,270,1073000,Milhouse Van Houten,LIVING ROOM,Hi Lisa! I brought you the Cap City version of Monopoly. Baltic Avenue is now Wayne Street. It's awesome!
83902,325,271,1080000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,Milhouse? I thought your mom took you away forever.
83903,325,272,1084000,Kirk Van Houten,LIVING ROOM,I got a court order bringing him back. The judge said I was the most pathetic person he'd ever seen in court. Pity custody -- boo-yeah!
83904,325,273,1092000,Repo Man,LIVING ROOM,Repo man. I'm here to take your pants.
83905,325,274,1095000,Kirk Van Houten,LIVING ROOM,Not in front of my son. Please.
83906,325,275,1098000,Repo Man,LIVING ROOM,You're somebody's father?!
83907,325,276,1100000,Kirk Van Houten,LIVING ROOM,"Yes, okay."
83908,325,277,1101000,Repo Man,LIVING ROOM,"Umm, boy."
83909,325,278,1103000,Milhouse Van Houten,LIVING ROOM,"Well, I'm glad to be back. Those Cap City kids don't think I'm cool anymore. We were having a sleepover, and a robber came and wet my bed. Then he folded the bed back into the couch...and disappeared into the night."
83910,325,279,1116000,Bart Simpson,LIVING ROOM,I knew you'd blow it. Now let me show you that mound.
83911,325,280,1118000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,You told him our secret?!
83912,325,281,1120000,Bart Simpson,LIVING ROOM,"Hey, he's my best friend."
83913,325,282,1122000,Lisa Simpson,LIVING ROOM,Oh. I see how it is.
83914,325,283,1124000,Bart Simpson,LIVING ROOM,Great. Then we're all cool.
83917,325,286,1130000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Since he's been back, Milhouse has had three bloody noses and stepped in dog doo. It's always a party with that guy."
83918,325,287,1137000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Well, it's nice you have your best friend back."
83919,325,288,1140000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"You should hang with us sometime, Lis."
83920,325,289,1142000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Mmm-hmm... I think I'll go to bed now.
83921,325,290,1144000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,What's wrong?
83922,325,291,1145000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Nothing.
83923,325,292,1147000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Hoo boy, are you in trouble."
83924,325,293,1149000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,What're you talkin' about?
83925,325,294,1150000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"When a woman says nothing's wrong that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off."
83927,325,296,1166000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey Lis, you wanna play Cap City Monopoly?"
83928,325,297,1169000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Look, just because Milhouse is gone doesn't mean you have to pretend to be my friend."
83929,325,298,1172000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh c'mon, I'll roll the dice for you."
83930,325,299,1175000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"...three, four, five, chance. Pick up a card."
83931,325,300,1187000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart will make your bed for a week.
83932,325,301,1187000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What? Really?
83933,325,302,1189000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Yep. Pick up another one.
83934,325,303,1191000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,But it's not my turn.
83935,325,304,1192000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'm trying to do something nice, you dink. Pick up a card."
83936,325,305,1196000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Bart will defend you when other kids call you a nerd."" No one calls me a nerd."
83937,325,306,1201000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Trust me, that is a valuable card. Pick up another."
83938,325,307,1204000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Bart will give back the Malibu Stacy head you thought was lost.
83939,325,308,1204000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Bart, that's really sweet."
83940,325,309,1214000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Just because I have Milhouse back, doesn't mean I haven't learned a few things about being a brother."
83941,325,310,1218000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I think I'm gonna use this card right now.
83942,325,311,1221000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, do I have to?"
83825,325,312,1226000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,All right.
83943,325,313,1231000,Isabel Sanford,Simpson Home,"This is what sitcoms call ""a schmaltzy ending"" -- a sentimental capper to leave the audience feeling good. Usually followed by a little coda to cut the treacle."
83944,325,314,1246000,Jethro,Simpson Home,"Granny, I'm gonna shoot me some Viet Cong."
83945,325,315,1248000,Granny,Simpson Home,"Yeah, well I ain't cookin' 'em."
83946,325,316,1253000,Isabel Sanford,Simpson Home,"And George Jefferson, wherever you are, we love you and want you to come home!"
