145783,561,132,564000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Oh, thank God you are here. I need to get to sleep. Tell me the story of jazz again."
145784,561,133,569000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Well, the story of jazz starts with the tresillo, the most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic cell in sub-Saharan African music, but the rest will have to wait. Bart, Bart, I hear Mom sobbing and I don't know where Dad is!"

145795,561,144,638000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I'm just a kid. But I say if Dad isn't here Christmas morning, that's the kind of thing families never recover from."
145796,561,145,646000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Lisa, sweetie, I'm tired of being a pushover."
145797,561,146,650000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're not a pushover.

145804,561,153,681000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"I'm the one that kept Homer from comin' home... 'cause... uh, well, I was lonely."
145806,561,155,685000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Yeah, that's right. Me, Mr. Party Pants. So, uh... so don't hold it against Homer, eh?"
145807,561,156,691000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, my poor Homie! This is what I was hoping for... for it not to have been completely his fault! Thank you, Moe."
145809,561,158,703000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry, Marge, I'm sorry, but it was Christmas and we were under the mistletoe..."
145810,561,159,707000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That's lettuce caught in a spider's web.
145811,561,160,708000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,All right.

145842,561,193,836000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Say Flanders, with all the hard luck you've had, how do you stay so happy? And don't say ""Jesus."""
145843,561,194,842000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Mall,"Well, sir, our good Lord, and my boys are all I've really got. All Edna left me was wonderful memories and some ungraded papers, which I'm still working my way through."

145849,561,200,871000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Mall,"Oh, Homer! Unto us this day, a neighbor is born! But why?"
145850,561,201,875000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,Because Jerk-ass Homer has become Ass-jerk Homer.
145851,561,202,879000,Ned Flanders,Springfield Mall,"Well that curled my lashes, but good for you."
145852,561,203,884000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Mall,"You're all right, Stupid Flanders. You're all right."
