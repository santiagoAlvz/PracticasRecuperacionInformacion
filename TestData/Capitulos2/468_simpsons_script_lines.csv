121244,468,8,121000,Rev. Lovejoy Avatar,Simpson Home,Slay the wounded!
121245,468,9,123000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I still think it's too violent.
121246,468,10,125000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,It's a game. We're not hurtin' anybody.
121247,468,11,128000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,My non-lazy eye!

121264,468,28,157000,Bart Simpson,ATTIC,"Hey, it's gotta be good if Satan put his name on it."
121265,468,29,163000,Bart Simpson,ATTIC,"Here, I'll be the demon, you be the thimble."
121266,468,30,166000,Milhouse Van Houten,ATTIC,"Oh, I'm always the thimble."

121269,468,33,186000,Rich Uncle Pennybags,ATTIC,There was a bank error in my favor... ...and I'm spending it all on Oriental Avenue prostitutes!
121271,468,35,196000,Milhouse Van Houten,ATTIC,All the games came to life!
121273,468,37,208000,Lou,Springfield,"I don't like the looks of that knight, Chief."
121274,468,38,210000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Don't worry, we're safe. He's two steps away and one to the right."
121275,468,39,218000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"For me it's game, set and match."
121276,468,40,222000,Lou,Springfield,"I think you mean ""check, and mate."""
121277,468,41,222000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,"Just got crushed by a giant horse, Lou. You wanna cut me a break."

121286,468,50,261000,Bart Simpson,SIMPSON HOUSE FRONT LAWN,How do we make this stop?
121287,468,51,263000,Lisa Simpson,SIMPSON HOUSE FRONT LAWN,"Well, my Latin's a little rusty, but I think to get everything back in its box, you have to finish the game."
121288,468,52,267000,Milhouse Van Houten,SIMPSON HOUSE FRONT LAWN,And if we don't finish?
121289,468,53,270000,Lisa Simpson,SIMPSON HOUSE FRONT LAWN,You're gonna have to deal with more nonsense like that.
121290,468,54,274000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,SIMPSON HOUSE FRONT LAWN,Yahtzu.
121291,468,55,277000,Waylon Smithers,SIMPSON HOUSE FRONT LAWN,"Here we go, back in the cup."
121292,468,56,279000,Sideshow Mel,SIMPSON HOUSE FRONT LAWN,At least the cup is lined with felt.
121293,468,57,281000,Moe Szyslak,SIMPSON HOUSE FRONT LAWN,"Hey Mister Positive, shut the hell up."

121299,468,63,307000,Bart Simpson,Springfield,"I wish I could see my Mom one last time so I can say ""this is all your fault""!"
121301,468,65,307000,Marge Simpson,Mansion,"Colonel Ketchup, I say it was you that killed him in the parlor with the letter opener."
121302,468,66,319000,Colonel Ketchup,Mansion,He was going to leave me. And I'm too old to find anyone else!
121305,468,69,324000,Bart Simpson,WATER,"C'mon, man, climb up!"
121306,468,70,326000,Milhouse Van Houten,WATER,"No, I might sink the letter. And Q is just too valuable."
121307,468,71,330000,Bart Simpson,WATER,That blank can be any letter we want!
121309,468,72,332000,Milhouse Van Houten,WATER,Maybe I'm just tired of living.
121310,468,73,341000,Bart Simpson,WATER,"The final challenge! Mousecatch... a game so lame, no one's ever finished it!"

121315,468,78,361000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,There comes a time to beat the crap out of childish things!
121316,468,79,381000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Street,Sure is a hard way to catch a mouse.
121317,468,80,388000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,This stupid thing never works.
121320,468,83,405000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That's it. From now on we'll just play hangman.
121321,468,84,408000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait, wait! We still get one more letter!"
121322,468,85,410000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Is it... three?
121323,468,86,412000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That's not a letter!
121324,468,87,415000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
121327,468,90,437000,Homer Simpson,SAILBOAT,"Man, it's been a crazy morning. Champagne?"
121328,468,91,443000,Marge Simpson,SAILBOAT,"Oh Homie, what a great idea to take a cruise in uncharted waters."
121329,468,92,448000,Homer Simpson,SAILBOAT,"Yeah, charts are for squares, baby."
121330,468,93,455000,Marge Simpson,SAILBOAT,"Whew, sure is hot out here..."
121332,468,95,459000,Homer Simpson,SAILBOAT,That's my cell phone.
121333,468,96,465000,Homer Simpson,SAILBOAT,"What is it? Lenny, I'm on a second honeymoon. You'll have to pick your own lotto numbers. Now, where were we?"
121334,468,97,477000,Homer Simpson,SAILBOAT,Oh baby. Let's give those seagulls something to squawk about.
121337,468,100,484000,Homer Simpson,SAILBOAT,"Oh yeah baby, I like it when you're distracted."
121339,468,102,491000,Marge Simpson,SAILBOAT,"Homie, help him up!"
121340,468,103,492000,Homer Simpson,SAILBOAT,"Fine, I'll get the hook."
121341,468,104,497000,Homer Simpson,SAILBOAT,"Don't fight it... That's it... That's it, a little more... How's that?"
121342,468,105,506000,Homer Simpson,SAILBOAT,"You're safe now, my friend."
121343,468,106,508000,Marge Simpson,SAILBOAT,This poor man must've been out there for days!
121344,468,107,510000,Marge Simpson,SAILBOAT,He's nothing but hard bronze muscle.
121150,468,108,515000,Man,SAILBOAT,Bless you.
121345,468,109,519000,Homer Simpson,SAILBOAT,"O-kay, this guy's taken care of so, uh, you know..."
121346,468,110,524000,Marge Simpson,SAILBOAT,I'm not really in the mood anymore.
121347,468,111,526000,Homer Simpson,SAILBOAT,Fine. I'm going for a walk.
121349,468,113,547000,Man,Boat,"My name's Roger. I was the chef on the Albatross, working for a businessman taking his partners to Tahiti. One night, he asked for pie for dessert..."
121351,468,115,557000,Roger,ALBATROSS,"As the pie cooled innocently on a porthole sill, my employer attempted to inject it with poison."
121352,468,116,564000,Roger,ALBATROSS,But I caught him in the act.
121353,468,117,566000,Roger,ALBATROSS,"Unfortunately, he had the strength of ten businessmen. He sent me napward with a bottle of low-sodium soy sauce."
121355,468,119,573000,Marge Simpson,Simpsons' Boat,Poor man. You've been through so much.
121356,468,120,576000,Homer Simpson,Simpsons' Boat,"Hey, I've had a hard trip too. One of the lenses fell out of my sunglasses."
121357,468,121,585000,Marge Simpson,Simpsons' Boat,"Oh, Roger! You really know what you're doing!"
121359,468,123,592000,Roger,Simpsons' Boat,No luck.
121360,468,124,594000,Roger,Simpsons' Boat,"Anyway, when I came to, everyone onboard was dead."
121362,468,126,601000,Roger,ALBATROSS,I fled the horrific scene.
121363,468,127,604000,Roger,ALBATROSS,"And after days at sea, I found my savior: you, Marge."
121364,468,128,609000,Roger,ALBATROSS,"...And in a very insignificant way, you, Homer."
121366,468,130,613000,Roger,SIMPSON BOAT,"God, it was horrible!"
121367,468,131,614000,Homer Simpson,SIMPSON BOAT,"Marge, can I have a word with you in private?"
121368,468,132,619000,Homer Simpson,SIMPSON BOAT,I don't trust that guy. I bet he killed everyone on that boat himself.
121369,468,133,623000,Marge Simpson,SIMPSON BOAT,That's crazy talk!
121370,468,134,624000,Roger,SIMPSON BOAT,Excuse me...
121372,468,136,626000,Roger,Boat,"You've both been so kind to me, I baked you this pie."
121373,468,137,633000,Marge Simpson,Boat,That is so sweet!
121374,468,138,635000,Homer Simpson,Boat,Why do pie makers get all the girls?
121376,468,140,640000,Marge Simpson,Bathroom,Why did you do that?
121377,468,141,641000,Homer Simpson,Bathroom,It was poisoned.
121378,468,142,641000,Marge Simpson,Bathroom,No it wasn't!
121379,468,143,643000,Homer Simpson,Bathroom,"Well, it was rhubarb."
121380,468,144,644000,Marge Simpson,Bathroom,"No, it was berry-peach!"
121381,468,146,645000,Homer Simpson,Cabin,Berry-peach?! That's my favorite!
121383,468,148,647000,Marge Simpson,LAVATORY,"Please! Homer, I am so sick of this unmotivated, jealous..."
121384,468,149,654000,Marge Simpson,LAVATORY,The pie was poisoned. You were right! I guess we've got to kill him before he kills us.
121385,468,150,662000,Homer Simpson,LAVATORY,"Well, we'd better do it quick. Because he's making scones!"
121386,468,151,669000,Homer Simpson,LAVATORY,"They should call this one ""recipe for murder."""
121387,468,152,669000,Marge Simpson,LAVATORY,"What do you mean, this one?"
121388,468,153,674000,Homer Simpson,LAVATORY,Never mind.
121390,468,155,680000,Marge Simpson,Homer And Marge's Yacht,"Oh Roger, would you hand me the suntan oil?"
121391,468,156,693000,Homer Simpson,Homer And Marge's Yacht,"Ooh, got a text."
121392,468,157,695000,Marge Simpson,Homer And Marge's Yacht,Now!
121393,468,158,700000,Marge Simpson,Homer And Marge's Yacht,Dear God. We just killed a man.
121394,468,159,703000,Homer Simpson,Homer And Marge's Yacht,"Yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea."
121395,468,160,713000,Homer Simpson,Homer And Marge's Yacht,Come 'n' get it barnacles!
121398,468,163,737000,Marge Simpson,ALBATROSS,Roger was telling the truth!
121399,468,164,739000,Homer Simpson,ALBATROSS,This proves nothing. Roger could've been the one that killed them!
121400,468,165,743000,Marge Simpson,ALBATROSS,Soy sauce!
121401,468,166,744000,Marge Simpson,ALBATROSS,Low sodium!
121402,468,167,747000,Homer Simpson,ALBATROSS,Then... his story was true!
121403,468,168,750000,Marge Simpson,ALBATROSS,We killed an innocent man. We're murderers! Murderers!
121404,468,169,758000,Roger,ALBATROSS,"Well, if it isn't my saviors."
121405,468,170,763000,Homer Simpson,ALBATROSS,"Hey pal, how ya been?"
121406,468,171,764000,Roger,ALBATROSS,"Don't you ""pal"" me. Why did you try to kill me?!"
121407,468,172,768000,Homer Simpson,ALBATROSS,The pie you baked us killed that shark!
121408,468,173,771000,Roger,ALBATROSS,The pie was clean! The shark died from the fuel leaking out of your boat.
121410,468,175,780000,Roger,ALBATROSS,Oh goody. The monkey got a hold of a spear gun.
121411,468,176,787000,Marge Simpson,ALBATROSS,Why did you do that?
121412,468,177,789000,Homer Simpson,ALBATROSS,"We had to kill him, or he'd tell people we tried to kill him."
121413,468,178,792000,Businessman,ALBATROSS,What the devil's going on here?
121414,468,179,794000,Marge Simpson,ALBATROSS,You're alive?
121415,468,180,795000,Businessman,ALBATROSS,"Yes, I suspected our host would poison us, so I gave everyone an antidote before dinner."
121416,468,181,801000,Homer Simpson,ALBATROSS,Looks like you've got a flair for avoiding death.
121417,468,182,805000,Homer Simpson,ALBATROSS,"Oh, come on! Just a second..."
121418,468,183,812000,Homer Simpson,ALBATROSS,Bankers away!
121421,468,186,822000,Homer Simpson,ALBATROSS,I repeat: no one will ever know.
121422,468,187,826000,Marge Simpson,ALBATROSS,We'll know.
121423,468,188,830000,Homer Simpson,ALBATROSS,"Marge, what are you doing? That pie is poisoned!"
121424,468,189,834000,Marge Simpson,ALBATROSS,I can't live with the guilt.
121425,468,190,840000,Homer Simpson,ALBATROSS,She just wanted to ride bikes through New England. But those seats hurt my ass!
121427,468,192,854000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ever wonder what she thinks about?
121428,468,193,856000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Just sugarplums and buttercups.
121431,468,196,909000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey, what's that weird look on all those girls' faces?"
121432,468,197,913000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,It's something you've never seen: they're smitten.
121433,468,198,916000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh I've seen it, especially when I do this."
121435,468,200,925000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Well, he is cute. But I'm sure a boy like him would never say hello to me."
121436,468,201,929000,Edmund,Springfield Elementary School,Hello.
121437,468,202,932000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I love your pallor.
121439,468,204,934000,Otto Mann,Bus,Why is there a steering wheel in my bedroom?
121441,468,206,940000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,How'd you do that?
121442,468,207,942000,Edmund,Bus,"Oh, it's these cheap school buses, with their squishy metal. On another subject, you have beautiful eyes."
121443,468,208,950000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,They're just dots in circles.
121444,468,209,962000,Otto Mann,Bus,What? Me again?
121445,468,210,967000,Edmund,Bus,Come with me!
121446,468,211,981000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,"You're a vampire! I should be scared, but I'm not."
121447,468,212,984000,Edmund,Bus,Let us move between the trees the way a bat does -- by jumping!
121449,468,214,995000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bus,Lisa's fallen for a vampire? That makes me so angry. I feel the change coming!
121452,468,217,1008000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Edmund's almost here, so PLEASE nobody be themselves!"
121453,468,218,1010000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know, I know. Don't serve garlic... don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake... don't ask him if he knows Frankenstein. It's racist somehow."
121455,468,220,1023000,Edmund,Simpson Foyer,"Sorry, my Dad insisted on coming."
121456,468,221,1027000,Edmund,Simpson Foyer,"Dad, I don't need a chaperone. I'm four hundred years old!"
121457,468,222,1032000,Vampire Dad,Simpson Foyer,"You live in my crypt, you play by my rules!"
121458,468,223,1035000,Edmund,Simpson Foyer,You're tearing me apart!
121459,468,224,1037000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Foyer,Dinner is served. I tried to make what Homer said you liked.
121460,468,225,1041000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Foyer,I get the drumstick!
121462,468,227,1050000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, okay. If a mosquito bites you, does it become a vampire too?"
121463,468,228,1056000,Vampire Dad,Simpson Home,Yes.
121464,468,229,1057000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, okay. If you bite your tongue, does it become a vampire?"
121465,468,230,1060000,Vampire Dad,Simpson Home,"Look, I'm more than just a vampire. I'm a nut for Dixieland jazz."
121466,468,231,1070000,Edmund,Simpson Home,You said you weren't going to bring that.
121467,468,232,1072000,Vampire Dad,Simpson Home,I said I might not.
121468,468,233,1077000,Edmund,Simpson Home,They say vampires live forever. But I die -- of embarrassment every day!
121469,468,234,1082000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I know just how you feel!
121470,468,235,1086000,Edmund,Simpson Home,"Let's fly, Lisa. Keep your mouth closed or you'll swallow a lot of bugs."
121471,468,236,1094000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Get them back -- she can't get neck-holes! It's picture day tomorrow!
121474,468,239,1100000,Homer Simpson,Car,"Man, you vamps got it made... you sleep all day..."
121475,468,240,1103000,Vampire Dad,Car,"And, because we only drive at night, we can really time the traffic lights. Vatch..."
121476,468,241,1107000,Vampire Dad,Car,Green! Green! Green! Boom! Green! Yes! Boom! Green! Good! Boom!
121478,468,243,1118000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"Boy, this place has every kind of vampire there is."
121479,468,244,1128000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,Excuse me?
121480,468,245,1129000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,Have you seen these kids?
121481,468,246,1131000,Kount,Springfield Streets,I did -- and they were sneaking kisses. One kiss. Ha ha ha. Two kisses. Ha ha ha. Three kisses...
121482,468,247,1142000,Vampire Dad,Springfield Streets,There they are!
121483,468,248,1145000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,Super-Team -- fly!
121484,468,249,1149000,Vampire Dad,Springfield Streets,"I'm Dracula, not The Hulk."
121485,468,250,1151000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,Hyah! Hyah!
121487,468,252,1158000,Lisa Simpson,CHURCH BELL TOWER,"Bite me now, Edmund -- and we'll both be vampires!"
121488,468,253,1161000,Vampire Dad,CHURCH BELL TOWER,"Get your neck away from my son's teeth, you evil temptress!"
121489,468,254,1165000,Lisa Simpson,CHURCH BELL TOWER,"Sir, I'm not trying to take your son away from you. I plan to be a part of your rich culture, and organize media-friendly events to help combat all the unfair vampire stereotypes."
121490,468,255,1175000,Vampire Dad,CHURCH BELL TOWER,"Vow! Vow! Now I know what you see in this girl! Bite her, my son, and you both will be eight forever."
121491,468,256,1183000,Lisa Simpson,CHURCH BELL TOWER,"Eight forever? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I can't spend eternity using kid scissors. They barely cut anything!"
121492,468,257,1190000,Edmund,CHURCH BELL TOWER,Too late. The bloodlust is upon me.
121493,468,258,1195000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH BELL TOWER,"Back off, you unholy dreamboat!"
121494,468,259,1199000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH BELL TOWER,Pretty ironic -- a cross being used to kill someone.
121496,468,261,1211000,Edmund,CHURCH BELL TOWER,"Father, you're hurt!"
121497,468,262,1212000,Vampire Dad,CHURCH BELL TOWER,"Yes, but at least you are safe, my son."
121498,468,263,1215000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH BELL TOWER,"Whoa, you blood-sucking freaks love your kids too?"
121499,468,264,1219000,Vampire Dad,CHURCH BELL TOWER,I remember when he was a baby... I'd sneak up to his crib in the middle of the day to make sure he was still not breathing...
121501,468,266,1230000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH BELL TOWER,"Well, nobody loves his kids more than me!"
121502,468,267,1233000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH BELL TOWER,Come and get it.
121503,468,268,1237000,Edmund,CHURCH BELL TOWER,"Die, fatso!"
121504,468,269,1240000,Vampire Dad,CHURCH BELL TOWER,His blood! It's full of cholesterol!
121505,468,270,1242000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH BELL TOWER,And not the good kind!
121506,468,271,1247000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH BELL TOWER,Woo-hoo!
121507,468,272,1248000,Lisa Simpson,CHURCH BELL TOWER,"Uh, Dad? They turned you into a vampire."
121508,468,273,1252000,Homer Simpson,CHURCH BELL TOWER,Yes! I can fly! See you back at the house!
