69163,273,215,980000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Car,Mmm... pistol whip.
69164,273,216,983000,Kent Brockman,Burns's Car,"Local authorities are confident the killer bees are just curious and won't bother us if we don't bother them. On a serious note, two local residents have been missing for the last twenty minutes. We take you now live to Barney's Bowlarama, and the last man who saw them, C. Montgomery Burns."
69165,273,217,998000,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns's Car,"I don't understand. She was my young, sexy fiancée, he was my sexually virile best friend, and they just drove off in my Bugatti Sexarossa. How could this ever have happened?"
69166,273,218,1010000,Kent Brockman,Burns's Car,"Well, according to our Audience Insta-poll, forty-six percent say ""You're Too Old"", and thirty-seven percent say ""She's A Skank""."
69167,273,219,1010000,Snake Jailbird,Burns's Car,Almost there.
69169,273,221,1027000,Homer Simpson,Snake's Hideout,"Wow, who do you have to kill to get a place like this?"
69170,273,222,1031000,Snake Jailbird,Snake's Hideout,I think his name was Gustafson.
69173,273,224,1036000,Gloria,Snake's Hideout,Let me guess. Now you're going to start working him over with the brass knuckles. You Are so predictable.
69174,273,225,1045000,Homer Simpson,Snake's Hideout,You know what would be surprising? A foot massage.
69175,273,226,1047000,Snake Jailbird,Snake's Hideout,Shut up!
69176,273,227,1049000,Gloria,Snake's Hideout,Beating a man to a bloody pulp isn't gonna impress me
69177,273,228,1052000,Snake Jailbird,Snake's Hideout,It used to. What if I beat him harder?
69178,273,229,1055000,Gloria,Snake's Hideout,"Wow, you don't get it."
69179,273,230,1057000,Homer Simpson,Snake's Hideout,"Um, has the ship sailed on my foot massage suggestion?"
69182,273,233,1063000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"Don't worry, Mr. Burns. We'll track down Simpson with your vehicle's anti-theft system."
69183,273,234,1068000,Anti-theft Device,Springfield Police Station,Car gone! Car gone!
69184,273,235,1070000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,We know that. W-Where has it gone to?
69185,273,236,1073000,Anti-theft Device,Springfield Police Station,Car gone! Car gone! Car gone!
69186,273,237,1075000,Lou,Springfield Police Station,"Uh, Chief, this yokel says he saw Simpson driving out near Hickton."
69187,273,238,1079000,Cletus Spuckler,Springfield Police Station,Yuh-huh. My peepers don't lie.
69188,273,239,1082000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield Police Station,"That's nice work, Lou. Lock 'im up."
69190,273,241,1085000,Cletus Spuckler,Springfield Police Station,"Hey, hey I want that lawyer what wears a cowboy hat."
69192,273,243,1092000,Chief Wiggum,Snake's Hideout,"Release the girl, Simpson."
69193,273,244,1094000,Lou,Snake's Hideout,"I think I can take him out, Chief."
69194,273,245,1098000,Chief Wiggum,Snake's Hideout,"O-oh, that's a sweet shot. He's tied to a chair."
69195,273,246,1102000,Lisa Simpson,Snake's Hideout,That means Dad's not a kidnapper. He's a hostage.
69196,273,247,1107000,Snake Jailbird,Snake's Hideout,"Get off my lawn, coppers! Or I'll totally turn the sprinklers on."
69197,273,248,1112000,Chief Wiggum,Snake's Hideout,"Come on, Snake. You don't wanna soak all these people."
69198,273,249,1116000,Kent Brockman,Snake's Hideout,"We're in minute two of this standoff. What's the situation, Chief?"
69199,273,250,1120000,Chief Wiggum,Snake's Hideout,"Well, we have an officer sneaking around the house, Kent. So, ah, unless they have a television in there or can hear my loud talking..."
69200,273,251,1127000,Chief Wiggum,Snake's Hideout,It--
69201,273,252,1128000,Eddie,Snake's Hideout,Ow! Ow! Ow!
69202,273,253,1130000,Chief Wiggum,Snake's Hideout,"Well, I guess that answers that, doesn't it?"
69203,273,254,1132000,Snake Jailbird,Snake's Hideout,"I swear I can change, Gloria. I'm taking classes in computer fraud."
69205,273,255,1137000,Gloria,Snake's Hideout,"That's what you said about the telemarketing scams, but you didn't stick with it."
69206,273,256,1142000,Snake Jailbird,Snake's Hideout,I don't like bothering people at home.
69207,273,257,1145000,Homer Simpson,Snake's Hideout,Good fire. Good fire. Keep burning. Almost there.
69208,273,258,1150000,Homer Simpson,Snake's Hideout,Just a little more.
69211,273,261,1166000,C. Montgomery Burns,Snake's Hideout,My Gloria is still inside! Save her!
69212,273,262,1170000,Chief Wiggum,Snake's Hideout,"Ah, it's too dangerous! Ah-- But I got a sister you might like. She's completely hairless, like those cats."
69213,273,263,1176000,C. Montgomery Burns,Snake's Hideout,I don't care if she's Miss Hairless America... I'm spoken for. Now step aside -- I'll save Gloria myself.
69214,273,264,1183000,Chief Wiggum,Snake's Hideout,"Y-- You? Ah, no offense, but you're a decrepit monkey skeleton."
69215,273,265,1188000,C. Montgomery Burns,Snake's Hideout,"Perhaps, but this monkey skeleton is in love."
69216,273,266,1201000,C. Montgomery Burns,Snake's Hideout,Who am I kidding? I'm just a feeble old man.
69217,273,267,1206000,C. Montgomery Burns,Snake's Hideout,Gloria!
69218,273,268,1213000,Lisa Simpson,Snake's Hideout,He did it! He saved her!
69219,273,269,1217000,Lisa Simpson,Snake's Hideout,"Well, the important thing is, they're both safe."
69220,273,270,1224000,Kent Brockman,Snake's Hideout,"I know you've been through a lot, ma'am, but we need you to stand in front of the burning house and say ""Channel 6 is hot, hot, hot."""
69221,273,271,1224000,Homer Simpson,Snake's Hideout,"Wow, Mr. Burns, how did you do that?"
69222,273,272,1235000,C. Montgomery Burns,Snake's Hideout,"Never forget, Homer, there's no muscle stronger than the human heart."
69223,273,273,1240000,Homer Simpson,Snake's Hideout,What about the wiener? A guy on TV lifted a can of paint with his.
69224,273,274,1245000,C. Montgomery Burns,Snake's Hideout,Yes.
69225,273,275,1246000,Gloria,Snake's Hideout,"Oh, Monty, you saved me. And to think, I was once in love with that dirty low-life..."
69226,273,276,1248000,Gloria,Snake's Hideout,"With his arrogant smirk, gutter mouth, tough-guy attitude, macho tattoos, hair that can't be tamed, prison-sculpted body..."
69227,273,277,1266000,Marge Simpson,Snake's Hideout,Uh-oh.
69228,273,278,1269000,Gloria,Snake's Hideout,"I'm sorry, Monty."
69229,273,279,1271000,Gloria,Snake's Hideout,"Oh Snake, don't ever change."
69230,273,280,1276000,C. Montgomery Burns,Snake's Hideout,"I don't get it, Simpson. I'm a bad boy."
69231,273,281,1278000,Homer Simpson,Snake's Hideout,"Oh, I know."
69232,273,282,1281000,C. Montgomery Burns,Snake's Hideout,I'm absolutely evil!
69233,273,283,1282000,Bart Simpson,Snake's Hideout,"You're preachin' to the choir, man."
69234,273,284,1284000,C. Montgomery Burns,Snake's Hideout,What do I have to do? Grow a devil beard?
69144,273,285,1287000,Marge Simpson,Snake's Hideout,Devil beard?
69172,273,286,1288000,C. Montgomery Burns,Snake's Hideout,"You know, a little goatee thing."
69235,273,287,1290000,Homer Simpson,Snake's Hideout,You mean a Van Dyke?
69236,273,288,1292000,C. Montgomery Burns,Snake's Hideout,"No, a Van Dyke has a mustache, doesn't it?"
69237,273,289,1294000,Lisa Simpson,Snake's Hideout,I think it can.
69238,273,290,1295000,Bart Simpson,Snake's Hideout,Are you talking about a soul patch?
