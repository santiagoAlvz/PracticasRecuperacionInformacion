110452,426,33,164000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,"Gee. Compared to you, my life is one big half-day!"

110454,426,35,175000,Seymour Skinner,Moe's Tavern,"Thanks, Homer. I don't think the school pep squad could've cheered me up more. And they were state runners up in nineteen ninety-seven!"
110455,426,36,184000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, that was amazing -- he actually felt better comin' outta the break-up than he did goin' in."
110456,426,37,188000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Say Homer, you're real good at this. Think you could dump my girlfriend Doreen for me?"
110457,426,38,191000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Doreen? She's cheated on you with everyone -- well, except for me. And I've showered her with gifts! Fancy soaps and massage oils and uh... what have ya..."

110562,426,143,603000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie... I'm not sure about this new business of yours. You're making it too easy for couples to break up just because they hit a rough patch.
110564,426,144,611000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I know this is hard on you, but in time you'll come to see it's for the best."
110565,426,145,615000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's one of your breakup lines!

110572,426,152,669000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Homie?
110573,426,153,670000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, I'm getting' out of the break-up business and I don't know if I'll ever sleep soundly again."
110574,426,154,675000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Well maybe...
110576,426,156,688000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,"Wow, so this is what this is."

110583,426,163,710000,Man In Bar,Hotel,"It's kind of a secret, so shut the door most of the way."
110584,426,164,717000,Man In Bar,Hotel,We found a way to make this tournament interesting. We bet on the matches.
110585,426,165,722000,Homer Simpson,Hotel,"Really? Well, I did bring this envelope full of money."
110586,426,166,725000,Homer Simpson,Hotel,"And these days, betting in a bar is safer than any stock, bond or real estate investment."
110587,426,167,730000,Bartender,Hotel,"Agreed. So, who are you gonna bet on?"
110588,426,168,732000,Homer Simpson,Hotel,I want you to put it all on my little girl. And parlay with the Asian kid.
110589,426,169,737000,Asian Man,Hotel,"He has a name, you know!"
110590,426,170,738000,Homer Simpson,Hotel,What is it?
110591,426,171,740000,Asian Man,Hotel,I don't know. He's not my kid.
110593,426,173,744000,Lisa Simpson,Ballroom,I win!
110594,426,174,745000,Homer Simpson,Ballroom,"She won! And like any prudent gambler, I know when to walk away: never!"

110596,426,177,796000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,"Dad, I could actually win this thing!"
110597,426,178,799000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,"And when you win, I win. I'll explain that to you on your deathbed."
110598,426,179,805000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,"My only fear is, I always sabotage myself when I'm on the verge of happiness."
110599,426,180,810000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,You what?
110600,426,181,810000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,"In my young life I've seen that every time I'm about to achieve true happiness, some little piece of me says ""you don't deserve this."" And another little piece says ""I agree."""
110601,426,182,810000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,"Right, right. But will it happen this time?"
110602,426,183,824000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,"With my luck, I bet it will. It's practically a sure thing."

110608,426,189,840000,Bartender,Springfield Hyatt,I'll take your money. But I won't look you in the eye.
110609,426,190,844000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,Fine. I won't look you in the eye.
110610,426,191,851000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,Have I made the bet yet?
110611,426,192,853000,Bartender,Springfield Hyatt,I got it.
110612,426,193,854000,Announcer,Springfield Hyatt,"We're down to our final two contestants. But before they compete, we would like to pay tribute to all the words that have been removed from the dictionary in the past year."
110613,426,194,882000,Gil Gunderson,Springfield Hyatt,"You know, my wife Shirley, she's the real crossword ace in our family. Fills in those letters fast as hail on a tin roof: ping-ping-ping, she's done. Shirley passed away two years ago. But I'm still not over it."
110614,426,195,895000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,"Oh, that's so sad!"
110615,426,196,896000,Gil Gunderson,Springfield Hyatt,"Hey, what can you do? Life keeps changing the music, but you gotta keep up the cha-cha-cha, huh?"
110616,426,197,908000,Gil Gunderson,Springfield Hyatt,"Let's see, I'll spread some Q's around. That'll get my brain goin'."
110617,426,198,910000,Gil Gunderson,Springfield Hyatt,"Aw, I dropped my glasses! Shirley, baby, I let you down."
110618,426,199,925000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,"Hey, there are no lenses in these glasses..."
110619,426,200,928000,Gil Gunderson,Springfield Hyatt,"Let's see, that's ""ENRICO FERMI"", and there you've got the ""PET SHOP BOYS"", and cross the T and zing the Z and skit skat skoodily I'm all the way home."
110620,426,201,937000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,Lisa got hustled!
110621,426,202,940000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Hyatt,I blew it again.
