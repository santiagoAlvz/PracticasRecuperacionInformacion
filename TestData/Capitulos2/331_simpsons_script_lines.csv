85324,331,8,49000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,"Hmm, not Otto -- he'd drive us off a cliff."
85325,331,9,52000,Otto Mann,School Bus,Off a cliff? That would solve everything!
85326,331,10,58000,Bart Simpson,School Bus,Bingo.

85347,331,32,154000,Grampa Simpson,UNCLE TYRONE'S HOUSE,I'm only rotting on the right side.
85348,331,33,156000,Homer Simpson,UNCLE TYRONE'S HOUSE,I'll right-side you!
85349,331,34,159000,Marge Simpson,UNCLE TYRONE'S HOUSE,"All right, kids, you don't have to go. But I insist we do something tonight as a family. We'll play board games, put photos in an album, measure how much you've grown..."
