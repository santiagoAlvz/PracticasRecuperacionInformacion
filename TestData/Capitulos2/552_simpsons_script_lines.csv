143362,552,14,84000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Ah, July fourth-- No fireworks?! Can't this stupid city entertain me one night a year?"
143363,552,15,92000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,The City's broke. The fire department has to raise money by delivering pizza.
143364,552,16,100000,Mother,Simpson Kitchen,My baby... back ribs!
143365,552,17,104000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Marge, when you're broke, that's when you've got to keep up appearances. The Fourth of July is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top, and leans into America's car window. God bless her."
143367,552,19,118000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,The last day of school. Field Day. WhEN you learn to balance an egg on a spoon...
143368,552,20,121000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,And run with your leg tied to someone who wouldn't talk to you all year.

143401,552,53,263000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,Perhaps I should take my action to Willie.
143402,552,54,266000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,I ain't makin' book no more. I lost the deed to me shack!
143403,552,55,269000,Üter,Springfield Elementary School,"You are late with the rent, Willie."

143412,552,63,302000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"As the runners go into the first turn, Lewis is in the lead! Followed by Lovejoy's daughter, Fat Tony's nephew, Brockman's little girl, and Jailbird's kid! The Frank Sinatra kid, well, he's doin' it his way! Rounding out the pack are all the kids that we never see. What's this? Milhouse takes the lead?! The same boy who sprained his shoulder doing the Pledge of Allegiance?!"
143413,552,64,326000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh-oh. If Milhouse wins this race, we're out a fortune."
143414,552,65,329000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,"Don't worry. The race takes a turn through the trees where no one can see. When Milhouse gets there, you know what to do."

143424,552,75,377000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,The best day of my life just turned into every other day of my life.
143425,552,76,386000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Bart faced a terrible choice: take a beating with his friend or slither off like a coward. And like he did with every multiple choice question he ever saw, Bart chose ""B."""
143426,552,77,392000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,The winner is Bart Simpson!
143427,552,78,409000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Bart won a blue ribbon... but was it worth it?
143428,552,79,411000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Lisa! Bath time!
143429,552,80,413000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Mom! I'm narrating!

143431,552,82,418000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Fine.
143433,552,84,423000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"As the pin on the back of the blue ribbon made its way through Bart's shirt and into its housing, the seeds of his comeuppance flew out of the woods."
143434,552,85,432000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield Elementary School,Son! What happened to you in the dark place behind the school? Something good?
143435,552,86,439000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,I'm afraid I don't remember.
143436,552,87,443000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield Elementary School,It looks like Milhouse has traumatic amnesia. He may never remember what happened to him. The most important thing is: the race results are now official.
143437,552,88,450000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield Elementary School,Now I've got to look at some severe cases of ice cream headache.
143439,552,90,475000,Milhouse Van Houten,DREAMSCAPE,"Help me, Bart."

143443,552,94,490000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Why am I having nightmares? I'm no coward.
143445,552,96,494000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"A chicken feather? Why would you hand this to me? Oh, you must've figured out I chickened out during the race! Well who are you to judge me?!"
143446,552,97,504000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,I suck?! You suck!
143447,552,98,506000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"While Bart was being outwitted by a baby, something was coming to a boil in our Pop's brainpan."
143449,552,100,512000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, if this stupid, one-reactor town won't put on a fireworks show, I will. I've mapped it out."
143450,552,101,523000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Maybe we should just light sparklers in the back yard.
143451,552,102,526000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I've had my problems with sparklers.
143452,552,103,530000,Little Homer,Simpson Home,Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun!
143454,552,105,533000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Fourth of July fireworks were a different story. They meant more to my Dad than my Mom could ever know.
143456,552,107,540000,Lisa Simpson,Park,It was the one night of every year that he never heard his parents argue. He figured it was because they loved the fireworks just as much as he did.
143457,552,108,549000,Mona Simpson,Park,I want to take a class!
148208,552,109,551000,Young Grampa,Park,Why can't you be happy ironing my shirts?!
143458,552,110,555000,Mona Simpson,Park,I need space!
148209,552,111,556000,Young Grampa,Park,Then close your eyes and go to Hawaii!
143459,552,112,560000,Lisa Simpson,Park,"With his mom gone, Homer needed a hero. And no one was a bigger hero than the magical little man behind the controls."
143460,552,113,570000,Little Homer,Park,Are you God?
143461,552,114,572000,Giuseppe,Park,"No, no, but I shoot rockets into his-a face. Here's-a my card. Don't forget to treasure it."
143462,552,116,584000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Now let's see... which pants have that card? board shorts, interested shorts, here we are."

143466,552,120,595000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,"Giuseppe, I want you to come out of retirement for the greatest fireworks show of your career."
143467,552,121,601000,Giuseppe,Apartment,Why do you come here and remind me of a time in my life when I made a-tons of money doing a-what I love?
143468,552,122,608000,Homer Simpson,Apartment,"If the Expendables movies have taught us anything, it's that people do their best work after they're old and forgotten."
143469,552,123,615000,Giuseppe,Apartment,Well I am younger than Sylvester Stallone. I will do it!
143471,552,125,624000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,Hey buddy.
143472,552,126,626000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"Bart, my truest friend."
143473,552,127,628000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,I brought you a cake. Read it.
143474,552,128,631000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,"That's an odd message, but who am I to argue with icing? Will you watch ""Cassidy the Crocodile"" with me?"
143475,552,129,638000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,Um... that's kind of a baby show.
143476,552,130,641000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,It's all I can handle now.
143477,552,131,646000,Cassidy The Crocodile,Van Houten Home,"Henrietta Kitten, will you marry me?"
143478,552,132,649000,Henrietta Kitten,Van Houten Home,"Meow, meow, maybe!"
143479,552,133,651000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,Why would a kitten marry a crocodile? Wouldn't it eat her?
143480,552,134,656000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Shush. Suspension of disbelief.
143481,552,135,658000,Cassidy The Crocodile,Van Houten Home,Friends help friends in trouble.
143482,552,136,661000,Bart Simpson,Van Houten Home,No! Turn it off! It's too intense for me!
143483,552,137,664000,Milhouse Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Some guys just can't take crocodiles.
143484,552,138,667000,Kirk Van Houten,Van Houten Home,Is it over yet?
143486,552,140,670000,Cletus Spuckler,RURAL AREA,"And if you're dissatisfied for any reason, I will refund your money in the form of acorns."
143487,552,141,681000,Giuseppe,RURAL AREA,"This ""gunpowder."" It has a-crystal meth in it."
143488,552,142,684000,Cletus Spuckler,RURAL AREA,Crystal meth? Then what the heck did I sell to them Colombian drug lords?!
143489,552,143,690000,Cletus Spuckler,RURAL AREA,Brandine! We're feudin' with the Escobars again!

143499,552,153,729000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Yeah, yeah. Thank you, Mel. But I am not here to talk about myself. Milhouse, would you join me at the podium?"
143500,552,154,737000,Drederick Tatum,Springfield Town Square,"What's going on? Seriously, what, what's transpiring?"
143501,552,155,740000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"I've gotta set things straight. During that same race, my friend Milhouse was in the lead, when something horrible happened..."
143502,552,156,748000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Bart knew the worst thing to do was pile lie upon lie, and that's exactly what he did."
143503,552,157,754000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Rather than try to figure out what happened, Milhouse had the courage to move on. To me, that's a hero."
143505,552,159,760000,Drederick Tatum,Springfield Town Square,Nicely done. Now we will give out free rubber bracelets. Do not wear them to bed. They smell like truck tires. They're disgusting.
143506,552,160,772000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Town Square,Crotch or forehead?
143507,552,161,774000,DOLPH,Springfield Town Square,Uh... forehead for once.
143509,552,163,789000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Town Square,Bart Simpson! You ran away when I was getting beat up!
143511,552,165,795000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Town Square,Bart's a coward!
143512,552,166,796000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Town Square,He lied to us!

143514,552,168,800000,Tattoo Artist,Springfield Town Square,"Uh, I could make it a bag of groceries?"
143515,552,169,803000,Drederick Tatum,Springfield Town Square,"All right, make sure there's some French bread sticking out."
143516,552,170,805000,Drederick Tatum,Springfield Town Square,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow!

143523,552,176,830000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,That's what put me in this dump!
143524,552,177,832000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Grampa, everyone's callin' me a coward."
143525,552,178,835000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Well, join the club! Anyone who makes it to old age has got to be part coward."
143526,552,179,840000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Come on. You were in World War Two.
143527,552,180,842000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Do you know how I survived D-Day?
148210,552,181,847000,Young Grampa,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Don't worry, just a day at the beach!"
148211,552,183,854000,Young Grampa,Ship,I'll be back around nineteen forty-six!
143529,552,184,858000,Bart Simpson,Ship,But don't people hate cowards?
143530,552,185,860000,Jasper Beardly,Ship,Sure do. But we outlive the brave!
143531,552,186,863000,Grampa Simpson,Ship,Leaving us cowards to make time with the heroes' widows!
143532,552,187,866000,Old Jewish Man,Ship,After Korea I was drowning in boobies.

143536,552,191,878000,Grampa Simpson,Ship,"So do I. But I get back to sleep by counting the men I let down. There's Jerry, Izzy, Brooklyn, the O'Donnell boys, the lost ship: P.T.-108, the Poor Buggers of Meatloaf Ridge, the Andrew sisters..."
143537,552,192,903000,Bart Simpson,Ship,I understand. You have standards.
143538,552,193,909000,Milhouse Van Houten,Ship,This is an angry sleepover. I'm only doin' it 'cause it was on the books.
143539,552,194,915000,Lisa Simpson,Ship,"While Bart was in Hell, Homer was happily surrounded by fire and brimstone."
143541,552,196,920000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Okay. Let's make some fireworks.
143542,552,197,923000,Giuseppe,Springfield Street,Now drive slowly and carefully to my workshop. It's in-a the Cobblestone a-District.
143543,552,198,935000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Street,Oh thank God. A rickety bridge.
143544,552,199,941000,Giuseppe,Springfield Street,Don't worry. We'll be safe in the gas lamp district.
143546,552,201,973000,Homer Simpson,GIUSEPPE'S WORKSPACE,Can I pitch something?
143547,552,202,974000,Giuseppe,GIUSEPPE'S WORKSPACE,Go ahead.
