77316,302,104,455000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, you've always been cool to me. But Homer is a lousy dad and I'm not gonna take it anymore."
77317,302,105,461000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, my dad was lousy and I didn't sue him. I just dumped him in the cheapest home I could find."

77328,302,116,498000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courthouse,Mr. Simpson. Your son alleges that you have an anger management problem...
77329,302,117,503000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,"Why you little...! Um, I'm sorry, Judge. That's a rare lapse in my normally calm demeanor."

77337,302,125,529000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,"Son, I just want you to know, whatever that judge decides, I'm gonna be the best dad I can."
77338,302,126,536000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,No judge would send a pre-teen out on his own...
77339,302,127,539000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Woo hoo! You're still mine! And you thought I was a bad dad before.
77340,302,128,544000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,Except in this case.
77342,302,130,546000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,"That boy's about as safe living with you as a crawdad in a gumbo shack. Bart Simpson, I declare you emancipated!"
77343,302,131,554000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,"Further, I hereby garnish Homer's wages until Bart is fully repaid."
77344,302,132,558000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,Mmmmm... garnish.
77345,302,133,561000,Judge Harm,Courtroom,That means half your paycheck goes to Bart!
77346,302,134,563000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,What the--? Half goes to Bart. Half goes to my Vegas wife. What's left for Moe?
77347,302,135,569000,Marge Simpson,Courtroom,"Homer, don't make things worse."
77348,302,136,571000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,I'll show you worse!
77349,302,137,577000,Homer Simpson,Courtroom,I was told this would be televised!
77351,302,139,582000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,How can I fit my whole life into a suitcase? Maybe if I move that thing there... perfect.
77352,302,140,589000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, where are you gonna live?"
77353,302,141,591000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"With the money Dad's paying me, I rented a loft downtown."
77354,302,142,594000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Do you even know what a loft is?
77355,302,143,596000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,No. I assume it has hay.
77356,302,144,598000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I'm gonna miss you."
77357,302,145,601000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Here's something to remember me by.

77364,302,152,624000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh honey, I can't believe this is happening. I'll miss you so much."

77376,302,164,687000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Attaboy! We just won the World Series! You and me together! Yeah!
77379,302,167,695000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He should have done that with the real Bart when he had the chance.
77381,302,169,702000,Bart Simpson,LOFT,"Being a free man is great, Milhouse. I can draw on myself with a magic marker."

77438,302,226,962000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Loft,"...And for every syringe I find, I get a dollar."
77439,302,227,965000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Loft,"Well, that's great, honey."
77441,302,228,968000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Loft,"You know son, I've been doing a lot of thinking. I was wrong to exploit you, and I won't do it again."
77442,302,229,973000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Loft,"Thanks Dad, that means a lot to me."
77443,302,230,976000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Loft,"So, do you think you might see your way clear to moving back in with your maw and me?"
77444,302,231,982000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Loft,"Sorry, no can do. I'm taking off for six months to join the Skewed Tour."
77445,302,232,986000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Loft,"Skewed Tour? The traveling festival of rock 'n' roll, skateboarding and extreme sports?"
77446,302,233,991000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Loft,And nipple piercing.
77448,302,235,993000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Loft,"Don't worry, they're clip-ons."
77450,302,237,998000,Martin Prince,SKEWED TOUR,"Behold, the delightful unicorn I got at the face-painting pavilion."
77451,302,238,1002000,Jimbo Jones,SKEWED TOUR,"Dude, that was a tattoo parlor."
77453,302,240,1007000,DOLPH,SKEWED TOUR,He's suffered enough.
77454,302,241,1009000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,SKEWED TOUR,"Yeah, but on the other hand..."
77455,302,242,1013000,Event Announcer,SKEWED TOUR,"Just a reminder: If you're getting bogus returns on your investments...contact Goldman Sachs, the skewwwed financial planners. Up next on the half-pipe, boarding legend Tony Hawk."
77456,302,243,1032000,Homer Simpson,SKEWED TOUR,"Psst, Mr. Hawk. May I have a word with you?"
77457,302,244,1035000,Tony Hawk,SKEWED TOUR,An extreme word?
77458,302,245,1035000,Homer Simpson,SKEWED TOUR,Sure. My son is Bart Simpson and...
77459,302,246,1039000,Tony Hawk,SKEWED TOUR,I didn't say extreme to the max.
77460,302,247,1039000,Homer Simpson,SKEWED TOUR,Sorry. I just wanna win my son back so badly.
77461,302,248,1044000,Tony Hawk,SKEWED TOUR,I can relate. I'm a father myself. One day they're little shredders. And the next day they're grinding and gnashing their way to college.
77462,302,249,1051000,Homer Simpson,SKEWED TOUR,"Yeah, I make up words too. Anyway, I was wondering if you could pretend to lose to me in a skateboarding contest so I can be a hero to my boy again."
77463,302,250,1059000,Tony Hawk,SKEWED TOUR,"I'll lose millions in endorsements, but, okay."
77464,302,251,1062000,Tony Hawk,SKEWED TOUR,This board represents the ultimate in poser technology. It gives people the illusion they have talent.
77465,302,252,1068000,Homer Simpson,SKEWED TOUR,Groovy.
77466,302,253,1069000,Tony Hawk,SKEWED TOUR,Just lock your feet in and the board does all the work.
77467,302,254,1072000,Homer Simpson,SKEWED TOUR,All the work?
77468,302,255,1074000,Tony Hawk,SKEWED TOUR,"Fine. I'll lift you onto the board, too."
77440,302,256,1080000,Homer Simpson,SKEWED TOUR,Do it without the attitude or don't do it at all.
77470,302,258,1083000,Event Announcer,HALF-PIPE,Now the portion of our event where champion Tony Hawk may be challenged by any unknown member of the audience.
77471,302,259,1090000,Homer Simpson,HALF-PIPE,"I'm challenging you, Hawk. In front of all these outcasts and dreamers, who can't even get into the army, if you can believe it."
77472,302,260,1097000,Bart Simpson,HALF-PIPE,"Dad, how drunk are you?"
77473,302,261,1099000,Homer Simpson,HALF-PIPE,Not very!
77474,302,262,1101000,Tony Hawk,HALF-PIPE,"You're going down, Homer. Then back up. Then down and back up again. That's how the game is played."
77475,302,263,1106000,Marge Simpson,HALF-PIPE,I can't count how many times your father's done something crazy like this.
77476,302,264,1111000,Lisa Simpson,HALF-PIPE,"It's three hundred, Mom."
77477,302,265,1114000,Marge Simpson,HALF-PIPE,I could have sworn it was three hundred and two.
77478,302,266,1116000,Lisa Simpson,HALF-PIPE,Shhh.
77479,302,267,1125000,Homer Simpson,HALF-PIPE,Now to win back my son in comfort and style.
77480,302,268,1140000,Homer Simpson,HALF-PIPE,"You know, I could save money by buying separate nuts and mixing them at home."
77482,302,270,1152000,Tony Hawk,HALF-PIPE,"Man, I wanted him to look good. But not to show me up. It's time to take out the thrash."
77485,302,273,1180000,Homer Simpson,HALF-PIPE,"Woo hoo! I rule this pseudo sport! Come back to me, boy!"
77486,302,274,1185000,Bart Simpson,HALF-PIPE,"Dad, you don't understand. This was never about being cool. It was about you not caring how I felt."
77487,302,275,1191000,Homer Simpson,HALF-PIPE,"Aw, that's the dumbest thing I ever heard, you stupid little kid."
77488,302,276,1195000,Tony Hawk,HALF-PIPE,"Homer, you're heading for a parental face plant. Do a 180 emotional ollie."
77490,302,278,1201000,Homer Simpson,HALF-PIPE,"Finally, someone explains it to me in words I can understand. Look, boy. I know I did wrong and I am truly sorry."
77491,302,279,1210000,Homer Simpson,HALF-PIPE,"I put you in humiliating commercials for money, which I spent on myself. I just wish I had an opportunity to make things right."
77492,302,280,1218000,Lindsay Naegle,HALF-PIPE,"Mr. Simpson, I like the way you handled yourself on that board. Would you like to do a commercial for us?"
77493,302,281,1224000,Homer Simpson,HALF-PIPE,Anything... as long as I can give the money to my son.
77494,302,282,1228000,Lindsay Naegle,HALF-PIPE,"Excellent. I represent Viagrogaine, the topical rub for bald, impotent men."
77495,302,283,1233000,Homer Simpson,HALF-PIPE,Well... I am bald and important. Where do I sign?
77496,302,284,1238000,Commercial Actress,HALF-PIPE,"Oh, Steve. You're everything a girl could want. What's your secret?"
77497,302,285,1243000,Homer Simpson,HALF-PIPE,"Well, Kathy, I'll tell you. It's Viagrogaine. It gives you lots of hair and what you need down there. What are you waiting for, loser?"
77498,302,286,1251000,Announcer,HALF-PIPE,Possible side effects include loss of scalp and penis.
77500,302,288,1254000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What did they say about my scalp?
77501,302,289,1255000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Don't worry, Dad, it's just a commercial. No one will remember this in fifty years."
