121511,469,1,51000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"Mousey and Catsy, aren't they great? Now listen up, kids -- Krusty's sponsor, the Texxon family of gas stations, wants you to know that today's the last day of their ""Happy Little Elves"" giveaway!"
121512,469,2,65000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"It's Texxon's way of saying ""Sorry about those million dead pelicans."""
121514,469,4,65000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,"You'll really love, the intentionally scarce ""Baby Must-Have."""
121516,469,6,65000,Krusty the Clown,Simpson Home,Don'tcha want her beyond all reason?
121517,469,7,84000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maggie, you can't climb into the TV. If you could, I'd make Alex Trebek answer some questions."
121518,469,8,90000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, I think Maggie's just sad 'cause her set is missing ""Baby Must-Have."""
121519,469,9,90000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No child of mine will go without anything, ever! Except quality healthcare!"
121522,469,12,102000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,Didn't there used to be more Texxon stations?
121523,469,13,105000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Yes, but they sold a bunch off to that frozen yogurt chain."
121524,469,14,113000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Car,What a cheap date this is.
121525,469,15,116000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Car,"I'm not cheap, baby, I'm embarrassed to be seen with you. Big difference."
121529,469,19,125000,Homer Simpson,Texxon Station,"Nice part of town you got here. Too bad you keep it so far away. Now that we're best friends, can I get the baby elf?"
121530,469,20,132000,Cashier,Texxon Station,Pick a box -- you get what you get.
121531,469,21,135000,Homer Simpson,Texxon Station,You can't tell what's inside! Of all the times not to have x-ray vision.
121532,469,22,140000,Homer Simpson,Texxon Station,I'll take... that one.
121533,469,23,148000,Homer Simpson,Texxon Station,"Aw, this isn't the right one -- she wants the baby!"
121534,469,24,151000,Cashier,Texxon Station,I can't give you another toy till you buy another ten gallons of gas.
121535,469,25,155000,Homer Simpson,Texxon Station,You're lucky you're behind glass.
121536,469,26,157000,Cashier,Texxon Station,Ain't no glass.
121537,469,27,157000,Homer Simpson,Texxon Station,"Sure, it's easy to slap people when you're hidin' behind that glass!"
121538,469,28,164000,Cashier,Texxon Station,You have a good day.
121539,469,29,165000,Homer Simpson,Texxon Station,Drive all the way... get the wrong elf... ain't no glass... I'll show 'em -- I'll buy ten more gallons of their stupid gas!
121541,469,31,177000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Woo hoo!
121545,469,35,223000,Marge Simpson,Texxon Station,"Oh Homie, maybe we should call it a day."
121546,469,36,226000,Homer Simpson,Texxon Station,"Oh I'm sorry, Maggie, but even at your age, I'm sure you understand things can't always go your way, and that's why... I can't believe we didn't get that stupid elf!"
121548,469,38,241000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,Where the hell are we? I've never seen stores like these before.
121549,469,39,246000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,I know where we are! This is the neighborhood where I grew up!
121550,469,40,251000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Ooo, everything's changed! That tree used to be a smaller tree. And that food bank used to be a regular bank."
121551,469,41,259000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,The march of progress.
121552,469,42,261000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,There's my old house!
121553,469,43,266000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Someday when I'm a grownup, maybe I'll go back and look fondly at our house."
121554,469,44,270000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Well, stop in and say ""hi"" to me 'cause I'll still be there -- chillin' in my basement bachelor pad."
121555,469,45,275000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Be sure to water the flowers on my backyard grave.
121556,469,46,278000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,As long as I can dig you up and stick you on the front porch every Halloween.
121557,469,47,282000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Just don't dress me up like a woman.
121558,469,48,282000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,We'll see.
121560,469,50,286000,Abby,Simpson Car,I know what you folks are here for.
121561,469,51,288000,Abby,Simpson Car,Rabbits! I just kilt this one because it stopped bein' cute!
121562,469,52,292000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,We're not here for rabbit. I used to live in this house as a girl.
121563,469,53,296000,Abby,Simpson Car,"I live in it now as a woman! Hey, you wanna come on in? Take a look around?"
121564,469,54,300000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Oh, I'd love to, if it's not an imposition."
121565,469,55,303000,Abby,Simpson Car,"Well, as long as we don't have to feed this one."
121566,469,56,307000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Tell her ""no deal""."
121568,469,58,307000,Marge Simpson,MARGE'S CHILDHOOD HOME,Everything's just the way I remember it...
121569,469,59,313000,Marge Simpson,MARGE'S CHILDHOOD HOME,You see that mirror? I discovered that if I sat in the kitchen I could see if the bathroom was free using the reflection from the mirror off the toaster.
121573,469,63,327000,Marge Simpson,Bedroom,This was my bedroom! My bedpost smooshes are still in the carpet!
121574,469,64,333000,Bart Simpson,Bedroom,I wanna go read books in the car.
121575,469,65,335000,Marge Simpson,Bedroom,There are no books in the car.
121576,469,66,336000,Bart Simpson,Bedroom,I just wanna sit in the car!
121578,469,68,338000,Abby,UPSTAIRS HALLWAY,"I always wondered who ""Marge"" is."
121579,469,69,341000,Marge Simpson,UPSTAIRS HALLWAY,My memorables!
121580,469,70,344000,Abby,UPSTAIRS HALLWAY,"Over the years, I've sure been tempted to go through this stuff. So I did, many times!"
121582,469,72,351000,Marge Simpson,MARGE'S CHILDHOOD ROOM,My whole childhood is in this box! My scrunchies! I never really had the hair for these.
121583,469,73,359000,Lisa Simpson,MARGE'S CHILDHOOD ROOM,"Wow, Mom -- you got first place in the science fair!"
121584,469,74,363000,Marge Simpson,MARGE'S CHILDHOOD ROOM,"Oh, that's ancient history. Ooh, here's my paper on ancient history."
121585,469,75,369000,Lisa Simpson,MARGE'S CHILDHOOD ROOM,"Mom, these grades are amazing! Just as good as mine!"
148724,469,76,373000,Lisa's Thoughts,MARGE'S CHILDHOOD ROOM,But then... you wound up like you.
121587,469,78,383000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,"Aw, man. The drainage around here is a joke."
121588,469,79,387000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Elementary School,I don't even know why I pay taxes.
121589,469,80,389000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Comin' through!
121590,469,81,393000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Just when you think I'm out of ideas!
121592,469,83,411000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Get your affairs in order.
121593,469,84,418000,Database,Springfield Elementary School,Bart beat up Nelson!
121594,469,85,420000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,A new bully has risen! Simpson Boombaye!
121595,469,86,424000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,Simpson Boombaye! Simpson Boombaye!
121596,469,87,430000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, Mama!"
121598,469,89,439000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Buying those extra trophies from cash-strapped schools really filled out the old case.
121599,469,90,443000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Principal Skinner? Quick question. Is it true my Mom was a great student?
121600,469,91,448000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Oh indeed. Your mother was as fine a student as you.
121601,469,92,451000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Keep up the good work and you'll probably wind up just like her.
121602,469,93,454000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Well... of course that would be great. But I see myself making an impact... outside the home.
121603,469,94,462000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, one of the hardest jobs I have is throwing cold water on young children's dreams."
121604,469,95,468000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Ralph, you're not a kangaroo."
121606,469,97,471000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"The point is, I've learned a lot about human nature by sitting in the park with mother. And one thing I've learned is children turn out like their parents. Behold, your future!"
121608,469,99,486000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Ralph, you're also not a trophy."
121610,469,101,490000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Skinner! I warned you about interacting with students!
121611,469,102,494000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,I don't want to have to yell at you.
121612,469,103,496000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,You yell at me about everything.
121613,469,104,497000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,"Well I can't yell at anyone else! Teachers have a union, students have parents."
121614,469,105,502000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,What about Willie?
121615,469,106,502000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,I like Willie!
121617,469,108,508000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Maggie, something happened to Mom and I'm gonna find out what and when."
121618,469,109,511000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom's looking good through elementary school... ninth grade, tenth grade, still ridin' the A-Train... Then suddenly, when she was a high school senior BLAM!"
121619,469,110,522000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You kids play nice up there!
121620,469,111,524000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What could've happened?
121621,469,112,546000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, can I talk to you for a second?"
121622,469,113,549000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What is troubling you, my son? I mean, my girl son?"
121623,469,114,554000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, um, I was looking through Mom's old schoolwork, and I noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you."
121624,469,115,562000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, if it hadn't been me, it would have been someone or something else. Sooner or later, everyone meets their ""Homer."""
121625,469,116,571000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"No offense Dad, but no boy is gonna distract me from my dreams."
121626,469,117,576000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"It may not be a boy. It could be anything: scrap-booking, high-stakes poker, or the Santa Fe lifestyle. Just pick a dead end, and chill out till you die."
121627,469,118,586000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,No! That's not gonna happen to me! I'm gonna make sure nothing distracts me ever!
121629,469,120,593000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Look at you, struttin' around, like you're Toad of Toad Hall."
121630,469,121,598000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I'm just whistlin', man."
121632,469,122,602000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"You think you're so smart, don'tcha, Simpson?"
121633,469,123,604000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,We're both in the same reading group. I think you know how smart I am.
121634,469,124,608000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,That's an insult to me and the rest of the inchworms!
121635,469,125,614000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,Bart did it again!
121636,469,126,615000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'm not a bully! It's just a series of incredible coincidences!
121637,469,127,620000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Well Bart, I guess his parking spot is yours now."
121638,469,128,622000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Well done.
121640,469,130,627000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, I've gotten rid of all of my distractions, diversions, hobbies and... Oh my God!"
121641,469,131,634000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Are you a distraction, or a higher calling? All right, let's see. How many jazz musicians led long and happy lives? There's, um..."
121644,469,134,654000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's odd. Lisa just threw her saxophone out the window.
121645,469,135,657000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that's probably because to her, the saxophone is a me, and she doesn't want to end up like you. G'night."
121646,469,136,664000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,She doesn't want to end up like me?!
121647,469,137,666000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, she does, totally, but uh... with a happier ending. Goodnight!"
121648,469,138,672000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What's so wrong with me?
121649,469,139,674000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Nothing, sweetie, nothing! Here, let me explain."
121650,469,140,677000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,She does not want to... turn out like... you... didn't... not until... diplomatic... trapped... help... remember nothing!
121651,469,141,690000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I remember everything.
121652,469,142,692000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if you check your purse I think you'll find... the seven of clubs!"
121653,469,143,700000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,No. Just a picture of Lisa. Who wants to be nothing like me.
121654,469,144,706000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I am so sorry, Marge."
121655,469,145,711000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Stupid pan.
121656,469,146,714000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, could you keep it down a little? I'm trying to study."
121657,469,147,716000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh-huh, yeah. Here's your breakfast."
121658,469,148,720000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Not a good time!
121659,469,149,723000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, is something wrong?"
121660,469,150,725000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Would it be so bad to turn out like me?
121661,469,151,728000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, I admire everything you do--"
121631,469,152,731000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"But it's not good enough, is it?"
121662,469,153,732000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's plenty good! It's great! It's just... not for me.
121663,469,154,739000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,School bus!
121665,469,156,748000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What kind of kiss did you get?
121666,469,157,748000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Normal. You?
121667,469,158,751000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Ice cold.
121668,469,159,752000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You're just imagining things.
121669,469,160,753000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Oh yeah?
121670,469,161,755000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Hm.
121671,469,162,757000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What does your note say?
121672,469,163,759000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,The seven of clubs.
121673,469,164,761000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ta-da!
121675,469,166,767000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"What's the point of getting rid of all the distractions at home, if I have to do my learning here?"
121677,469,168,779000,Groundskeeper Willie,Library,OH I'LL WAX THE UPSTAIRS / AND I'LL WAX THE DOWNSTAIRS / THEN I'LL GET DRUNK IN THE LI'BRY!
121678,469,169,786000,Lisa Simpson,Library,Willie!
121679,469,170,787000,Lisa Simpson,Library,Do you have to wax this floor now?
121680,469,171,790000,Groundskeeper Willie,Library,"No, no, I can come back later."
121682,469,173,794000,Lisa Simpson,Library,Should I get the nurse?
121683,469,174,796000,Groundskeeper Willie,Library,Nae. Just keep studying. I'll scream this out.
121686,469,177,805000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"I can get to you whenever I want, Simpson. But I'm gonna bide my time. You won't even hear the punch that wastes you. And you'll crack like one of those chicken turds rich people eat."
121687,469,178,823000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,You mean an egg?
121688,469,179,825000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I mean you're dead!
121690,469,181,828000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Let me outta here so I can put you in here!
121691,469,182,831000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Ha! You're not so tough now.
121694,469,185,841000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,Dad was right -- I might as well give up.
121695,469,186,860000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,"""Cloisters Academy?!"" That bus could pick me up any day of the week!"
121696,469,187,866000,Otto Mann,School Bus,"S'up, bro?"
121697,469,188,867000,Professional-looking Driver,School Bus,I'm not your brother.
121698,469,189,870000,Lisa Simpson,School Bus,"Lord Buddha, I know I'm not supposed to want stuff, but c'mon."
121701,469,192,881000,Admissions Director,TOP OF TOWER,Cloisters Academy is a refuge for quiet learning. We have every facility imaginable. Including an imaginatorium.
121702,469,193,889000,Admissions Director,TOP OF TOWER,"Oh no, wait, it's over there."
121703,469,194,892000,Lisa Simpson,TOP OF TOWER,"Mom, Dad! Please, can I go here? I'll study so hard I'll make the old me look like Bart."
121704,469,195,897000,Homer Simpson,TOP OF TOWER,That would be one weird-looking kid.
121705,469,196,899000,Marge Simpson,TOP OF TOWER,"We'd love to send you here, sweetie. We just can't afford it."
121706,469,197,904000,Admissions Director,TOP OF TOWER,I'm sure she'll do fine at Springfield Elementary. I hear they just found out there was a World War Two.
121707,469,198,912000,Marge Simpson,TOP OF TOWER,"Homer, Lisa, could you please step outside? I have a few choice words for this gentleman."
121708,469,199,918000,Lisa Simpson,TOP OF TOWER,"Mom, please don't."
121709,469,200,921000,Homer Simpson,TOP OF TOWER,"Oh, I've seen that look before. That's the ""I ate the piece of wedding cake she's been saving in the freezer ten years"" look."
121710,469,201,927000,Marge Simpson,TOP OF TOWER,You what?!
121711,469,202,927000,Homer Simpson,TOP OF TOWER,Run!
121713,469,204,945000,Admissions Director,Base Of Tower,"Lisa, your mother convinced me to take a closer look at your record, and upon further reflection, I have decided to offer you a full scholarship to Cloisters Academy."

121715,469,206,959000,Homer Simpson,Base Of Tower,"Thank you, four-eyes!"

121718,469,209,966000,Lisa Simpson,Cloisters Academy,I'm so exci--
121719,469,210,967000,Admissions Director,Cloisters Academy,Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh -- quiet campus. Shh. Now please hold your celebration until you're off the school grounds.
121721,469,212,981000,Homer Simpson,Cloisters Academy,What time Monday?
121722,469,213,983000,Admissions Director,Cloisters Academy,"Um, eight o'clock."

121725,469,216,998000,Homer Simpson,Cloisters Academy,All right!
121726,469,217,998000,Lisa Simpson,Cloisters Academy,An academy! I'm attending an academy!
121727,469,218,1003000,Cloisters Girl,Cloisters Academy,"Hi! I see that you're new, and we'd be honored to have you join our softball team."
121729,469,219,1007000,Lisa Simpson,Cloisters Academy,"I'm sorry, I don't really play."
121730,469,220,1009000,Cloisters Girl,Cloisters Academy,"Oh, no one plays. We just discuss the physics of the game."
