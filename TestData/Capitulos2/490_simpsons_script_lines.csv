127053,490,5,119000,Scratchy,SIDE OF POND,Friend?
127055,490,7,126000,Lisa Simpson,SIDE OF POND,"Bart, you wanna see something cool?"
127056,490,8,128000,Bart Simpson,SIDE OF POND,"Oh, did you pick that big scab off your knee?"
127057,490,9,130000,Lisa Simpson,SIDE OF POND,No.
127058,490,10,131000,Marge Simpson,SIDE OF POND,Don't touch the scab!
127059,490,11,132000,Lisa Simpson,SIDE OF POND,"My science fair project proves that an asteroid will strike the earth on July 15, 9789."
127060,490,12,139000,Bart Simpson,SIDE OF POND,Who cares? I'll be President of Hell by then.
127061,490,13,142000,Lisa Simpson,SIDE OF POND,"Fine. Good luck with your project, which I'm sure you haven't started yet."
127062,490,14,146000,Bart Simpson,SIDE OF POND,I'll tell you my project: a fisteroid hitting the planet nerd.
127063,490,15,149000,Lisa Simpson,SIDE OF POND,That's pathetic.
127064,490,16,152000,Bart Simpson,SIDE OF POND,"Jeez, I put a lot of time in this. Back to the drawing board."
127066,490,18,158000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Hey Bart, is your cootie shot ready?"
127067,490,19,163000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, the science fair's not till next week!"
127068,490,20,165000,Milhouse Van Houten,Simpson Home,I really need that shot. My dog and I accidentally touched tongues.
127069,490,21,169000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"How is it ""accidentally"" when this is the fifth time?"
127070,490,22,174000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Bart, isn't that awfully similar to the cootie patch you did last year?"
127071,490,23,178000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"That was preventative, this is morning-after... eh, you're right."
127072,490,24,186000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What am I gonna do? Good ideas don't grow on trees.
127073,490,25,192000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Or do they?
127075,490,27,199000,Martin Prince,Springfield Street,Good shot!
127077,490,28,201000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,Not really -- I was trying to bounce it off your left testie.
127078,490,29,204000,Martin Prince,Springfield Street,"Testis, my friend."
127079,490,30,206000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"Look, I need help with my science fair project."
127080,490,31,210000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Street,"To sweeten the deal, I'll pick you first for basketball."
127081,490,32,213000,Martin Prince,Springfield Street,"Ah, to be a mathlete without the M."
127082,490,33,216000,Martin Prince,Springfield Street,"Fly orb, and find thy hoop!"
127083,490,34,230000,Martin Prince,Springfield Street,I'm in.
127086,490,37,237000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Workstation,"""In the event of a primary core breach, you have fifteen seconds to avoid a complete--"
127088,490,39,255000,Roz,Homer's Workstation,Howdy!
127090,490,41,255000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Workstation,A woman of stature!
127091,490,42,258000,Roz,Homer's Workstation,"Roz Davis, your new assistant."
127092,490,43,260000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Workstation,"Assistant? Well, I have been pretty overworked lately."
127093,490,44,264000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Workstation,But I guess I should find out a little bit about you.
127094,490,45,266000,Roz,Homer's Workstation,"I'm just a gal from Ohio who never wants to call her daddy again and say ""I need to borrow money."""
127095,490,46,266000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Workstation,So your dad has money to lend?
127097,490,48,275000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,This is where we get our coffee. Just leave a little at the bottom so someone else has to make the next pot. The burning smell will let them know.
127098,490,49,283000,Roz,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Genius.
127099,490,50,285000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Uh-oh, it's Old man Burns!"
127100,490,51,286000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Hello, Young man Burns."
127101,490,52,289000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Oh, Simpson. You do know how to whip my buggy."
127102,490,53,295000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That sucker soaks up flattery like a Twinkie soaks up gravy.
127103,490,54,300000,Roz,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Well, when it's a handsome guy like you talkin'..."
127104,490,55,304000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Oh well!
127105,490,56,305000,Roz,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,Your giggle is like strawberry wine.
127107,490,58,311000,Roz,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,And your snort's like a summer breeze.
127076,490,60,320000,Roz,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,That's not very attractive though.
127109,490,61,322000,Roz,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,You okay?
126795,490,62,322000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,I'm fine.
127110,490,65,329000,Martin Prince,Bart's Bedroom,"Bart, I fail to see the scientific function of this ""Homer Humiliator"" you've devised."
127111,490,66,335000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Well, we gotta come up with something. Hey, what if we make some kind of robo-pet?"
127112,490,67,342000,Martin Prince,Bart's Bedroom,What made you think of that?
127113,490,68,349000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Thy will be done, Lord Vader. Please don't hurt me. Please."
127114,490,69,353000,Martin Prince,Bart's Bedroom,"A robo-pet? Not a bad idea. Bully, Bart. Bully!"
127115,490,70,357000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Where? Is it Nelson?
127116,490,71,358000,Martin Prince,Bart's Bedroom,"No Bart, it's just an expression."
127117,490,72,361000,Nelson Muntz,Bart's Bedroom,Who hath summoned me?!
127121,490,76,372000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Baby seal, huh?"
127122,490,77,372000,Martin Prince,Bart's Bedroom,Research shows it's impossible to gaze at a baby seal and say anything but...
127123,490,78,378000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Awww.
127124,490,79,379000,Martin Prince,Bart's Bedroom,"Precisely -- and at science fairs, the ""awws"" get the ""A's."""
127125,490,80,385000,Martin Prince,Bart's Bedroom,Heavens to Asimov!
127126,490,81,387000,Martin Prince,Bart's Bedroom,Hmmm... Must make sure these wires aren't crossed.
127127,490,82,395000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,Awww...
127128,490,83,399000,Homer Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,"Marge, get my seal club! The big one!"
127129,490,84,403000,Marge Simpson,Bart's Bedroom,They're all pretty big...
127132,490,87,421000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School Gym,I'm an experiment!
127134,490,89,428000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Gym,Fine.
127136,490,91,434000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,Check it out.
127138,490,93,437000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"So, the soft fur, big eyes and gentle motion are designed to make it one helluva pet with none of the poop."
127139,490,94,443000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,This is the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my entire life!
127147,490,98,454000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"What a wonderful science fair. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts we could not afford our third place ribbon. Now, in Second Place, Lisa Simpson's grim description of our short-sighted dependence on fossil fuels."
127148,490,99,465000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,It's about an asteroid!
127149,490,100,467000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"They're all the same, Gloomhilda."
127150,490,101,469000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Gym,First Place goes to Bart Simpson and Martin Prince...
127151,490,102,472000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Gym,Yeah!
127152,490,103,472000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"...for creating a furry robotic friend who provides comfort when humans fail to, which they will, trust me."
127153,490,104,480000,Agnes Skinner,Springfield Elementary School Gym,"I carried you in my belly for four-and-a-half-months. When you fell out on the bus, that's when my job ended."
127155,490,106,491000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Congratulations on gettin' a ribbon, Lisa -- you must've baked a mighty fine pie!"
127156,490,107,497000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"It wasn't a pie, it was science! And it's not fair -- my project was way better than Bart's, and I didn't have help from a nerd! I'm my own nerd!"
127157,490,108,507000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Ha-ho sweetie, being second ain't the worst thing that can happen. Look at poor old Jasper over there."
127158,490,109,518000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"He lost his wife, his kids don't call. Soon he'll just be bones and beard."
127161,490,112,549000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Wow! While I was sitting here feeling sorry for myself, Bart's invention actually changed someone's life!"
127162,490,113,556000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,And best of all I got funding for my Homer Humiliator.
127163,490,114,560000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Hm.
127164,490,115,564000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Retirement Castle,Why would a Homer Humiliator do this to me?
127167,490,118,583000,Homer Simpson,Homer and Roz's Workstations,"Y'ello. Hey, Barney... a free movie screening? Of course I can go! I just need somebody to hold down the fort."
127168,490,119,592000,Homer Simpson,Homer and Roz's Workstations,"Oh, uh, Roz, I have to step out for one hour and forty-three minutes. Could you cover for me?"
127169,490,120,598000,Roz,Homer and Roz's Workstations,Go ahead.
127170,490,121,598000,Homer Simpson,Homer and Roz's Workstations,"Woo hoo! Oh, uh, if an emergency alarm goes off, there's earplugs in the top drawer!"
127145,490,125,624000,Homer Simpson,Movie Theater,Life imitates Flart.
127146,490,126,626000,Barney Gumble,Movie Theater,It says that on the poster.
127172,490,127,628000,Homer Simpson,Movie Theater,I thought of it first.
127175,490,130,631000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Marge, I just saw the greatest movie. Guess what happens when a mop is replaced with an octopus! I'll give you a clue, it's funny!"
127176,490,131,640000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Take off the 3-D glasses!
127178,490,133,645000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,Simpson! A gangly little bird told me you've been lollygagging at the Biograph.
127179,490,134,650000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Someone snitched? Wha-wha-wha-wha-what are you gonna do to me?
127180,490,135,653000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,You're demoted.
127181,490,136,654000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Up or down?
127182,490,137,656000,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson Living Room,Down!
127184,490,139,656000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Don't tell my wife.
127186,490,141,664000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"So, partner, what's next on the agenda?"
127187,490,142,667000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Oh... um...
127188,490,143,668000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Back off, man. Can't you see you're embarrassing Bart?"
127189,490,144,672000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,When did you take that picture?
127190,490,145,675000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Last time you slept over at my house. I love when you're sleeping and at peace. START HERE
127192,490,147,682000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Elementary School,"Hey Skippy, we need some more of them loveable critters for our friends at the home."
127193,490,148,687000,Grampa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Unless you got any heroin.
127194,490,149,689000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Elementary School,You got any heroin?
127195,490,150,691000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Elementary School,Hm?
127196,490,151,693000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Elementary School,"Well then, critters it is."
127198,490,153,698000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I'm telling you guys, Roz told Old Man Burns I ditched work early and now I'm her assistant."
127199,490,154,704000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"I dunno, Homer. You're sayin' she's nice on the outside, but mean on the inside? No one could pull that off!"
127200,490,155,709000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Enjoy. And as for you, Homer, don't worry. You're at Moe's tavern -- lady-free since eighty-three."
127201,490,156,716000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,What the-- This is a gentleman's club!
127202,490,157,719000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Yeah.
127203,490,158,721000,Roz,Moe's Tavern,"So, what you boys drinkin'? I'm buyin'."
127204,490,159,724000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Can we just have the cash value of the drink?
124881,490,160,726000,Roz,Moe's Tavern,Be my guest.
127205,490,161,727000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,I'd rather use my money to buy a Moe souvenir t-shirt.
127206,490,162,732000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,That comes in kid sizes too.
127208,490,164,733000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This is terrible. What am I gonna do?
127210,490,166,737000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Aren't you gonna come to bed, Homie?"
127211,490,167,739000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Can't, Marge. I'm fighting for my professional life here."
127212,490,168,742000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Do you know what I just learned? My job is the reason I get those checks every week! And now that I'm demoted, the checks have gotten smaller! Not in physical size, but--"
127213,490,169,754000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I know! I know!
127216,490,172,777000,Undertaker,RETIREMENT CASTLE RECREATION ROOM,"I represent the Eternal Valley funeral home, and I'm here to talk about an extremely unpleasant subject: people continuing to live."
127217,490,173,785000,HOWARD JR.,RETIREMENT CASTLE RECREATION ROOM,"If we don't have a frickin' funeral soon people, you can say goodbye to Howard's Flowers!"
127218,490,174,789000,Undertaker,RETIREMENT CASTLE RECREATION ROOM,"Calm down, Howard Junior. Now here is the zip, the zap and the zing: we're gonna rewire Charlie Loveable here into the greatest threat to seniors' lives since nursing homes themselves."
127219,490,175,802000,Undertaker,RETIREMENT CASTLE RECREATION ROOM,Switcheroo...
127220,490,176,813000,Undertaker,RETIREMENT CASTLE RECREATION ROOM,Impressive. Hard to believe two ten-year-old kids built this.
127221,490,177,817000,HOWARD JR.,RETIREMENT CASTLE RECREATION ROOM,And I heard one of them did all the work.
127222,490,178,819000,Reps,RETIREMENT CASTLE RECREATION ROOM,That's True. / Wow.
127225,490,181,828000,Homer Simpson,Roz's Workstation,Am I early?
127226,490,182,829000,Roz,Roz's Workstation,You're late.
127227,490,183,831000,Homer Simpson,Roz's Workstation,"Since I got demoted I have to show my I.D., but the picture was taken so long ago I put on a lot of weight, so I have to stretch out my face and say ""I used to look like this..."""
127228,490,184,831000,Roz,Roz's Workstation,Late.
127229,490,185,843000,Homer Simpson,Roz's Workstation,You're mean!
127230,490,186,845000,Roz,Roz's Workstation,"Now, I want a list of a hundred ways to make your job worse by close of business today."
127231,490,187,849000,Homer Simpson,Roz's Workstation,Can one of the hundred be making the list?
127232,490,188,849000,Roz,Roz's Workstation,No.
127233,490,189,852000,Homer Simpson,Roz's Workstation,Can some of them be callbacks to earlier ones?
125030,490,190,854000,Roz,Roz's Workstation,"Also, no."
127235,490,193,857000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Retirement Castle,"We're live at the Springfield Retirement Castle where long-time resident, Alice Glick, died last night -- at the paws of this cuddly little killer."
127236,490,194,865000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Retirement Castle,Our Channel Six Substitute Medical Expert Dr. Nick Riviera had this to say:
127237,490,195,870000,Dr. Nick Riviera,Springfield Retirement Castle,The champion was cleared to fight.
127238,490,196,872000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Retirement Castle,"Doctor, this press conference is about a nursing home death. The Springfield police are in the process of taking all the robots into custody...safely returning the seniors to their hopeless, dismal lives."
127239,490,197,875000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,Shut that thing off.
127240,490,198,887000,Old Jewish Man,Springfield Retirement Castle,I meant the TV!
127241,490,199,888000,Jasper Beardly,Springfield Retirement Castle,Sorry.
127243,490,201,892000,Bart Simpson,Professor Frink's Lab,"Hi, we need someone to re-program our robots to break out of jail."
127244,490,202,897000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Professor Frink's Lab,"A chance to reprogram robots? Well, I had a date with a beauty queen tonight, but forget it. Hello, yes, hello, Miss Wyoming? I'll, I'll have to climb your Grand Tetons another night. The breast joke! I, I, I served it up."
127245,490,203,915000,Miss Wyoming,Professor Frink's Lab,Why won't he love me?!
127247,490,205,925000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Driveway,"Do this, do that. Lousy Roz, thinks she's so big..."
127248,490,206,928000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Driveway,"Well, looks like it's time for another ""'End of the Walk' Talk With Homer and Ned."" Tonight's topic: ""The Niceness of the Evening."""
127249,490,207,935000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Driveway,Hey.
127250,490,208,936000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Driveway,"Homer, all nonsense aside, are you okalidokalaroony?"
127251,490,209,940000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Driveway,"I'm having problems with my new boss Roz. She's the most evil person to come out of Ohio since LeBron, but at least he thought long and hard before screwing everybody over, in public for no reason."
127252,490,210,951000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Driveway,"Y'know, I knew a backstabbin' buckeye named Roz at Bible Camp. Twice as tall as she should've been."
127253,490,211,956000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Driveway,Is this her?
127254,490,212,958000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Driveway,C'mon. The apple must be wreaking havoc with the Twinkie!
127255,490,213,962000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Driveway,"It is! But if you've got the stones, I can tell you how to slay that Gal-ioth."
127256,490,214,963000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Driveway,"Are you aware that ""stones"" means ""man junk?"""
127258,490,215,971000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Driveway,What the? I've been using that around the boys!
127259,490,216,977000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Driveway,"Thank you. Now, it was one of our biggest celebrations...the nineteenth Sunday after Easter. We'd just had a rousing no-fun run and in the heat of the moment I wanted to offer my respectful best wishes."
127260,490,217,989000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Driveway,Peace be with you.
127261,490,218,990000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Driveway,"Well, sir, she went crazy. Crazier than sleeping in on a Sunday."
127262,490,219,995000,Roz,Simpson Driveway,I can't stand to be touched! Never tell anyone!
127263,490,220,999000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Driveway,And I haven't. Not until now.
127264,490,221,1001000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Driveway,"That's it! That's it! My nightmare is over! Oh Flanders, you are my personal savior!"
127265,490,222,1009000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Driveway,"Oh that's nice, but I don't approve of--"
127266,490,223,1011000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Driveway,Hail Flanders! Mightier than Jesus!
