54356,226,83,421000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think there's enough here for a vacation.
54357,226,84,424000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,There is for a Mega-Savings vacation. Chuck Garabedian says you can fly Mega-cheap if you don't care where you go.
54358,226,85,431000,GARABEDIAN,Simpson Home,That's right! Just go to the airport and wait for some no-shows. Then you can buy their seats for a fraction of the price!
54359,226,86,438000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Are you going through our garbage?
54360,226,87,440000,GARABEDIAN,Simpson Home,That's right! You fat-cats didn't finish your plankton. Now it's mine!

54421,226,148,664000,Marge Simpson,Hotel Room,I'd like to see the Japanese take on the club sandwich. I bet it's smaller and more efficient!

54427,226,154,693000,Homer Simpson,AMERICATOWN RESTAURANT,Let's just say the stories about him are greatly exaggerated.

54437,226,163,732000,Homer Simpson,TOKYO FRUIT STAND,It's worth every cent. I'm tired of fumbling with round fruit.
54439,226,165,737000,Marge Simpson,TOKYO FRUIT STAND,Maybe we should just head back to the hotel.
54440,226,166,740000,Lisa Simpson,TOKYO FRUIT STAND,But you promised me we'd do something Japanese.
54441,226,167,743000,Homer Simpson,TOKYO FRUIT STAND,"Oh, of course. You're right. You know, I read about a Shinto tea house where they practice the traditional... Run, Bart!"

54476,226,201,886000,Marge Simpson,Street,Be careful. We need that money to get home.

54498,226,226,991000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"Thank you, thank you. And welcome to our contestants from America, the Simpson family."
54499,226,227,998000,Marge Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,You honor us.
54500,226,228,1000000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"Don't patronize me! Now, Simpson family, have you picked a wish?"
54501,226,229,1005000,Homer Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,"Well, I haven't talked it over with the family, but I think we'd all like a free dinner at AmericaTown."
54502,226,230,1011000,Marge Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,"No, no, no! We want plane tickets home to Springfield."
54503,226,231,1018000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,Now our gameshows are a little different from yours. Your shows reward knowledge. We punish ignorance.
54504,226,232,1027000,Homer Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,Ignor-- what?
54506,226,234,1027000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"Okay, let's begin. Our categories are ""OW, THAT HURTS,"" ""WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?"" and ""PLEASE LET ME DIE."""
54507,226,235,1041000,Homer Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,"Do ""OW THAT HURTS."""

54509,226,237,1047000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,My name is Wink!
54510,226,238,1055000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"All right, Simpsons, whack the pinata!"
54511,226,239,1059000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"Come on, break that pig open! Once more. Harder. Whack it open. Good."
54512,226,240,1065000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"All right, you may remove your blindfolds."
54513,226,241,1070000,Lisa Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,"Oh sorry, Dad, we didn't know."
54514,226,242,1073000,Bart Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,I had an inkling.
54515,226,243,1074000,Homer Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,Could someone please whack my hernia back in?
54516,226,244,1076000,Bart Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,"Sure thing, Dad."
54517,226,245,1077000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"Mr. Simpson, we'll cut you down as soon as you answer one question about Japan."
54518,226,246,1084000,Homer Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,Is the answer Japan?
54519,226,247,1086000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"Actually, it is. That means you move on to the lightning round."
54523,226,251,1098000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"He seems okay, but he is being burned internally."
54527,226,255,1108000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, ain't that Homer on the Japanese channel?"
54528,226,256,1111000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,If that's Homer then... who the hell's been putting beers on his tab?
54529,226,257,1116000,Barney Gumble,Moe's Tavern,Woo hoo? Umm... that boy ain't right?
54531,226,259,1122000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"Congratulations Simpsons, the airline tickets are yours. All you have to do is to pick them up...from inside that volcano."
54532,226,260,1133000,Homer Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,Why are you so cruel?
54534,226,262,1140000,Bart Simpson,RIM OF VOLCANO,This vacation really blows.
54535,226,263,1142000,Homer Simpson,RIM OF VOLCANO,"Well, at least we're past the lightning round."
54536,226,264,1144000,Homer Simpson,RIM OF VOLCANO,"Hmmm, I see... I sure hope they don't have an ice cream round."
54537,226,265,1154000,Marge Simpson,RIM OF VOLCANO,"Mmm, I don't think that bridge can support much weight."
54538,226,266,1159000,Lisa Simpson,RIM OF VOLCANO,"Well, Maggie weighs a lot less than... oh, I'll just go."
54540,226,268,1167000,Audience,GAMESHOW SET,Plum-met! Plum-met! Plum-met! Plum-met! Plum-met! Plum-met! Plum-met! Plum-met!

54542,226,270,1177000,Bart Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S...
54544,226,272,1184000,Marge Simpson,Volcano,Lisa!
54545,226,273,1195000,Homer Simpson,Volcano,Marge! Your shoe!
54546,226,274,1200000,Bart Simpson,Volcano,Plane tickets!
54547,226,275,1210000,Marge Simpson,Volcano,"Oh, I'm afraid this might be the end."
54548,226,276,1212000,Homer Simpson,Volcano,"Well, at least we'll die doing what we love... inhaling molten rock."
54550,226,278,1221000,Homer Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,It burns! It burns!
54551,226,279,1226000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"Don't worry, that ""lava"" is just Orangeade made by our sponsor, Osaka Orangeade Concern."
54552,226,280,1234000,Homer Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,It burns! It burns!
54553,226,281,1235000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"It's loaded with wasabi. Kudos, Simpsons, you have won your freedom!"
54554,226,282,1246000,Homer Simpson,GAMESHOW SET,"Before I go, I want to say something. Game shows aren't about cruelty, they're about greed and wonderful prizes like poorly-built catamarans. But somewhere along the line, you lost your way. For shame."
54555,226,283,1263000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,"Coming up next, a Canadian couple who say they are deathly afraid of scorpions."
54556,226,284,1271000,Canadian Man,GAMESHOW SET,"Ooh, that stings, eh. Oooh, God!"
54558,226,286,1276000,Gameshow Host,GAMESHOW SET,Sting those Canucks.
54560,226,288,1278000,Homer Simpson,Hallway,"I love this show. Take that, you stupid hosers!"
54562,226,290,1284000,Bart Simpson,Plane,"Goodbye, Japan. I'll miss your Kentucky Fried Chicken and your sparkling, whale-free seas."
54564,226,291,1289000,Simpsons,Plane,"Hey, what's all that? / Whoa! / What's happening?"
54565,226,292,1293000,Pilot,Plane,"Ahh, folks, we're experiencing some moderate Godzilla-related turbulence at this time, so I'm gonna go ahead and ask you to put your seatbelts back on."
54566,226,293,1300000,Pilot,Plane,"When we get to thirty-five thousand feet, he usually does let go. So, from there on out all we have to do is worry about Mothra and uh, we do have reports he's tied up with Gamra and Rodan at the present time. Thank you very much."
54567,226,294,1366000,Homer Simpson,Plane,Undo! Undo!
