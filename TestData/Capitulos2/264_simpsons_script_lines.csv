66073,264,16,126000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson TV Room,That ad campaign may have crossed a line.
66074,264,17,128000,Homer Simpson,Simpson TV Room,What can you do? Sex sells.
66075,264,18,132000,Marge Simpson,Simpson TV Room,"Homer, you're still here? You should've left for work an hour ago!"
66076,264,19,136000,Homer Simpson,Simpson TV Room,"They said if I come in late again, I'm fired. I can't take that chance."
66077,264,20,140000,Marge Simpson,Simpson TV Room,"And kids, you're gonna miss the school bus!"
66078,264,21,144000,Marge Simpson,Simpson TV Room,It's only two blocks away!
66081,264,24,151000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,But I gotta spit...
66082,264,25,152000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,You can spit on the bus.
66083,264,26,156000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, Mom..."

66095,264,38,199000,Otto Mann,Street,"No, you eat my dust!"
66098,264,41,216000,Milhouse Van Houten,Bus,"Whoa. It's like ""Speed 2,"" only with a bus instead of a boat."
66101,264,44,230000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,I did it! I caught the school bus. Now hurry up and get on.
66102,264,45,237000,Lisa Simpson,Marge's Car,"But Mom, the school's right here."
66103,264,46,239000,Marge Simpson,Marge's Car,I won. Don't take that away from me.

66114,264,57,279000,Terri Mackleberry,Bus,Red hair? What's she trying to pull?
66115,264,58,282000,JANEY,Bus,Those shoes look Canadian.
66116,264,59,284000,Freakish Kid,Bus,She'll never fit in.
66117,264,60,288000,Lisa Simpson,Bus,"Oh, it's tough being the new kid. Someone should go talk to her."
66118,264,61,293000,Bart Simpson,Bus,"Yeah, somebody should. One-hour dry cleaner. Man, that's fast."
66120,264,63,299000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Kids gone?
66121,264,64,301000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yep. It's great to have some time just to ourselves, huh?"
66122,264,65,304000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You read my mind. Sooo...
66123,264,66,310000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"This coffee's good, huh?"
66124,264,67,312000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah. The uh... the milk really takes the edge off.
66125,264,68,317000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"You know, I think our marriage is..."
66126,264,69,320000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I got it!

66128,264,71,321000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I got it!"
66129,264,72,321000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I do!"
66130,264,73,322000,Saleswoman,Simpson Home,Your baby is dead.
66133,264,75,326000,Saleswoman,Simpson Home,That's what you'd hear if your baby fell victim to the thousands of deathtraps lurking in the average American home.
66134,264,76,333000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"""Springfield Baby-Proofing""?"
66135,264,77,336000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,You...you really scared us.
66136,264,78,338000,Saleswoman,Simpson Home,"Sorry about that. But the truth is, your baby, Maggie Simpson, is dead!"
66138,264,80,344000,Saleswoman,Simpson Home,Dead tired of baby-proofers who don't provide a free estimate. Let's start in the kitchen.
66139,264,81,349000,Saleswoman,Simpson Home,"Now, pretend I'm a baby."
66140,264,82,352000,Saleswoman,Simpson Home,Goo goo. Me wike to expwore.
66141,264,83,356000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,That's a pretty big caboose for a baby.
66142,264,84,358000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homer! Don't be... Wow, that is huge."
66143,264,85,362000,Saleswoman,Simpson Home,"Ooh, pwetty colors. Me wanna dwink."
66144,264,86,383000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,She got it open.
66145,264,87,385000,Saleswoman,Simpson Home,You see how quickly your baby could've been drinking this...
66146,264,88,385000,Saleswoman,Simpson Home,Similac Baby Formula.
66147,264,89,390000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Noooo!
66148,264,90,394000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,This is such an eye-opener. I always pictured the kids dying in the living room.
66149,264,91,400000,Saleswoman,Simpson Home,"Okay, with the window bars, toilet latches, dingo alarm, and grapefruit-squirt shield, your total cost would be... Wow, I'm rich!"
66150,264,92,406000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Three dollars? That doesn't seem so bad.
66151,264,93,410000,Saleswoman,Simpson Home,That's the price of the clipboard.
66152,264,94,411000,Saleswoman,Simpson Home,Here's your estimate.
66153,264,95,411000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Mm hm. Hmmmm.
66154,264,96,416000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,We don't need your high-priced safety junk!
66155,264,97,419000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Thank you.
66157,264,99,426000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Look at the new kid, hoggin' the teeter-totter. It's like she owns the place."
66158,264,100,432000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Yeah, she thinks she's Babe: Pig in the City."
66159,264,101,434000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Give her a break. Remember your first day at school?
66160,264,102,438000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Not as long as I keep taking these.
66161,264,103,442000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,"Well, someone's gotta make her feel welcome."
66162,264,104,445000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,Hi there.
66163,264,105,448000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Playground,My name's Lisa. What's yours?
66165,264,107,460000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Now don't feel bad, honey. Did you know back in grade school, I had a bully problem myself?"
66167,264,109,467000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,EVERYBODY WAS KUNG-FU FIGHTING...
66168,264,110,473000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,THOSE CATS WERE FAST AS LIGHTNING...
66169,264,111,478000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,Good times.
66170,264,112,482000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,Why don't you try reaching out to this new girl? See if you two have a common interest.
66171,264,113,487000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Well, lots of people like jazz fusion..."
66172,264,114,494000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"Okay, that's in the ""maybe"" file. What if you two bond over your Malibu Stacey dolls?"
66173,264,115,501000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School Hallway,"They're not dolls, they're aspiration figures. But it might work."
66176,264,118,508000,Homer Simpson,Dining Room,That baby-proofing crook wanted to sell us safety covers for the electrical outlets.
66177,264,119,512000,Homer Simpson,Dining Room,But I'll just draw bunny faces on them to scare Maggie away.
66178,264,120,519000,Marge Simpson,Dining Room,She's not afraid of bunnies.
66179,264,121,521000,Homer Simpson,Dining Room,She will be.
66181,264,123,524000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Uh, Francine? I think we got off to a bad start so... Hey!"
66182,264,124,529000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"You like Malibu Stacey, too?"
66183,264,125,533000,Francine Rhenquist,Springfield Elementary School,Oh yeah.
66184,264,126,535000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"And you like the same one I like -- with the Grad-student Glamour Pack... just like the one in my... ...locker. That's mine, isn't it?"
66186,264,128,548000,Francine Rhenquist,Springfield Elementary School,Tastes like yours.
66187,264,129,554000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,How about jazz? Do you like jazz?
66188,264,130,558000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,I like jazz.
66189,264,131,559000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Milhouse? She got you, too?"
66190,264,132,561000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah. But it's not so bad, I'm standin' on Ralph."
66191,264,133,564000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,We're a totem pole.
66193,264,135,573000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"See, honey, Daddy's protecting you from all the sharp scary things. Here, hold this a sec."
66194,264,136,581000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ow! Oh, my..."
66195,264,137,585000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay Maggie, put it down."
66132,264,138,589000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Okay, now. Put..."
66196,264,139,591000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It...
66197,264,140,593000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Down.
66198,264,141,594000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh. Okay, that's quite enough, it's not funny anymore."
66200,264,143,603000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, no, no. Oh, Homie!"
66201,264,144,609000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now do you realize how unsafe the American home is? Baby accidents occur every three minutes.
66202,264,145,616000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm the one who told you that.
66203,264,146,618000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, but this is me talking. Look, I already encased the telephone in concrete."
66204,264,147,622000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,How are you supposed to dial?
66205,264,148,624000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Reach into these holes. I use a carrot.
66206,264,149,628000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Isn't that a little excessive? I mean, how are the buttons dangerous?"
66207,264,150,631000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Baby could order poison.
66208,264,151,632000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, that's ridiculous."
66209,264,152,637000,Poison Service,Simpson Home,Poison Delivery Service. A gift-basket of poisons is on its way.
66210,264,153,641000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm a horrible mother.
66211,264,154,642000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of course you are. Marge, I've finally discovered the reason God made me: to protect his tiniest, most breakable creatures. And I've got to share that gift with the world."
66212,264,155,656000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Get her outta here.
66214,264,157,661000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Why ya throwing tomatoes at yourself? Huh? Why ya throwing tomatoes at yourself?
66215,264,158,665000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,Your very question is faulty!
66216,264,159,667000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,You're faulty!
66217,264,160,670000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Knock-knock...
66218,264,161,671000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,What do you want?
66219,264,162,673000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Would you bullies be interested in some bodyguard work?
66220,264,163,676000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh, this is so funny. We were just talking about moving into protection."
66221,264,164,680000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,We're offering a recess-and-lunch package that's very affordable.
66222,264,165,683000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Well I'm gonna need full coverage -- my bully is highly aggressive. Check out these Indian burns.
66224,264,167,691000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,Triple twist! Nice work.
66225,264,168,693000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Elementary School,You sure this was done by hand?
66226,264,169,694000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, she's a real purist."
66227,264,170,697000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"She?! Sorry, we don't do girls. They bite and kick and scratch..."
66228,264,171,702000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,And sometimes we fall in love...
66230,264,173,705000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Wow. There's so much I don't understand about bullying.
66231,264,174,707000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"Yeah, there's a lotta history there. Did you know it predates agriculture."
66232,264,175,711000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Um-um.
66233,264,176,713000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Let's walk.
66234,264,177,716000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Finish the job.
66235,264,178,719000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I just don't understand Francine's motivation.
66236,264,179,721000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Why does she only go after the smart ones?
66237,264,180,730000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,That's like asking the square root of a million. No one will ever know.
66238,264,181,734000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Someone will. I'm gonna crack the bully code.
66240,264,183,739000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Savin' those babies. And the soft spots on their heads do, do, do, do do..."
66242,264,185,745000,Homer Simpson,Apu's Apartment,Problem: a pointy deity. And I've got the perfect solution.
66243,264,186,753000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,"Oh, thank you. No more Shiva-related pokings."
66244,264,187,757000,Homer Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"Yeah, you know down the line, you might want to switch to a nice round Buddha."
66246,264,189,761000,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu's Apartment,But we are Hindu.
66247,264,190,763000,Homer Simpson,Apu's Apartment,"So am I, but I don't get all huffy about it."
66249,264,192,766000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Ach, 'tis a mighty puddle-a puke."
66250,264,193,805000,Wendell Borton,Springfield Elementary School,I'm sorry.
66251,264,194,806000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Aw, that's all right, lad. It reminds me why I got into this business."
66252,264,195,812000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Willie, I need to see the school security tapes."
66253,264,196,815000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,Security tapes? There's no security tapes.
66254,264,197,819000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,It's hard to miss the cameras.
66255,264,198,824000,Groundskeeper Willie,Springfield Elementary School,"Aye, Willie's a stinkin' liar."
66257,264,200,831000,Lisa Simpson,Video Surveillance Room,Why does the school need to watch us all the time?
66258,264,201,835000,Groundskeeper Willie,Video Surveillance Room,School?
66260,264,202,836000,Lisa Simpson,Video Surveillance Room,"Ooh, here's the tape I need."
66261,264,203,837000,Groundskeeper Willie,Video Surveillance Room,Oh my God! That roll of towels is nearin' the end.
66262,264,204,843000,Groundskeeper Willie,Video Surveillance Room,Ach! It's on double red stripe!
66263,264,205,861000,Lisa Simpson,Video Surveillance Room,How did she know I was there?
66264,264,206,869000,Lisa Simpson,Video Surveillance Room,"Hey, that time she looked right at me and didn't touch me."
66265,264,207,875000,Lisa Simpson,Video Surveillance Room,Hmm...
66266,264,208,878000,Lisa Simpson,Video Surveillance Room,Of course! The nose clip!
66267,264,209,882000,Lisa Simpson,Video Surveillance Room,"Hey Willie, I think I'm onto something! Check this out!"
66268,264,210,886000,Lisa Simpson,Video Surveillance Room,"Not talking, eh Willie? Just listen, then. I think I figured out what sets off that big ape Francine... Willie? Willie?"
66270,264,212,910000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Come on, people! Move it! I want to see some sweat!"
66271,264,213,914000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,I'm not mastering another stair until you explain the purpose of this monstrous experiment.
66272,264,214,921000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I believe the key to bully-nerd antagonism lies in your drippings.
66273,264,215,925000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,Then I shall drip like a pot roast.
66274,264,216,928000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Excellent, now don't mind the squeegee."
66275,264,217,935000,Database,Springfield Elementary School,"Ah. Ah. The scraping seems wrong, but it feels so right."
66276,264,218,943000,Drederick Tatum,Springfield Elementary School,"...And so, as Heavyweight Champion, recognized by nine of the fourteen sanctioning bodies, I sincerely urge you all to stay in school. Uh, thank you."
66277,264,219,955000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Thank you, Drederick Tatum. That was truly a K.O. Knockout Oration."
66278,264,220,962000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,Need a ride home?
66279,264,221,963000,Drederick Tatum,Springfield Elementary School,You really don't want that. Trust me.
66280,264,222,966000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Mr. Tatum, do you mind if I swab you with this damp rag?"
66281,264,223,970000,Drederick Tatum,Springfield Elementary School,"No, not at all. Swab away."
66282,264,224,972000,Drederick Tatum,Springfield Elementary School,"Whoa, whoa, no one mentioned a beaker."
66283,264,225,975000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Please? It's for science.
66284,264,226,977000,Drederick Tatum,Springfield Elementary School,"Oh for science. In that case, proceed."
66285,264,227,980000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Lisa, this is outrageous! Explain yourself!"
66286,264,228,982000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Shh. It's working. Look.
66287,264,229,988000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Springfield Elementary School,"Nelson, what are you doing?!"
66289,264,230,991000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I don't know... I can't help myself.

66315,264,256,1080000,Scientist #1,LECTURE HALL,Constant flying saucer attacks. The solution?
66316,264,257,1085000,Scientist #1,LECTURE HALL,"And thus, the Earth is saved."
66317,264,258,1088000,Marge Simpson,LECTURE HALL,"That's quite an act to follow, Lisa."
66318,264,259,1093000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,"I know, and the crowd is so distinguished. The inventor of the walkie-talkie is out there."
66319,264,260,1098000,Marge Simpson,LECTURE HALL,Where?
66320,264,261,1099000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,"Third row, near the aisle."
66321,264,262,1101000,Marge Simpson,LECTURE HALL,"Ooh, you're right. And that's not his wife."

66328,264,268,1126000,Crowd,LECTURE HALL,What? / She's just a little girl... / Still in the larval stage... / Let's not listen...
66329,264,269,1133000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,"My study is entitled ""Airborne Pheromones and Aggression in Bullies""."
66330,264,270,1133000,Crowd,LECTURE HALL,Bullies? / Where? / I'm afraid! / ETC.
66331,264,271,1139000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,"For as long as there have been smart people, there have been bullies to prey on them. From Galileo...To Sir Isaac Newton...And even in the animal kingdom..."
66332,264,272,1151000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,But why do the brawny prey on the brainy? Is it jealousy?
66334,264,274,1157000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,No. The reason is chemical.
66336,264,276,1159000,Scientist #2,LECTURE HALL,Tha-that's impossible. Chemicals are our friends!
66337,264,277,1163000,Scientist #3,LECTURE HALL,She's a witch!

66343,264,283,1181000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,"I have isolated the chemical which is emitted by every geek, dork, and four-eyes. I call it ""Poindextrose""."
66344,264,284,1187000,Homer Simpson,LECTURE HALL,Woo hoo! Simpsons rule! Sorry.
66345,264,285,1198000,Francine Rhenquist,LECTURE HALL,"You're dead, nerd!"
66346,264,286,1200000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,"The bully has caught my scent, and she's at maximum rage. Professor Frink?"
66347,264,287,1204000,Professor Jonathan Frink,LECTURE HALL,"Very well, Lisa. I'll just finagle the glavin..."
66348,264,288,1211000,Scientist #2,LECTURE HALL,"Are you mad, Frink? Put down that science pole!"
66350,264,290,1220000,Francine Rhenquist,LECTURE HALL,Huh?
66351,264,291,1223000,Scientist #1,LECTURE HALL,My God! She stopped in her tracks.
66352,264,292,1225000,Scientist #2,LECTURE HALL,The little girl's invented some sort of bully repellent!
66354,264,294,1229000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,"Actually, it's just ordinary salad dressing."
66356,264,296,1233000,Marge Simpson,LECTURE HALL,So that's where that went.
66357,264,297,1234000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,"The pungent vinegar and tangy Roquefort block the smell receptors, rendering the bully harmless."
66358,264,298,1242000,Professor Jonathan Frink,LECTURE HALL,"Congratulations, Lisa. You are truly the standout of this year's Big Science Thing."
66359,264,299,1248000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,A gift certificate from J.C. Penney?
66360,264,300,1251000,Professor Jonathan Frink,LECTURE HALL,"Yes, you'll love their slacks."
66361,264,301,1254000,Marge Simpson,LECTURE HALL,"Oh, honey, we're so proud of you."
66362,264,302,1258000,Homer Simpson,LECTURE HALL,So all her bullying was just to get some attention.
66363,264,303,1262000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,"No, Dad! Didn't you listen to anything I said?"
66364,264,304,1265000,Homer Simpson,LECTURE HALL,Just to get some attention.
66365,264,305,1268000,Professor Jonathan Frink,LECTURE HALL,"Lisa, help!"
66366,264,306,1275000,Lisa Simpson,LECTURE HALL,The repellent's all gone!
66367,264,307,1277000,Francine's Mom,LECTURE HALL,Don't worry. She'll punch herself out.
66368,264,308,1279000,Francine Rhenquist,LECTURE HALL,"Suck fist, Doctor Dork!"
66369,264,309,1281000,Francine's Dad,LECTURE HALL,Someone's gonna sleep well tonight.
66370,264,310,1290000,Homer Simpson,LECTURE HALL,Pound that nerd.
