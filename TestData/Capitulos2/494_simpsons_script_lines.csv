128193,494,2,49000,Scratchy,Therapist's Office,In these d-d-d-dark t-t-t-times...
128198,494,7,76000,Krusty the Clown,Therapist's Office,"Hey-hey! Can't get enough Itchy and Scratchy! And now it's time for-- Another Itchy and Scratchy?! Who's the star of this show, me or--"
128200,494,9,111000,Krusty the Clown,The Krusty the Clown Show,"Why is my show all cartoons? And all the movies they're making fun of are over a year old! It's like those parodies were written when the movies came out, but it took so long to animate them that we look dated and hacky! Why can't we--"
128204,494,13,138000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Kids, that's enough TV. Maggie's eye is starting to wander."
128205,494,14,144000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Mo-om, what are you doing?"
128206,494,15,144000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,What a rip.
128207,494,16,146000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"No more TV! We're gonna get some fresh air, and visit the Museum... of Television."
128208,494,17,152000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Why can't we visit a real museum? One that doesn't have the skeletons of the Three Stooges in the lobby?
128209,494,18,158000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,We have to see the Museum of TV before next Wednesday when it closes forever.
128210,494,19,163000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,It's closing?! But where will people find clips of old TV shows if they're not housed in a giant building? Where? Where?
128211,494,20,177000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Ay carumba!
128214,494,23,195000,Lisa Simpson,Museum,"Hm, they're selling off all the old TV relics."
128215,494,24,200000,Bart Simpson,Museum,Whoa! The gun Sheriff Baby wore! Hm.
128216,494,25,207000,Homer Simpson,Museum,Bart! Thank God I had this in my pocket.
128217,494,26,218000,Homer Simpson,Museum,My pants are splitting wide open!
128219,494,27,221000,Homer Simpson,Museum,And people will see my tattoo of Donald Duck smoking a doob! That was for Marge's eyes only! Oh my God!
128221,494,29,231000,Homer Simpson,Museum of TV and Television,Fatso Flanagan!
128222,494,30,233000,Bart Simpson,Museum of TV and Television,Who's Fatso Flanagan?
128223,494,31,235000,Homer Simpson,Museum of TV and Television,Only the funniest black-and-white man ever!
128224,494,32,238000,Marge Simpson,Museum of TV and Television,"Isn't that just a rip-off of ""The Honeymooners?"""
128225,494,33,241000,Homer Simpson,Museum of TV and Television,"Everything's a rip-off of ""The Honeymooners."" Margie, you're the greatest."
128226,494,34,246000,Marge Simpson,Museum of TV and Television,"Oh Ralph, Fred, Archie, King of Queens, I mean Homer."
128227,494,35,252000,Fatso,Museum of TV and Television,"You'll see, Eunice! I'm gonna win the Irish Sweepstakes, and then I'm buying you a mink coat."
128229,494,37,260000,Fatso,Museum of TV and Television,Are you getting excited?
128230,494,38,261000,Eunice,Museum of TV and Television,"No, that's me not holding my breath!"
128232,494,40,266000,Fatso,Museum of TV and Television,"Just you wait, Eunice! Just you wait. Ka-chik, Kaboom, Ka-Splatter! See yer grave there?"
128233,494,41,277000,Homer Simpson,Museum of TV and Television,They were so childless and miserable.
128234,494,42,281000,Annie Crawford,Museum of TV and Television,The size forty-eights. That's when he was the funniest.
128235,494,43,284000,Homer Simpson,Museum of TV and Television,How would you know?
128236,494,44,285000,Annie Crawford,Museum of TV and Television,I was Fatso's agent.
128237,494,45,287000,Annie Crawford,Museum of TV and Television,Annie Dubinsky.
128238,494,46,289000,Annie Crawford,Museum of TV and Television,"If you ever hear a star's name and wonder ""is he dead?"" The answer is either I represent him, or ""yes."""
128239,494,47,295000,Homer Simpson,Museum of TV and Television,"Now, let me ask you something: is there a place for an old-fashioned lardass like me on today's television?"
128240,494,48,300000,Annie Crawford,Museum of TV and Television,"Would you play a bloated corpse on ""CSI?"""
128241,494,49,304000,Homer Simpson,Museum of TV and Television,Would I!
128242,494,50,308000,Annie Crawford,Museum of TV and Television,"Wow, that's good bloat work."
128243,494,51,310000,Bart Simpson,Museum of TV and Television,He always comes back really religious.
128246,494,54,314000,Krusty the Clown,CHANNEL SIX STUDIOS CONFERENCE ROOM,You're killing me here with this Catchy and Patchy. I'm barely on my own show!
128247,494,55,319000,Young Executive,CHANNEL SIX STUDIOS CONFERENCE ROOM,Today's kids are uncomfortable with a clown whose every reference they have to look up on Wikipedia.
128248,494,56,324000,Krusty the Clown,CHANNEL SIX STUDIOS CONFERENCE ROOM,"Wikipedia, Twitter... who names these things? Percy Dovetonsils? Get it? Come on, he was on... Ernie Kovacs... with a smoking jacket..."
128249,494,57,337000,Woman Executive,CHANNEL SIX STUDIOS CONFERENCE ROOM,Krusty... we want to make some changes.
128250,494,58,340000,Krusty the Clown,CHANNEL SIX STUDIOS CONFERENCE ROOM,What kind of changes?
128251,494,59,342000,Woman Executive,CHANNEL SIX STUDIOS CONFERENCE ROOM,"Krusty... um... this is never easy... but you're fired. Oh, that was easy."
128252,494,60,349000,Krusty the Clown,CHANNEL SIX STUDIOS CONFERENCE ROOM,"Oh, no. My contract states there's only one way you're allowed to fire me."
128253,494,61,357000,Krusty the Clown,CHANNEL SIX STUDIOS CONFERENCE ROOM,"Yep, everything's nice and legal."
128254,494,62,363000,Krusty the Clown,CHANNEL SIX STUDIOS CONFERENCE ROOM,Could this be more awkward?
128257,494,65,367000,Krusty the Clown,Agency,"...They took my dressing room, my parking space, even my writer -- so I don't have a funny third item. But at least I've got you, my agent and best friend."
128258,494,66,379000,Ron Rabinowitz,Agency,"Krustila... I'm gonna drop you as a friend first, so that when I drop you as a client, you'll know it's only business."
128259,494,67,384000,Krusty the Clown,Agency,"But we shared everything. Boats, girlfriends, condos. And when I finished, every one of 'em was spic and span."
128260,494,68,392000,Ron Rabinowitz,Agency,"Krusty, I'm gonna prove that it's over."
128261,494,69,394000,Krusty the Clown,Agency,What? I'm on your garage door opener?
128262,494,70,396000,Ron Rabinowitz,Agency,"It's a Smartphone, you out of it hack!"
128264,494,72,404000,Krusty the Clown,Agency,Little help?
128265,494,73,406000,Ron Rabinowitz,Agency,This only shuts the door.
128267,494,75,411000,Marge Simpson,Krusty Burger,"So, what was everyone's favorite moment at the museum?"
128268,494,76,414000,Lisa Simpson,Krusty Burger,I liked the knowledgeable docents.
128269,494,77,416000,Bart Simpson,Krusty Burger,I like the early closing time.
128271,494,79,420000,Lisa Simpson,Krusty Burger,Krusty?
128272,494,80,421000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty Burger,"Fate is so cruel. This morning I was a star, with a top agent. Now I'm strung out in a ball pit. Go Away! No kid should see his hero sunk so low."
128273,494,81,437000,Lisa Simpson,Krusty Burger,"Well, you're not exactly my hero. I see you more as a cautionary tale."
128274,494,82,441000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty Burger,What?! I'll show you who's a cautionary tale!
128275,494,83,445000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty Burger,I'll show everybody...!
128277,494,84,451000,Lisa Simpson,Krusty Burger,"You're not licked, Krusty. People love a comeback. Look at Robert Downey Junior... Mickey Rourke..."
128278,494,85,457000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty Burger,I don't know if I've got it in me.
128279,494,86,459000,Bart Simpson,Krusty Burger,"Well, people also love a quitter... Sarah Palin... The Beatles..."
128280,494,87,463000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty Burger,"Eh, it's hopeless without an agent."
128281,494,88,465000,Lisa Simpson,Krusty Burger,"You need an agent? We met a ten percenter today. She'll get you meetings with the eye, the peacock, the alphabet web. You'll have a skein on the sked before you can say ""Krusty's wardrobe furnished by Ha-Has of Beverly Hills""."
128282,494,89,471000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty Burger,A new agent? I better freshen up.
128283,494,90,484000,Krusty the Clown,Krusty Burger,Also better get back on those anti-psychotic meds.
128286,494,93,489000,Krusty the Clown,Small Office Building,This is a bad sign. I've been to classier gas stations.
128287,494,94,496000,Annie Crawford,Small Office Building,"I know that laugh! It's the laugh of the most ungrateful, credit-grabbing, other-people's-room-service-eating man that I ever met! I will never forgive you for what you did to me!"
128288,494,95,508000,Bart Simpson,Small Office Building,"Krusty, you know her?"
128289,494,96,510000,Krusty the Clown,Small Office Building,She sure knows me.
128291,494,98,516000,Lisa Simpson,Office Building,"Ms. Dubinsky, can you please just tell us why you hate Krusty?"
128292,494,99,518000,Annie Crawford,Office Building,"Come on in, it's a long story."
128293,494,100,522000,Homer Simpson,Office Building,Now I hate him too.
128294,494,101,524000,Annie Crawford,Office Building,It was the mid-sixties...
128297,494,104,526000,Annie Crawford,The Village Id,"I was a virgin agent, looking for a first client or a fourth husband. And then I saw him."
148273,494,105,533000,Young Krusty,The Village Id,"Hey-hey. Scary world. They start with the ""A"" bomb, then skipped right to the ""H"" bomb. These ""geniuses"" can blow up the planet, but they don't know the alphabet!"
128299,494,107,546000,Annie Crawford,The Village Id,I knew he could be big. He just needed some savvy fingers to mold his clay into an Ali.
128301,494,109,553000,Annie Crawford,THE OFF-BROADWAY DELI,"Herschel, you killed 'em tonight!"
148274,494,110,556000,Young Krusty,THE OFF-BROADWAY DELI,There wasn't a dry turtleneck in the house.
128303,494,111,559000,Annie Crawford,THE OFF-BROADWAY DELI,But mark my words: the bohemian crowd is small potatoes. You're gonna have to broaden your act if you want to play in Peoria.
148275,494,112,566000,Young Krusty,THE OFF-BROADWAY DELI,I don't want to play in Peoria. They're always doing construction on Highway Seventy-four.
128304,494,113,571000,Annie Crawford,THE OFF-BROADWAY DELI,"I mean, if you wanna hit it big, you've gotta lose this...stick this on...and make your comedy a touch more physical."
148276,494,114,582000,Young Krusty,THE OFF-BROADWAY DELI,How do I do that?
128305,494,115,584000,Annie Crawford,THE OFF-BROADWAY DELI,Like so.
148278,494,117,593000,Young Krusty,THE OFF-BROADWAY DELI,Wow. This is the best kind of comedy of all: cheap.
128306,494,118,597000,Annie Crawford,THE OFF-BROADWAY DELI,"Herschel, you're gonna get everything you want: money and women and--"
148279,494,119,602000,Young Krusty,THE OFF-BROADWAY DELI,There's only one thing I want. Ice for my ding-dong! And you.
128308,494,121,607000,Annie Crawford,Apartment Building,"Every night he had 'em rolling in the aisles, followed by a roll in the hey-hey with me."
128309,494,122,618000,Marge Simpson,Apartment Building,This is the part where I get the kids out of the room.
128310,494,123,621000,Annie Crawford,Apartment Building,"Oh, grow up. Today's kids are less sensitive than an army condom. They see more on TV than my mother did on her wedding night. And they don't complain about it for the next fifty years."
128312,494,125,631000,Annie Crawford,Annie's Apartment,"I got big plans for us, Krusty. This is just the beginning."
148280,494,126,636000,Young Krusty,Annie's Apartment,"Actually, sweetheart... it's the end. I'm leaving you for Ron Rabinowitz at United Parasites."
128313,494,127,642000,Annie Crawford,Annie's Apartment,You waited until now to tell me that!?
148281,494,128,644000,Young Krusty,Annie's Apartment,I can only tell the truth right after sex. But all during sex I was thinking it.
128314,494,129,649000,Annie Crawford,Annie's Apartment,Get out!
128316,494,131,652000,Annie Crawford,Apartment Building,You ungrateful pig! I made you!
128317,494,132,656000,Krusty the Clown,Apartment Building,Deep down I'm doing this to get back at my father.
128318,494,133,659000,Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Apartment Building,Don't blame this on me! Your childhood was heaven!
128319,494,134,664000,Annie Crawford,Apartment Building,"I was so mad at him, I didn't have sex with a clown for five months."
128320,494,135,668000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,What about mimes?
128321,494,136,669000,Annie Crawford,Apartment Building,"Come on, I'm not made of stone."
128322,494,137,671000,Marge Simpson,Apartment Building,"Annie, would you ever consider taking Krusty back as a client?"
127257,494,138,675000,Annie Crawford,Apartment Building,No! Absolutely not!
128323,494,139,678000,Annie Crawford,Apartment Building,"Trust with me is like a candle. When you blow it out, it's gone for good."
128324,494,140,683000,Krusty the Clown,Apartment Building,"What about a comedy candle? You know, that relights itself?"
128325,494,141,687000,Annie Crawford,Apartment Building,"I don't find those funny, just frustrating."
128326,494,142,689000,Bart Simpson,Apartment Building,"They're pretty funny. Once I used one on Milhouse. He was wishing for his parents to get back together, but the flame never went out."
128327,494,143,697000,Homer Simpson,Apartment Building,"Good one, boy."
128328,494,144,699000,Krusty the Clown,Apartment Building,"Annie, I'm down on my rebuilt knee. Can't you forgive me? Please? For the sake of me getting what I want?"
128329,494,145,710000,Annie Crawford,Apartment Building,"Fine. But no nonsense. Except of course during working hours, then it's all nonsense."
128331,494,147,717000,Annie Crawford,ANNIE'S TALENT AGENCY,"Great. So we're booked for three weeks in June at the Springfield Playhouse. I promise you Krusty will show up on time or sober. Yeah, that's right, I said ""or."""
128332,494,148,725000,Krusty the Clown,ANNIE'S TALENT AGENCY,"Let me get this straight: you want me to do my kids' show for adults? They're gonna want F-bombs and all I can give 'em is ""ka-ka"" and ""ta-tas."""
128333,494,149,732000,Annie Crawford,ANNIE'S TALENT AGENCY,"Krusty, there is nothing people love more than the things they loved when they were kids. So you re-create your show for adults! It worked like magic for Pee-Wee Herman after his setback."
128334,494,150,747000,Krusty the Clown,ANNIE'S TALENT AGENCY,What'd he get in trouble for?
128335,494,151,751000,Krusty the Clown,ANNIE'S TALENT AGENCY,That's all?! I did that while you were on the phone!
128337,494,153,759000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,"Y'know, I'm a little nervous about doing live theater again."
128338,494,154,763000,Annie Crawford,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,"Come on, didn't you do your TV show in front of an audience for years?"
128339,494,155,767000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,"Yeah, but they were kids and we gave 'em candy if they laughed. And if they didn't, until the seventies I hit 'em with a stick. Some jerk tracked down the kids and made a documentary. It's called ""Circus of Shame"" or something."
128340,494,156,780000,Sideshow Mel,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,"And now, let's welcome a man the Spanish call ""Señor No-Fun"": Krusty the Clown!"
128342,494,158,788000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,"Hey-hey, kids!"
128343,494,159,790000,Adult Audience,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,"Hey-hey, Krusty!"
128344,494,160,792000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,Who here likes nostalgia?
128346,494,162,795000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,Everything's perfect about the past except how it led to the present!
128347,494,163,799000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,Then welcome back the original Tick-Tock the Clock!
128348,494,164,803000,Tick-Tock,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,Would that I could turn back time and never play this career-killing role.
128349,494,165,808000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,"Ooo, looks like Tick-Tock is telling us it's time for..."
128350,494,166,813000,Adult Audience,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,What's In Krusty's Pocket?!
128351,494,167,829000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,"I've pulled out everything but my Little Krusty. Aw, what the heck."
128353,494,169,839000,Adult Audience,Theater,"Oh, that was great! I feel like I'm ten again!"
128354,494,170,843000,Audience Member,Theater,Everything I loved as a kid and hated as a teenager I love as an adult!
128355,494,171,847000,Krusty the Clown,Theater,"No one knows better than me that it's ""here today, gone tomorrow."" But I'm here today! Thanks to you, honey."
128356,494,172,858000,Annie Crawford,Theater,"Uh, um, sorry... / This one I think is mine... / Yeah, I'll take that... / I'll, gimme that one... / Well that looks better on you... / No, no, it screams you..."
128357,494,173,868000,Krusty the Clown,Theater,Let's just keep smooching till everything sorts itself out.
128358,494,174,871000,Krusty the Clown,Theater,I'm done.
128360,494,176,875000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,"Krusty, you're getting the best reviews of your career!"
128361,494,177,878000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,"Yep! I'm back on top! And this time I'm not blowing it on cocaine for my horses. They start well, then they get paranoid around the third turn."
128362,494,178,888000,Annie Crawford,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,And you'll have plenty to invest. The networks have come crawling.
128363,494,179,892000,Krusty the Clown,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,Which ones? Telebozo? Shtick at Nite? E.S.P.U.?
128364,494,180,896000,Annie Crawford,SPRINGFIELD THEATER,"Better, baby."
128366,494,182,898000,Female Executive,HBO-TYPE CABLE NETWORK BOARDROOM,Our premium cable network is a little different from what you're used to. Our brand is classy and upscale.
128367,494,183,904000,Male Executive,HBO-TYPE CABLE NETWORK BOARDROOM,And we pay for everything with soft porno and boxing.
128368,494,184,907000,Krusty the Clown,HBO-TYPE CABLE NETWORK BOARDROOM,Wait a minute -- there's soft porno?
128369,494,185,910000,Female Executive,HBO-TYPE CABLE NETWORK BOARDROOM,"And here you don't have to worry about budgets, and the critics are in our pocket."
128370,494,186,913000,Krusty the Clown,HBO-TYPE CABLE NETWORK BOARDROOM,Even the Boston Phoenix?
128371,494,187,915000,Female Executive,HBO-TYPE CABLE NETWORK BOARDROOM,"If not, we'll burn it to the ground."
128372,494,188,917000,Male Executive,HBO-TYPE CABLE NETWORK BOARDROOM,And that will be the end of that phoenix.
128373,494,189,919000,Krusty the Clown,HBO-TYPE CABLE NETWORK BOARDROOM,All good. I just have one non-negotiable demand:
128374,494,190,919000,Krusty the Clown,HBO-TYPE CABLE NETWORK BOARDROOM,This brass begonia here is my producer now until the end of time.
128375,494,191,930000,Annie Crawford,HBO-TYPE CABLE NETWORK BOARDROOM,Really?
128376,494,192,930000,Krusty the Clown,HBO-TYPE CABLE NETWORK BOARDROOM,Yep. And you know that anything said at a network pitch meeting can be taken to the bank.
128378,494,194,950000,Bart Simpson,HBOWTIME STUDIO,"Krusty, my man, you finally hit it big."
128379,494,195,952000,Krusty the Clown,HBOWTIME STUDIO,"You said it! The ""entourage"" actors are now my interns!"
128380,494,196,956000,Kevin Dillon,HBOWTIME STUDIO,"I got your coffees, Mr. K.!"
128381,494,197,958000,Krusty the Clown,HBOWTIME STUDIO,Too hot! Too cold!
