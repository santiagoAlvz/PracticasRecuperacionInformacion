144067,555,13,107000,Homer Simpson,SIMPSON'S YARD,Absolutely not.

144069,555,15,112000,Homer Simpson,SIMPSON'S YARD,"My one weakness: the third ""really."" Come with me."
144072,555,17,119000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Turn right here. I keep this frozen meat in case society collapses but we still have power.
144073,555,18,125000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Garage,Homer! This is my freezerino.
144074,555,19,127000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Seriously, I am getting so tired of those stupid Flandersisms."
144075,555,20,133000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Garage,It's the name of the freezer!
144076,555,21,135000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Okily Dokahama?!
144077,555,22,137000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Garage,"Right next to Mount Fu-Gee, I'm glad to see ya!"

144081,555,26,147000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I'll cook this meat, cut it up, and make it into sandwiches."
144082,555,27,151000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,And I will wait and worry!
144083,555,28,185000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"...so, I cooked the meat, sliced it up, made sandwiches, cut off the crusts, fed those to the dog..."
144084,555,29,191000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, somebody wants more crusts. Here you go, boy!"
144086,555,31,200000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Here ya go. Have some more.
144088,555,33,204000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Still hungry, buddy?"
144089,555,34,206000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Dad, dogs don't know when to stop eating."
144090,555,35,208000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Lucky.
144091,555,36,210000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Ta-da!
144093,555,38,215000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh Marge, once again you've taken one of my screw-ups and turned it into food. Man, if only you could do that with Bart."
144094,555,39,224000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Mo-om! Dad's imagining me as food again!
144095,555,40,228000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He does it to all of us.
144096,555,41,229000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Can someone put butter on me?
144097,555,42,231000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Familyicious.
144098,555,43,234000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"C'mon, where's that butter?"
144100,555,45,240000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Hey mom, can you pack me a dozen sandwiches in my lunch tomorrow? Meat, no meat, it's all good."
144101,555,46,246000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Sandwiches, Mom. Fill 'er up. And the garment bag."
144102,555,47,249000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,What's going on? Are you kids eating your feelings?
144103,555,48,252000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"No, whenever anything bothers me I harmlessly vent it to Maggie."
144105,555,50,259000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,I smash fluorescent lights at the gravel pit.
144071,555,51,263000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,But that's so many sandwiches!
144106,555,52,264000,Lisa Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Kids love 'em. We trade them at school.
144107,555,53,267000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,They replaced cigarettes as our currency.
144108,555,54,268000,Marge Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,Bubble gum cigarettes?
144109,555,55,270000,Bart Simpson,Lisa's Bedroom,"Yeah, sure."
144111,555,57,274000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What are you doing here, freezer stealer?"
144112,555,58,277000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Ned's letting us use his freezer to store the extra sandwiches.
144113,555,59,280000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Well, I felt a little guilty for taking back what belonged to me."
144114,555,60,284000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo! Flanders isn't perfect!
144115,555,61,286000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Never claimed to be.
144116,555,62,288000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Yeah! And aren't!
144119,555,65,293000,TRUDY ZENGLER,Springfield Elementary School,"Marge, see this face? It's opportunity! Blink and you'll miss it."
144121,555,67,299000,TRUDY ZENGLER,Springfield Elementary School,"Just kidding. I'm right behind you. I'm Trudy Zengler, vice president of development for ""Mother Hubbard's Sandwich Cupboards."""
144122,555,68,306000,TRUDY ZENGLER,Springfield Elementary School,How would you like to run your own business? Take control of your financial future!
144124,555,70,315000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,"Homie, how much money do we have put aside in case something happens to you?"
144125,555,71,323000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,None.
144126,555,72,327000,TRUDY ZENGLER,Simpson Master Bedroom,"If that flashback you just described is true, you can't afford not to open this franchise."
144127,555,73,332000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Master Bedroom,I'm in.
144129,555,75,338000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, Mom! You're gonna open a sandwich store?!"
144130,555,76,341000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-huh!
144131,555,77,342000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, if you're gonna do this, there's one thing I need to know. And be honest. What's your soda refill policy?"
144132,555,78,349000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,All you can drink... if you buy a jumbo cup.
144133,555,79,352000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Careful, Marge, that's how I bankrupted a Pizza Hut."
144134,555,80,358000,Thought Bubble Homer,Simpson Home,"Mmm, that's good. More, more! Refill! Free!"
144135,555,81,366000,Manager,Simpson Home,"I...I just, I-- where is it going?"
144138,555,84,375000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,My store. My offset spatula! Mine!
144139,555,85,384000,Krusty the Clown,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Well, well, well. Seems like someone forgot there's a Krustyburger two blocks away."
144140,555,86,391000,Krusty the Clown,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Go ahead, Teeny. Show 'em what we did to Arby's."
144143,555,89,405000,Krusty the Clown,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,She did the one thing I never could. Feed him.
144144,555,90,408000,TRUDY ZENGLER,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"You're a cool customer, Marge. And we've got your back. With everything from pre-sliced tomatoes, to the homey needlepoint on the walls."
144146,555,92,418000,TRUDY ZENGLER,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"And now, the best part of running your own franchise -- picking your Sammy Fammy! You'll want to avoid that."
144147,555,93,430000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Your monkey just ate all my turkey.
144148,555,94,433000,Krusty the Clown,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Do you want some monkey meat to replace it?
144149,555,95,434000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,No!
144150,555,96,436000,Krusty the Clown,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,It's low-fat.
144153,555,99,437000,Gil Gunderson,MANAGER'S OFFICE,"As you can see, I was just two credits short at Southern Illinois, and-- I gotta be honest with you, Marge. I need this job bad."
144154,555,100,444000,Marge Simpson,MANAGER'S OFFICE,"You seem to have had, and lost, a lot of jobs."
144155,555,101,448000,Gil Gunderson,MANAGER'S OFFICE,"God, it's a new world, Marge. A whole new world. Why my Dad spent his whole life at one company. Started in the basement mailroom, and ended his career jumpin' out the window from the top floor."
144157,555,103,460000,Gil Gunderson,MANAGER'S OFFICE,He was wearing this suit!
144158,555,104,462000,Gil Gunderson,MANAGER'S OFFICE,Corpse suit.
144159,555,105,467000,Marge Simpson,MANAGER'S OFFICE,I'm not sure this is going to work out.
144160,555,106,471000,Shauna Chalmers,MANAGER'S OFFICE,"Oh, I get it. You won't hire me because I'm pretty. That can be a lawsuit."
144161,555,107,475000,Marge Simpson,MANAGER'S OFFICE,No lawsuit! You're hired!
144162,555,108,477000,Shauna Chalmers,MANAGER'S OFFICE,"Okay, so, I don't want to do anything that'll ruin my manicure."
144163,555,109,480000,Marge Simpson,MANAGER'S OFFICE,"Well, what do you want a job for?"
144164,555,110,482000,Shauna Chalmers,MANAGER'S OFFICE,So I can get manicures. Duh!
144165,555,111,485000,Marge Simpson,MANAGER'S OFFICE,"Professor... could you say ""Welcome to Mother Hubbard's Sandwich Cupboard"" without making any other noises?"
144167,555,112,491000,Professor Jonathan Frink,MANAGER'S OFFICE,"Of course I can, my dear child. Welcome to... Mother Hubbard's... uh... Sandwich mcboing boing glavin flyvy hyvy goyvyn and now I'm running to the Unemployment Office."
144169,555,114,508000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm too nervous to sleep.
144175,555,120,517000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm sorry I woke you up. I'm just so anxious about tomorrow. What if the store fails? What if I fail?
144176,555,121,524000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, you woke up the right man in bed."
144177,555,122,527000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"I love you, Marjorie. And I've had my share of failures, sure. And sometimes I get pretty nervous. But thanks for talking it out with me. I think I can finally get to sleep now."
144178,555,123,539000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"No! No, no, no! It was me that couldn't get to--"
144181,555,126,547000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Make love now?
144184,555,129,551000,Gil Gunderson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S,"Say there, buddy... are ya interested in our Two-For-One Tuesday?"
144185,555,130,556000,Carl Carlson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S,"I never would have been, till I got this flyer!"
144186,555,131,558000,Gil Gunderson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S,"Interested in some exotic dancers, huh? Today's ""Tell You Their Real Name"" Tuesday."
144187,555,132,563000,Carl Carlson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S,"Are you working two jobs here, Gil?"
144188,555,133,565000,Gil Gunderson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S,"No, and I resent the accusation."
144189,555,134,568000,Gil Gunderson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S,"Tell me. It's pointing west, right?"
144191,555,136,571000,Shauna Chalmers,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Hello! No change for the meter.
144192,555,137,574000,Homer Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"No, no, I'd like to see the manager."
144193,555,138,578000,Shauna Chalmers,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Mrs. Boss! Some fat blob wants to see you.
144194,555,139,582000,Homer Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Marge, come on, let's celebrate! It's your first day!"
144195,555,140,586000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Homie, I'm a little worried. Do you know there were no customers between two and four?"
144197,555,141,592000,Homer Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Hey, Tony Roma's wasn't built in a day. But don't worry. I told everyone about this place and they're all going to support you. You do have drone delivery, right? I kinda promised that."
144198,555,142,603000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,We don't have drone delivery! You'll have to find a substitute!
144200,555,144,609000,Homer Simpson,Lenny's Apartment,Dammit!
144203,555,147,621000,Lisa Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,What's wrong?
144204,555,148,623000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Mother Hubbard Central expects you to buy a lot of stuff from them. Uniforms, fixins... it's like they don't care if you make money as long as they make money. What kind of corporation does that?"
144205,555,149,637000,Gil Gunderson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"And I'm not trying to be political, but I'm the only one you can trust here."
144206,555,150,646000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Shauna! I saw that! I'm going to have to let you go.
144207,555,151,651000,Shauna Chalmers,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Oh, so you're like firing me like in that movie where that girl gets fired?"
144208,555,152,655000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,I'm sorry.
144209,555,153,656000,Shauna Chalmers,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"If I'm fired, then he's quitting!"
144210,555,154,658000,Squeaky-Voiced Teen,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,I am?
144211,555,155,663000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,What am I going to do? I'm down two employees and it's the afternoon rush!
144212,555,156,671000,Chief Wiggum,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,I need a six-foot party sub. Lots of mayonnaise. And I mean lots. Never stop squirting mayo.
144213,555,157,677000,Homer Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Don't worry, baby."
144214,555,158,685000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Thank you, Homie."
144216,555,160,687000,Marge Simpson,Back Room,"Why, why does this have to be so hard?"
144217,555,161,690000,Gil Gunderson,Back Room,"Oh, uh... sorry there, Marge."
144218,555,162,693000,Gil Gunderson,Back Room,This is my changing room.
144219,555,163,695000,Marge Simpson,Back Room,You are working two jobs!
144220,555,164,697000,Gil Gunderson,Back Room,"No, these are my real legs. I'm --I'm not a well man, Marge."
144222,555,166,705000,Lisa Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"This is so sad. In his homeland, Dad was a nuclear engineer."
144223,555,167,709000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"I was short-staffed and your father volunteered. Actually, I was wondering if you two might want to lend a hand."
144224,555,168,716000,Lisa Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"No, no. You want to make American kids work?"
144196,555,169,720000,Bart Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,You're supposed to be driving me to a tennis class I said I wanted then I changed my mind and I hate it so much I'm faking stomach aches to get out of it.
144166,555,170,727000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Would it kill one of you to wash a bell pepper?
144225,555,171,730000,Lisa Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Um, I'm not sure this is the best use of my skills."
144226,555,172,732000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"I said wash! And Bart, go work the deep fryer."
144227,555,173,736000,Bart Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Well, if I'll be doin' this when I'm forty, might as well start now."
144228,555,174,746000,Bart Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,I'm home!
144229,555,175,748000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Guys, this is gonna be hard for a while, but we'll get through this... as a family."
144230,555,176,753000,Gil Gunderson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Yes we will. The Simpsons and Old Uncle Gil.
144231,555,177,758000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Gil, I've been meaning to tell you, you're fired."
144232,555,178,762000,Gil Gunderson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Guess I had it comin'. Can I take some baloney heels?
144233,555,179,767000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,As many as you like...
144234,555,180,768000,Gil Gunderson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,You sure?
144235,555,181,769000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Take 'em!
144236,555,182,770000,Gil Gunderson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Aw, yeah! A big ol' fat one!"
144237,555,183,819000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Good baby.
144238,555,184,821000,"""Just Stamp the Ticket"" Man",MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Oh yeah. Real good baby.
144239,555,185,823000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Good everybody. You won't believe it but we actually turned a profit today.
144240,555,186,830000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Kids, we're taking some shredded lettuce, pre-sliced cheese, and cold cuts and turning them into the American dream."
144241,555,187,840000,Bart Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Uh, guys... what the hell is that?"
144242,555,188,848000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,They're opening another Mother Hubbard -- across the street?! How could they? How could they?!
144243,555,189,854000,Chief Wiggum,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Move, move, move!"
144244,555,190,860000,Lou,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Uh, Chief, uh, who you fooling with this one sandwich a day diet?"
144245,555,191,864000,Chief Wiggum,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"It's on whole wheat, Lou. Cleans up your insides."
144246,555,192,868000,Chief Wiggum,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,I'm gonna sit next to it.
144248,555,194,874000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Town Square,How could they open another franchise so close to me?
144249,555,195,877000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,"Don't worry, Marge. They can't beat us. Because we're family-run."
144250,555,196,881000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Town Square,Hillbillies!
144251,555,197,885000,Cletus Spuckler,Springfield Town Square,"Okay, in you go, Minimum Wade, Addem-up, Oxycontin, Fontanelle, and Pediculus. You make way for those that's nocturnal comin' off the night shift."
144254,555,200,905000,Bart Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Mom, I need a few hours off. It's Milhouse's birthday party and I'm all the guests."
144255,555,201,910000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"I understand, honey. Did you get someone to cover?"
144256,555,202,912000,Bart Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Grampa.
144257,555,203,914000,Grampa Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD SANDWICH CUPBOARD,I'm workin' the drive-thru!
144258,555,204,916000,Marge Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD SANDWICH CUPBOARD,There is no drive thru!
144261,555,207,927000,Homer Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Finally! A customer!
144263,555,209,931000,Waylon Smithers,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Simpson! Why aren't you at work?
144264,555,210,933000,C. Montgomery Burns,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Hold that famous temper, Smithers, Who is this?"
144265,555,211,940000,C. Montgomery Burns,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Simpson, introduce me to this almond-eyed beauty, and all is forgiven."
144266,555,212,944000,Homer Simpson,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Uh, Mr. Burns, I'd like you to meet... Mother Hubbard standee."
144267,555,213,948000,C. Montgomery Burns,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"From the Wisconsin Standees! Milk-fed, yet so slim. Permit me to play you a tune on my mouth organ."
144268,555,214,957000,Waylon Smithers,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,"Sir, maybe we should go."
144269,555,215,958000,C. Montgomery Burns,MOTHER HUBBARD'S SANDWICH CUPBOARD,Sorry you died! Put the body with the others.
