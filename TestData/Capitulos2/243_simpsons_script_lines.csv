59712,243,95,403000,Bart Simpson,Simpson House of the Future,"President-Elect. I could've been President, but I'm too real. People can't deal with what I'm layin' down. They're just like, ""Whoa, dude, you can't say that."" And I'm like, ""Watch me."""
59713,243,96,408000,Marge Simpson,Simpson House of the Future,We're not giving you money.
59714,243,97,415000,Bart Simpson,Simpson House of the Future,But I want some.

59725,243,108,457000,Bart Simpson,Flanders Home,"Listen, dude..."
59726,243,109,458000,Ned Flanders,Flanders Home,"Oh, hi Bart. How much this time?"

59741,243,125,528000,Ralph Wiggum,BEACH BUNGALOW,"Now we've got no home, no money, and our band's going nowhere. And it's all your fault. Smell ya later, Bart. Smell you later forever."
59742,243,126,539000,Bart Simpson,BEACH BUNGALOW,He's right. I'm a loser. There's only one way out of this mess.

59748,243,132,575000,Bart Simpson,INDIAN CASINO,Lisa's the President? I'm a pathetic loser? I gotta be honest: I'm not loving this vision.
59749,243,133,580000,Casino Manager,INDIAN CASINO,The fire has more wisdom to impart to you. In three... two...
59751,243,135,588000,Bart Simpson,Pennsylvania Avenue,Fifteen-ninety-six...

59758,243,142,624000,Lisa Simpson,White House,"As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump. How bad is it, Secretary Van Houten?"
59759,243,143,630000,Milhouse Van Houten,White House,We're broke.
59760,243,144,632000,Lisa Simpson,White House,The country is broke? How can that be?

59762,243,146,642000,Aide,White House,The Balanced Breakfast Program just created a generation of ultra-strong super-criminals.
59765,243,147,646000,Milhouse Van Houten,White House,And Midnight Basketball taught them to function without sleep.
59766,243,148,649000,Lisa Simpson,White House,What about my pledge to build the world's largest bookmobile? Isn't there any money left for that?
59767,243,149,654000,Aide,White House,No. And we've borrowed from every country in the world.

59773,243,155,665000,Bart Simpson,White House,"I knew you'd need some help keepin' it real, so I figured I could be, like, your co-President."
59774,243,156,671000,Lisa Simpson,White House,Co-President? Are you crazy?
59775,243,157,674000,Bart Simpson,White House,"Mo-om, Lisa won't share."

59778,243,160,684000,Marge Simpson,White House,Don't you think we should wait for Lisa? She is the President.
59779,243,161,687000,Homer Simpson,White House,She knows what time dinner is.

59784,243,166,712000,Marge Simpson,White House,"Aww, just like her mommy, Maggie Senior. So, what did everyone do today?"
59785,243,167,719000,Lisa Simpson,White House,Appointed a Supreme Court Justice.

59790,243,172,724000,Lisa Simpson,White House,"Dad, that's just a myth. Lincoln didn't hide any gold in the White House."
59791,243,173,728000,Homer Simpson,White House,Then what is his ghost protecting?
59792,243,174,731000,Lisa Simpson,White House,"Hey, that's my helicopter!"
59793,243,175,734000,Bart Simpson,White House,"Yeah, I sent it to pick up Ralph. No one was using it."

59795,243,177,741000,Lisa Simpson,White House,"Bart, you do not send a billion-dollar helicopter to pick up your drinking buddy."

59797,243,179,748000,Lisa Simpson,White House,"No, I didn't."
59799,243,182,749000,Lisa Simpson,White House,"I am proud to honor the players of the Negro Leagues of Rollerball. And as we strive for the desegregation of all deathsports, we cannot help but be inspired by..."

59803,243,186,771000,Bart Simpson,White House,"Relax, Lis. You'll live longer."
59804,243,187,773000,Lisa Simpson,White House,I can't relax! Being president is hard work. Maybe you should try doing something with your life.
59805,243,188,779000,Bart Simpson,White House,I'm gonna!
59806,243,189,780000,Lisa Simpson,White House,Yeah. Did you even call about that messenger job?
59807,243,190,782000,Bart Simpson,White House,"Yeah, but they said I wouldn't get my first check for two weeks! Meanwhile, they're making major interest on my salary. Hey, maybe I can sue 'em."
59809,243,192,789000,Homer Simpson,White House,... four score and four... four score and five... four score and six... four score and seven paces.
59810,243,193,799000,Marge Simpson,White House,Wait! How do you know this is where Lincoln buried the gold? You just started counting from an arbitrary place.
59811,243,194,806000,Homer Simpson,White House,I started what from a what?
59812,243,195,807000,Marge Simpson,White House,Your plan makes no sense.
59813,243,196,809000,Homer Simpson,White House,"Gold bars discovered by Marge? Zero. Gold bars discovered by Homer? Well, let's just see..."

59820,243,203,833000,Lisa Simpson,Oval Office,"See, that has the same problem. We need to soften the blow."

59862,243,243,965000,Aide,White House,"I'm afraid it looks pretty grim. We're going to have to give them the amber waves of grain, the purple mountains' majesty, and the shores of Tripoli."
59863,243,244,971000,Lisa Simpson,White House,We don't own the shores of Tripoli.
59864,243,245,973000,Aide,White House,"Shh. By the time they find out, we'll have taken our cyanide pills."
