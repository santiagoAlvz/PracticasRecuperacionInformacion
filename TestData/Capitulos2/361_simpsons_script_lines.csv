93595,361,114,543000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, are you callin' my life-partner a sissy? 'Cause a hundred bucks says he could whup you in arm wrestling."

93600,361,119,572000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Well, uh... what do you like?"
93601,361,120,574000,The Rich Texan,Moe's Tavern,I dunno... a good book... long walk on the beach...
93603,361,122,580000,Moe Szyslak,Beach,"So, we uh, we kinda evened things up here?"

93607,361,126,591000,Bart Simpson,SPRINGSHIRE,"Me too, Mother."
93608,361,127,592000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGSHIRE,"Ooh, such respect! You could grow up to be a doorman!"
93610,361,129,601000,British Woman,Teahouse,"""Loyal customers, we have been forced to close forever. It seems our cakes were filled with rat droppings. It's not that we're bad people, we just weren't paying close attention. Ta-taa!"""
93611,361,130,612000,Bart Simpson,Teahouse,What'd it say?
93612,361,131,615000,Marge Simpson,Teahouse,Uh... she died.
93614,361,133,620000,Marge Simpson,Countryside,"Well, Bart, I guess that's it. We'll have to go back to our separate things."
93615,361,134,625000,Bart Simpson,Countryside,"Hey, we could have tea in my treehouse."
93616,361,135,627000,Marge Simpson,Countryside,You... invited me... to your treehouse? Wow -- that's like Bruce Wayne letting his mother into the Bat-club.
93617,361,136,644000,Marge Simpson,Countryside,So... is that standing water?
93618,361,137,648000,Bart Simpson,Countryside,"Yeah. You know, that puddle started life as a bowl of cereal."
93620,361,139,656000,Marge Simpson,Countryside,I think I might be able to turn this treehouse into a teahouse.
93621,361,140,664000,Bart Simpson,Countryside,"Mom, this is great! It makes our real house look like a pile of crap."
93622,361,141,668000,Marge Simpson,Countryside,And I threw out all your old comics!
93623,361,142,670000,Bart Simpson,Countryside,Mom!
93624,361,143,672000,Marge Simpson,Countryside,Just kidding. Today's mom knows to seal 'em in Mylar so you can never read them again. Never ever again.
93626,361,145,682000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Where are you two going?
93627,361,146,684000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm joining the professional arm-wrestling circuit!
93628,361,147,686000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Uh-huh. And how will this affect your job at the power plant?
93629,361,148,690000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Negatively, I assume."
93630,361,149,691000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, well, we're off to buy a new tea set. Have fun!"
93631,361,150,698000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Gee, she didn't seem angry, or anything. Maybe she doesn't care anymore!"
93632,361,151,704000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Forget about it, Homer. She's dead to you now."
93633,361,152,706000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay.
93634,361,153,708000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"Now, if we get bored on the bus, I got a book of brain teasers here. Let's see... oh, ""Brothers and sisters have I none, but this man's father is my father's son."" Huh. Screw you, you stupid thing!"
93635,361,154,724000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Home,"""He is my son!"" That blows!"
93637,361,156,731000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,I can't wait to use our new Krusty the Clown tea service!
93638,361,157,734000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,Me neither. Oh my God! I took the salesman's pen. I'll be right back.
93639,361,158,742000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Mall,"Green Tea? What's that? Mr. T's Irish brother? Earl Grey? I'd rather have Linda Gray. Is she still alive? What's next?... What the hell, I'm not doing that one."
93641,361,160,756000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Mall,Hey Simpson!
93642,361,161,758000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Mall,What are you gonna do with that teapot? Gay out?
93643,361,162,761000,DOLPH,Springfield Mall,I'll answer for you: yes.
93644,361,163,763000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,What? Um... uh... I just shoplifted this bad boy. Housewares never knew what hit 'em.
93645,361,164,769000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Mall,Why didn't you steal something cool?
93646,361,165,771000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Uh... because I'm gonna bring it back to the store for store credit.
93647,361,166,776000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Mall,"How you gonna get credit without a gift receipt, ass?"
93648,361,167,779000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Um, well..."
93649,361,168,780000,DOLPH,Springfield Mall,"We've seen you hanging out with your mom, Simpson."
93650,361,169,782000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Mall,Word on the street is... you're a mama's boy.
93651,361,170,787000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Hey, there is no way that Bart Simpson is a mama's boy."
93652,361,171,791000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Oh, Ba-art!"
93653,361,172,793000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,Aren't they jazzy? They match the new curtains we hung in your treehouse!
93654,361,173,798000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Here, try yours on. I got you a child's large because your tummy's getting kind of bloopy from all the cakes we've been having. Somebody here likes princess cakes."
93655,361,174,808000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Springfield Mall,"Princess cake? Bart, you just got yourself a nickname for life."
93656,361,175,812000,DOLPH,Springfield Mall,Hey Princess Cake! Want some princess cake?
93657,361,176,816000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Bart, are you having a fight with your boyfriends?"
93658,361,177,819000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,Shut up! I don't want your stupid sweatshirt! Or your tea set!
93659,361,178,825000,Krusty the Clown,Springfield Mall,Smashing voids my warranty! Have a good life!
93660,361,179,828000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Mom, I only hung out with you because I felt sorry for you!"
93661,361,180,833000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Mall,That was weird. Will you teach us how to smoke?
93662,361,181,837000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,No!
93665,361,183,844000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I can't believe she suckered me into being a mama's boy. I've got to make this place mine again.
93666,361,184,852000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,It's gonna take me weeks to get the booger wall back up.
93667,361,185,857000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Bart?
93668,361,186,859000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,You're not allowed in here! Can't you read the sign?
93669,361,187,862000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,You mean this?
93670,361,188,863000,Bart Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,Ay carumba!
93671,361,189,867000,Lisa Simpson,Bart's Treehouse,I'm worried about Mom. She's been sitting there just petting the dog for two hours.
93674,361,192,906000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hey, Mom."
93675,361,193,907000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Hello, Bart. Just so you know, I sold our bike."
93677,361,195,912000,Chief Wiggum,Springfield,Faster! Faster!
93680,361,198,918000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,But we had so much fun on that bike!
93682,361,200,922000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Mom, I really did like hanging out with you."
93683,361,201,930000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,You know... there's a karaoke night at school tomorrow. Some of the little kids are bringing their parents. Do you wanna go?
93684,361,202,938000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Really? Could we do a duet?
93685,361,203,941000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Sure... why not? It'll be fun.
93686,361,204,945000,Chief Wiggum,Simpson Kitchen,It's still happening!
93688,361,206,952000,Homer Simpson,AMERICAN LEGION HALL,I can't believe Marge hasn't called me. Maybe I should go home.
93689,361,207,957000,Moe Szyslak,AMERICAN LEGION HALL,"Oh, Marge called you. She said... uh... that she loves you and she hopes you break the guy's arm so hard that it pokes through his skin."
93690,361,208,964000,Homer Simpson,AMERICAN LEGION HALL,Did she say anything else?
93691,361,209,965000,Moe Szyslak,AMERICAN LEGION HALL,"Yeah. She said to shut up, and stop asking questions and listen to Moe."
93692,361,210,968000,Homer Simpson,AMERICAN LEGION HALL,"Oh Marge, I love her so much."
93693,361,211,970000,Moe Szyslak,AMERICAN LEGION HALL,"Now Homer, you gotta keep your head in the game, all right? Your first opponent is Lefty ""The Righty"" Leftwright."
93694,361,212,979000,Homer Simpson,AMERICAN LEGION HALL,He looks tough.
93695,361,213,981000,Moe Szyslak,AMERICAN LEGION HALL,"Yeah, he only lost once: in his fight against illiteracy."
93696,361,214,984000,Homer Simpson,AMERICAN LEGION HALL,I can relate. I've fought that foe and lost many times.
