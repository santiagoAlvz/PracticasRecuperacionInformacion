50363,213,81,381000,Maude Flanders,Flanders's Car,"Well, you may be a bit cautious, but what's wrong with that? Some people like chunky peanut butter, some like smooth."
50364,213,82,388000,Ned Flanders,Flanders's Car,"Mmm-hmm. And some people steer clear of that whole hornet's nest. I'll stick with just plain white bread, thank you very much. Maybe with a--"
