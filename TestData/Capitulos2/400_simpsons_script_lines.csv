103976,400,239,1037000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo!
103977,400,240,1038000,Birch Barlow,Simpson Home,Liberals hate families...
103978,400,241,1039000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Liberals!
103979,400,242,1039000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals!
103980,400,243,1046000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo--
103983,400,244,1047000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Fox deliberately runs shows that will earn them huge fines, which are then funneled through the FCC straight to the Republican Party. Everybody in the media knows it, but no one has the guts to say it."
103984,400,245,1055000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Not true. You've got the guts -- and I've got a web cam! This time you can tell the truth...
103985,400,246,1060000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,And swear like a lumberjack who hacked off a leg. Let's do it!
103986,400,247,1065000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hoo!
103987,400,248,1066000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Woo hoo? Liberals? Woo hoo?
103988,400,249,1075000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Here we go. Four-three-two...
103989,400,250,1079000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Good evening. Thank you for inviting me into your laps. Friends, the press and the government are in bed together in an embrace so intimate and wrong, they could spoon on a twin mattress and still have room for Ted Koppel."
103990,400,251,1091000,Kent Brockman,Simpson Home,"Journalists used to question the reasons for war, and expose abuse of power. Now like toothless babies, they suckle on the sugary teat of misinformation, and poop it into the diaper we call the six o'clock news."
103992,400,253,1104000,Kent Brockman,Sideshow Mel's House,Demand more of your government! Demand more of your press!
103993,400,254,1106000,Sideshow Mel,Sideshow Mel's House,"Fellow primate, this is a wakeup call!"
103996,400,257,1114000,Kent Brockman,DARK CASTLE,Vote out your so-called representatives! Reject your corporate masters! Buy nothing! Hug your children! Love the one you're with!
103997,400,258,1121000,C. Montgomery Burns,DARK CASTLE,Look at that rabble-rouser! He's threatening our ill-gotten gains!
103998,400,259,1125000,The Rich Texan,DARK CASTLE,Galdarnit! I worked hard to ill-get those gains! How do we stop him?
103999,400,260,1131000,Dracula,DARK CASTLE,I could Dracula-bite him.
104000,400,261,1134000,Lindsay Naegle,DARK CASTLE,"Actually, Krusty and I have been working on a plan to take out Brockman. You wanna start?"
104001,400,262,1139000,Krusty the Clown,DARK CASTLE,"No, why don't you start."
104002,400,263,1140000,Lindsay Naegle,DARK CASTLE,Oh but you're so good at starting!
104003,400,264,1142000,Krusty the Clown,DARK CASTLE,You really think so?
104004,400,265,1143000,Lindsay Naegle,DARK CASTLE,Oh I know so. Go on.
104005,400,266,1143000,Krusty the Clown,DARK CASTLE,All right.
104007,400,268,1145000,Rainier Wolfcastle,DARK CASTLE,Do you think there's something going on between those two?
104008,400,269,1148000,Dracula,DARK CASTLE,To find out I could turn myself into a bat and follow them around.
103981,400,270,1152000,Rainier Wolfcastle,DARK CASTLE,"Oh, you couldn't even get our pizza orders right."
103982,400,271,1155000,Dracula,DARK CASTLE,"Every order is half this, half that. It's confusing!"
104010,400,273,1162000,Slacker Girl,Downtown Springfield,Kent! Your righteous political commentary rocks!
104011,400,274,1166000,Slacker Dude,Downtown Springfield,Yeah! You know how many stars out of five I gave the YouTube of your webcast? Five! And I never give five!
104012,400,275,1173000,Slacker Girl,Downtown Springfield,"It's true, he never does."
104013,400,276,1175000,Lisa Simpson,Downtown Springfield,"Mr. Brockman, you're a huge hit!"
104014,400,277,1177000,Kent Brockman,Downtown Springfield,Really? How wide is the web?
104015,400,278,1179000,Lisa Simpson,Downtown Springfield,World.
104016,400,279,1179000,Kent Brockman,Downtown Springfield,Wow.
104017,400,280,1182000,Lindsay Naegle,Downtown Springfield,"Kent, we want to offer you your old job back, with a fifty per cent pay increase!"
104018,400,281,1187000,Kent Brockman,Downtown Springfield,Hmm...
104019,400,282,1191000,Kent Brockman,Downtown Springfield,"Lisa, close your eyes for two seconds."
104020,400,283,1193000,Lisa Simpson,Downtown Springfield,One... two...
104021,400,284,1196000,Kent Brockman,Downtown Springfield,I held out as long as I could!
104022,400,285,1201000,Lisa Simpson,Downtown Springfield,I guess there's just no place for truth and bravery in today's media.
104023,400,286,1206000,Homer Simpson,Downtown Springfield,True -- but there's room for the truth in this household. Do you wanna hear something really bad Kent told me about the Fox network?
104024,400,287,1214000,Lisa Simpson,Downtown Springfield,"Of course. Gosh, Dad, your hands are shaking!"
104025,400,288,1217000,Homer Simpson,Downtown Springfield,"I know, 'cause this one's really, really bad. For years now, Fox has been--"
104026,400,289,1226000,Clearly Dubbed-in Voice,Downtown Springfield,...programming shows that the whole family can enjoy!
104027,400,290,1229000,Lisa Simpson,Downtown Springfield,Oh my God! You don't suppose they're gonna start--
104028,400,291,1232000,Clearly Dubbed-in Voice,Downtown Springfield,"...entertaining America with hits like ""House,"" ""American Idol"" and ""American Idol Results Show."""
104029,400,292,1239000,Homer Simpson,Downtown Springfield,I'm afraid they might. But I will not be silenced. The truth is...
104030,400,293,1249000,Homer Simpson,Downtown Springfield,"Okay. What I was going to say, was..."
