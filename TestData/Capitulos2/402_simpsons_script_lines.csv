104312,402,8,153000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Oh man, that church service was so boring. I did a whole book of Find-A-Words."
104313,402,9,159000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"Dad, all you circled were the ""I's"" and ""A's""."
104314,402,10,162000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Those are words.

104323,402,19,182000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Car,"I just want a simple salad with pine nuts, haricots verts, seasonal heirloom tomatoes..."
104324,402,20,188000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Forget it! One day a week I should be able to put on nice clothes and have someone bring food to me!
104325,402,21,193000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,There's a place -- with no line!
104326,402,22,195000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Woo hoo!

104337,402,33,235000,Homer Simpson,House,"Mmmm, au jus! Not quite gravy, not quite blood..."
104338,402,34,239000,Lisa Simpson,House,Look at the crowd around that table.
104339,402,35,241000,Bart Simpson,House,It must be a make-your-own sundae bar!
104340,402,36,245000,Homer Simpson,House,"Oh, I can't wait to taste that hot fudge, and caramel, and crushed nuts, all slathered over a delicious... elderly corpse?!!!"

104351,402,47,280000,Bart Simpson,House,You're Donny? Pop-pop said that after he died you should give me ten bucks a week. Starting now.
104352,402,48,289000,Sad Boy,House,Okay.
104353,402,49,291000,Bart Simpson,House,"Um, listen, I'm outta town next week, so..."
104354,402,50,295000,Homer Simpson,House,"Come on, we're leaving! Mmm, after one more mini-quiche..."
104355,402,51,301000,Widow,House,Excuse me. My brother twisted his ankle setting up the chairs.
104356,402,52,305000,Homer Simpson,House,Will the tragedies that stalk this family never cease?
104357,402,53,312000,Widow,House,Would you like to be a pallbearer?

104364,402,61,333000,Homer Simpson,Cemetery,Stop that! I'm down here!
104366,402,63,339000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"Homer, you have a mild back sprain. And you also ingested a dangerous quantity of grave dirt."
104367,402,64,346000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,"Well, you're always telling me I should eat more dirt."
104368,402,65,349000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,Not dirt -- vegetables!
104369,402,66,351000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Which grow in what?

104371,402,68,358000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"This should take only a minute, and cost about a thousand dollars."
104373,402,70,362000,Marge Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,That doesn't sound like Homer's usual annoyed grunt.
104374,402,71,365000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,Hmm...
104376,402,73,369000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,Fascinating.
104377,402,74,369000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"When Homer is on his back, his stomach lodges perfectly under his diaphragm, giving him a powerful singing voice."
104378,402,75,376000,Bart Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,Is that a real thing?
104379,402,76,377000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,It is! Tenor Andrea Bocelli recorded an entire song on his back.
104380,402,77,382000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Springfield General Hospital,"You know, Homer, your singing could help alleviate patient suffering, and save us a fortune in Demerol."
104381,402,78,387000,Homer Simpson,Springfield General Hospital,My pleasure. IF EVER I WOULD LEAVE YOU / IT WOULDN'T BE IN SUMMER. / SEEING YOU IN SUMMER I NEVER WOULD GO...

104390,402,87,447000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield General Hospital,"Ah, nothing lifts my spirits like shopping."

104403,402,100,503000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital Hallway,"The Springfield Opera House, of which I am founder, artistic director, and standing ovation starter, is producing La Bohème. I want you to sing the lead."
104404,402,101,511000,Homer Simpson,Hospital Hallway,But I can only sing lying on my back.
104405,402,102,514000,C. Montgomery Burns,Hospital Hallway,We'll cover it with a rewrite.
104407,402,104,522000,Stage Manager,Springfield Opera House,"Places, everyone!"
104408,402,105,524000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Opera House,"Oh, oh, I just have one question: what is this movie about?"

104426,402,125,605000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Opera House,"No, no. It's a good thing."
104427,402,126,607000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Opera House,"Oh, good. This makes up for me showing up drunk to the father-daughter dance."
104428,402,127,612000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Opera House,The dance isn't till next week.
104429,402,128,614000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Opera House,"Sorry, Lisa. Can't change the future."

104437,402,136,671000,Placido Domingo,Opera House,"You know, Homer, there's one thing about opera that has always bugged me: everyone sings instead of talking. But you made me believe I was in a magical world where singing is talking."
104438,402,137,685000,Homer Simpson,Opera House,"Thanks! You know, of the three tenors, you're my second favorite! No wait, I forgot about that other guy. Sorry, you're third."

104448,402,147,734000,Homer Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,But I need my childhood friends to help me keep it real. Would you have me keep it fake?

104465,402,164,785000,Homer Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,What? That's how guys talk.
104468,402,167,790000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,"You are out of control! The late nights, the eating! You've actually outgrown your cape!"
104469,402,168,797000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Street,Homie... I miss our alone time. I miss you.

104476,402,175,818000,Carl Carlson,Limo,"Now we both know that ain't gonna happen. But uh, I'm right here."
104478,402,177,833000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Marge, when I'm onstage I can only sing those love songs by picturing your beautiful face. So in a way, my groupies are really our groupies."
104479,402,178,845000,Marge Simpson,Street,"Aw, you're sweet."
104480,402,179,847000,Shrill Voice,Street,"Oh my God, it's him!"

104490,402,188,900000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Streets,"Sir, thank you for saving us. Do you want to come in for coffee?"

104492,402,190,908000,Homer Simpson,Springfield Streets,"A lady motorcycle driver?! What is this, the Twilight Zone?"
104494,402,192,914000,Beautiful Woman,Simpson Home,It's a shame a few out of control fans can make the rest of us look bad.
104495,402,193,918000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I couldn't agree more, Julia."
104496,402,194,921000,JULIA,Simpson Home,"Listen, I love opera, but I hate the way these people treat your husband. Why don't you make me president of Homer's fan club and I'll keep the crazies in check."
104497,402,195,929000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's a great idea! To celebrate, I'll go whip us up some Chex Mix pie."

104502,402,200,954000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"What is it, sweetie?"
104503,402,201,956000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Um, everyone's wearing clothes in here."
104504,402,202,956000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's nice!
104505,402,203,956000,JULIA,Simpson Home,"Mr. Simpson will send you a photo if you send him a self-addressed envelope. Mr. Simpson cannot sing at your daughter's birthday, but he will come for cake. Dedicate your shopping center? What's the anchor store? I don't think so."
104506,402,204,956000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,She's perfect! For the first time since you became an opera star I can finally relax.
104507,402,205,956000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, I'm not sure she's workin' out."
104508,402,206,956000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's it! Let me make something very clear: my heart belongs to Marge and you can never, ever have it. This opera's over when the fat man sings."

104510,402,208,956000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"That's good. You've calmly accepted that you will never have the only man you could ever love. Now, I think it would be best if you left."
104511,402,209,956000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Julia, wait!"
104512,402,210,956000,JULIA,Simpson Home,Yes?
104513,402,211,956000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Before you go, could you hire your own replacement? But make sure she's not crazy like you."
104489,402,213,959000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Die, you stupid cobra, die!"
104515,402,214,959000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Dad, I think someone's trying to kill you!"
104516,402,215,959000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Who could it be? A disgruntled former employee? Whoever it is, the cobra is their symbol."
104519,402,218,959000,Homer Simpson,Opera House,D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH / WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO HOO / STU STU STU STU-PID FLANDERS...
104520,402,219,959000,Ned Flanders,Opera House,"Why the crescendo, my dear old friend-o?"
104521,402,220,959000,Homer Simpson,Opera House,"GET LOST, YOU WASTE OF A MOUSTACHE!"
104522,402,221,1012000,Ned Flanders,Opera House,Okily-dokily!
104523,402,222,1012000,Marge Simpson,Opera House,"Chief, I think we should cancel the performance."
104524,402,223,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Opera House,"No can do, Marge. My first duty is to the season-ticket holders. But don't worry, I've got the entire opera house on a complete lockdown."
104525,402,224,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Opera House,We've got sharp shooters on the gargoyles...
104526,402,225,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Opera House,Inflatable Homer decoys in the seats...
104527,402,226,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Opera House,"And to take out the biggest threat of all, we're pre-crashing the chandelier."
104529,402,228,1012000,Marge Simpson,Opera House,"I'm so tense, I can't enjoy Count Almaviva serenading the intended bride of Dr. Bartolo. I just can't."
104530,402,229,1012000,Lisa Simpson,Opera House,I don't see anything suspicious... except someone is loudly unwrapping their candy.
104531,402,230,1012000,Moe Szyslak,Opera House,"It ain't candy, it's a lamb chop wrapped in foil."
104532,402,231,1012000,Bart Simpson,Opera House,"Hey mom, do all conductors carry poisoned blow-darts in their pocket?"
104533,402,232,1012000,Marge Simpson,Opera House,"Well, Arthur Fiedler used to, but I'd better take a look."
104534,402,233,1012000,Marge Simpson,Opera House,Chief Wiggums! The maestro is the killer!
104535,402,234,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Opera House,"All right, I'm going in."
104536,402,235,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Opera House,Allegro! Allegro!
104537,402,236,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Opera House,I mean andante! Andante!
104538,402,237,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Opera House,"Ah, yeah."
104539,402,238,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Opera House,"Snipers, take the shot!"
104540,402,239,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Opera House,"Okay, that's a wrap, people!"
104541,402,240,1012000,Dr. Julius Hibbert,Opera House,"Luckily the sniper bullets stopped her heart from pumping the poison through her body long enough for the chandelier to squish it all out of her. With any luck, she'll be up and stalking within a week."
104542,402,241,1012000,Marge Simpson,Opera House,"I'm sorry you got hurt, but you learned an important lesson. No one comes between me and my Homie."
104543,402,242,1012000,JULIA,Opera House,"I'll get you for this, Marge! If it's the last thing I do! Oh and I scheduled the cable guy to come on Wednesday between ten and two."
104544,402,243,1012000,Marge Simpson,Opera House,Oh but Wednesday's not good for me.
104545,402,244,1012000,JULIA,Opera House,"I know, Marge. I know."
104546,402,245,1012000,Chief Wiggum,Opera House,"Let's go, Hagliacci -- or should I say, Madame Butterface! What? What? I had two."
104547,402,246,1012000,Homer Simpson,Opera House,"Well that's it, I'm retiring from the opera. It's just too popular."
104548,402,247,1012000,Homer Simpson,Opera House,And I know something much more fun I can do on my back.
104550,402,249,1012000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Singing opera made me good at painting.
104551,402,250,1012000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Is that a real thing?
104552,402,251,1012000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,No.
