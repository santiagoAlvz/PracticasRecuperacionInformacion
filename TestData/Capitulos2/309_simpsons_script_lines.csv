79278,309,120,468000,Lisa Simpson,Dude Ranch,This whole ranch is appalling. It's built on a legacy of cruelty to animals and oppression of indigenous people.
79279,309,121,474000,The Rich Texan,Dude Ranch,Just our way of making y'all feel welcome!
79280,309,122,477000,Lisa Simpson,Dude Ranch,You're not listening!

79297,309,139,548000,Luke,RANCH,"Well, if you like animals, you won't want to disappoint that pony over there. She's just achin' to show you around."
79298,309,140,557000,Lisa Simpson,RANCH,I'm sure she'd be happier without someone sitting on her back all day.
79299,309,141,561000,Luke,RANCH,"I'm sorry you're not interested. Because I need somebody to help me hang these ""No Hunting"" and ""Free Tibet"" signs."

79309,309,150,601000,Bart Simpson,PICNIC AREA,I thought you guys lived off the land. How come you're selling junk to jerks like us?
79310,309,151,606000,Native American,PICNIC AREA,"We used to live and farm in a bountiful valley. Then the river was dammed to make that lake...by our ancient enemy, the beaver."
79311,309,152,616000,Marge Simpson,PICNIC AREA,Why don't you just chase the beavers away?
79312,309,153,619000,Native American,PICNIC AREA,"Unfortunately, the beaver is also our God. In retrospect it was a poor choice."
79313,309,154,624000,Homer Simpson,PICNIC AREA,"You people are guests in our country, and the beaver have no right to treat you that way. If I get back your land, will you promise to build a casino on it?"
79314,309,155,633000,Native American,PICNIC AREA,"Sure. And when we do, your breakfast will be comped."
79315,309,156,637000,Homer Simpson,PICNIC AREA,How many decks will your blackjack dealers use?

79322,309,163,647000,Lisa Simpson,Field,Oh Luke.
79323,309,164,650000,Marge Simpson,Field,I didn't gasp like that until I was eighteen!
79325,309,166,657000,Homer Simpson,Lake,"All right, son, we just knock over this dam and the noble Native Americans can reclaim the land that is theirs."
79327,309,168,676000,Homer Simpson,Lake,No! I wanted to die choking on food!
79328,309,169,681000,Bart Simpson,Lake,I'll save you!
79329,309,170,687000,Homer Simpson,Lake,"So long, suckers!"

79333,309,174,703000,Luke,RANCH,"Lisa, this here is the New West, where we respect our equine and bovine Americans."
79334,309,175,711000,Luke,RANCH,"Uh, well maybe we should just mosey on over this way."
79335,309,176,715000,Cookie,RANCH,"Free range, my ass! Tonight you're gonna be swimming next to a matzo ball."
79336,309,177,720000,Luke,RANCH,I think maybe we should just look at the clouds. Ain't that pretty.
79337,309,178,724000,Lisa Simpson,RANCH,"Oh, it looks like a happy sheep."
79339,309,180,734000,Luke,RANCH,"Oh, dammit!"
79341,309,182,738000,Marge Simpson,NATURAL HOT SPRINGS,"Shucks, Lisa. You sure have taken a shine to that cowpoke."
79308,309,183,743000,Lisa Simpson,NATURAL HOT SPRINGS,"Mom, why are you talking like that?"
79342,309,184,745000,Marge Simpson,NATURAL HOT SPRINGS,Don't rightly know. I just soaked up the lingo like a biscuit in a bucket full of gopher gravy. I'll stop now.
79343,309,185,752000,Lisa Simpson,NATURAL HOT SPRINGS,"Well, I like it here, too. Luke has shown me the gentle side of the old west. He's really sophisticated for a thirteen-year-old."
79344,309,186,759000,Marge Simpson,NATURAL HOT SPRINGS,"Thir-what year old?!! Lisa, you're only eight."
79345,309,187,763000,Lisa Simpson,NATURAL HOT SPRINGS,"But when he's twenty-three, I'll be eighteen."
79346,309,188,766000,Marge Simpson,NATURAL HOT SPRINGS,"Lisa, you don't know what you'll want in the future. I didn't marry the first boy I... well, I did. But you shouldn't!"
79349,309,191,777000,Lisa Simpson,RANCH,Wanna play a little longer? It's only ten and the moon is awful big.
79350,309,192,785000,Luke,RANCH,"Well heck, you should see it when it's full."
79351,309,193,794000,Marge Simpson,RANCH,Oh no! They're making beautiful music together!
79352,309,194,797000,Homer Simpson,RANCH,/ Let's see move that there... do a flanking maneuver there... Wind should be coming in from the south... Time it to coincide with a beaver holiday...
79353,309,195,808000,Homer Simpson,RANCH,This map is useless! Useless!
79354,309,196,811000,Marge Simpson,RANCH,"Homie, I'm worried about how fast our kids are growing up."
79355,309,197,815000,Homer Simpson,RANCH,It's the beef hormones and the fluorescent lights. What are you gonna do?
79356,309,198,818000,Marge Simpson,RANCH,But they're already acting like teenagers. Lisa's with that boy... and look at Maggie!
79358,309,200,840000,Lisa Simpson,DINING HALL,"Look, Cookie! There's a dance tonight!"
79359,309,201,843000,Cookie,DINING HALL,A dance! A dance!
79360,309,202,850000,Cookie,DINING HALL,"Whoo, I'm pooped. I'm goin' to bed. Bed!"
79361,309,203,856000,Luke,DINING HALL,"All righty, I'll see you tonight -- and I'll save you the first dance. Love you too, Clara."
79362,309,204,863000,Lisa Simpson,DINING HALL,Clara?! He's got a girlfriend! I feel like such an idiot.
79364,309,206,873000,Bart Simpson,Lisa and Bart's Cabin,"Hey, bottom bunk's mine."
79365,309,207,879000,Cookie,Lisa and Bart's Cabin,Keep goin'.
79367,309,209,889000,Lisa Simpson,DIRT ROAD THROUGH FOREST,"I can't believe Luke has another gal. ""My name is Clara... I've known Luke for more than five days..."""
79368,309,210,893000,Girl,DIRT ROAD THROUGH FOREST,"Excuse me, is this the way to the Lazy I Ranch?"
79369,309,211,899000,Lisa Simpson,DIRT ROAD THROUGH FOREST,"Yeah, it sure is..."
79371,309,212,904000,Lisa Simpson,DIRT ROAD THROUGH FOREST,...But a quicker way to the ranch is that shortcut.
79372,309,213,907000,Clara,DIRT ROAD THROUGH FOREST,Thanks darlin'. See you at the dance.
79373,309,214,913000,Lisa Simpson,DIRT ROAD THROUGH FOREST,"I look forward to it. Ha ha ha ha, I hate you."

79425,309,266,1170000,Luke,RANCH,No. Just that she felt mighty stupid for getting herself lost in them woods.
79426,309,267,1174000,Lisa Simpson,RANCH,"Listen, Luke. It's my fault Clara got lost. I didn't know she was your sister, and I wanted you all to myself."
79427,309,268,1181000,Luke,RANCH,"You would do that just for me... That's despicable! You're the kind of city slicker my family left Central Park West to avoid. You've got a lot of chutzpah, Missy. Goodbye."
