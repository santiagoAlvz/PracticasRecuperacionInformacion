66531,265,162,664000,Lisa Simpson,WILDLIFE RESERVE,That's terrible!
66532,265,163,666000,Homer Simpson,WILDLIFE RESERVE,"Now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the balance. Whenever there are so many species that people get confused and angry, a poacher is born."
66533,265,164,676000,Lisa Simpson,WILDLIFE RESERVE,I don't care. I hate them.
66534,265,165,685000,Kitenge,WILDLIFE RESERVE,They'll be back. They left their cargo pants.

66543,265,174,718000,Marge Simpson,Masai Village,"Oh, thank you. Your ground is so comfortable."
66544,265,175,722000,Homer Simpson,Masai Village,"By the way, what kind of blood is this?"

66553,265,184,740000,Bart Simpson,Masai Village,Uh-oh-boh-boh.
66554,265,185,748000,Kitenge,Masai Village,"That's it. Get into a frenzy! Ha, ha!"
66557,265,188,760000,Marge Simpson,Masai Village,This song has been going on for hours.
66558,265,189,763000,Homer Simpson,Masai Village,"Yeah, it's like the Allman Brothers!"
66560,265,191,769000,Kitenge,Masai Village,"Homer, no!"
66562,265,193,773000,Homer Simpson,Masai Village,"A hungry, hungry hippo!"
66563,265,194,777000,Homer Simpson,Masai Village,Help! Kitenge!
66564,265,195,781000,Kitenge,Masai Village,"Now, Simpsons! Run for it!"
66565,265,196,790000,Homer Simpson,Masai Village,Good ol' Kitenge.
66566,265,198,802000,Homer Simpson,Masai Village,Quick! Into the river! Hippos hate water.
66567,265,199,805000,Lisa Simpson,Masai Village,No they don't. They--

66572,265,204,834000,Homer Simpson,River,It's working!
66573,265,205,835000,Homer Simpson,River,Leeches!
66577,265,209,855000,Homer Simpson,River,"Okay, here's the situation: We're hopelessly lost and about to die."
66579,265,211,863000,Homer Simpson,River,Don't worry. Being eaten by a crocodile is just like going to sleep... in a giant blender.
66580,265,212,870000,Marge Simpson,River,Wonder where this river goes.
66581,265,213,872000,Homer Simpson,River,I've got a map!
66582,265,214,874000,Homer Simpson,River,"Monkey. Now, according to Animal Crackers, there's no river here."
66583,265,215,879000,Marge Simpson,River,"Stay in the boat, Homer."
66584,265,216,887000,Marge Simpson,River,Look!
66588,265,220,900000,Marge Simpson,River,Let's just float by quietly...
66591,265,223,912000,Homer Simpson,River,"So, you think they settled that bag boy strike yet?"
66592,265,224,917000,Lisa Simpson,River,"Oh, no! We're headed for Victoria Falls!"
66593,265,225,921000,Homer Simpson,River,Here's why they shouldn't get anything. One...
66596,265,228,931000,Homer Simpson,River,This flower saved our lives.
66597,265,229,936000,Marge Simpson,River,"Oh, no! It's eating us!"
66598,265,230,939000,Homer Simpson,River,Not a chance.
66599,265,231,943000,Bart Simpson,River,"Wow, Dad. How did you do that?"
66600,265,232,944000,Homer Simpson,River,It's a flower.
66602,265,234,948000,Lisa Simpson,JUNGLE,Are we insane yet? Are we insane yet? Are we insane yet?
66603,265,235,952000,Homer Simpson,JUNGLE,"I told you, yes. Now Bart, go to the top of that hill and see if you can spot our hotel."
66604,265,236,958000,Bart Simpson,JUNGLE,Mount Kilimanjaro?
66605,265,237,960000,Homer Simpson,JUNGLE,Go.
66606,265,238,961000,Bart Simpson,JUNGLE,Okay.

66610,265,243,967000,Bart Simpson,JUNGLE,"Hey, maybe it'll lead us to bananas."
66611,265,244,970000,Homer Simpson,JUNGLE,Or... more mouthwatering monkeys.
66612,265,245,972000,Homer Simpson,JUNGLE,Overtime for bag boys? Ridiculous!
66614,265,247,983000,Lisa Simpson,JUNGLE COMPOUND,This is the place I've read about! Where Dr. Bushwell lives among the chimps!
66615,265,248,987000,Marge Simpson,JUNGLE COMPOUND,"Oh, isn't that sweet? He named it after his wife."
66616,265,249,991000,Lisa Simpson,JUNGLE COMPOUND,"No, Dr. Bushwell is a woman."
