128927,497,1,117000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Springfield County Court House,"Lisa Simpson, your actions have brought devastation upon this town! And all because of your selfish desire to be accepted by others!"
128929,497,3,127000,Homer Simpson,Springfield County Court House,Leave her alone! That's my only talking daughter!
128930,497,4,133000,Bart Simpson,Springfield County Court House,Lethal inject her on the electric chair!
128931,497,5,135000,Marge Simpson,Springfield County Court House,"Bart, it's okay to say that at home, but not in court! Take it back!"
128932,497,6,140000,Bart Simpson,Springfield County Court House,Withdrawn.
128933,497,7,141000,Marge Simpson,Springfield County Court House,"Now, Lisa tell your side of the story. And use your big voice."
128934,497,8,146000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield County Court House,"Well, it all started a couple of months ago..."
128935,497,9,148000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Springfield County Court House,"Your honor, I'd like to request that everyone in the court picture in their minds what the witness is describing."
128936,497,10,154000,Judge Snyder,Springfield County Court House,I'll allow it. But no flights of fancy!
128937,497,11,156000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield County Court House,"Like all too many stories about my family, it began with somebody watching television."
128939,497,13,162000,Senator Mendoza,Abandoned Warehouse,"Well, McBain. You certainly picked a bad time to come out of retirement. I hope you have a... Cobra plan."
148010,497,14,170000,McBain,Abandoned Warehouse,You are suffering from a reptile dysfunction.
128940,497,15,175000,Homer Simpson,Abandoned Warehouse,Down in front!
128941,497,16,177000,Homer Simpson,Abandoned Warehouse,Dammit! Why do kids have heads?
128942,497,17,180000,Marge Simpson,Abandoned Warehouse,Homie! Stop watching the movie in the other people's car!
128943,497,18,183000,Homer Simpson,Abandoned Warehouse,But I'm invested in the characters.
128944,497,19,187000,Marge Simpson,Abandoned Warehouse,You'll miss the turnoff to the fancy new mall!
128945,497,20,189000,Homer Simpson,Abandoned Warehouse,I make my own turnoffs.
128946,497,21,194000,Homer Simpson,Abandoned Warehouse,"And that, kids, is how you stick it to the Towne Centre Real Estate Investment Trust. No, no, no. Woo hoo!"
128947,497,22,203000,Marge Simpson,Abandoned Warehouse,Someone thinks we're leaving. I'll wave them off.
128948,497,23,207000,Homer Simpson,Abandoned Warehouse,"No, no, no, no, let's see how long we can keep 'em waiting. Everyone act like we're buckling up to go home."
128949,497,24,212000,Marge Simpson,Abandoned Warehouse,Homie...
128950,497,25,213000,Homer Simpson,Abandoned Warehouse,"Marge, if you were married to Da Vinci, you wouldn't tell him not to Da Vinch."
128951,497,26,236000,Other Car's Driver,Abandoned Warehouse,"Dammit, are you leaving or not?"
128952,497,27,238000,Homer Simpson,Abandoned Warehouse,Leaving? Why on earth would you think that?
128957,497,32,245000,Bart Simpson,GARAGE,We totally wasted his time.
128958,497,33,248000,Homer Simpson,GARAGE,And ours!
128960,497,35,254000,Homer Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,"This place is so great. When the trolley hits you, it doesn't even hurt."
128961,497,36,264000,Homer Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,"You try it, Maggie!"
128963,497,38,268000,Marge Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,"Ooo, condos!"
128964,497,39,272000,Marge Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,"Lenny, do you live here?"
128965,497,40,274000,Lenny Leonard,PARKING STRUCTURE,"Yeah, I just moved in!"
128966,497,41,275000,Lenny Leonard,PARKING STRUCTURE,"I have a Drippin' Dots for breakfast every morning, at lunch I get a massage in front of strangers, and then I spend the afternoon browsing cell-phone skins."
128967,497,42,282000,Bart Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,Ever get tired of those dancing waters?
128968,497,43,289000,Lenny Leonard,PARKING STRUCTURE,The day I moved in! So what are we all gonna do together?
128969,497,44,292000,Marge Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,"Actually, we just came to do some shopping... as a family."
128970,497,45,297000,Lenny Leonard,PARKING STRUCTURE,Oh. No worries. Mr. Mall can make his own excitement.
128971,497,46,302000,Lenny Leonard,PARKING STRUCTURE,"Give me one doll from every time period, and set me up for a tea party in a private room!"
128972,497,47,307000,Salesperson,PARKING STRUCTURE,"Lenny, you asked me to stop you from coming back in here. Let me help you."
128973,497,48,311000,Lenny Leonard,PARKING STRUCTURE,"You can help me by giving me Ellis Island Emily! Hi, dear. I'm your Uncle Lenny. I'm gonna buy you an all new wardrobe, fix your teeth, send you to the best schools, and you're gonna hate and resent me for it... 'cause you're an American now."
128974,497,49,327000,Marge Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,I was hanging onto these gift cards as investments... but then half the companies went out of business. Better sort those out.
128975,497,50,356000,Homer Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,Do-over!
128976,497,51,358000,Homer Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,Woo hoo!
128977,497,52,362000,Homer Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,Unspool it into my mouth till that card is at zero.
128978,497,53,367000,Homer Simpson,PARKING STRUCTURE,Draw the curtain.
128980,497,56,378000,Homer Simpson,Lotion Store,"Sir, as a complexion scientist, I must advise you against using any more. This is the most powerful hydrator we sell."
128981,497,57,385000,Homer Simpson,Lotion Store,"Less blathering, more slathering."
128982,497,58,394000,Otto Mann,Lotion Store,"Yo, Bart dude. Can I get a ride to the food court?"
128983,497,59,397000,Bart Simpson,Lotion Store,Hop on!
128985,497,61,409000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Hm, I kinda want to create my own thing. Do you sell any just plain sets?"
128986,497,62,415000,Saleslady,Springfield Mall,"No, we do all the imagining for you."
128987,497,63,417000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Well, I'll just buy one of these and build something different."
128988,497,64,420000,Saleslady,Springfield Mall,You do and you'd better build yourself a lawyer.
128989,497,65,422000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Springfield Mall,"Miss Simpson, does the court really need to hear..."
128991,497,67,422000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,...everything that happened in every store your family visited?
128992,497,68,430000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,"Trust me, I've left a lot out, and cleaned up the swears. Anyway, I ran into some schoolmates and thought they might be friendly. That's what kids do, right? Hang out at the mall together. But when I went over..."
128994,497,70,442000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,"Hi, guys, what are you doing?"
128995,497,71,444000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Mall,"Duh, having feathers woven into our hair."
148725,497,72,447000,Lisa's Thoughts,Springfield Mall,Those girls are snotty and shallow. Tell them off!
128996,497,73,451000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,Can I join you?
148726,497,74,455000,Lisa's Thoughts,Springfield Mall,You'd better hope they say yes!
128997,497,75,455000,Terri Mackleberry,Springfield Mall,"Lisa, how can we put this..."
128998,497,76,458000,Sherri Mackleberry,Springfield Mall,...you're the reason no one wears silly bandz anymore.
128999,497,77,461000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,They-they don't?
129000,497,78,466000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Mall,What the--
129003,497,81,470000,Marge Simpson,CINNABUN STORE,Enough!
129005,497,83,475000,Homer Simpson,Mapple Store,I don't trust this place. Where are the cashiers?
129010,497,88,483000,Salesman,Mapple Store,"Yep, the lightest, most desirable computer in the world for the next three weeks: the Mapple Void."
129012,497,89,492000,Homer Simpson,Mapple Store,I'll take it! Provided you charge me for services that Google offers for free.
129013,497,90,499000,Salesman,Mapple Store,I already have.
129014,497,91,500000,Homer Simpson,Mapple Store,Sweet!
129016,497,93,502000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"This computer is so great! I'm watching the latest Sofia Coppola movie at ""twenty times"" speed to make it seem like a normal movie."
129017,497,94,510000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"I think it just froze. Oh no. No, that bird just moved."
129018,497,95,515000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh oh, a draggy backpack."
129019,497,96,518000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I have no friends.
129020,497,97,520000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Aw, sweetie. Hey, why don't you make friends with my new computer?"
129021,497,98,525000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Okay.
129022,497,99,525000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Let me just download the complete works of Shakespeare.
129023,497,100,534000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Now who's the greatest writer of all time?
129024,497,101,541000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'd have more friends if I knew what people liked. But I won't know what people like unless I'm their friend. It's a conundrum.
129025,497,102,547000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Helpful hint: if you want friends, don't use words like ""conundrum."""
129026,497,103,552000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Jimbo heard me say it. I'm dead.
129027,497,104,563000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hm...
129028,497,105,571000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,It's easier to be friends with lots of people online than one person in person. What if I started an online meeting place where all are equal and I am the undisputed center?
129029,497,106,585000,Jimbo Jones,Simpson Home,How's this for a conundrum?
129030,497,107,588000,Martin Prince,Simpson Home,It's not really a conundrum. Sit at my feet and I will elaborate.
129032,497,109,598000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"So to summarize, your honor, Lisa Simpson created this ""social network"" because she had no friends."
129033,497,110,606000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,"No, that is not true! I--"
129034,497,111,608000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,May I remind you you're under oath?!
129035,497,112,610000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,All right already! I had no friends.
129036,497,113,613000,Cletus Spuckler,Courtroom,"With an attitude like that, I wouldn't be her friend."
129037,497,114,616000,Brandine Del Roy,Courtroom,Life is too dang short.
129038,497,115,619000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,"So, since I had no friends, I assembled a motley crew of the friendless to help me construct my social network. Did we become friends? No."
129041,497,118,633000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"As the CEO of SpringFace, I want you all to have fun as you write source code until you fall asleep at your consoles."
129043,497,120,640000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Here's my favorite computer game: Angry Nerds!
129046,497,123,647000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"Nelson, is there any way I could be your friend?"
129047,497,124,652000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,"The only way I would be your friend is if I could click a box under your picture saying ""Accept friendship request from."""
129048,497,125,652000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Nelson, you've just given us the template for our site!"
129049,497,126,663000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,I don't care.
129050,497,127,671000,Martin Prince,Springfield Elementary School,"If we don't move, his odds of getting us both are three hundred and seventy-four to one."
129051,497,128,679000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Bye.
129053,497,130,684000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"Now, to skip ahead, your diabolical plan was an instant success."
129054,497,131,689000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,I never said it was diabolical!
129055,497,132,691000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,Withdrawn.
129056,497,133,694000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,This social network quickly unified the disparate children of Springfield Unified.
129058,497,135,700000,Jimbo Jones,Springfield Elementary School,I just got invited to make out with Shauna! See?
129059,497,136,704000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,That went out to two hundred guys.
129061,497,138,708000,DOLPH,Springfield Elementary School,And seven girls.
129063,497,140,711000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Santa's Little Helper's friends with Snowball Two? Now I've seen everything!
129064,497,141,716000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,All my friends have birthdays this year!
129065,497,142,722000,Bart Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I just un-friended Skinner!
129066,497,143,722000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,Doggone it. I'm less popular than the hornet's nest in the gym.
129067,497,144,729000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,You said you were getting rid of that nest.
129068,497,145,731000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,We trade the honey for chalk and yardsticks.
129069,497,146,733000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Hornets make honey?
129070,497,147,734000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"Better than wasp honey, not as good as bee."
129071,497,148,737000,Gary Chalmers,Springfield Elementary School,Is this how you talk on dates?
129011,497,149,738000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,I wish my dates were this interesting.
129073,497,151,742000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hit refresh.
129074,497,152,743000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,Hit refresh.
129075,497,153,744000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,I have a thousand friends! And only eight of them are Milhouse.
129076,497,154,748000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,A thousand kids?! If you could get each of them to send you a dollar you'd be a millionaire!
129077,497,155,753000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, it's not just kids using SpringFace -- it's moms like me. Marge!"
129078,497,156,758000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wait a minute, grownups are on this?"
129079,497,157,760000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, look!"
129081,497,159,769000,Patty Bouvier,Simpson Kitchen,"We've gotta thank you, kiddo."
129082,497,160,771000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Kitchen,We've gotten so much more action since we signed up and used this picture of ourselves.
129083,497,161,776000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,That's not you.
129084,497,162,776000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Kitchen,You can see our reflection in the sunglasses.
129086,497,164,783000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,"Wow, I've created something incredibly popular!"
129087,497,165,786000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,And I've created something that created something incredibly popular!
129088,497,166,790000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,And I created an alcoholic hippo!
129089,497,167,792000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,You never showed it to me.
129090,497,168,794000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,A stupid alcoholic hippo!
129091,497,169,796000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I still wanna see it.
129092,497,170,797000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,There is no hippo!
129093,497,171,798000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Then why did you say it?
129094,497,172,800000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,'Cause you're the hippo!
129095,497,173,801000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,Are you just saying that 'cause you don't want me to see the hippo?
129096,497,174,804000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Kitchen,I don't have a hippo!
129098,497,176,810000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"And so this so-called ""SpringFace"" spread from the world of children to adults..."
129100,497,178,815000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Man, this website makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer."
129101,497,179,820000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I am sitting here... zero sheets to the wind...
129102,497,180,827000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"...counting the moments to closing time when I can stumble home to you. Another round, Moe. Uh-oh. Did I type that? Delete! Delete! Hm, typing ""delete"" does not delete."
129106,497,183,840000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,It is gratifying to see all of you bowing in prayer...the light of God shining on your faces...
129107,497,184,848000,Lenny Leonard,First Church of Springfield,"Uh-oh. Bernice Hibbert keeps ""liking"" Bumblebee Man's posts. That's how it starts."
129108,497,185,855000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Why did I make this church a Wi-Fi hotspot? If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."
129109,497,186,861000,Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,First Church of Springfield,"Let's see, which Muppet am I? Beaker?! I guess that's fair."
129111,497,188,867000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Friend, friend, awaiting reply, friend..."
129112,497,189,871000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,Sherri? Terri? Hopscotch? Double Dutch? Ringolivio? Anyone?
129113,497,190,881000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"I have a thousand friends, and I feel more alone than ever!"
129114,497,191,885000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Whee!
129115,497,192,886000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I'm trying to set a mood here.
129116,497,193,888000,Ralph Wiggum,Springfield Elementary School,Whee.
129118,497,195,890000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"So, to sum up, Lisa's social network turned into the biggest internet failure since... well, there've been so many. ""Ask Jeeves,"" anyone?"
129122,497,199,920000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"And so SpringFace became too big to control... just like the sixty-foot baby in my self-published novel, ""The Sixty-Foot Baby."""
129123,497,200,929000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"Order it online now, while you can still cheat the government on sales tax."
129124,497,201,932000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,"As I was saying, SpringFace was used in ways I never expected."
129126,497,203,943000,Milhouse Van Houten,Computer Lab,"Thanks for SpringFacing me your head cleaver, Bart."
129127,497,204,952000,Bart Simpson,Computer Lab,"Check this out. I'm hiding a bomb in this pile of corpses, so when Kearney loots their ammo, he gets a face full of ass shrapnel."
129128,497,205,960000,Kearney Zzyzwicz,Computer Lab,"Damn, I got ass-shrapped!"
129130,497,207,967000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,What the! That idiot cut me off!
129131,497,208,970000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"I'm gonna run his plates, find out who he is, then change his SpringFace profile picture to a shot of a monkey. Get that, Marge? A monkey!"
129132,497,209,979000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,Homer! Watch the road!
129134,497,210,979000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,Right. Status update: Homer... is... watching... the...
129135,497,211,993000,Hans Moleman,Simpson Car,Dislike! Dislike!
129136,497,212,1006000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Car,Somebody call 911!
129137,497,213,1008000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Car,I don't know how to use the phone on my phone!
129138,497,214,1012000,Fireman #1,Simpson Car,"Hey, did you guys get my picture of the fire?"
129139,497,215,1014000,Fireman #2,Simpson Car,"Yeah, I did. Nice grab."
129140,497,216,1015000,Fireman #3,Simpson Car,I didn't get it yet.
129141,497,217,1016000,Fireman #2,Simpson Car,Funny how that works.
129143,497,219,1018000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,"Lisa Simpson, can you give us any reason why the city should not force you to shut down your site?"
129144,497,220,1024000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,"I know it's awful and insular, and caused thirty-five deaths, but I had friends! Four digits of friends! I had a friend in common with Malcolm Gladwell!"
129145,497,221,1036000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,Courtroom,He friends everybody.
129146,497,222,1038000,Lisa Simpson,Courtroom,Fine. I'll shut down the site.
129149,497,225,1049000,Comic Book Guy,The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop,Time to get a life.
