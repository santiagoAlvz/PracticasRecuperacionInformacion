104144,401,114,535000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,What's the point of putting my socks on? I just have to take them off again a week later.

104169,401,139,650000,Colby,Barney's,"I want you to wear those bowling shoes out the door and everywhere you go. It's crazy, but it just might work."

104254,401,223,1007000,Homer Simpson,Shelbyville Airport,"Okay, so this should be enough money to get me up in the air, have a frank talk with Marge then maybe eat a devilled egg."
104255,401,224,1014000,Pilot,Shelbyville Airport,"Well, anything for a fellow marine."
104256,401,225,1016000,Homer Simpson,Shelbyville Airport,"Yeah, uh... semper fudge!"
104257,401,226,1018000,Pilot,Shelbyville Airport,"Uh, did you just say ""semper fudge""?"
104258,401,227,1020000,Homer Simpson,Shelbyville Airport,"No, I said the right thing."
104260,401,229,1022000,Marge Simpson,Burns's Plane,"Look at this business center -- fax, Wi-Fi, teleconferencing capabilities... I'm gonna remember this day for the rest of my life!"
104261,401,230,1032000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Plane,Honey... don't try to remember the whole day. Just what you're feeling this second.
104262,401,231,1039000,Marge Simpson,Burns's Plane,"Sweetheart, what do you mean?"
104263,401,232,1041000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Plane,Marge... I've gotta be honest...
104264,401,233,1044000,Marge Simpson,Burns's Plane,What was that?
104265,401,234,1045000,Homer Simpson,Burns's Plane,I don't know. Maybe we flew through a rainbow.
104267,401,236,1052000,Pilot,Cockpit,I didn't think I would be flying today so I was doing heroin.
104268,401,237,1059000,Marge Simpson,Cockpit,"Homie, what are you doing? You don't know how to fly!"
104269,401,238,1062000,Homer Simpson,Cockpit,I drove a car over a cliff once. How different could it be?
104270,401,239,1065000,Homer Simpson,Cockpit,"Hm, what's the ocean doing in the sky?"
104272,401,241,1073000,Marge Simpson,Cockpit,There's only one man who could help us now.
104273,401,242,1076000,Colby,Cockpit,"Hello, and welcome to success."
104274,401,243,1078000,Marge Simpson,Cockpit,It's Marge Simpson. I need you to coach like you've never coached before.
104275,401,244,1082000,Colby,Cockpit,"Marge please, I'm with a client."
104276,401,245,1086000,Marge Simpson,Cockpit,"Now you listen here, Bub. We paid you all the savings we had in the world. You could at least tell my husband something encouraging."
104277,401,246,1094000,Colby,Cockpit,"All right, Homer. What is it you're attempting to do? Win over a difficult client?"
104278,401,247,1098000,Homer Simpson,Cockpit,I'm trying to land a plane with no experience.
104279,401,248,1100000,Colby,Cockpit,"Homer, I've gotta tell you, I'm not very good. I went to the Harvard of the South."
104280,401,249,1105000,Homer Simpson,Cockpit,Duke? That's good.
104281,401,250,1106000,Colby,Cockpit,Not Duke.
104282,401,251,1106000,Homer Simpson,Cockpit,Vanderbilt?
104283,401,252,1108000,Colby,Cockpit,A little further south. Don't make me say it.
104285,401,254,1115000,Duffman,Cockpit,Duffman has reported you to the F.A.A. This near-miss will be investigated by a board of three retired pilots.
104286,401,255,1123000,Colby,Cockpit,"Okay, Homer. I don't know anything about planes, but I know about you. You have what made America great: no understanding of the limits of your power, and a complete lack of concern for what anyone thinks of you. So you'll land that plane. And do you know why? Because I heard some guy say you couldn't."
104287,401,256,1142000,Homer Simpson,Cockpit,What? I'll show him. I'll show that guy!
104289,401,258,1150000,Plane Computer,Plane,Elevation three hundred feet... two hundred feet... fifty--
104292,401,261,1158000,Marge Simpson,Airport,"Homer, you did it! You landed a jet!"
104293,401,262,1161000,Homer Simpson,Airport,"And now, to taxi to the terminal."
104296,401,264,1174000,Homer Simpson,Airport,"Marge, flying in private jets is great and all, but it's just too dangerous. That's why I've decided to go to the plant and beg Mr. Burns for my old job back."
104297,401,265,1184000,Marge Simpson,Airport,"I understand, Homie."
104298,401,266,1186000,Lisa Simpson,Airport,And at least we can take the extra income you've earned in the last few months and set it aside for a rainy day.
104299,401,267,1192000,Homer Simpson,Airport,"You'd think so, but no."
104300,401,268,1195000,Pilot,Airport,"Mr. Richie, your American Music Awards are weighing us down! Let them go!"
104301,401,269,1200000,Lionel Richie,Airport,You let yours go!
104302,401,270,1201000,Pilot,Airport,I don't have any.
104303,401,271,1202000,Lionel Richie,Airport,"That's right, you don't!"
