68807,272,214,812000,Moe Szyslak,M,"Eh, you'd be having a great time if you'd stayed in your dark spot."
68808,272,215,815000,Homer Simpson,M,"Oh, so you're ashamed of us. Well, you've turned into a big phony."
68809,272,216,819000,Moe Szyslak,M,"Hey, nobody calls Moe St. Cool a phony."
68810,272,217,823000,Model #1,M,All of this yelling is taking away my horny.
68811,272,218,826000,Moe Szyslak,M,"Is it? Oh, well that's it. That's-- Dagmar, Julian, throw this bum out."
68812,272,219,832000,Homer Simpson,M,"I'll throw myself out, thank you."

68817,272,224,852000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,I think it's pretty obvious. I'm turning our garage into a tavern. The kind Moe's used to be.
68818,272,225,859000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Garage,This is pretty far to go just to spite Moe.
68819,272,226,862000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,It's not about spite. It's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor Moe. Now help me nail up this urinal.
68820,272,227,874000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Beautiful.
68821,272,228,876000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Garage,Running a bar is a full-time job and you don't even do your full-time job.
68822,272,229,881000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"But when I'm passionate about something, I see it through to the end."
68823,272,230,886000,Sad Robot,Simpson Garage,"Father, give me legs."
68824,272,231,894000,Sad Robot,Simpson Garage,Father.

68827,272,234,911000,Moe Szyslak,M,"So what you talkin' 'bout? Uh, somethin' interesting?"
68828,272,235,913000,Male Bargoer,M,I was just comparing Kurasawa's films to Herzog's.
68829,272,236,917000,Moe Szyslak,M,Uh-huh. Carry on.
68830,272,237,920000,Customer #1,M,My diet lets me eat anything I want for one minute a day.
68831,272,238,923000,Customer #2,M,"My youth consultant gives me Botox injections in my head, neck and navel."

68837,272,244,946000,Male Bargoer,M,"Unless you're being ironic, turn that off now!"
68839,272,246,952000,Moe Szyslak,M,I'm glad you ain't around to see what a mess I made.
68840,272,247,955000,Prof. Huntington,M,"Oh, but I am."
68841,272,248,958000,Moe Szyslak,M,Whaaa?
68842,272,249,960000,Prof. Huntington,M,You've discarded your loyal regulars for a mob of soulless snobs.
68843,272,250,964000,Moe Szyslak,M,"Well, at least the tips are good."
68844,272,251,966000,Prof. Huntington,M,"Are they, Moe? Take a look."
68847,272,254,974000,Moe Szyslak,M,"Hey, why ya mockin' me? We're friends."

68856,272,262,991000,Marge Simpson,Homer's Garage,I thought this was gonna be your bar.
68857,272,263,993000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Garage,"It's the family bar. Right, kids?"
68858,272,264,995000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Garage,Can we go to bed now?
68859,272,265,997000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Garage,As soon as you finish cutting up those lemons.
68860,272,266,1000000,Lisa Simpson,Homer's Garage,But you're not even using them.
68861,272,267,1002000,Homer Simpson,Homer's Garage,"She's so sleepy, she doesn't know what she's saying. Hee, hee."

68871,272,277,1048000,Lenny Leonard,Simpson Garage,How'd you get REM to play in your garage?
68872,272,278,1051000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,I told them it was a benefit. They think they're saving the rainforest.
68873,272,279,1058000,Carl Carlson,Simpson Garage,Suckers...
68875,272,281,1065000,Peter Buck,Simpson Garage,"Michael, are you sure these guys are millionaires?"
68876,272,282,1067000,Michael Stipe,Simpson Garage,"C'mon, would a poor person have a bar in his garage?"
68877,272,283,1069000,Mike Mills,Simpson Garage,"Hey, guys..."
68878,272,284,1070000,Mike Mills,Simpson Garage,Stand around me. I can't go with Lenny watching.

68880,272,286,1075000,Mike Mills,Simpson Garage,"Oh, forget it."
68881,272,287,1078000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Garage,What the-- You can't open your own bar!
68882,272,288,1081000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Seems to me I already did.
68883,272,289,1082000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Garage,But it's illegal! You can't run a bar in a private residence.
68884,272,290,1086000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Bar? I see no bar. This is a hunting club...Which is permitted by state law ""to serve beverages of a refreshing nature."""
68885,272,291,1091000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Garage,Hunting club?!
68886,272,292,1098000,Michael Stipe,Simpson Garage,You lied to us!

68889,272,295,1101000,Peter Buck,Simpson Garage,That's not the REM way.
68891,272,296,1103000,Michael Stipe,Simpson Garage,You're right. Let's recycle those shards and get out of here.
68892,272,297,1114000,Moe Szyslak,Simpson Garage,"Ah, here we go. It also says, ""a licensed hunting club must actively engage in the sport of hunting."""
68893,272,298,1115000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Which I'll be doing tomorrow morning, smart guy."
68894,272,299,1123000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Garage,"Hunting? Dad, no!"
68895,272,300,1125000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Garage,Lemons...
68898,272,303,1130000,Lisa Simpson,Woods,"It's not fair, Dad. Why should an animal die just because you and Moe are fighting?"
68899,272,304,1135000,Homer Simpson,Woods,It's the law. My hands are tied.
68900,272,305,1137000,Homer Simpson,Woods,"Okay, cranberry sauce, stuffing, potatoes. Come on, turkey. Join your friends."
68901,272,306,1143000,Lisa Simpson,Woods,Do you really think the turkey's just gonna climb onto the plate?
68902,272,307,1146000,Homer Simpson,Woods,I would.
68904,272,309,1148000,Moe Szyslak,WIDE SHOT OF WOODS,Psst. Lisa.
68905,272,310,1151000,Lisa Simpson,WIDE SHOT OF WOODS,Moe?
68906,272,311,1152000,Moe Szyslak,WIDE SHOT OF WOODS,"Listen, I don't like you and you don't like me. But we both want to stop Homer from shootin' a turkey."
68907,272,312,1157000,Lisa Simpson,WIDE SHOT OF WOODS,You don't like me? I like you.
68908,272,313,1159000,Moe Szyslak,WIDE SHOT OF WOODS,"You do? Then I like you, too. Here, have a towelette."
68909,272,314,1163000,Homer Simpson,WIDE SHOT OF WOODS,"Here, turkey, turkey... Turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey..."
68910,272,315,1168000,Homer Simpson,WIDE SHOT OF WOODS,Nobody's gonna kill you.
68911,272,316,1170000,Moe Szyslak,WIDE SHOT OF WOODS,"All right, from now on, no talkin'. If you want to signal me, use this bird call:"
68912,272,317,1176000,Moe Szyslak,WIDE SHOT OF WOODS,Oh! Oh! Not the face!
68913,272,318,1179000,Moe Szyslak,WIDE SHOT OF WOODS,"Ooh! Ooh! Okay, the face!"
68914,272,319,1183000,Moe Szyslak,WIDE SHOT OF WOODS,"Oh, that actually feels good after the... after the crotch."
68916,272,321,1187000,Homer Simpson,Forest,"All right turkey. Where are you? Turkeys, the only animal smarter than man."
68917,272,322,1195000,Homer Simpson,Forest,What the hell is that?
68919,272,324,1197000,Homer Simpson,Forest,A turkey!
68920,272,325,1199000,Lisa Simpson,Forest,Dad's gonna slaughter that poor turkey!
68921,272,326,1202000,Moe Szyslak,Forest,Not if I scare it away with this cougar call.
68922,272,327,1208000,Lisa Simpson,Forest,"You did it, Moe!"
68923,272,328,1212000,Homer Simpson,Forest,"A cougar! Die, cougar!"
68924,272,329,1216000,Moe Szyslak,Forest,"My leg! Aww, geez!"
68925,272,330,1218000,Homer Simpson,Forest,Got that cat right in the leg.
68926,272,331,1220000,Lisa Simpson,Forest,"Dad, you shot Moe!"
68927,272,332,1222000,Homer Simpson,Forest,"Oh, no! This time I really am gonna faint!"
68928,272,333,1228000,Homer Simpson,Forest,Son of a...
68930,272,335,1230000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"How'd they get your bar back to normal so quickly, Moe?"
68931,272,336,1232000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,It's a snap when you use Certified Contractors.
68932,272,337,1235000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,Like the ones found in your local Yellow Pages.
68933,272,338,1237000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,Exactly.
68934,272,339,1240000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I'm sorry I shot you, Moe."
68935,272,340,1242000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, that's okay. It's like my Dad always said, ""Eventually everybody gets shot."""
68936,272,341,1244000,Marge Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Aw, I'm glad you two are friends again so we can all have Thanksgiving dinner together in this bar."
68937,272,342,1255000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Hey, who invited the hippies?"
68938,272,343,1257000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"I did. You owe REM an apology for, eco-fraud."
68939,272,344,1261000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"All right, I'm sorry... but I will not save the rainforest."
68940,272,345,1266000,Peter Buck,Moe's Tavern,Good enough. Let's eat.
68941,272,346,1268000,Lisa Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"And we should all be thankful to Michael, Peter and Mike for supplying this beautiful turkey, made entirely of tofu."
68942,272,347,1276000,Mike Mills,Moe's Tavern,Tofu and gluten!
68943,272,348,1278000,Bart Simpson,Moe's Tavern,I'm thankful I ate before I came.
68944,272,349,1280000,Michael Stipe,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, come on, Bart. Smell those curds! Mmmmm, curds."
68945,272,350,1287000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"And I'm thankful I get to spend Thanksgiving with my family, these alternative rockers, and my favorite bartender."
68946,272,351,1295000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Ah, here you go, pal."
68947,272,352,1296000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,And here you go.
