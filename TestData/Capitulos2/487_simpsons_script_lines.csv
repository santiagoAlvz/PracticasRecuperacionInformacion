126333,487,51,219000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, a guy at work seems not to like me. I guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay."
126334,487,52,228000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"It's big to you. Would you like a ""get well"" pork chop?"

126368,487,85,360000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,"Well, we all know what we're doing. The question is, is it an appropriate reaction to the situation?"

126370,487,87,371000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,My fresco! That's coming out of your stealings!
126371,487,88,379000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,That's comin' out of your stealings!
126372,487,89,379000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking, but I think you're awesome."
126373,487,90,385000,Wayne,Moe's Tavern,I'm just a guy who saw what needed to be done and did it.
126374,487,91,389000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Oh, speakin' of which, let's get these eggs back in a jar."
126376,487,93,406000,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern,"Wow, that's the farthest that one of my eggs ever made it down someone's throat!"
126378,487,95,414000,Wayne,Simpson Home,It's great to have a home-cooked meal.
126379,487,96,416000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, if anyone saves my Homie's life, they get a free meal. Which actually comes up about once a week."
126380,487,97,423000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"So Wayne, how'd you learn all those cool self-defense moves?"
126381,487,98,427000,Wayne,Simpson Home,I had training. Special training. The kind they're not allowed to give anymore.
126385,487,102,481000,Wayne,Simpson Home,Sorry. I have to go.
126386,487,103,483000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh c'mon, stay for dessert!"
126388,487,105,493000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Hey Simpson, you wanna hear about the big change in my life?"
126389,487,106,495000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Sure. Why not.
126391,487,107,497000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,I started drinking orange juice with pulp! I asked the Reverend and he said it was okay. Then he hung right up on me. That man is cranky at three in the mornin'.
126393,487,109,509000,Kent Brockman,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"And here he is, this week's Noble Nobody!"
126394,487,110,512000,Wayne,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,What the f--

126404,487,120,549000,Narrator,Moe's Tavern,And they drove home.

126410,487,126,573000,Wayne,CIA OFFICE,"Just doing my job, sir."
126411,487,127,574000,Cia Official,CIA OFFICE,All too well. I'm afraid that protocol demands that I totally erase your memory.
126413,487,129,590000,Wayne,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Die, you fascist bastard!"
126414,487,130,593000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"Mother, is that you?"

126421,487,137,614000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Of course. I mean, how long could it be?"
126422,487,138,617000,Wayne,PLANT,I don't know. I've got no job... no references... can't afford my apartment.
126390,487,139,621000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,It's best to concentrate on what you do have.
126423,487,140,624000,Wayne,PLANT,I have recurring flashbacks to a nightmarish past.
126424,487,141,627000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"That's funny, because I have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future."

126428,487,145,640000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,Or maybe it was him.
126429,487,146,643000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Man, this robot really gets me."
126430,487,147,648000,Wayne,PLANT,My nightmares are real.
126431,487,148,650000,Homer Simpson,PLANT,"Your voice is so gravelly, just like Lauren Bacall's."

126435,487,152,664000,Wayne,Simpson Home,Don't you get it -- he used the governor's eyeball for the retinal scan!... That's ten members of the electoral college dead in one day!
126437,487,154,672000,Wayne,Flanders Home,"If you don't give me those launch codes, you'll never be able to make the ""o.k."" sign again!"

126445,487,162,691000,Wayne,Simpson Home,"I'm sorry I have so many nightmares. I've done unspeakable things, from Buenos Aires to the Ukraine."
126446,487,163,697000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, what brought you to Springfield? Was it our Frito Lay distribution center?"
126447,487,164,702000,Wayne,Simpson Home,"I needed somewhere to lie low, and your town appears on no maps or charts."
126448,487,165,705000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Neh, they couldn't find a Google map photo without me naked or urinating."
126449,487,166,709000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"And when there was a map-maker's convention here, they all got Lou Gehrig's disease."
126450,487,167,713000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Not the one you're thinking of, there's another one."
126452,487,169,717000,Wayne,Simpson Living Room,"So Lisa, if you press on Bart's elbow here...he'll tell you anything you want to know."
126454,487,170,722000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I admit it! I let Milhouse lie down in your bed!
126455,487,171,725000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Kids, can I talk to Wayne alone a minute?"
126456,487,172,727000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Remember everything they say and tell us later in rattle code.
126457,487,173,730000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"What do you mean ""no?"""
126458,487,174,733000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,I don't know if you should teach our children advanced interrogation techniques.
126459,487,175,738000,Wayne,Simpson Living Room,"I'm sorry, Marge. Sometimes I forget where I am."
126460,487,176,741000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Living Room,Apology accepted. Now could you teach me a couple little driving tricks?
126462,487,178,755000,Marge Simpson,Springfield Mall,We'll see who gets their pick of pizza pockets!

126492,487,209,901000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Except me!
126493,487,210,904000,Viktor,Simpson Home,"I see you are tight like borscht and beets. Tell me, if we kidnapped a friend of Wayne's, would he attempt to rescue that friend?"
126494,487,211,914000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Well, I suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured..."
126495,487,212,918000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Hey! Wha?! Wha?! Wha?!
