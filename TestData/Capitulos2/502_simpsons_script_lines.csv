130274,502,105,491000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,He's a baby with wings!
130275,502,106,493000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Marge, it's not the diaper, it's what's inside."
130276,502,107,504000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,BUM-BA-BUM-BA / BUM-BA-BUM-BA...
130277,502,108,504000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,That's just not doing it for me.

130283,502,114,526000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Streets Of Springfield,"Oh yes, yes, I'm fine, my dear. I was just trying to get past the New York Times pay-wall and then kaboy! And what brings you out in the middle of the night?"
130284,502,115,535000,Marge Simpson,Streets Of Springfield,It's kind of embarrassing...
130285,502,116,537000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Streets Of Springfield,"Yes, I heard about your husband's bedwetting problem."
130286,502,117,540000,Marge Simpson,Streets Of Springfield,How do you know about it?

130289,502,120,546000,Professor Jonathan Frink,Streets Of Springfield,"Well, perhaps I can help -- you see, I have invented a device that allows you to enter someone else's dreams, and explore their subconscious."
130290,502,121,554000,Marge Simpson,Streets Of Springfield,...so we can go inside Homer's sleeping mind and find out why he's wetting the bed.
