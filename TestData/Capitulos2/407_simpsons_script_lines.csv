105664,407,68,394000,Alan Moore,COOLSVILLE,Oh really. So you like that I made your favorite superhero a heroin-addicted jazz critic who's not radioactive?
105665,407,69,402000,Bart Simpson,COOLSVILLE,I don't read the words. I just like when he punches people. How do you make his costume stick so close to his muscles?
105666,407,70,409000,Milhouse Van Houten,COOLSVILLE,"Mr. Moore, will you sign my DVD of ""Watchmen Babies?"""

105743,407,146,788000,Husband #1,RESORT,Mmm-hmm. Here's how it starts: she gets a total makeover and she starts wearing fancy new clothes.
105744,407,147,794000,Husband #2,RESORT,Then she stops wanting to tell you about her day.
105746,407,149,797000,Husband #1,RESORT,Here's how you know she's really about to go: your wife seems happy and full of life.

105794,407,195,984000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother."
105795,407,196,991000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,You had your hot dog plumped?
105796,407,197,992000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"No, I had my stomach stapled!"
105797,407,198,1015000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,All food tastes like barf now.
105798,407,199,1019000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Homie, I'm back!"

105807,407,208,1049000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Whoa, whoa, whoa -- slow down, sexy beast. Why don't you take some time to savor the front?"
105808,407,209,1055000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,What are you hiding from me? Is it chocolate?
105809,407,210,1058000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Uh, it used to be."
105810,407,211,1059000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Whoa! Those buns are poppin' fresh!
105811,407,212,1063000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Yeah, I'm gonna turn off the lights now."
105812,407,213,1066000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,And I'll just fold this old sweaty blanket and put it in the closet.
105813,407,214,1071000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
105815,407,216,1074000,Homer Simpson,Plastic Surgeon's Office,"Doctor, I'm embarrassed to show my body to my wife. And it's all because of your surgery!"
105816,407,217,1080000,Plastic Surgeon,Plastic Surgeon's Office,You want me to unstaple your stomach?
105817,407,218,1083000,Homer Simpson,Plastic Surgeon's Office,"No, I want you to give me every other surgery you have so I can look good! And can you call it an aortic valve replacement so my insurance will cover it?"
105818,407,219,1091000,Plastic Surgeon,Plastic Surgeon's Office,No problem.
105820,407,221,1092000,Plastic Surgeon,SURGERY ROOM,"Okay, count backwards from ten."
105728,407,222,1096000,Homer Simpson,SURGERY ROOM,"Fine, I admit it. I'm drunk!"
105822,407,224,1103000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Shapes,"And so, to honor her success, I bestow upon Marge Simpson this hundred dollar gift card to Sweatpants Etcetera."
105823,407,225,1112000,Homer Simpson,Shapes,Did someone order a super stud?
105824,407,226,1116000,Homer Simpson,Shapes,My implants feel itchy.
105825,407,227,1119000,Plastic Surgeon,Shapes,"Yes, I was out of silicone rubber so I used rolled-up socks."
105827,407,229,1125000,Mayor Joe Quimby,Shapes,"He's a monster! Pitchforks, everyone."
105828,407,230,1128000,Crowd,Shapes,Monster! Monster! Monster! Monster!

105834,407,236,1148000,Marge Simpson,Cathedral,"Listen, Homer, I gotta be honest with you..."
105835,407,237,1151000,Homer Simpson,Cathedral,You better not make me cry. 'Cause I don't know where my tear ducts are anymore.
105836,407,238,1155000,Marge Simpson,Cathedral,I appreciate you trying to become more attractive for me. But the truth is... I'm way too successful for you now. I'm gettin' me a trophy husband!

105839,407,241,1173000,Marge Simpson,Cathedral,Okay.

105843,407,245,1185000,Marge Simpson,Cathedral,The doctor called me about all the crazy surgeries you wanted. And I said no. But I did have him unstaple your stomach and turn you back into the sweet man I love.
105844,407,246,1195000,Homer Simpson,Cathedral,Then it was all a dream. I never became a hideous monster.
105845,407,247,1199000,Bart Simpson,Cathedral,The only person who thinks you're a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath.
105847,407,249,1205000,Lisa Simpson,Nurse's Station,"And Dad, I hope you learned something from this."
105848,407,250,1207000,Homer Simpson,Nurse's Station,"I sure have. Plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good. When it is, everyone should get it."
105849,407,251,1216000,Bart Simpson,Nurse's Station,Amen.
105851,407,253,1219000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,"Listen Marge... I've been wondering all these years, what is it about me that you find so irresistible? Let's face it... you could do better."
105853,407,254,1229000,Marge Simpson,Springfield,"Well, maybe I could. But every time I look at you, I see the same adorable boy I fell in love with."
105854,407,255,1236000,Homer Simpson,Springfield,Aw...
105855,407,256,1238000,Dan Clowes,Springfield,"Well, there's nothing like a happy ending."
105856,407,257,1241000,Alan Moore,Springfield,Holy heavens! Is that a meteor heading for the earth?
105857,407,258,1246000,Art Spiegelman,Springfield,Maybe. But tonight there's a benefit for underpaid comic book artists of the forties and fifties.
105858,407,259,1251000,Alan Moore,Springfield,To the cash bar!
