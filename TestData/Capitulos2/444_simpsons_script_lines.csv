114939,444,2,126000,Luann Van Houten,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oh Marge, how did you ever come up with an idea like ""crazy bowling?"""
114940,444,3,131000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,"I googled ""girls having fun,"" and after wading through ninety-seven thousand pages of porn, I found ""crazy bowling."""
114941,444,4,131000,Marge Simpson,Barney's Bowlarama,That's odd. There isn't a single man in this whole bowling alley.
114943,444,6,152000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Barney's Bowlarama,It's pretty sad when I can't pick up a guy on Super-Nacho Tuesday. Where'd they all go?
114944,444,7,157000,Bernice Hibbert,Barney's Bowlarama,"Oh, you know men... probably at a baseball game or a bar."
114948,444,10,163000,Gulliver Dark,Moe's Tavern,THEY DID THE MONSTER MA-- / THEY DID THE MONSTER MA-- / THEY DID THE MONSTER MA--
114952,444,14,192000,Groundskeeper Willie,Arena,"Come on, ya pansies! I've seen fiercer fights in Parliament!"
114953,444,15,196000,Sideshow Mel,Arena,"Yes, what is this, ""Prime Minister's Question Time?"""
114954,444,16,201000,Moe Szyslak,Arena,Yeah -- is it that?

114958,444,20,226000,Bart Simpson,Arena,"Thanks for bringing me here, Dad. I'll remember this day on my deathbed."
114959,444,21,231000,Homer Simpson,Arena,"Not everyone has a deathbed, son -- you could die suddenly."
114960,444,22,234000,Bart Simpson,Arena,Whoa. Maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang.
114961,444,23,237000,Homer Simpson,Arena,Maybe.
114962,444,24,241000,Lenny Leonard,Arena,Three hours of half-naked guys fightin' like animals.
114963,444,25,245000,Carl Carlson,Arena,Just like the ancient Romans.
114964,444,26,247000,Lenny Leonard,Arena,"Yeah, except their empire was falling apart."
114965,444,27,250000,Carl Carlson,Arena,Stupid Romans.
114966,444,28,253000,Homer Simpson,Arena,Ask him.
114967,444,29,254000,Bart Simpson,Arena,"Sir, could you sign my program with a swear word?"
114968,444,30,258000,Homer Simpson,Arena,"Ah yes, filthy, but obscure. With a subtle scatological undertone."
114969,444,31,263000,Autograph-signing Fighter,Arena,"Sure, no problem. Twenty-five dollars, please."
114970,444,32,265000,Homer Simpson,Arena,"Pay the man, boy."
114971,444,33,268000,Homer Simpson,Arena,"Now listen, son, I know we saw some awesome beat-downs tonight, but remember: don't try this at home. Do it at the schoolyard. Someplace where, if you get hurt, we can sue, not just them, but the school, the county, the state, and that jackass Joe Biden."
114973,444,35,286000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Python neck clinch and...
114974,444,36,286000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Out.
114975,444,37,289000,Milhouse Van Houten,Springfield Elementary School,Maybe I was promoted to green belt too early...
114976,444,38,292000,Nelson Muntz,Springfield Elementary School,Next victim!

114982,444,43,307000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,I dunno -- chasing ducks? Buried alive? He'll be missed. Let's move. I've gotta collect pine cones.
114983,444,44,312000,Kids,Springfield Elementary School,Die! Die! Die!
114984,444,45,314000,Lisa Simpson,Springfield Elementary School,"Just follow the ""dies,"" Mom."

114988,444,49,325000,Marge Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Bart Simpson! I'm glad your father isn't here to see this!

114993,444,54,341000,Marge Simpson,PLAYGROUND,God didn't give you legs so you could use them as scissors!
114994,444,55,344000,Bart Simpson,PLAYGROUND,I was just doing the moves I learned from Ultimate Punching!
114995,444,56,347000,Marge Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"Ultimate Punching?! ""Ultimate"" makes everything worse!"
114996,444,57,352000,Otto Mann,PLAYGROUND,Not Frisbee!
114997,444,58,353000,Marge Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"Otto, don't you have a sack to hacky?"
114998,444,59,355000,Otto Mann,PLAYGROUND,Indeed I do.
114999,444,60,356000,Otto Mann,PLAYGROUND,"One... Aw, I messed up. One... Aw, I messed up. One... Aw, I messed up."
115000,444,61,363000,Marge Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"Okay, I'm going to put a stop to this ""Ultimate Punching."""
115001,444,62,367000,Nelson Muntz,PLAYGROUND,"You can't stop an entire sport! You'd need several other mothers, some sympathetic school officials and clergymen..."
115002,444,63,373000,Marge Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Uh-huh...
115003,444,64,373000,Nelson Muntz,PLAYGROUND,A place to meet...
115004,444,65,374000,Marge Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Uh-huh...
115005,444,66,374000,Nelson Muntz,PLAYGROUND,Some snacks...
115006,444,67,376000,Marge Simpson,PLAYGROUND,What else?
115007,444,68,376000,Nelson Muntz,PLAYGROUND,"A phone tree is invaluable. How you fixed for staplers? Those fliers don't stick to phone poles by themselves, you know."
115008,444,69,383000,Marge Simpson,PLAYGROUND,"Nelson, you really have a knack for this."
115009,444,70,386000,Nelson Muntz,PLAYGROUND,"Well, when I grow up, I hope to go into event planning."
115010,444,71,390000,Marge Simpson,PLAYGROUND,Maybe someday you can do Lisa's wedding!
115011,444,72,392000,Nelson Muntz,PLAYGROUND,"Oh, I'd like that."
115014,444,75,398000,Bernice Hibbert,Simpson Home,Omigod!
115015,444,76,398000,Luann Van Houten,Simpson Home,It's so violent!
115016,444,77,406000,Sarah Wiggum,Simpson Home,On his nose!
114947,444,78,406000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oh, he hit him!"
115017,444,79,410000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This goes on for a while...
115018,444,80,414000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Call me a killjoy, but I think that because this is not to my taste, no one else should be able to enjoy it."
115019,444,81,420000,Bernice Hibbert,Simpson Home,I'm all over that.
115020,444,82,422000,Luann Van Houten,Simpson Home,"Oh, yes."
115022,444,84,422000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Mom, don't do this! This sport is as fun for me as having kids is for you!"
115023,444,85,427000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Tell her, Dad! You love Ultimate Punching even more than I do!"
115024,444,86,431000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Ultimate Punching is exploitative, violent and a bad influence on our young people. Studies have shown your mother is right."
115025,444,87,437000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,What the?
115026,444,88,440000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Chocolate, whipped cream... cherries! She got to you! With a piece of black forest cake!"
115027,444,89,445000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,It wasn't just a piece -- it was the whole cake! Frosting... like snow... on the eaves of a Bavarian castle!
115028,444,90,458000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Glad you didn't come cheap.
115029,444,91,459000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,I couldn't help it! She knew my one weakness -- that I'm weak!
115031,444,93,467000,Women,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,"One, two / We say boo! / Three, four / Stop the gore!"
115032,444,94,471000,Homer Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,"Five, six / Who's got tix?"
115033,444,95,473000,Scalper,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,"Seven, eight / Use that gate!"
115034,444,96,477000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,"We need to take this into the belly of the beast. Mr. Scalper, give me a ticket."
115035,444,97,482000,Scalper,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,"I am not a scalper, I am a dude whose two hundred friends did not show up."
115036,444,98,488000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,What do we do now?
115037,444,99,490000,Helen Lovejoy,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,Let's talk about Marge behind her back.
115038,444,100,491000,Bernice Hibbert,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,Have you ever noticed how that baby of hers never says a thing?
115039,444,101,495000,Luann Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,I think it saw something awful.
115040,444,102,496000,Helen Lovejoy,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,Me too.
115041,444,103,496000,Edna Krabappel-Flanders,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,That's exactly what it is.
115042,444,104,498000,Luann Van Houten,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,Oh what else could it be?
115043,444,105,498000,Bernice Hibbert,SPRINGFIELD ARENA,Um-um-um.
115045,444,107,509000,Chett,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,Hm. That woman has natural breasts. This can't be good.
115046,444,108,518000,Marge Simpson,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,I'm Marge Simpson and I will not rest until you tear down this septagon!
115048,444,110,527000,Blue-Haired Lawyer,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,Crazy dame! Nobody tears down the septagon! Except for the arena crew because Hufflesnuffs on Ice needs the space tomorrow.
115049,444,111,534000,Chett,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,"Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. I have a better idea."
115050,444,112,539000,Chett,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,"Marge, I'm Chett Englebrecht. U.P.K.C.C. founder, commissioner and public face of the sport."
115053,444,115,549000,Marge Simpson,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,"Pleased to meet you, Chett."
115055,444,117,553000,Marge Simpson,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,"Guys, please. When you yell like that, no one can hear me."
115057,444,119,558000,Marge Simpson,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,"Chett, I'm here to ask you one simple thing: please go out of business and donate all your profits to charity."
115059,444,121,567000,Marge Simpson,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,"At least in other sports they're trying to put a ball in a net or a zone. But in this sport they don't put anything in anything. And if they did, I wouldn't want to see it!"
115060,444,122,577000,Chett,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,"Okay, you win."
115062,444,124,579000,Chett,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,"Annoying lady, you make a great point. I am going to shut down this sport..."
115063,444,125,584000,Marge Simpson,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,Really?
115064,444,126,584000,Chett,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,"...if you meet me in the septagon, fight me and beat me!"
115065,444,127,589000,Marge Simpson,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,What? That's crazy.
115066,444,128,592000,Chett,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,"What's wrong, Marge? Do you have to ask your husband?"
115068,444,130,597000,Donkey,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
115069,444,131,601000,Marge Simpson,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,That flattens my soda pop! You're on!
115071,444,133,605000,Homer Simpson,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,What'd I miss?
115072,444,134,607000,Bart Simpson,PROMOTER'S SKYBOX,Nothin'.
115074,444,136,612000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,"Mom, you can't fight that guy."
115075,444,137,614000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Yeah, Marge. He'll knock your block off. Your beautiful block."
115076,444,138,619000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"Thank you, Homie."
115077,444,139,620000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Listen: of all the crazy things I've ever done, this is the craziest. And you're doing it."
115078,444,140,626000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Car,"I can't back out. This is for a cause that's bigger than I am. If Gandhi could go without eating for a whole three-hour movie, I can do this. Besides, I'm a woman. He'll probably go easy on me."
115080,444,141,638000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Car,Or kick the crap out of you.
115081,444,142,639000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Car,"Watch your language, moron."
115084,444,145,656000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"If I'm gonna open a can of whup-tushy, I'd better get in shape, with some rhythmic gymnastics!"
115086,444,147,671000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Someone's gotta stop her from going through with this fight. This goes against every feminist bone in my body, but Dad, can't you control your woman?"
115087,444,148,680000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,How can I control her?! I have nothing to withhold!
115088,444,149,683000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh man, now she's writing cutesy things with the ribbon."
115090,444,151,695000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Homer, this is bad. One unlucky punch and Marge could be bedridden for life."
115091,444,152,699000,Lenny Leonard,Moe's Tavern,Unable to move anything but her left toe.
115092,444,153,702000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,Yeah.
115093,444,154,705000,Thought Bubble Homer,Moe's Tavern,"Oh Marge, if only I knew what these paintings meant."
115094,444,155,712000,Thought Bubble Homer,Moe's Tavern,"I know the woman I loved is still in there somewhere, behind all this nonsense."
115095,444,156,718000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"We've gotta get Marge some professional training. Carl, do you know heavyweight champ Drederick Tatum?"
115096,444,157,723000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,What? You think just 'cause I'm black I know all other black people?
115097,444,158,726000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,"Well, I... uh..."
115098,444,159,728000,Carl Carlson,Moe's Tavern,"Actually, Drederick and I are very good friends. We met through Dr. Hibbert at a party at Bleeding Gums Murphy's house."
115100,444,161,734000,Drederick Tatum,Mansion,"Oh Marge, you have definitely come to the right crib. I'm always happy to impart my pugilistic prowess to a punching parvenu."
115101,444,162,741000,Drederick Tatum,Mansion,And the first lesson will be to work the tattoos. Flaming skull. Obama. Scooby Doo. Scooby Doo. Scooby Doo!
115102,444,163,749000,Drederick Tatum,Mansion,"Now, work ""The Lord's Prayer"". I'm gonna order some lion food."
115103,444,164,752000,Drederick Tatum,Mansion,"Hello, yeah, how you doin', I'd like to order two gazelles, an impala, and throw in a couple wildebeests. Oh, and a two-liter bottle of diet cherry cola. You just have one-liter bottles? Okay, cancel the whole order."
115107,444,166,765000,Akira,MARTIAL ARTS ACADEMY,"The second element of mixed martial arts is jiu-jitsu, in which we use an opponent's strength against himself. But I sneak some of my strength in there too. A-ha-HA! Now attack me with great anger!"
115109,444,168,780000,Akira,MARTIAL ARTS ACADEMY,Surprising move!
115110,444,169,783000,Akira,MARTIAL ARTS ACADEMY,"Next: Homer, hajime!"
115112,444,171,788000,Akira,MARTIAL ARTS ACADEMY,"Now we stick foot in mouth, tie arms like pretzel and pop discs in spine like bubble wrap."
115113,444,172,798000,Marge Simpson,MARTIAL ARTS ACADEMY,Is he okay?
115114,444,173,799000,Akira,MARTIAL ARTS ACADEMY,He feels no pain.
115116,444,175,802000,Akira,MARTIAL ARTS ACADEMY,"Sorry, my English is not so good. I mean ""he feels only pain."""
115119,444,178,809000,C. Montgomery Burns,YALE CLUB,"Back when I wrestled at Yale, I was in the lightest weight category -- ""ether weight."" Now, get ready to face the wrath of the ""New Haven Nuisance""!"
115120,444,179,829000,C. Montgomery Burns,YALE CLUB,"Side-mount! Takedown! Advantage! Reversal! Reversal! Clinch! Clinch, I say!"
115121,444,180,834000,Marge Simpson,YALE CLUB,Listen... I'm late for a P.T.A. meeting.
115123,444,182,838000,Seymour Skinner,Springfield Elementary School,"In order to save money, the following presidents will no longer be taught: Buchanan, Fillmore, Pierce, Bush, Bush... could you please stop that?"
115124,444,183,848000,C. Montgomery Burns,Springfield Elementary School,Saratoga slam! Aristotle's dilemma! Knickerbocker knucklebreaker! And so on.
115126,444,185,854000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Marge... I bet we've got ten minutes till the kids wake up.
115127,444,186,860000,Chett,Simpson Home,Marge! Marge! Marge!
115129,444,188,863000,Chett,Simpson Home,"Tomorrow night your bedroom will be the septagon. Your sleeping pill will be my punches. By the way, what's that book you're reading?"

115132,444,191,879000,Chett,Simpson Home,I said tomorrow!
115133,444,192,881000,Man Below,Simpson Home,No can do. We're out of fireworks!
115134,444,193,883000,Chett,Simpson Home,Why'd you shoot them off now?
115135,444,194,885000,Man Below,Simpson Home,I have trouble concentrating! I should be on antidepressants!
115136,444,195,889000,Chett,Simpson Home,Where was I?

115145,444,205,919000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY FIELD,Is there someone in there?
115146,444,206,921000,Martin Prince,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY FIELD,It's my fault. I looked them in the eye when I gave them my lunch money.
115147,444,207,925000,Marge Simpson,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY FIELD,Someone should tell your principal!
115148,444,208,927000,Seymour Skinner,SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY FIELD,I'm well aware of the situation.
115151,444,211,937000,Lisa Simpson,Arena,"Mom, I came here to tell you it's not too late to back out."
