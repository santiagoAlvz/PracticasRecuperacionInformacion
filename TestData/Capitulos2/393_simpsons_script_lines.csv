101948,393,11,71000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Wow, the graphics are amazing. That ball almost seems real!"
101949,393,12,76000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,This basement is a wonderful gift to the family. But how could you afford it?

101954,393,17,94000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,"Yes I do. Under chapter thirteen of the fiscal code, an individual whose debts exceed his assets may file for bankruptcy, thus protecting said assets."
101955,393,18,103000,Judge Harm,Courthouse,That was the old bankruptcy law.
101957,393,20,106000,Judge Harm,Courthouse,"Under the new law, you have to pay your creditors everything."
101958,393,21,110000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,"What the? But I thought bankruptcy was the cool law! The one that says ""Dude, don't worry about it. I got this."""
101959,393,22,113000,Judge Harm,Courthouse,"Mr. Simpson, I'm afraid this court must appoint a financial officer to supervise repayment of your debts."
101929,393,23,124000,Homer Simpson,Courthouse,Permission to moan?
101960,393,24,125000,Judge Harm,Courthouse,I'll allow it.
101963,393,27,131000,Accountant,Simpson Home,"Mr. Simpson, among the expenses the court deems frivolous: you throw over one thousand dollars a month into local wishing wells."
101964,393,28,138000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Of course, you idiot, 'cause I'm wishing for more money."
101965,393,29,143000,Accountant,Simpson Home,"Uh-huh. Well you're going to have to make some serious cutbacks to your expenses. Three subscriptions to ""Vanity Fair?"""

101967,393,31,151000,Accountant,Simpson Home,Five hundred dollars a month to Totalpoker.com?
101968,393,32,155000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Shut up! It's an instructional website! Shut up!
101969,393,33,159000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Give it here, I'll find some fat we can trim. Here you go, a giant useless expense for something that no one is interested in."

101988,393,52,237000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Oh, I wish! No, these are complimentary boxes from the shipping company."
101989,393,53,241000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Could a kid like me get these boxes? Then use 'em for whatever he wanted?
101990,393,54,244000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,"Only if he fibbed about his name, age, and occupation on this automated eight-hundred number."
101992,393,55,249000,Ned Flanders,Simpson Home,Why don't you put this box by your phone so you don't call the number by accident.
101993,393,56,249000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I won't."
101994,393,57,259000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Nothing like un-tossing a leftover salad. It'll be like new!

102001,393,64,287000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,Can we at least get out of the house for an evening?
102002,393,65,289000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"Sure, but I think you're exaggerating the problem."
102003,393,66,292000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,I'm scared. Can I sleep across ya?
102005,393,68,303000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,"What are you doing here, Patty-or-Selma?"
102006,393,69,306000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I invited Selma here to watch Grampa watch the kids.
102007,393,70,310000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"For some reason, she doesn't trust him. Maybe it's the bang-up job he did raising you."
102008,393,71,315000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,He was a great Dad! Every year he got so mad when Santa didn't bring me presents.
102009,393,72,324000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,Um... lemon candy?
102010,393,73,327000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,"No thanks, I brought my own."
102012,393,75,346000,Selma Bouvier,Simpson Home,I know what you're wondering: how come a single woman with so much to offer is alone on a Saturday night.
102013,393,76,353000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Home,"I assumed you were restin' up for bingo tomorrow, like me."

102030,393,92,434000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Well I never, ever want to see that again."
102031,393,93,437000,Grampa Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Ah, the hell with you. I just might ask that Selma girl out. And you can't tell me not to! My roof, my rules!"
102032,393,94,446000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Living Room,"Oh, why did I borrow that roof from him?"

102037,393,99,459000,Box Delivery Man,Simpson Home,"Uh-huh. Are you run by dogs or for dogs? Actually, don't answer. I like not knowing."
102038,393,100,466000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Now we just have to figure out what to do with these boxes.
102039,393,101,468000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"As always, I have some ideas."
102040,393,102,474000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Build a fart! I love it.
102041,393,103,477000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,"Fort. That's build a ""fort."""
102042,393,104,477000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,That might work too.

102047,393,109,498000,Grampa Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Ah phooey on buts! At my age and with your drawbacks, we can't afford to miss an opportunity. Why don't we just spend some time together and see where that takes us?"
102048,393,110,509000,Selma Bouvier,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Yeah, what the hell. Wanna split a basket of garlic bread?"
102049,393,111,514000,Grampa Simpson,The Gilded Truffle Restaurant,"Slow down, ya hussy!"
102021,393,113,542000,Marge Simpson,Beach,Look at Grampa and Selma frolicking in the water.
102052,393,114,546000,Homer Simpson,Beach,It's not right. It's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase that fell out of a plane.
102053,393,115,551000,Marge Simpson,Beach,"Be nice, Homer. Don't you see how great it is that they found each other? Like how the parts of a pig nobody wants combine to make a yummy hot dog."

102056,393,118,571000,Grampa Simpson,Beach,We wrote that joke in the water. It wasn't all frolicking.
102059,393,121,579000,Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern,How could my Dad go out with Selma? Don't those two gargoyles know that love is for good-looking young people?

102068,393,130,612000,Homer Simpson,Street,"Okay, but I'm not good at details. Or the big picture. I also show up late, and drunk."
102069,393,131,617000,Homer Simpson,Street,I've got a good feeling about this.
102071,393,133,621000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Lower the drawbridge!

102076,393,138,638000,Delivery Man,Simpson Home,"Those boxes are for shipping, not for creating a world of pure imagination. Give them back!"
102077,393,139,644000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Not till we're bored with them! Now begone!
102078,393,140,647000,Delivery Man,Simpson Home,I shall go. But I will return with an army of my brethren. And together we shall take back what is ours and Hell will rain down upon you!
102079,393,141,658000,Lisa Simpson,Simpson Home,What if we're not here?
102080,393,142,659000,Delivery Man,Simpson Home,"We will come two more times, and then you'll have to come to our customer center!"
102081,393,143,667000,Delivery Man,Simpson Home,It's near the airport where the old Crown Books used to be.

102124,393,187,836000,Grampa Simpson,HONEYMOON SUITE,Nonsense! When I left PAN AM they said they'd always have a job waiting for me.
102125,393,188,841000,Selma Bouvier,HONEYMOON SUITE,Abe... there's no more PAN AM.
102126,393,189,843000,Grampa Simpson,HONEYMOON SUITE,"Oh, I'm an old fool. I don't even have two kidneys to rub together."

102132,393,195,868000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,"We're having a great time. I cleaned up all my best war stories for her! I told her how we chased the ""Teddy bears"" into their cuddle-bunkers, then had to tickle them out with machine-hugs and fun-throwers. They say the more soldiers you tickle, the easier it gets. Well sir, it doesn't."
102134,393,197,899000,Bart Simpson,Simpson Home,Who knew guys in brown shirts could cause so much trouble.

102158,393,220,1063000,Selma Bouvier,DMV FRONT AREA,I shaved my legs to the knees for this?
102160,393,222,1070000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,Now to relax with a nice cup of tea.
102161,393,223,1075000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,Which one of you do-hickeys is the tea kettle?
102162,393,224,1087000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,"Ooh, a flapjack flipper!"
102163,393,225,1096000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,"I usually don't cook, but when you're in love you do crazy things! Now I'll just put in a movie to pass the time..."
102164,393,226,1106000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,Let's see... running time two hours...
102165,393,227,1114000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,"Ooh, the kettle's whistlin'!"
102166,393,228,1115000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,"Ah, just the way I like it: thick and noxious!"
102167,393,229,1121000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,Uh-oh. Better call the fire brigade!
102168,393,230,1125000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,"Wow, they're already here!"
102170,393,232,1130000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,So that's my projected new driver's test route.
102171,393,233,1134000,Male Dmv Suit,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Nice pres, Selma. But uh... Where's the three-point turn on this baby?"
102172,393,234,1138000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,Um... Bailey Street?
102173,393,235,1140000,Female Dmv Suit,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Bailey Street? The freshly paved Bailey Street? Oh yeah, let's wear that out."
102174,393,236,1148000,Selma Bouvier,Department of Motor Vehicles,I'm sorry. I-I've got a lot of stress at home.
102175,393,237,1151000,Grampa Simpson,Department of Motor Vehicles,I'm wet and scared and the house hates me!
102176,393,238,1156000,Male Dmv Suit,Department of Motor Vehicles,"Selma, we don't have time for this. This is the D.M.V. -- we're about getting things done!"

102178,393,240,1161000,Male Dmv Suit,Department of Motor Vehicles,"How will we ever replace her? Oh, I know."
102180,393,242,1167000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,Why is this so hard? I just wanted to marry my best gal.
102181,393,243,1173000,Selma Bouvier,Grampa and Selma's House,"I guess the Beatles were wrong -- love isn't all you need. Abe, I hate to admit it, but maybe this marriage isn't going to work."
102182,393,244,1181000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,"I guess you're right. Also, I didn't realize you liked the Beatles. That would have caused some problems down the line."
102183,393,245,1189000,Selma Bouvier,Grampa and Selma's House,I guess I'm gonna be alone forever.
102184,393,246,1192000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,Now don't be an idiot. A sweet young tomato like you will definitely find someone. Some young bruiser who can eat corn on the cob and not think twice about it.
102185,393,247,1203000,Selma Bouvier,Grampa and Selma's House,You really think so?
102186,393,248,1204000,Grampa Simpson,Grampa and Selma's House,Absolutely. Now how 'bout givin' an old man one last dance?
102188,393,250,1222000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,So... how long is Señor Homer out of town for?
102189,393,251,1227000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,"Oh, I don't know, he might come home any minute."
102190,393,252,1230000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Then I must flee!
102191,393,253,1233000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Where is he? Where is he? I smell his aftershave!
102192,393,254,1239000,Marge Simpson,Simpson Home,I don't think we're doing this right.
102193,393,255,1242000,Homer Simpson,Simpson Home,Where is he? I know he's in here.
